00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 previously we talked about that 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.069
 some companies or industries 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.830
 responsible for making games or toys 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.960
 which usually have ideas 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.690
 teachers for the creation of their 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.949
 products we know that you are in the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.380
 background are very gloomy stories such 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.070
 is the case of barbie history that already 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.820
 I told in a past video if you want to see it 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.769
 here I'll leave the video link 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.710
 this time I will talk about a very game 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.129
 popular that I can almost assure you that what 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.980
 have you played at least once like this is 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.309
 is the popular board game called 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.430
 monopoly of which there are many 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.559
 versions currently the first 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.420
 version of monopoly was raised by 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.820
 Charles Darrow in 1935 and it is true that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.120
 by then there was already a very 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.720
 peculiar to the same style but did not have 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.510
 the same success that got monopoly 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.750
 on which charles was based for the creation 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.000
 of monopoly is thought to throw him based 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.410
 in the tragic story of a very friend 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.860
 close to him called jon the story is 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.900
 the next john and charles had 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.960
 studied together at some stage of the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.180
 school and that's where their friendship came from 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.840
 the time and everyone took directions 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.580
 different john made his life he got a 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.540
 good employment in an institution of 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.100
 government which was very well paid 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.680
 after having a job and a home 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.920
 Stable John decided to get married and form 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.680
 a family until then the only 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.080
 defect in quotation marks of he was that 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.020
 had the habit of going to a kind 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.060
 places like casinos will 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.840
 they liked gambling very much 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.509
 bet and that sort of thing even you 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.640
 it went well on some occasions little to 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.250
 little that habit is beginning to be done 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.100
 almost daily and how his salary was 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.450
 very good was enough to bet and 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.620
 keep your family 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.330
 at the same time but as expected 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.090
 unconsciously he was neglecting 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.209
 his wife and children that already appears 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.760
 then he had jong's marriage 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.519
 fails and depression because of divorce 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.830
 it made him take refuge even more in the games 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.870
 of chance he practically lived for 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.069
 work and spend their money on 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.930
 bets 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.739
 he used to rely too much on his luck and 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.819
 say that the world would one day be the and 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:45.150
 that everyone would recognize him without knowing it 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.760
 he had a disorder called ludopathy the 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.640
 which basically consists in losing the 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.860
 control with betting games 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.950
 combining the disorder with divorce 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.610
 the result ended in the worst he lost to 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.549
 his family lost his house his cars in 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.299
 order all your belongings and the latest 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.489
 that he had left he lost his job in a 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.739
 Occasion Charles walking down the street 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.260
 he meets a beggar who 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.900
 asks for some money and time 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.769
 observe what he recognizes and note that it is his 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.110
 of the institute that is John dismayed him 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.079
 question what happened to him because he has 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.629
 come to that situation and conversing he 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.640
 He tells her what happened and says so 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:33.060
 like him there are many more who also 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.189
 they lose everything by ambition almost 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.549
 to finish his talk john says 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:42.200
 maybe I've lost everything but someday 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:45.359
 I will collect my rematch and the world will be my 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.450
 charles not all that terrifying ambition 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.639
 so outlandish of your friend but more 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.250
 that scared took advantage of the 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.200
 situation to think about creating 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.859
 a game that was at the hand of 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.409
 anyone either children 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:04.109
 teenagers adults and seniors he believed 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:07.439
 that each and every one of us has 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:10.019
 an ambition some more than others but 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.569
 this game would take out that piece 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.790
 ambitious of each one making us believe 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.370
 that we can have the world in our 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.220
 hands with the fact of winning a simple 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.900
 departure of monopoly after some 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.720
 failed attempts 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.270
 sell the board game to hasbro and from 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.699
 that then starts one of the most 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.370
 recognized games of chance and for many 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.039
 of strategy of history in many 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.110
 occasions an entertainment 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:40.590
 seemingly innocent can bring after 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.710
 of itself a history of suffering alone 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.120
 that obviously we do not know
