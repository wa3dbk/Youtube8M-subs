00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
basically the standard model of Batman

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.600 
basically the standard model of Batman
we<00:01:40.049> got<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> blue<00:01:40.619> outfit<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:42.530> silver

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
we got the blue outfit going on silver

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.120 
we got the blue outfit going on silver
kind<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.909> goldish<00:01:46.670> glitter<00:01:47.670> pieces<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.600> his

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
kind of goldish glitter pieces in his

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.950 
kind of goldish glitter pieces in his
bunny<00:01:50.130> suit<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:51.299> supposed<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> little

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
bunny suit it's supposed to be a little

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.260 
bunny suit it's supposed to be a little
bit<00:01:52.140> translucent<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.340> Batman<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.909> isn't

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
bit translucent but for Batman it isn't

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.830 
bit translucent but for Batman it isn't
so<00:01:54.600> translucent<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:56.299> think<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.420> looks<00:01:57.630> really

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
so translucent I think it looks really

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.359 
so translucent I think it looks really
cool<00:01:58.759> behind<00:01:59.759> him<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.450> reflective

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
cool behind him is like this reflective

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.880 
cool behind him is like this reflective
piece<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.579> really<00:02:02.820> makes<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.530> figure<00:02:04.530> stand

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
piece that really makes the figure stand

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.479 
piece that really makes the figure stand
