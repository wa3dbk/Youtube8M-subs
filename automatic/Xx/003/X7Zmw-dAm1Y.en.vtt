00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.740
 I want to emphasize that there is to hide his dietician loops 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.079
 state graduate 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:14.349
 and I work for as many points as on 100 m the montignac method 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.820
 on the internet as an aesthetic coach for about a year now 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.239
 and I also have an activity of dieticians 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.239
 in this paris office since january 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.039
 because the players can never that rather hold us than a diet 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.439
 low calorie lexicon because the montignac method presents many 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.100
 benefits that other plans do not offer 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.910
 first of all she has no restrictions on events 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.300
 festive such as foie gras red wine champagne 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.670
 and chocolate 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.410
 then we have a sense of satiety that is reached very quickly and 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.120
 durably 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.710
 we then have a weight loss that is done it will wait and in fact there is 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.440
 it was 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.580
 and stability 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.010
 all that methadone hers 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.010
 we only illuminate beneficial effects secondary to the level of health 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.619
 for example, we often notice that fatigue decreases enormously 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.070
 he is no longer quiet here these coupons not 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.750
 we also have a decrease and prevention of diabetes diseases from 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.470
 type 2 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.250
 and to add also a prevention of cardiovascular disease with a 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.250
 cholesterol lowering of triglycerides and hypertension 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.600
 the participants may be that his lover dt of his graduates and I 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.250
 thinks that the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.490
 most of the participants in this breakdown I'm here he said 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.280
 metal creator 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.869
 on the other hand the fact of the letters in the file michel montignac brings me to my 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.869
 opinion an additional credibility compared to eating 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.690
 95% of those who come to see me in consultation already know the 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.450
 montignac method be among us 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.149
 in this context they have already followed 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:53.190
 dr 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.390
 he resumed his course at age 30 because their parents laurent fignon 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.070
 ever come here so I ask them how they know and 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.520
 know that if it's me the var 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.580
 then I lose the stock market 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.299
 the skill the stirrup to see and all the detail she deems 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.790
 this represents one of the questions 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.249
 we fly over goes on their way of life 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.249
 besides, for its spontaneity and taste, disgust 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:21.209
 I made to know if that's not all 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.609
 that could be to have a winter party with 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.369
 with overweight increases 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:29.309
 it's not just people who are overweight 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:33.819
 and then I explained to them in Europe waiting the montignac method 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.959
 and the nation with different 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.499
 do I think it's very important not to give a real 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.379
 passion like iron telling them to eat if it happens it's like that 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.379
 agen 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:50.479
 and so I explain to them this notion 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.639
 london and then I teach them to compose their own programs
