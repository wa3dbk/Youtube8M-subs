00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
doesn't do what it claims to do the only

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.449 
doesn't do what it claims to do the only
reason<00:03:03.049> I<00:03:03.260> picked<00:03:03.680> up<00:03:03.739> this<00:03:03.890> product<00:03:04.310> is

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
reason I picked up this product is

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.970 
reason I picked up this product is
because<00:03:04.670> we<00:03:05.599> had<00:03:05.750> some<00:03:05.959> hard<00:03:06.140> water<00:03:06.470> spots<00:03:06.680> to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
because we had some hard water spots to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.089 
because we had some hard water spots to
remove<00:03:07.220> on<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:07.489> Dodge<00:03:07.670> Ram<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.920> should<00:03:09.920> be

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
remove on this Dodge Ram and should be

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.890 
remove on this Dodge Ram and should be
blunt<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.640> didn't<00:03:11.000> remove<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.330> water<00:03:11.599> spots

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
blunt it didn't remove the water spots

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.020 
blunt it didn't remove the water spots
it<00:03:12.080> did<00:03:12.319> not<00:03:12.470> perform<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:13.370> didn't<00:03:13.640> get<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.819> job

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
it did not perform it didn't get the job

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.880 
it did not perform it didn't get the job
done<00:03:14.269> sure<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.930> results<00:03:15.290> were<00:03:15.380> a<00:03:15.440> little<00:03:15.680> bit

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
done sure the results were a little bit

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.380 
done sure the results were a little bit
better<00:03:16.040> by<00:03:16.280> machine<00:03:16.670> but<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.120> mean<00:03:17.269> that's

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
better by machine but I mean that's

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.729 
better by machine but I mean that's
expected<00:03:17.750> there's<00:03:18.019> a<00:03:18.049> lot<00:03:18.170> more<00:03:18.290> power<00:03:18.560> behind

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
expected there's a lot more power behind

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.430 
expected there's a lot more power behind
the<00:03:18.920> machine<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.400> higher<00:03:19.609> rpms<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:20.989> then

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
the machine and higher rpms and then

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.530 
the machine and higher rpms and then
polishing<00:03:21.950> my<00:03:22.040> hand<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:22.579> did<00:03:22.760> minor<00:03:23.030> results

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
polishing my hand you did minor results

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.410 
polishing my hand you did minor results
at<00:03:23.690> best<00:03:24.019> but<00:03:24.709> there's<00:03:25.190> still<00:03:25.489> an<00:03:25.850> very

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
at best but there's still an very

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.259 
at best but there's still an very
obvious<00:03:27.109> hard<00:03:28.040> water<00:03:28.280> spots<00:03:28.459> all<00:03:28.850> over<00:03:28.880> the

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
obvious hard water spots all over the

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.020 
obvious hard water spots all over the
