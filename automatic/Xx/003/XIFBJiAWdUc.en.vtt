but we want to be able to cancel our
subscription<00:00:10.620> now<00:00:10.800> as<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.610> mentioned<00:00:11.969> at<00:00:12.090> the

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
subscription now as I mentioned at the

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.360 
subscription now as I mentioned at the
start<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.870> series<00:00:13.349> when<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.679> cancel<00:00:14.280> a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
start of the series when you cancel a

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.990 
start of the series when you cancel a
subscription<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:15.480> stripe<00:00:16.049> active<00:00:16.800> field<00:00:17.789> in

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
subscription the stripe active field in

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.939 
subscription the stripe active field in
your<00:00:18.119> database<00:00:18.600> won't<00:00:18.900> be<00:00:19.199> set<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.650> zero

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
your database won't be set to zero

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.429 
your database won't be set to zero
that's<00:00:20.670> because<00:00:21.119> you've<00:00:21.420> paid<00:00:21.840> for<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.199> month

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
that's because you've paid for a month

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.359 
that's because you've paid for a month
upfront<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.939> what<00:00:24.119> will<00:00:24.240> happen<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
upfront so what will happen is the

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.970 
upfront so what will happen is the
unsubscribe<00:00:26.510> process<00:00:27.510> will<00:00:28.170> basically<00:00:28.439> mean

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
unsubscribe process will basically mean

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.640 
unsubscribe process will basically mean
that<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.460> still<00:00:30.060> remain<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.960> Premium<00:00:31.619> Member

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
or subscribe to member but only up until

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.170 
or subscribe to member but only up until
the<00:00:35.940> date<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.809> month<00:00:37.770> from<00:00:38.219> now<00:00:38.280> basically<00:00:38.760> off

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the date a month from now basically off

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.630 
the date a month from now basically off
a<00:00:39.210> month<00:00:39.629> from<00:00:39.809> when<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.260> first<00:00:40.640> subscribed

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
a month from when you first subscribed

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.450 
a month from when you first subscribed

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
so let's take a look at a couple more

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.299 
so let's take a look at a couple more
pieces<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:45.379> cashier<00:00:46.379> functionality<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.219> we

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
pieces of cashier functionality that we

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.740 
pieces of cashier functionality that we
can<00:00:47.460> use<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.789> check<00:00:48.059> if<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> user<00:00:48.510> has

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
can use to check if the user has

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.200 
can use to check if the user has
canceled<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.980> I'm<00:00:50.309> gonna<00:00:50.489> create<00:00:50.730> an<00:00:50.910> if

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
canceled so I'm gonna create an if

will be get to cancel so we want to make

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.020 
will be get to cancel so we want to make
sure<00:02:32.069> this<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.250> really<00:02:33.430> important<00:02:33.940> that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
sure this is really important that

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.030 
sure this is really important that
before<00:02:34.750> we<00:02:34.930> do<00:02:35.079> anything<00:02:35.290> here<00:02:35.680> we<00:02:35.799> want

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
before we do anything here we want

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.330 
before we do anything here we want
cross-site<00:02:36.489> request<00:02:36.549> forgery<00:02:36.940> protection

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
cross-site request forgery protection

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.280 
cross-site request forgery protection
and<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.430> reason<00:02:39.790> for<00:02:39.909> that<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.180> anyone<00:02:40.780> could

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
and the reason for that is anyone could

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.080 
and the reason for that is anyone could
either<00:02:41.650> give<00:02:42.069> someone<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.549> link<00:02:42.760> or<00:02:43.030> embed

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
either give someone the link or embed

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.869 
either give someone the link or embed
the<00:02:43.540> link<00:02:43.569> in<00:02:43.870> an<00:02:43.989> image<00:02:44.290> resource<00:02:44.769> this<00:02:45.549> would

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
the link in an image resource this would

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.569 
the link in an image resource this would
count<00:02:46.209> all<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.599> users<00:02:46.989> account<00:02:47.349> you<00:02:48.069> can<00:02:48.340> set

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
count all the users account you can set

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.479 
count all the users account you can set
up<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.790> form<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.540> use<00:02:49.810> post<00:02:50.170> here<00:02:50.530> all<00:02:51.250> I'm

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
up a form and use post here all I'm

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.490 
up a form and use post here all I'm
going<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.849> do<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.329> on<00:02:52.569> this<00:02:52.930> link<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.470> I

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
going to do is on this link that I

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.949 
going to do is on this link that I
generate<00:02:54.010> here<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.700> we<00:02:54.849> know<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.450> route<00:02:55.690> now

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
generate here and we know the route now

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.479 
generate here and we know the route now
so<00:02:56.200> we<00:02:56.290> can<00:02:56.440> say<00:02:56.620> URL<00:02:57.810> action<00:02:59.489> subscription

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
so we can say URL action subscription

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.490 
so we can say URL action subscription
cancel<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.329> think<00:03:01.720> that's<00:03:01.870> what<00:03:02.019> we<00:03:02.140> called<00:03:02.379> it

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
cancel I think that's what we called it

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.729 
cancel I think that's what we called it
yeah<00:03:03.250> what<00:03:04.209> we<00:03:04.299> can<00:03:04.450> do<00:03:04.659> is<00:03:04.870> on<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.260> end<00:03:05.500> of

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
yeah what we can do is on the end of

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.550 
yeah what we can do is on the end of
here<00:03:05.980> we<00:03:06.250> can<00:03:06.430> say<00:03:06.640> token<00:03:07.299> equals<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:08.319> then<00:03:08.470> we

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
here we can say token equals and then we

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.759 
here we can say token equals and then we
can<00:03:08.709> generate<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.099> token<00:03:09.579> here<00:03:10.769> cross-site

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
can generate a token here cross-site

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.500 
can generate a token here cross-site
request<00:03:11.829> forgery<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:14.200> can<00:03:14.409> help<00:03:14.560> her<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.790> now

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
request forgery so can help her so now

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.289 
request forgery so can help her so now
when<00:03:16.810> I<00:03:16.840> hit<00:03:17.019> enter<00:03:17.200> on<00:03:17.500> here<00:03:17.940> we've<00:03:18.940> got<00:03:19.150> the

cancel my subscription link which if we

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.979 
cancel my subscription link which if we
inspect<00:03:22.510> we<00:03:23.169> have<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.919> token<00:03:24.430> on<00:03:24.849> here<00:03:25.239> so<00:03:25.900> if

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
inspect we have the token on here so if

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.259 
inspect we have the token on here so if
this<00:03:26.109> token<00:03:26.500> isn't<00:03:26.859> modified<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.669> won't<00:03:28.030> let

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
this token isn't modified it won't let

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.360 
this token isn't modified it won't let
us<00:03:28.419> go<00:03:28.599> through<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:29.019> this<00:03:29.169> link<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:29.829> it's

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
us go through to this link so it's

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.530 
us go through to this link so it's
important<00:03:30.819> that<00:03:30.879> we<00:03:31.030> do<00:03:31.209> have<00:03:31.419> that

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
important that we do have that

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.659 
important that we do have that
protection<00:03:31.959> so<00:03:32.709> when<00:03:32.829> I<00:03:32.859> click<00:03:33.129> cancel<00:03:33.340> my

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
protection so when I click cancel my

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.099 
protection so when I click cancel my
subscription<00:03:33.849> we<00:03:34.450> obviously<00:03:34.599> don't<00:03:34.959> have

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
subscription we obviously don't have

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.020 
subscription we obviously don't have
this<00:03:35.470> method<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.220> let's<00:03:36.400> go<00:03:36.549> ahead<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:36.849> create

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
this method so let's go ahead and create

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.479 
this method so let's go ahead and create
this<00:03:37.329> now<00:03:37.599> on<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.900> subscription<00:03:38.859> controller

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
this now on the subscription controller

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.699 
this now on the subscription controller
so<00:03:40.209> down<00:03:40.450> here<00:03:40.900> we<00:03:41.349> create<00:03:41.680> this<00:03:41.829> down<00:03:42.220> here<00:03:42.639> it

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
so down here we create this down here it

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.979 
so down here we create this down here it
cancel<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:45.010> this<00:03:45.609> is<00:03:45.760> extremely<00:03:46.209> easy<00:03:46.359> all<00:03:46.959> we

true<00:04:36.880> so<00:04:37.880> I'm<00:04:38.210> gonna<00:04:38.360> say<00:04:38.630> your<00:04:39.280> subscription

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280

true so I'm gonna say your subscription
will<00:04:40.850> end<00:04:41.150> on<00:04:41.750> and<00:04:42.410> then<00:04:43.570> I'm<00:04:44.570> going<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:44.900> output

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
will end on and then I'm going to output

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.890 
will end on and then I'm going to output
the<00:04:46.040> date<00:04:46.310> that<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.640> users<00:04:46.970> subscription

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
the date that the users subscription

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.580 
the date that the users subscription
ends<00:04:48.320> on<00:04:48.670> now<00:04:49.670> because<00:04:49.850> we<00:04:50.570> now<00:04:50.780> have<00:04:50.810> carbon

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
ends on now because we now have carbon

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.320 
ends on now because we now have carbon
available<00:04:52.100> for<00:04:52.250> these<00:04:52.340> dates<00:04:52.670> we<00:04:52.940> can<00:04:53.120> say

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
available for these dates we can say

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.390 
available for these dates we can say
user<00:04:54.730> subscription<00:04:55.730> ends<00:04:56.020> at<00:04:57.020> and<00:04:58.010> then<00:04:58.340> we

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
user subscription ends at and then we

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.460 
user subscription ends at and then we
can<00:04:58.580> format<00:04:59.060> that<00:04:59.210> however<00:04:59.600> we<00:04:59.750> want<00:05:00.020> so<00:05:00.380> I'll

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
can format that however we want so I'll

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.210 
can format that however we want so I'll
do<00:05:00.710> something<00:05:01.310> like<00:05:01.490> add<00:05:01.640> a<00:05:02.050> month<00:05:03.050> a<00:05:03.380> year<00:05:03.560> and

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
subscription will end up then so that's

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.450

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
we don't actually hit that controller

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.560 
we don't actually hit that controller
but<00:06:13.070> we<00:06:13.160> want<00:06:13.310> to<00:06:13.400> hide<00:06:13.580> this<00:06:13.790> anyway<00:06:14.180> so<00:06:14.210> let's

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
but we want to hide this anyway so let's

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.230 
but we want to hide this anyway so let's
do<00:06:14.690> that<00:06:14.840> now<00:06:15.140> so<00:06:15.800> under<00:06:16.280> here<00:06:16.310> we<00:06:16.940> can<00:06:17.210> just

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
do that now so under here we can just

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.130 
do that now so under here we can just
create<00:06:17.810> an<00:06:17.870> if<00:06:18.170> statement<00:06:19.450> and<00:06:20.450> we<00:06:20.540> can<00:06:20.690> say<00:06:20.870> if

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
create an if statement and we can say if

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:27.400 
create an if statement and we can say if
user<00:06:23.230> cancelled<00:06:24.490> and<00:06:25.540> just<00:06:26.540> nagae<00:06:26.870> that<00:06:27.170> and

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
then we can end that if there there we

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.700 
then we can end that if there there we
go<00:06:32.450> so<00:06:33.050> now<00:06:33.260> we<00:06:33.740> won't<00:06:34.130> see<00:06:34.400> that<00:06:35.950> oops
