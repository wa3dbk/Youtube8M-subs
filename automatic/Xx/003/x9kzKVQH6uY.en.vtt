00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.780
 The girls proudly present them as carrier handheld machines 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.099
 so it all started so well now we have to see new model from the 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.730
 Home dell server the whole world yes 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.910
 Percent which is also something behind the fuel through the texts under which one can 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.720
 they recognize the broomstick 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.510
 so that this so-called group after game si 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.600
 wanted in the context of one month of vibration 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.280
 so in the extraction, you have the formative on the one hand 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.240
 features 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.020
 by the promotion next to it 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.580
 the planners also installations the polish the spring force of the piston 4 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.920
 is triggered 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.870
 Now I have a look 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.150
 As a miller I just ran a super show 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.790
 Ronny taken 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.150
 with all-in and two portions and manual Laval does not work 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.150
 just let's go tidy up 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.070
 so that Wollitz scored 44 seconds 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.830
 One should now be proud to add a short time here that is reasonably 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.420
 is covered 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.730
 Bernd Helbig that we together 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.250
 Klose 4 150 should be fixed so that is the eyebrows 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.300
 Immediate construction started recommending the cake to go wine 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.000
 presses hand again 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.430
 so it looks now purely athletic alone under emphatically that Porsche 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.800
 make the pressure and know about it then what happens here always nice 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.040
 tighten 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.680
 not the same portafilter goes out back the taillight 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.980
 hereunder 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.890
 the group again 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.910
 Mission now we wait until we get the first few drops out 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.440
 Companies make their songs op 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.280
 and now that relaxes easily overlooks that installation 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.280
 The result is very good, and it's the same on the first try 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.710
 Now, of course, you can design the quantity as you like 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.499
 it now during Klezmer phasing out 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:17.499
 So the shopkeeper is very good 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:21.059
 I'll give it a try 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.689
 more tastes wonderful 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.949
 and the rest of it is leaking 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.949
 the keeper then just cleaned it off you do not need it 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.709
 Oracle are actually so were the essential features 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.109
 Although the Prague budget is one for a route one of two 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.049
 cups 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.219
 the back is still a water tank 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.360
 to the just as feasible accessible 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.929
 that is wonderfully solved 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:48.319
 so 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.189
 now her husband adds the cake at the post office also dry this 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.749
 otherwise dressed anyway 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.279
 I was allowed too 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.279
 high-ranking again with McKinsey after 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.769
 and before 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.469
 of course, I have to take care of the Bebelplatz administrator here 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.469
 Of course, already pretty high buys want cheaper 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.009
 Here comes the water out and how to hear Lottes shine 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:27.999
 maybe the water comes 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.999
 and now I start again carefully 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.359
 completely relaxed 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.919
 the Grim Reaper winning goal per anno 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.919
 so and then 2010 could 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.219
 Stoll is it like that 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.369
 the specialist for espresso and coffee machines
