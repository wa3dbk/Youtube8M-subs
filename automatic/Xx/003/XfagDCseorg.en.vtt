00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:33.520
 The attack took place in various towns in the eastern Ghouta in the Damascus countryside, most notably Harasta and Irbid (63 63 people, 30 of them children), Hamuriya, Saqba and Zamalek, and Ein Tarma and Kafarbanda. 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:47.740
 The massacre left a trail of accusations and allegations. The coalition and the armed opposition have accused forces of the 95th Brigade of the Syrian army stationed in the Qalamoun area of ​​carrying out the attack. 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:01:02.100
 On the other hand, the Syrian government and Russia accused the armed opposition forces of using chemical weapons in areas under their control, while officials in Damascus considered that the opposition and its supporters orchestrated the attack to attract foreign intervention. 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:13.180
 American, French, British and German intelligence have put the Syrian government in the position of the possible official and the closest to the execution of the attack.

 In early September, Obama announced his intention to launch a limited military strike on Syria provided Congress approved, and Washington began its efforts to build an international coalition supporting the strike, but Western capitals have reservations about the US move. 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:50.300
 After the specter of the strike on Syria, Russian diplomacy on September 9 led to an initiative to put Syria under its international control and then quickly destroy it in order to avoid any US military strike against it. The initiative took an international consensus and the blow was shattered. 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:06.980
 In mid-September, the report of the UN inspectors was released without charge, but included assurances that sarin gas had been fired by surface-to-surface missiles and that its perpetrators had timed the attack in a manner that guaranteed the most casualties, 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:16.020

 After a delay of 50 days from the scheduled date, the Pentagon announced on the nineteenth of this month the destruction of all elements of chemical weapons handed over by Syria. 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:03:01.560
 Some considered this a success for the international community, but others believe that the Syrian crisis that has shaken the Middle East can not be reduced to chemical destruction. Its first motives have not yet ended, and its recent output is emerging strongly in Iraq and Syria.
