Bigfoot hard drives Bigfoot drives were
made<00:00:22.289> by<00:00:22.470> quantum<00:00:22.980> about<00:00:23.490> 15<00:00:24.210> years<00:00:24.359> ago<00:00:24.510> and

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
made by quantum about 15 years ago and

drive<00:02:37.830> magnets<00:02:38.250> which<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.640> will<00:02:38.850> definitely

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
drive magnets which I will definitely

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:54.490 
drive magnets which I will definitely
try<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.750> salvage

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.199 

all<00:02:55.500> right<00:02:55.740> so<00:02:57.620> we've<00:02:58.620> taken<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.520> first

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
all right so we've taken the first

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.809 
all right so we've taken the first
little<00:03:00.480> ring<00:03:00.750> off<00:03:00.900> in<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.430> six<00:03:02.430> screws<00:03:02.610> that

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
little ring off in the six screws that

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.059 
little ring off in the six screws that
go<00:03:02.880> with<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.450> set<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.140> aside<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.650> we

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
go with it and set that aside and we

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.790 
go with it and set that aside and we
should<00:03:05.340> now<00:03:05.550> be<00:03:06.150> able<00:03:06.270> to<00:03:06.450> pride<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.500> arm

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
should now be able to pride this arm

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.850 
should now be able to pride this arm
away<00:03:08.780> perhaps<00:03:09.780> we<00:03:10.170> need<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.350> take<00:03:10.680> these

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
away perhaps we need to take these

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.680 
away perhaps we need to take these
screws<00:03:11.310> out<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.819> get<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.090> magnet<00:03:12.600> loose<00:03:16.580> and

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
screws out and get that magnet loose and

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.180 
screws out and get that magnet loose and
be<00:03:18.690> careful<00:03:19.020> with<00:03:19.110> this<00:03:19.260> thing<00:03:19.319> it<00:03:19.739> will<00:03:19.920> bite

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
be careful with this thing it will bite

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.360 
be careful with this thing it will bite
you<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:21.090> break<00:03:21.720> your<00:03:21.750> fingers<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.410> all<00:03:23.040> kinds

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
you and break your fingers and all kinds

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.729 
you and break your fingers and all kinds
of<00:03:23.430> fun<00:03:23.610> stuff<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:27.720> that's<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.350> kind<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.590> thing

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
of fun stuff so that's the kind of thing

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.300 
of fun stuff so that's the kind of thing
you<00:03:28.830> want<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.010> watch<00:03:29.160> out<00:03:29.370> for<00:03:31.010> as<00:03:32.010> you're

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
you want to watch out for as you're

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:47.570 
you want to watch out for as you're
prying<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.150> thing<00:03:33.330> off<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:45.120> now<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:47.400> can

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
prying this thing off so now you can

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.280 
prying this thing off so now you can
pivot<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.450> little<00:03:48.720> bit<00:03:48.870> out<00:03:48.959> of<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.110> way

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
pivot that a little bit out of the way

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:58.069 
pivot that a little bit out of the way
and<00:03:49.730> fully<00:03:50.730> lift<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.120> off<00:03:56.690> now<00:03:57.690> we<00:03:57.750> should<00:03:57.989> be

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
and fully lift it off now we should be

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.170 
and fully lift it off now we should be
able<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.320> lift<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.620> platters<00:03:59.010> away<00:04:00.140> and

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
able to lift the platters away and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.890 
able to lift the platters away and
finish<00:04:04.040> gutting<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.130> drive<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.900> actually

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
finish gutting the drive and actually

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.479 
finish gutting the drive and actually
this<00:04:07.019> might<00:04:07.260> be<00:04:07.500> close<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.160> extent<00:04:08.340> that

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
this might be close to the extent that

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:21.289 
this might be close to the extent that
we're<00:04:08.640> going<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.790> get<00:04:16.039> okay<00:04:17.299> so<00:04:19.789> at<00:04:20.789> this<00:04:21.000> point

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
we're going to get okay so at this point

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.400 
we're going to get okay so at this point
we<00:04:22.109> should<00:04:22.289> have<00:04:23.240> mostly<00:04:24.240> an<00:04:24.510> empty<00:04:25.080> shell<00:04:25.320> of

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
we should have mostly an empty shell of

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:36.500 
we should have mostly an empty shell of
a<00:04:25.500> drive<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:32.360> inside<00:04:33.360> it<00:04:33.600> we<00:04:34.229> will<00:04:35.330> stick<00:04:36.330> that

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
a drive and inside it we will stick that

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.860 
a drive and inside it we will stick that
flash<00:04:36.780> drive<00:04:36.810> down<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:38.390> I'm<00:04:39.390> not<00:04:39.600> even<00:04:39.750> sure

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
flash drive down and I'm not even sure

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.140 
flash drive down and I'm not even sure
how<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:40.140> happened<00:04:40.380> so<00:04:41.370> now<00:04:41.729> we've<00:04:41.880> got<00:04:42.030> the

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
how that happened so now we've got the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.300 
how that happened so now we've got the
drive<00:04:42.360> pretty<00:04:42.630> well<00:04:42.840> hollowed<00:04:43.169> out<00:04:43.310> we're

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
drive pretty well hollowed out we're

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.740 
drive pretty well hollowed out we're
probably<00:04:44.550> not<00:04:44.850> going<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.060> get<00:04:45.180> this<00:04:45.360> motor<00:04:45.630> out

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
probably not going to get this motor out

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.540 
probably not going to get this motor out
all<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.289> way<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.410> think<00:04:46.710> it's<00:04:46.830> friction<00:04:47.220> fit<00:04:47.370> in

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
all the way I think it's friction fit in

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.460 
all the way I think it's friction fit in
there<00:04:49.160> you<00:04:50.160> know<00:04:50.250> let's<00:04:50.789> just<00:04:50.850> try<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.470> yeah

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
there you know let's just try it yeah

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.320 
there you know let's just try it yeah
it's<00:04:52.590> probably<00:04:52.740> maybe<00:04:53.190> not<00:04:53.400> coming<00:04:53.669> out<00:04:53.729> so

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
it's probably maybe not coming out so

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.279 
it's probably maybe not coming out so
we'll<00:04:54.750> leave<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:54.930> there

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
we'll leave that there

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.990 
we'll leave that there
it<00:04:55.500> well<00:04:56.039> it<00:04:56.130> doesn't<00:04:56.370> spin<00:04:56.550> anymore<00:04:56.850> so

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
it well it doesn't spin anymore so

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.440 
it well it doesn't spin anymore so
that's<00:04:57.090> good<00:04:57.360> we<00:04:57.539> need<00:04:57.960> to<00:04:58.080> find<00:04:58.260> a<00:04:58.500> place<00:04:58.710> to

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
that's good we need to find a place to

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.149 
that's good we need to find a place to
mount<00:05:00.450> that<00:05:00.690> flash<00:05:00.900> drive<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.409> I<00:05:01.740> mean<00:05:02.039> really

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:02.159 
mount that flash drive and I mean really

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:03.320 
mount that flash drive and I mean really
it<00:05:02.310> doesn't<00:05:02.460> matter<00:05:02.580> just<00:05:02.729> stick<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.210> in<00:05:03.270> there

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
it doesn't matter just stick it in there

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.090 
it doesn't matter just stick it in there
somewhere

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
somewhere

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.740 
somewhere
but<00:05:05.100> more<00:05:05.280> importantly<00:05:05.789> we<00:05:06.090> need<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.360> find<00:05:06.569> out

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
but more importantly we need to find out

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
but more importantly we need to find out
where<00:05:07.740> we're<00:05:07.889> going<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.340> run<00:05:09.289> the<00:05:10.289> USB<00:05:10.650> cable

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
where we're going to run the USB cable

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.089 
where we're going to run the USB cable
out<00:05:11.009> of<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.190> drive<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:12.150> since<00:05:13.080> I'm<00:05:13.380> choosing

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
out of the drive and since I'm choosing

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.420 
out of the drive and since I'm choosing
to<00:05:14.130> keep<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:15.289> logic<00:05:16.289> board<00:05:16.500> there<00:05:16.710> I<00:05:16.919> think<00:05:17.069> it

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
to keep the logic board there I think it

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.249 
to keep the logic board there I think it
might<00:05:17.639> not<00:05:17.819> be<00:05:17.970> a<00:05:18.000> bad<00:05:18.210> idea<00:05:18.270> to<00:05:18.599> kind<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:19.050> run

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
might not be a bad idea to kind of run

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.279 
might not be a bad idea to kind of run
it<00:05:19.380> out<00:05:20.599> somewhere<00:05:21.599> near<00:05:21.870> it<00:05:22.020> there's<00:05:22.229> a

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
it out somewhere near it there's a

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.129 
it out somewhere near it there's a
little<00:05:22.699> indent<00:05:23.699> right<00:05:23.849> here<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:24.479> I'm

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
little indent right here and I'm

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.020 
little indent right here and I'm
probably<00:05:25.650> gonna<00:05:26.160> go<00:05:26.400> ahead<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:26.610> run<00:05:26.789> it<00:05:26.910> out

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
probably gonna go ahead and run it out

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.740 
probably gonna go ahead and run it out
there<00:05:27.240> and<00:05:28.130> I'm<00:05:29.130> betting<00:05:29.940> that<00:05:30.240> I<00:05:30.270> can<00:05:30.479> file

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
there and I'm betting that I can file

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.240 
there and I'm betting that I can file
this<00:05:31.020> down<00:05:31.259> without<00:05:31.470> too<00:05:31.710> much<00:05:31.860> trouble

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
this down without too much trouble

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.820 
this down without too much trouble

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
so I'm gonna go grab a file and see if

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.540 
so I'm gonna go grab a file and see if
we<00:05:34.919> can't<00:05:35.099> do<00:05:35.190> that

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
we can't do that

00:05:35.550 --> 00:06:00.710 
we can't do that
okay<00:05:36.090> so<00:05:37.639> go<00:05:38.639> ahead<00:05:38.699> and<00:05:38.789> file<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.090> hole<00:05:39.389> here

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.780 

and<00:06:01.720> I<00:06:01.840> don't<00:06:01.900> want<00:06:02.200> to<00:06:02.230> go<00:06:02.350> too<00:06:02.410> deep<00:06:02.560> with<00:06:02.860> it

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
and I don't want to go too deep with it

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.760 
and I don't want to go too deep with it
I<00:06:03.850> want<00:06:04.330> to<00:06:04.420> shallow<00:06:04.960> enough<00:06:05.350> that<00:06:05.530> it's<00:06:05.680> going

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
I want to shallow enough that it's going

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.920 
I want to shallow enough that it's going
to<00:06:05.830> kind<00:06:06.160> of<00:06:06.250> pinch<00:06:06.760> the<00:06:06.970> USB<00:06:07.300> cable<00:06:07.690> in<00:06:07.780> that

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
to kind of pinch the USB cable in that

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.390 
to kind of pinch the USB cable in that
way<00:06:08.020> I<00:06:08.050> don't<00:06:08.260> really<00:06:08.410> need<00:06:08.560> to<00:06:08.710> tie<00:06:08.890> a<00:06:08.920> knot<00:06:09.190> in

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
way I don't really need to tie a knot in

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.510 
way I don't really need to tie a knot in
it<00:06:09.570> or<00:06:10.570> do<00:06:10.720> any<00:06:10.900> other<00:06:11.020> kind<00:06:11.260> of<00:06:11.470> strain<00:06:12.190> relief

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
it or do any other kind of strain relief

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:22.269 
it or do any other kind of strain relief
on<00:06:12.700> it<00:06:14.160> and<00:06:15.160> we're<00:06:15.340> almost<00:06:15.550> there

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:22.279 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:31.149 

okay<00:06:25.569> so<00:06:26.569> now<00:06:26.779> we<00:06:27.499> can<00:06:27.619> go<00:06:27.739> ahead<00:06:27.859> and<00:06:30.069> put<00:06:31.069> the

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159 
okay so now we can go ahead and put the

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:33.899 
okay so now we can go ahead and put the
USB<00:06:31.489> extension<00:06:31.789> cable<00:06:32.029> in<00:06:32.269> there<00:06:32.389> and<00:06:32.599> we<00:06:33.589> can

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:33.909 
USB extension cable in there and we can

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:45.609 
USB extension cable in there and we can
sticky<00:06:34.909> down<00:06:35.089> the<00:06:35.329> flash<00:06:35.569> drive<00:06:44.079> my<00:06:45.079> hope<00:06:45.349> is

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:45.619 
sticky down the flash drive my hope is

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:49.949 
sticky down the flash drive my hope is
that<00:06:45.919> I<00:06:46.579> can<00:06:46.839> screw<00:06:47.839> this<00:06:47.989> cover<00:06:48.229> back<00:06:48.409> on<00:06:48.619> and

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:49.959 
that I can screw this cover back on and

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:55.719 
that I can screw this cover back on and
it'll<00:06:50.959> all<00:06:51.079> fit<00:06:54.579> okay

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729 
it'll all fit okay

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:57.579 
it'll all fit okay
after<00:06:56.299> a<00:06:56.329> little<00:06:56.449> readjusting<00:06:57.110> I<00:06:57.229> was<00:06:57.349> able<00:06:57.469> to

00:06:57.579 --> 00:06:57.589 
after a little readjusting I was able to

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:59.709 
after a little readjusting I was able to
get<00:06:57.739> the<00:06:57.829> drive<00:06:58.009> to<00:06:58.189> fit<00:06:58.429> just<00:06:59.329> fine

00:06:59.709 --> 00:06:59.719 
get the drive to fit just fine

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:04.329 
get the drive to fit just fine
and<00:07:01.209> it's<00:07:02.209> holding<00:07:02.809> the<00:07:03.079> USB<00:07:03.409> cable<00:07:03.589> quite

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:04.339 
and it's holding the USB cable quite

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:07.029 
and it's holding the USB cable quite
snugly<00:07:04.779> so<00:07:05.779> all<00:07:06.110> we<00:07:06.319> really<00:07:06.439> need<00:07:06.679> to<00:07:06.769> do<00:07:06.889> now

snugly so all we really need to do now

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:09.789 
snugly so all we really need to do now
is<00:07:07.279> run<00:07:07.909> those<00:07:08.089> screws<00:07:08.389> back<00:07:08.539> in<00:07:08.779> and<00:07:08.989> put<00:07:09.769> the

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:09.799 
is run those screws back in and put the

00:07:09.799 --> 00:07:34.749 
is run those screws back in and put the
logic<00:07:10.099> board<00:07:10.279> back<00:07:10.429> on<00:07:33.249> all<00:07:34.249> right<00:07:34.339> so<00:07:34.610> there

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:34.759 
logic board back on all right so there

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:37.600
