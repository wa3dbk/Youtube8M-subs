but<00:02:00.800> last<00:02:01.220> season<00:02:01.430> probably<00:02:02.360> one<00:02:02.450> of<00:02:02.479> your

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
but last season probably one of your

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.600 
but last season probably one of your
best<00:02:02.780> seasons<00:02:03.200> it's<00:02:03.440> fair<00:02:03.650> to<00:02:03.680> say<00:02:03.800> over<00:02:04.159> 20

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610

for this year we always try and be the
previous<00:02:09.320> year<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:09.770> that<00:02:10.610> won't<00:02:10.759> be<00:02:10.789> too<00:02:10.970> easy

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
previous year so that won't be too easy
