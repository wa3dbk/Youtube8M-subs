00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.540
 what do you do is the first time 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.250
 experiment this thing so I don't know 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.170
 how can it come but oh well there is always 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.180
 a start 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.230
 then today in this video they make you 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.539
 see the material first and then there will be 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.250
 a second part and I'll show you how 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.739
 coming cole 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.680
 let's start is the main thing is that 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.020
 serves is read more as a base is a cover 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.120
 I took this cover here today 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.410
 went to the Chinese and I took this 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.309
 here simple white cover with space 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.570
 for lamela for the apple logo e 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.680
 so yes 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.170
 the most important thing today 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.280
 you can do it the way you want the cover 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.880
 but you want to achieve and I have chosen to 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.340
 do it with the studs so the second is 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.869
 the second thing that sentence is the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.740
 studs and I'm not going to use these 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.770
 almost l 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.100
 if you can see it send use those 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:27.540
 silver that these are these eh 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:31.770

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.880
 taxes that I fell follow me wait 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.710

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.810

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.689
 this one here is now of a different shape 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.840
 so for this thing he went to use 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:53.310
 this kind of boats of course you 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.280
 you can also changed or change color 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.590
 shape as you want to monthly 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.990
 I tell you right away that he was boatmen 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.460
 buy the tobacco shop those 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:10.050
 shokky studs bandz ok your then 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.820
 the two main things are these 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:21.160
 we pass to the third the third hatred 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:26.220
 object object tool what good is that 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.310
 the glue that this has overcome here and there 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.370
 attack that my dad lent me 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.270
 because yes I don't usually use it but 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.610
 even super my dad super attack 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.790
 Venetian and this is very dangerous 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.570
 cover then and this thing this glue 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.970
 part there is written danger paste 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.200
 to the skin and eyes in seconds 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.880
 therefore seeing that dangerous it is in fact the 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.350
 first time to use alone 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.900
 My dad and my mom told me to 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:04.060
 be careful careful and then the 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.160
 the last thing you need to stay 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.980
 just be careful otherwise you can do it 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:14.110
 can be said with bare hands 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.480
 I have latex gloves because a 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.790
 place to paste me even if my dad will 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.060
 explained how to use them all I have 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.090
 afraid of getting stuck so me 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.150
 they are better that is better to use gods 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.920
 gloves in my opinion and these are the gloves 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.040
 in latex that you find them from all 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.480
 parts so this is all that 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.280
 I need to show you a word 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.560
 overview of course you can do it with 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.600
 even on other types of phones, that's enough 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.840
 change things to them 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.950
 so now nothing gets to work 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:53.310
 so much so that upload videos and see you 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.940

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.090

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.870
 let alone the kore box 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.590
 that's all it takes 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:08.560
 OK nothing 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.790
