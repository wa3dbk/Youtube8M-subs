00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.889
 because here the guys are like my 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.410
 name know aguilar dn or sport 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.620
 dotcom dot by we are seeing these 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.070
 those new married 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:18.400
 really brand timberland the model is 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:21.160
 called the hyper country font and oxford 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.480
 this is the good model is the classic 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.289
 with little cut and capella 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.539
 of suede I think many of us have seen 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.940
 this kind of designs and this kind of 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.829
 color with this type of plant half red 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:46.079
 good iconography this belongs to what 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:46.079
 that he was badly shod teams with 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.910
 pretty good reference to what it is 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.690
 care for the environment and with uses of 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.829
 recycled materials that help and 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.870
 they collaborate in the attention 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.280
 good environment let's go a little bit more 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.909
 the footwear has enough technology 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.790
 as we will see 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.690
 good the plant is 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:18.710
 of rubber or rubber that has this 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:23.210
 this logo this innovative design of 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.960
 timberland what it does is use or 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.500
 reuse the rubbers 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.710
 and redo the templates of such 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.920
 way that this improves the ecosystem that 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.439
 is not wasted absolutely nothing 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.230
 has a position as we can see the 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.290
 seem 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.620
 type word wilde I do not know if it's this kind of 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.620
 sewing or simply part of the 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.550
 I designed the pins as we said 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:58.260
 round the timberland logo on the 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.880
 suede leather has approximately 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:05.680
 334 cuts not the main copy this 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:10.850
 part of the instep the laterals 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.290
 a cut plus a small design in the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.670
 small cuts with the logo of 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.330
 timberland and cape 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.069
 a small part also of leather yes 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.590
 but that made little ones that part 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.130
 design 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.190
 and the posture as seen with three 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:34.540
 holes waylett punched in the part 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.550
 Internal rest seems different to me 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.770
 the conventional do not have some leagues 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.739
 that help giant is a mesh 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.440
 quite stretchable that helps support 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.710
 of the foot , remove the template and then 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.350
 explain why good 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.380
 the internal part covered with this 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:57.600
 fiber for disease management is 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:00.300
 good, let's go to technology 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.770
 languages ​​that make up all this footwear 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.050
 that I thought was excellent and I wanted 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.790
 show them what things and one more that 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.740
 good is a new technology a 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.310
 very apart patent that uses timberland in 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.700
 his shoes is not two in this case in 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.530
 this rum with outsourcing 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.210
 what things I'm going to show you first 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.090
 ok fast what is this thing 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.700
 let's make a 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.810
 a little experiment that 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.380
 at a pressure dose 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.290
 well you this shoes return a 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.770
 little the liquid that is going to happen we are going to 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.710
 watch 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.590
 but 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:43.270
 what this shoe does with this 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.140
 technology as we saw is to repel the 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.280
 Water 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.210
 that's how these languages ​​are 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.400
 is this technology 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.330
 in all footwear let's say good at level 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.510
 at the molecular level is this not what it does 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.800
 this patent is to cover all this 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.510
 footwear with this 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.300
 well the new system when the 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.810
 nanotechnology as I repeat it again 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:14.070
 and in such a way that the tired of the 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.440
 liquids and are not permeable to the material 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.959
 excellent is a new technology of 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.310
 suddenly by and we spill some things 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.019
 when we were wrong or for some 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.460
 reason we process is to treat things 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.030
 we will go to the footwear but in this 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.890
 case this is protected good that more the 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.660
 template is extremely flexible 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:35.360
 let's see the excellent in this footwear 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:40.730
 we can bring the template that 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:44.450
 he also has this unfriendly technology 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.910
 as we see it anti-fatigue this thing 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.920
 feel fatigue good that's the number 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.070
 template with design 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.310
 the comedian and how it is appreciated here and with 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.750
 micro micropores good injections of 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.770
 air in this template came to what 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.870
 that allows is comfort for people 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.270
 as those who stood up and most 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.430
 part of the day or let's say out there 5 or 6 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.960
 hours the foot what makes rest the 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.250
 heels good in this case this reduces 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:16.280
 in a considerable way all that is the 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:19.650
 fatigue reduces in a very good way 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:23.460
 this are the 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:26.490
 timbaland the team with against oxford 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.509
 available from size 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.819
 39 up to size 44 in this store 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:35.599
 virtual and in sneakers 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.599
