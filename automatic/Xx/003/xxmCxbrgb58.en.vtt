00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.869
 basic and small tutorial for those who 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.529
 we just started with this phone and it's 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:19.869
 how to enter the recovery mode as a first 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:24.060
 step we must turn off our phone 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.060
 with the power key 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.320
 to turn off 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.550
 we stop 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.710
 and then off our device 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.570

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.990
 you can see 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.320
 it's that simple to enter the recovery 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.840
 when all the restart options 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.289

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.590
 possibly a rom when it comes out 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.330
 from the dry 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.240
 sd card 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.079

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:54.119

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.210

 include the applications that also 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.490
 we can save in them but that 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.490
 it would include a greater capacity of space 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.360
 and good friends this was all
