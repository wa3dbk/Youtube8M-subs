00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.370
 nothing else 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.500
 when you tell me how are you expect to be 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.900
 super super good I'm a reader here and 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.730
 here we are back forgiveness for not 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.500
 have uploaded video what was the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.860
 Saturday and Sunday but I really do not 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.570
 I could also be a little bit 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.419
 short of times but good what 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.260
 important is that here we are I wanted them 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:36.720
 upload several things that were not something 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.239
 Well not here but something that has nothing 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.730
 what to do with my series but they have been 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.410
 days that all absolutely all the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.260
 subway has given him and this yesterday I tried 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.440
 record minecraft as three times as 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.120
 I tell them that and had I do not know if it 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.460
 agree that there was a stream with 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.800
 capone town and there we were practicing 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.300
 a while and rest them during that am 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.120
 I was rendering what was 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.040
 minecraft and my survival chapter 15 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.380
 if not bad memory 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.840
 and I'm supposed to be or render and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.590
 the whole show and it turns out that he looked for it 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.810
 get on them and I did not find it 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.119
 look for more ways that re 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.380
 videos longer already he reached or not 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.770
 nothing then this one 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.350
 Well, I looked for it and it turns out that 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.380
 I find the audio of my voice so 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.470
 I could not upload that gameplay if 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.170
 saved the gameplay but it does not save my 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.960
 voice then would be the as well as 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.780
 comment them apart but the truth is 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.369
 that's not about minecraft 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.630
 minecraft to comment live 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.729
 absolutely and then I was planning 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.899
 put it on because it is already recording 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:57.189
 other other other gameplay and it turns out 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:00.399
 the most important part was not recorded as 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.380
 who says the final part and I in that 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.990
 example and I thought putting them in a 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.490
 I enclose the example and the past so that 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.009
 they would see why I got into the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.260
 mines and other good has nothing to 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.910
 see with black ops but I wanted to tell you 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.390
 that's why I could not upload them 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.660
 video and I wanted to upload them killing stealth 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.569
 but like today is not my idea to play 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.810
 with knives I honestly do not know if it's 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.380
 the bad day or flat I was touched with pure 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.500
 camper 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.060
 and tell them that everyone brought ghost and is 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.620
 well I say everyone brings what he wants 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.630
 I'm not complaining, much less 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.190
 because there is someone who tells me that 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.080
 I 'm complaining about everything, I 'm not complaining 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.570
 simply that today was not a day for 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.280
 record that series either then then 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.320
 I said let's record a game in the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.530
 that I can probably look good 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.510
 this no longer does not matter so much if 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.610
 I lose or I win but it remains positive and 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.170
 well then that's why I got myself 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.080
 this game apart from that is 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.500
 totally started, they always got me 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.530
 from the companies and others I managed 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.330
 take out this gameplay with the franc with the 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.490
 of that ere with the one I like most about 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.310
 everyone in the class had already been told 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.130
 in some video I think the drone is the 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.470
 I said in case you have not seen it then go and 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.710
 check locke and then nothing else was this 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.950
 tell them about the epic super faces and 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.310
 other and good already happening to another little thing 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.200
 this 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.020
 I do not know if they remember that they raised a 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.510
 Video shotgun to stay 53 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.340
 kilos everyone told me he was 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.190
 super good that the game good for today 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.560
 everything but nobody hair what the essential 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.860
 of that gameplay that was also that they 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.660
 I said that I proposed to play with you 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.670
 this one like they went the waves or 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.470
 I do not know what happened there today I think that 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.870
 flat if they were impressed media 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.180
 more super kills that there is no 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.280
 I know but guys no one told me yes 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.220
 and that when I did it then good 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.110
 this one soon we will do it because 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.480
 have played with you since it came out 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.540
 black ops 2 I already know that it is super bad 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.760
 I know but I really could not 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.650
 this not so much because for more time 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.890
 but apart from that it is super complicated 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.750
 agree with you 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.440
 I have many series and they know 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.790
 that you have to give your space to each one 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.130
 but soon you come that the 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.810
 they want or we can even play several 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.210
 different games from one in the 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.940
 quick cops room although here is 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.250
 sub are super complicated to do this 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.220
 bounce bounces whatever you want 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.310
 well and probably I recorded one or two 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.130
 games that we play then 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.490
 Well, you tell me what's the matter 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.310
 to the milestone 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:45.060
 the truth is that I do know it more a little 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.360
 more complicated because I know that to do 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.220
 Paris is more difficult then 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.500
 let me grabbed the wave or ask 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.870
 someone or flat I try and and 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.169
 when you see each other and others could also 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:02.009
 we played that spun four do not worry 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.839
 and as for the strings 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:07.199
 if we are going to continue doing them but 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:09.389
 they hold me a little bit because I'm in the 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.300
 process of already buying what is explained 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.889
 because I only have the trial version and 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.860
 that's why he listens to me well 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:19.770
 funny every time I speak there then it 's 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.229
 to put up with me so little and as soon as 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.490
 have in us stream and remember 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.740
 that they can not squeeze by the 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.919
 moment console games because my 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.289
 capturing does not have that function anymore 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.529
 I have explained them thousands of times but 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.349
 there are probably people who do not know and 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:39.210
 because nothing else was that is to take advantage 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.979
 this gameplay to explain them one that 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.809
 another little thing and not to let them climb 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:45.360
 video because believe me if I kept 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:46.740
 trying to get out killing stealth 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.719
 minecraft probably was not going to 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.029
 work or the same and if there goes to 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:53.129
 it was very late the gameplay and I was going to 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:55.770
 go up until tomorrow but well then 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:59.610
 I hope you liked this this 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.590
 game is around 21-9 I think 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.660
 now we are going to see it 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.050
 and then a person that we lost 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.880
 I consider that I played well this contribution 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.900
 more to the team since it was then duel for 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.780
 equipment and not at confirmed low 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.940
 and well nothing else is that I hope they 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.930
 have liked to be very careful 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.930
 we see goodbye
