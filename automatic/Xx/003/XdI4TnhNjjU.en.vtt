the<00:00:06.759> brush<00:00:07.060> tool<00:00:07.420> is<00:00:07.690> at<00:00:08.139> the<00:00:08.230> base<00:00:08.500> of<00:00:08.769> all

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
the brush tool is at the base of all

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.830 
the brush tool is at the base of all
digital<00:00:09.220> painting<00:00:09.730> so<00:00:10.360> to<00:00:10.420> make<00:00:10.570> sure<00:00:10.599> you're

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
digital painting so to make sure you're

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.509 
digital painting so to make sure you're
getting<00:00:10.960> the<00:00:11.200> most<00:00:11.230> out<00:00:11.620> of<00:00:11.680> this<00:00:11.890> simple<00:00:12.280> tool

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 
getting the most out of this simple tool

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.910 
getting the most out of this simple tool
I'm<00:00:13.090> going<00:00:13.360> to<00:00:13.420> show<00:00:13.570> you<00:00:13.599> the<00:00:13.840> basic<00:00:14.320> brush

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
I'm going to show you the basic brush

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.890 
I'm going to show you the basic brush
controls<00:00:15.340> and<00:00:16.000> everything<00:00:16.480> we<00:00:16.599> do<00:00:16.720> in<00:00:16.840> this

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
controls and everything we do in this

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.499 
controls and everything we do in this
video<00:00:17.199> is<00:00:17.919> going<00:00:18.099> to<00:00:18.159> be<00:00:18.220> found<00:00:18.489> in<00:00:18.759> the<00:00:19.269> brush

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509 
video is going to be found in the brush

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.179 
video is going to be found in the brush
palette<00:00:19.810> so<00:00:20.529> go<00:00:20.679> to<00:00:20.739> window<00:00:21.179> brush<00:00:23.099> now<00:00:24.099> if

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
palette so go to window brush now if

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:25.889 
palette so go to window brush now if
you're<00:00:24.310> drawing<00:00:24.640> with<00:00:24.730> a<00:00:24.880> mouse<00:00:25.119> this<00:00:25.599> is<00:00:25.659> what

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:25.899 
you're drawing with a mouse this is what

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.819 
you're drawing with a mouse this is what
it<00:00:25.960> would<00:00:26.019> look<00:00:26.079> like<00:00:27.419> straight<00:00:28.419> lines<00:00:28.829> with

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 
it would look like straight lines with

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.580 
it would look like straight lines with
no<00:00:30.039> variety<00:00:30.519> but<00:00:31.509> because<00:00:31.839> you're<00:00:32.050> using<00:00:32.290> a

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
no variety but because you're using a

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.920 
no variety but because you're using a
Wacom<00:00:32.950> tablet<00:00:33.100> what<00:00:34.060> you<00:00:34.210> have<00:00:34.390> to<00:00:34.540> work<00:00:34.720> with

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
Wacom tablet what you have to work with

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.200 
Wacom tablet what you have to work with
is<00:00:35.110> pressure<00:00:35.500> sensitivity<00:00:36.160> so<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.030> first

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
is pressure sensitivity so the first

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.850 
is pressure sensitivity so the first
question<00:00:37.390> is<00:00:37.780> what<00:00:38.320> do<00:00:38.410> you<00:00:38.470> want<00:00:38.530> that

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
question is what do you want that

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.510 
question is what do you want that
pressure<00:00:39.100> sensitivity<00:00:39.790> to<00:00:40.360> manipulate

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
pressure sensitivity to manipulate

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.460 
pressure sensitivity to manipulate
generally<00:00:42.520> I'll<00:00:42.730> paint<00:00:43.030> with<00:00:43.150> brushes<00:00:43.600> where

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
generally I'll paint with brushes where

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.920 
generally I'll paint with brushes where
the<00:00:44.620> opacity<00:00:45.280> is<00:00:45.460> affected<00:00:46.150> by<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.570> brush

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
the opacity is affected by the brush

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.980 
the opacity is affected by the brush
pressure<00:00:47.790> so<00:00:48.790> here<00:00:48.970> I<00:00:49.030> click<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.510> transfer

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
pressure so here I click the transfer

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.990 
pressure so here I click the transfer
button<00:00:50.020> and<00:00:51.570> says<00:00:52.570> here<00:00:52.780> opacity<00:00:53.500> jitter<00:00:53.650> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
button and says here opacity jitter and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.690 
button and says here opacity jitter and
flow<00:00:55.000> jitter<00:00:55.270> and<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:56.500> control<00:00:57.010> for<00:00:57.340> both<00:00:57.520> of

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
flow jitter and the control for both of

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.590 
flow jitter and the control for both of
those<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:59.350> set<00:00:59.650> to<00:00:59.829> pen<00:01:00.070> pressure<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.510> what

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
those is set to pen pressure so what

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.979 
those is set to pen pressure so what
that<00:01:01.720> means<00:01:01.989> is<00:01:02.230> if<00:01:02.860> I<00:01:03.040> do<00:01:03.100> a<00:01:03.220> light<00:01:03.550> line<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
that means is if I do a light line the

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.679 
that means is if I do a light line the
opacity<00:01:05.289> is<00:01:05.619> low<00:01:05.859> the<00:01:06.609> harder<00:01:06.969> it<00:01:07.090> is<00:01:07.210> I<00:01:07.390> press

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
opacity is low the harder it is I press

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.739 
opacity is low the harder it is I press
the<00:01:08.590> darker<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.039> opacity<00:01:09.549> is<00:01:09.670> but<00:01:10.630> you'll

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:10.749 
the darker the opacity is but you'll

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:12.870 
the darker the opacity is but you'll
notice<00:01:10.960> that<00:01:11.109> the<00:01:11.409> size<00:01:11.710> of<00:01:12.009> my<00:01:12.130> brush<00:01:12.189> is

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
notice that the size of my brush is

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.139 
notice that the size of my brush is
staying<00:01:13.240> consistent<00:01:13.479> I<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:15.520> change<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.969> size

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
staying consistent I can change the size

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.959 
staying consistent I can change the size
with<00:01:16.659> keyboard<00:01:17.049> shortcuts<00:01:17.469> but<00:01:18.460> I<00:01:18.520> can't<00:01:18.819> make

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
with keyboard shortcuts but I can't make

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.959 
with keyboard shortcuts but I can't make
a<00:01:19.030> line<00:01:19.299> go<00:01:19.539> from<00:01:19.810> skinny<00:01:20.319> to<00:01:20.649> fat<00:01:20.889> it<00:01:21.700> always

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
a line go from skinny to fat it always

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.580 
a line go from skinny to fat it always
stays<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.509> same<00:01:23.499> diameter<00:01:24.899> so<00:01:25.899> if<00:01:26.020> I<00:01:26.109> instead

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
stays the same diameter so if I instead

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.629 
stays the same diameter so if I instead
wanted<00:01:27.100> to<00:01:27.249> have<00:01:27.429> more<00:01:27.789> oak<00:01:27.909> a<00:01:28.030> dip<00:01:28.329> pen<00:01:28.630> look<00:01:28.990> I

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:29.639 
wanted to have more oak a dip pen look I

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:33.179 
wanted to have more oak a dip pen look I
would<00:01:30.639> turn<00:01:30.819> off<00:01:31.060> transfer<00:01:31.689> and<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.920> would<00:01:33.069> turn

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
would turn off transfer and I would turn

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.050 
would turn off transfer and I would turn
on<00:01:33.340> shape<00:01:33.670> dynamics<00:01:33.909> and<00:01:35.280> here<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:36.429> see<00:01:36.670> size

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
on shape dynamics and here you see size

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.699 
on shape dynamics and here you see size
jitter<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:38.530> set<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.920> pen<00:01:39.130> pressure<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:41.560> I'll

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
jitter is set to pen pressure and I'll

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:43.469 
jitter is set to pen pressure and I'll
lower<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.039> minimum<00:01:42.490> diameter<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:43.179> increase

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
lower the minimum diameter to increase

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.529 
lower the minimum diameter to increase
the<00:01:43.630> effect<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:45.340> now<00:01:45.520> as<00:01:45.729> I<00:01:45.850> go<00:01:45.999> from<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.329> light

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
the effect so now as I go from a light

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.359 
the effect so now as I go from a light
mark<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:48.219> a<00:01:48.249> heavy<00:01:48.490> mark<00:01:48.789> goes<00:01:49.689> from<00:01:49.929> small<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
mark to a heavy mark goes from small to

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.370 
mark to a heavy mark goes from small to
large<00:01:51.539> you<00:01:52.539> know<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:52.810> is<00:01:52.929> very<00:01:52.990> different

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
large you know this is very different

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.660 
large you know this is very different
before<00:01:54.369> it<00:01:54.909> was<00:01:55.389> a<00:01:55.420> constant<00:01:56.380> diameter<00:01:56.670> but

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
before it was a constant diameter but

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.789 
before it was a constant diameter but
the<00:01:57.849> opacity<00:01:58.149> was<00:01:58.539> changing<00:01:58.959> here<00:01:59.619> the

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
the opacity was changing here the

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.039 
the opacity was changing here the
opacity<00:02:00.099> will<00:02:00.459> stay<00:02:00.639> the<00:02:00.789> same<00:02:00.819> no<00:02:01.329> matter

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
opacity will stay the same no matter

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.769 
opacity will stay the same no matter
what<00:02:02.259> I<00:02:02.289> do<00:02:02.409> and<00:02:02.849> all<00:02:03.849> that's<00:02:04.119> changing<00:02:04.539> is<00:02:04.689> the

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:04.779 
what I do and all that's changing is the

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:07.949 
what I do and all that's changing is the
brush<00:02:05.170> diameter<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:07.329> sometimes<00:02:07.749> when

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
brush diameter so sometimes when

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.020 
brush diameter so sometimes when
beginners<00:02:08.380> start<00:02:08.649> out<00:02:08.800> brushes<00:02:09.640> just<00:02:09.670> don't

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
beginners start out brushes just don't

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.030 
beginners start out brushes just don't
seem<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.420> be<00:02:10.540> working<00:02:10.780> correctly<00:02:11.140> something

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
seem to be working correctly something

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.190 
seem to be working correctly something
about<00:02:12.250> them<00:02:12.430> just<00:02:12.580> feels<00:02:13.030> wrong<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:14.110> if

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
about them just feels wrong and if

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.059 
about them just feels wrong and if
that's<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.470> case

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
that's the case

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.009 
that's the case
you're<00:02:15.370> probably<00:02:15.610> using<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.239> wrong<00:02:16.450> sort<00:02:16.870> of

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
you're probably using the wrong sort of

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.089 
you're probably using the wrong sort of
brush<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:18.430> most<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:18.969> painting<00:02:19.329> that<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.540> do

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
brush so most of the painting that I do

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.640 
brush so most of the painting that I do
involves<00:02:21.099> opacity<00:02:21.790> brushes<00:02:22.260> like<00:02:23.260> this<00:02:23.469> one

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
involves opacity brushes like this one

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.050 
involves opacity brushes like this one
the<00:02:23.950> hard<00:02:24.159> round<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.959> this<00:02:26.109> means<00:02:26.379> that<00:02:27.060> shape

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
the hard round so this means that shape

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.720 
the hard round so this means that shape
dynamics<00:02:28.629> can<00:02:28.810> be<00:02:28.959> off<00:02:29.140> but<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:29.980> transfer<00:02:30.549> is

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
dynamics can be off but the transfer is

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.309 
dynamics can be off but the transfer is
on<00:02:30.909> and<00:02:31.209> if<00:02:31.599> you<00:02:31.659> have<00:02:31.780> an<00:02:31.870> older<00:02:32.140> version

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
on and if you have an older version

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.520 
on and if you have an older version
simply<00:02:33.189> look<00:02:33.370> for<00:02:33.480> opacity<00:02:34.480> jitter<00:02:34.629> and<00:02:34.930> flow

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
simply look for opacity jitter and flow

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.250 
simply look for opacity jitter and flow
jitter<00:02:36.120> now<00:02:37.120> there<00:02:37.329> are<00:02:37.480> times<00:02:37.870> where<00:02:38.230> you

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
jitter now there are times where you

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.039 
jitter now there are times where you
would<00:02:38.500> want<00:02:38.650> both<00:02:39.189> opacity<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.209> diameter

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
would want both opacity and diameter

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.080 
would want both opacity and diameter
controlled<00:02:41.560> simultaneously<00:02:42.030> by<00:02:43.030> the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
controlled simultaneously by the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.449 
controlled simultaneously by the
pressure<00:02:43.389> now<00:02:44.319> this<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.650> much<00:02:44.859> less<00:02:45.159> useful

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
pressure now this is much less useful

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.759 
pressure now this is much less useful
but<00:02:46.030> can<00:02:46.150> come<00:02:46.299> in<00:02:46.389> handy<00:02:46.480> sometimes<00:02:46.769> so

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
but can come in handy sometimes so

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.800 
but can come in handy sometimes so
here's<00:02:47.980> what<00:02:48.129> that<00:02:48.280> will<00:02:48.430> look<00:02:48.459> like<00:02:48.609> I<00:02:49.000> have

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
here's what that will look like I have

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.550 
here's what that will look like I have
both<00:02:50.040> opacity<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.220> flow<00:02:51.579> jitter<00:02:52.260> tied<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.409> pen

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
both opacity and flow jitter tied to pen

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.119 
both opacity and flow jitter tied to pen
pressure<00:02:53.799> and<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.930> also<00:02:56.169> have<00:02:56.560> size<00:02:56.859> jitter

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
pressure and I also have size jitter

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.809 
pressure and I also have size jitter
tied<00:02:57.819> to<00:02:57.939> pen<00:02:58.090> pressure<00:02:59.220> so<00:03:00.220> here<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:00.579> draw<00:03:00.790> a

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
tied to pen pressure so here is I draw a

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:01.319 
tied to pen pressure so here is I draw a
stroke

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
stroke

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.420 
stroke
you'll<00:03:01.900> see<00:03:02.139> it<00:03:02.260> gets<00:03:02.500> both<00:03:02.709> smaller<00:03:03.129> to

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
you'll see it gets both smaller to

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.710 
you'll see it gets both smaller to
larger<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:04.000> also<00:03:04.959> lighter<00:03:05.379> to<00:03:05.650> darker<00:03:06.720> so

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
larger and also lighter to darker so

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.270 
larger and also lighter to darker so
this<00:03:07.900> could<00:03:08.079> be<00:03:08.109> good<00:03:08.379> if<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.530> wanted<00:03:08.889> to<00:03:09.099> go

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
this could be good if you wanted to go

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.300 
this could be good if you wanted to go
for<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.989> calligraphy<00:03:10.989> look<00:03:11.260> or<00:03:11.590> maybe<00:03:11.950> an<00:03:12.099> ink

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
for a calligraphy look or maybe an ink

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.759 
for a calligraphy look or maybe an ink
wash<00:03:12.579> look<00:03:12.939> but<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:13.959> find<00:03:14.319> that<00:03:14.439> it<00:03:14.560> can<00:03:14.680> be

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
wash look but I find that it can be

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.309 
wash look but I find that it can be
harder<00:03:15.099> to<00:03:15.129> control<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.810> as<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:16.959> rule<00:03:17.169> of<00:03:17.260> thumb

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
harder to control so as a rule of thumb

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.969 
harder to control so as a rule of thumb
I<00:03:17.680> like<00:03:18.639> to<00:03:18.760> work<00:03:18.909> with<00:03:19.120> either<00:03:19.979> opacity

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:20.979 
I like to work with either opacity

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:27.240 
I like to work with either opacity
brushes<00:03:21.479> or<00:03:23.129> with<00:03:24.129> diameter<00:03:24.669> brushes<00:03:26.069> but<00:03:27.069> not

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
brushes or with diameter brushes but not

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.180 
brushes or with diameter brushes but not
both<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.870> most<00:03:29.109> of<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.319> time<00:03:29.560> the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
both and that most of the time the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.369 
both and that most of the time the
simple<00:03:30.549> hard<00:03:30.790> round<00:03:31.090> which<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.840> an<00:03:31.959> opacity

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
simple hard round which is an opacity

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.569 
simple hard round which is an opacity
brush<00:03:32.680> is<00:03:32.889> the<00:03:33.849> most<00:03:34.180> versatile
