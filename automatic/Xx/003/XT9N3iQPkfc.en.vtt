00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 for now they have all improved at least 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.890
 the last three we saw going up 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.540
 on the trampoline 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.940
 tania cagnotto more to mortal and a half 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.010
 back pike has changed the order 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.690
 of dives compared to last year 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.940
 he kept this as penultimate and closed 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.520
 with the overturned it is back to what it is 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.550
 was the diving order let's say 2012 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.820
 year of the London Olympics 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.830
 and here we are with tablet dad joe yes 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.019
 he says that he has some stimuli as he is then 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.269
 she also improved with worse respect 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.460
 in the morning he had made 63 points with 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.740
 this darkness over 70 because you will be 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.610
 definitely useful 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.210
 don't move 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.400
 much more unfortunate because there are 38 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.010
 which are good and eight and a half but also 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.540
 27 and a half we have cost we say the year 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.220
 I picked them up because they took the two off 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.080
 points the two highest votes here it is the 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.100
 detail the two lowest votes anyway 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.860
 72 for now this house is so much stuff 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.780
 yes we definitely give maria marconi 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.629
 the thor athlete begins 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.370
 all respect has been seen so much 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.050
 aiming I was looking a little bit at that 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.150
 what happened that size is asking 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.040
 if to the referee if he can leave 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.990
 or not 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.240
 yes but very regular race at high 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.020
 level but fell under only trafficking 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.940
 indeed with the returned 67 50 there are 4 up 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.220
 5 is the fifth was born very close to quota 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.940
 70 let's see it struggling with the rock 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.940
 of the triple and a half forward 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.909
 even abundant these days 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.740
 I was not so fluid so fast 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.869
 has remained a little hesitant in the part 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.490
 final but definitely a dive that the 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.909
 quietly leads to the command of 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.380
 partial ranking 55,80 for tania 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.549
 cagnotto which however also improves with 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.350
 this dive the score of 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.630
 eliminatory and managed to block the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.240
 never rotate from almost having any 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.009
 too what a positive note because in 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.319
 we see this dip we see the 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.869
 maria marconi screwing response 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.459
 ahead for the Roman athlete nothing is 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.200
 likely to be taken with his 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:05.289
 something also snapped in the head of the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.329
 computer of this athlete after the 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.019
 initial defaiance well surely yes 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.019
 because it arrives 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.770
 I lived I thought we were entrances 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.280
 a little polenta said tania right before 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.720
 of the final that kicked a little 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.250
 this springboard these stilts ne 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.160
 they are traps not to say one 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.860
 degeneration but those a little older 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.500
 and therefore they are a little softer and a bit 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.750
 slower in response being the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.730
 athletes accustomed to different times and rhythms 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.950
 on the new trampolines do they do a little 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.050
 struggling to recover 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.340
 15 points ahead are in play 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.709
 bertocchi we now see the triple e 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.420
 half ahead caught by maria marconi 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:56.849
 that it takes the paw of the lioness 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.709
 that she struggles with her ankles with this 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.450
 the only dive sometimes those of the 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:06.300
 drought that allows it to exploit the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:08.519
 table you see the tip of your toes is 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.870
 nothing improved in this one 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.580
 we also hold for the European is 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.010
 definitely in the world cup it is 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.640
 improved mind me has improved a lot 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.500
 in the stability phase on 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.120
 trampoline therefore allows this to 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.890
 also have greater stability than 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.840
 ankles and not seen in the part 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.640
 final because a little quieter a little 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.940
 on the in the rotation and therefore the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.390
 decided 67 point point 50 points only 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.280
 which got creed cuba was anymore 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.420
 let's see maria marconi now 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.420
 double and a half back pike 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.940
 goal third place we did 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.530
 little to tachometer did not want 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.209
 risk nothing 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.560
 1 other exhibits and another time was 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.690
 perhaps even cleaner at the entrances 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:58.079
 however 38 points fantastic tania cagnotto 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.780
 with this last dive really good 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.550
 he was tall 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.140
 see the absent trick under water 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.240
 that everything is going on so a 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.670
 further roe deer upside down below 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:13.190
 to the water for which the sense narrow band 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.810
 336.30 she had in the last few drops 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.120
 meanwhile we see marconi going to 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.359
 close with double and a half 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.359
 inverted
