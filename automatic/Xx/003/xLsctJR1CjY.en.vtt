because then you get

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.840 
because then you get
it's<00:06:26.610> much<00:06:26.820> simpler<00:06:27.240> to<00:06:28.050> see<00:06:28.260> what<00:06:28.500> you<00:06:28.710> to<00:06:29.670> get

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
it's much simpler to see what you to get

it's much simpler to see what you to get
a<00:06:29.880> hang

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:36.349
