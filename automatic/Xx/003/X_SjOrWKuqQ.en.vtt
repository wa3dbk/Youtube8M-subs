00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
your lips moisturized and I sometimes I

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.870 
your lips moisturized and I sometimes I
use<00:01:53.590> this<00:01:53.710> underneath<00:01:54.009> some<00:01:54.250> of<00:01:54.310> my<00:01:54.430> lipsticks

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
use this underneath some of my lipsticks

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.819 
use this underneath some of my lipsticks
because<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.390> just<00:01:55.509> gives<00:01:55.689> us<00:01:55.840> Reema's<00:01:56.259> so<00:01:56.649> like

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
because it just gives us Reema's so like

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.260 
because it just gives us Reema's so like
feel<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.369> my<00:01:57.520> lips<00:01:57.729> and<00:01:57.909> then<00:01:58.000> when<00:01:58.149> the

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
feel to my lips and then when the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.700 
feel to my lips and then when the
lipstick<00:01:58.689> goes<00:01:58.840> on<00:01:59.049> it<00:01:59.170> just<00:01:59.289> feels<00:01:59.439> really

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
lipstick goes on it just feels really

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.469 
lipstick goes on it just feels really
smooth<00:02:00.070> I<00:02:00.250> would<00:02:00.490> say<00:02:00.729> though<00:02:00.939> that<00:02:01.180> if<00:02:01.329> you

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
smooth I would say though that if you

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.240 
smooth I would say though that if you
are<00:02:01.630> going<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.960> use<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.350> matte<00:02:02.619> lipstick<00:02:03.100> you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
are going to use a matte lipstick you

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.249 
are going to use a matte lipstick you
should<00:02:03.399> probably<00:02:03.700> wait<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.390> while<00:02:04.630> after<00:02:05.229> you

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
should probably wait a while after you

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.109 
should probably wait a while after you
apply<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.860> put<00:02:06.009> it<00:02:06.100> on<00:02:06.189> because<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.850> can

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
apply this to put it on because it can

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.150 
apply this to put it on because it can
make<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.539> lipstick<00:02:07.899> fade<00:02:08.259> you<00:02:08.800> don't<00:02:09.009> want

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
make the lipstick fade you don't want

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.499 
make the lipstick fade you don't want
that<00:02:09.310> if<00:02:09.430> you<00:02:09.460> want<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.850> apply<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.240> matte

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
that if you want to apply a matte

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.120 
that if you want to apply a matte
lipstick<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:11.050> you<00:02:11.170> want<00:02:11.350> lost<00:02:11.560> or<00:02:11.860> really

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
probably the best one to start with

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.650 
probably the best one to start with
however<00:03:16.820> not<00:03:17.820> many<00:03:17.940> people<00:03:18.090> like<00:03:18.270> their

lipsticks<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.110> be<00:03:19.320> max<00:03:19.590> because<00:03:19.920> they<00:03:20.010> feel

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
lipsticks to be max because they feel

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.010 
lipsticks to be max because they feel
like<00:03:20.370> it's<00:03:20.580> drying<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.210> this<00:03:21.420> one<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.810> quite

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.650
