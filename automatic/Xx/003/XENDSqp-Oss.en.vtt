00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
got such a background in engineering and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.330 
got such a background in engineering and
mechanics<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.899> computer<00:02:07.409> aided<00:02:07.799> design

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340

so<00:02:08.610> yeah<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:08.970> natural<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:09.479> right
