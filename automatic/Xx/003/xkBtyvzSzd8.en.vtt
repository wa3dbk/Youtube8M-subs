got<00:00:09.240> smoke<00:00:09.599> rolling<00:00:10.139> out<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.650> fan<00:00:11.040> there

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
got smoke rolling out of that fan there

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.430 
got smoke rolling out of that fan there
I've<00:00:11.849> loaded<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.420> with<00:00:12.570> wood<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:12.870> let<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.290> run

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
I've loaded it with wood and let it run

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.890 
I've loaded it with wood and let it run
for<00:00:13.679> about<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.070> last<00:00:14.299> let's<00:00:15.299> say<00:00:15.480> seven

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
for about the last let's say seven

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.050 
for about the last let's say seven
minutes<00:00:16.199> or<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:17.279> I'm<00:00:17.400> kind<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.730> standing

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
minutes or so and I'm kind of standing

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.490 
minutes or so and I'm kind of standing
on<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.300> wrong<00:00:18.420> side<00:00:18.750> at<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.080> moment<00:00:19.380> let<00:00:19.439> me

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500

go ahead and kind of turn myself to the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.810 
go ahead and kind of turn myself to the
other<00:00:21.660> side<00:00:21.930> we're<00:00:22.650> gonna<00:00:22.800> light<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.369> smoke

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
other side we're gonna light this smoke

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.700 
other side we're gonna light this smoke
here<00:00:24.119> coming<00:00:24.449> out<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.720> our<00:00:24.810> fan<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.470> see<00:00:25.590> if

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
here coming out of our fan and see if

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.160 
here coming out of our fan and see if
we've<00:00:25.890> got<00:00:25.920> synthetic<00:00:26.640> gas<00:00:26.820> if<00:00:27.660> everything

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
we've got synthetic gas if everything

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.070 
we've got synthetic gas if everything
works<00:00:28.380> for<00:00:28.650> us<00:00:28.769> here<00:00:29.449> I've<00:00:30.449> got<00:00:30.660> some<00:00:30.869> wind

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
works for us here I've got some wind

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.200 
works for us here I've got some wind
issues<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> poor<00:00:32.040> lighter<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.940> there<00:00:33.090> we

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
issues and a poor lighter but there we

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.440 
issues and a poor lighter but there we
go<00:00:33.360> whoa<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.739> heck<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.850> flame<00:00:36.149> once

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
go whoa it's a heck of a flame once

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.790 
go whoa it's a heck of a flame once
everything<00:00:37.079> works<00:00:37.290> correctly<00:00:39.469> did<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.559> tell

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
everything works correctly did you tell

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.760 
everything works correctly did you tell
that<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:42.510> wind<00:00:42.750> right<00:00:43.020> now<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.230> coming

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
that the the wind right now is coming

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.440 
that the the wind right now is coming
right<00:00:43.920> into<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> end<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.940> thing<00:00:45.210> let's

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
right into the end of this thing let's

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.729 
right into the end of this thing let's
see<00:00:45.600> if<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.899> get<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.230> run<00:00:46.350> from<00:00:46.559> this

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
see if we can get it to run from this

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.490 
see if we can get it to run from this
side<00:00:47.300> there<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.420> go<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.809> had<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> lid<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
side there we go we had a lid for a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.889 
side there we go we had a lid for a
second<00:00:49.829> there<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.219> needs<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.149> cool<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.570> smoke

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
second there it needs to cool this smoke

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.510 
second there it needs to cool this smoke
a<00:00:51.930> lot<00:00:52.140> Morris<00:00:52.530> there<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> go<00:00:52.980> notice<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
a lot Morris there you go notice the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.090 
a lot Morris there you go notice the
smoke<00:00:53.760> disappeared<00:00:54.449> we've<00:00:55.320> got<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> nice<00:00:55.770> clean

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
smoke disappeared we've got a nice clean

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.450 
smoke disappeared we've got a nice clean
burn<00:00:56.370> off<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.969> then<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.899> came<00:00:58.020> back<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:59.039> if<00:00:59.309> I

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
burn off and then it came back but if I

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.010 
burn off and then it came back but if I
can<00:00:59.609> keep<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> lighter<00:01:00.090> laid<00:01:00.359> inside<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.870> it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
can keep the lighter laid inside of it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.850 
can keep the lighter laid inside of it
we've<00:01:01.320> got<00:01:01.590> synthetic<00:01:02.520> gas<00:01:02.699> flare<00:01:03.090> off<00:01:03.329> there

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
we've got synthetic gas flare off there

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.270 
we've got synthetic gas flare off there
there<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:04.979> go<00:01:05.129> right<00:01:05.400> there<00:01:06.890> you<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
there we go right there you see the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.880 
there we go right there you see the
smoke<00:01:08.490> how<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.850> disappears<00:01:09.619> becomes<00:01:10.619> very

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
smoke how it disappears becomes very

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.640 
smoke how it disappears becomes very
very<00:01:11.220> thin<00:01:11.640> that's<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.510> very<00:01:12.780> large<00:01:13.080> flame

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
very thin that's a very large flame

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.890 
very thin that's a very large flame
almost<00:01:14.610> impossible<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.330> see<00:01:15.509> during<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
almost impossible to see during the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.530 
almost impossible to see during the
daytime<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.100> I'll<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.520> more<00:01:17.549> test<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.360> this

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
daytime so I'll do one more test of this

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.300 
daytime so I'll do one more test of this
at<00:01:18.840> night<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.320> show<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.530> exactly<00:01:19.979> what's

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
at night to show you exactly what's

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.580 
at night to show you exactly what's
taking<00:01:20.610> place<00:01:20.689> you'll<00:01:21.689> notice<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> thickness

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
taking place you'll notice the thickness

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.289 
taking place you'll notice the thickness
of<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.920> cloud<00:01:23.189> when<00:01:23.430> I'm<00:01:23.549> not<00:01:23.700> lighting<00:01:24.180> it

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
of that cloud when I'm not lighting it

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.179 
of that cloud when I'm not lighting it
here<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.780> then<00:01:25.290> once<00:01:25.470> again<00:01:25.619> we'll<00:01:26.009> come<00:01:26.159> up

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
here and then once again we'll come up

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.819 
here and then once again we'll come up
to<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.110> light<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.500> you'll<00:01:28.619> notice

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
to it and light it and you'll notice

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.179 
to it and light it and you'll notice
it's<00:01:29.250> not<00:01:29.400> there<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.570> actually<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.189> flame

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
it's not there it's actually a flame

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.160 
it's not there it's actually a flame
rolling<00:01:32.820> out<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.150> there<00:01:33.270> when<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.900> so

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
rolling out of there when I do that so

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.859 
rolling out of there when I do that so
right<00:01:35.159> now<00:01:35.340> their<00:01:35.610> planes<00:01:36.060> actually<00:01:36.270> burning

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
right now their planes actually burning

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.410 
right now their planes actually burning
and<00:01:37.200> staying<00:01:37.439> Burt<00:01:37.860> that's<00:01:38.700> synthetic<00:01:39.240> gas

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
and staying Burt that's synthetic gas

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.060 
and staying Burt that's synthetic gas
production<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> good<00:01:40.439> enough<00:01:40.619> rate<00:01:40.829> there<00:01:41.040> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
production at a good enough rate there I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.950 
production at a good enough rate there I
went<00:01:41.310> out<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.270> tell<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.570> difference

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
went out so you can tell the difference

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.350 
went out so you can tell the difference
there<00:01:43.200> when<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.490> flame<00:01:44.729> actually<00:01:44.970> goes

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
there when the the flame actually goes

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.120 
there when the the flame actually goes
out<00:01:45.600> between<00:01:45.869> when<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.380> not<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:46.860> there's

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
out between when it's not there there's

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.960 
out between when it's not there there's
a<00:01:47.250> litigant<00:01:48.890> I'll<00:01:49.890> right<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.640> our<00:01:50.729> synthetic

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
a litigant I'll right so our synthetic

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.200 
a litigant I'll right so our synthetic
gas<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.630> producing<00:01:52.170> really<00:01:52.619> well<00:01:53.210> obviously

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
gas is producing really well obviously

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.330 
gas is producing really well obviously
there<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:54.960> lit<00:01:55.170> obviously<00:01:55.680> again<00:01:55.979> that's<00:01:56.219> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
there it's lit obviously again that's a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.760 
there it's lit obviously again that's a
big<00:01:56.700> flame<00:01:57.119> I'd<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.320> put<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.590> out<00:01:58.740> so

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
big flame I'd like to put it out so

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.789 
big flame I'd like to put it out so
close<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> fan<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:01.020> we're<00:02:01.170> gonna<00:02:01.290> choke<00:02:01.649> it

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
close to the fan so we're gonna choke it

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.160 
close to the fan so we're gonna choke it
off<00:02:02.000> run<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> pipe<00:02:03.329> inside<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.899> there<00:02:04.020> real

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
off run a pipe inside of there real

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.630 
off run a pipe inside of there real
quick<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.590> see<00:02:04.710> if<00:02:04.740> we<00:02:04.860> can't<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.369> at<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
quick and see if we can't do that at the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.260 
quick and see if we can't do that at the
end<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.939> pipe

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
end of the pipe

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.770 
end of the pipe
so<00:02:07.540> here<00:02:07.690> we<00:02:07.810> go<00:02:07.960> once<00:02:08.229> again<00:02:09.119> there<00:02:10.119> there<00:02:10.630> we

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
so here we go once again there there we

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.449 
so here we go once again there there we
go<00:02:10.959> we've<00:02:11.260> got<00:02:11.290> great<00:02:11.890> synthetic<00:02:12.430> gas<00:02:12.610> light

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
go we've got great synthetic gas light

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.550 
go we've got great synthetic gas light
there<00:02:15.459> there<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.300> that's<00:02:16.630> our<00:02:16.870> synthetic

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
there there it is that's our synthetic

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.030 
there there it is that's our synthetic
gas<00:02:17.770> in<00:02:18.100> ignition<00:02:18.610> from<00:02:19.510> our<00:02:19.720> reactor<00:02:20.650> system

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
gas in ignition from our reactor system

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.970 
gas in ignition from our reactor system
we<00:02:21.130> just<00:02:21.370> built<00:02:21.580> put<00:02:21.940> into<00:02:22.180> our<00:02:22.209> truck<00:02:22.950> well<00:02:23.950> I

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
we just built put into our truck well I

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.010 
we just built put into our truck well I
hope<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:24.370> enjoyed<00:02:24.790> our<00:02:24.970> little<00:02:25.270> test<00:02:25.569> here<00:02:25.690> of

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
hope you enjoyed our little test here of

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.199 
hope you enjoyed our little test here of
the<00:02:26.110> reactor<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.800> action<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.400> put<00:02:27.880> a<00:02:27.910> minor

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
the reactor in action I put a minor

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.850 
the reactor in action I put a minor
amount<00:02:28.569> of<00:02:28.660> wood<00:02:28.840> in<00:02:28.989> there<00:02:29.140> just<00:02:29.380> because<00:02:29.709> I

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
amount of wood in there just because I

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.900 
amount of wood in there just because I
wanted<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.160> make<00:02:30.340> sure<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:30.520> didn't<00:02:30.850> have

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
wanted to make sure I didn't have

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.390 
wanted to make sure I didn't have
thermal<00:02:31.360> meltdown<00:02:31.750> what<00:02:32.739> we're<00:02:32.860> gonna<00:02:32.950> do<00:02:33.220> now

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
thermal meltdown what we're gonna do now

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.740 
thermal meltdown what we're gonna do now
is<00:02:33.459> let<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.700> go<00:02:33.970> ahead<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.239> run<00:02:34.360> its<00:02:34.510> course

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
is let that go ahead and run its course

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.660 
is let that go ahead and run its course
in<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.050> next<00:02:35.290> part<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.620> project<00:02:36.190> we'll

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
in the next part of this project we'll

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.490 
in the next part of this project we'll
put<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.060> radiator<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.840> filters<00:02:38.290> and

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
put it the radiator the filters and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.870 
put it the radiator the filters and
everything<00:02:38.950> on<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.190> bed<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.550> little

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
everything on the bed of this little

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.759 
everything on the bed of this little
love<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.390> we'll<00:02:40.930> get<00:02:41.050> this<00:02:41.230> whole<00:02:41.410> reactor

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
love and we'll get this whole reactor

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.470 
love and we'll get this whole reactor
set<00:02:42.130> up<00:02:42.280> in<00:02:42.459> there<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.850> is<00:02:42.910> going<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.209> look<00:02:43.390> a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
set up in there this is going to look a

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.449 
set up in there this is going to look a
little<00:02:43.600> big<00:02:43.900> for<00:02:43.930> this<00:02:44.260> truck<00:02:44.560> but<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.100> like<00:02:45.310> to

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
little big for this truck but I like to

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:46.680 
little big for this truck but I like to
go<00:02:45.610> big<00:02:45.910> because<00:02:46.000> there's<00:02:46.269> a<00:02:46.300> lot<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.570> other
