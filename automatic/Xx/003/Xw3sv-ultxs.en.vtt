00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.389
 this is the wilson big city nine 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.670
 to five is no the 5 you can 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.490
 think that it stands for spin here 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.449
 effect and then settles down in the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.029
 general conditions 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.000
 we have a 95 here he comes after 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.869
 name already at 113 grams and prepares 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.059
 a balance of 31 0 1 thin 18 mm 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.610
 Boxteam frame so typical pattern 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.590
 feeling is coming soon and now 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.090
 it comes as mentioned spin effect 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.469
 is here for the side picture 16 15 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.960
 you do not have a huge prophet 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.379
 To be able to predict a box 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.600
 in the frame of the typical gustav with the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.320
 open pages image means control 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.239
 I am also a racket with lots of people 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.340
 Here the control is in the foreground 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.859
 I think the racket offers anyway 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.080
 a very big amount of steam that 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.720
 open pages picture does that something more 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.010
 opposite the normal monastery no 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.909
 I think here 's one more 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.220
 a little more power 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.170
 The racket in general is very good 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.659
 suitable for poly pages in my opinion 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.189
 and lives if there is no farmer racket 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.920
 is very suitable for 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.689
 Aggressive player because control 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.670
 or you can animal here to the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.000
 ball tearing the page image gives a lot 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.799
 here 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.659
 we can spin much much aggressive 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.220
 play without losing control 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.900
 have to 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.630
 the bat generally animates you 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.400
 just doing a lot of yourself is not 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.780
 really is or not main 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.280
 this back play reckitt but her 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.229
 should be aggressive on the ball 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.970
 He should choose the game himself 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.149
 can wonderfully control the lengths 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.560
 for my concepts it can very very 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.600
 opponents unfriendly the impact 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.640
 Generate there is every amount to each 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.290
 lots of spider out 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.509
 I also found it very much on the net 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.790
 Quiet as the weight comes so good 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.229
 not too heavy not so easy on 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.450
 actually slaughter a pleasure 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.310
 as well, of course, if you like it 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.079
 said at the 95 he hit pretty well 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.549
 should 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.860
 wilson has been in the middle of the class 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.500
 still one more 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.759
 on top of that very well complementary for 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.800
 range in my opinion 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.270
 Please look at the rest as well 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.610
 us on centercourt de an 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.810
 there are some new big ones that all 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.970
 to look in our shop 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.650
 and if you are interested have a good one 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.870
 Kontroll racket but that aggressive 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.880
 Game allows a lot of spin generated 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.290
 then check out the wilson pro 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.290
