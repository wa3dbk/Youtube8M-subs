 1993 in a car accident he was born 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.630
 here in the chorrillo one of the neighborhoods 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.119
 poorest and most dangerous city of 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.490

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.420
 where he has many memories of him and 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.210
 this from his bed and here I have his altar 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.100

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.760

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.520
 chorrillo and rest in this cemetery 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.230
 On your gravestone you can read the names 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.330
