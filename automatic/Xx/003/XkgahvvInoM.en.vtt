00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
hours the server can handle up to 80 I'm

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.000 
hours the server can handle up to 80 I'm
not<00:03:30.359> sure<00:03:30.569> if<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.840> will<00:03:31.019> handle<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.620> full<00:03:31.799> 80

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
not sure if it will handle the full 80

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.000 
not sure if it will handle the full 80
very<00:03:32.400> well<00:03:32.840> I'll<00:03:33.840> have<00:03:34.109> to<00:03:34.200> reduce<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.829> if

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
very well I'll have to reduce that if

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.819 
very well I'll have to reduce that if
that's<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.340> case<00:03:35.519> but<00:03:35.790> not<00:03:36.590> hopefully<00:03:37.590> we<00:03:37.709> can

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
that's the case but not hopefully we can

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.319 
that's the case but not hopefully we can
get<00:03:37.950> all<00:03:38.069> these<00:03:38.190> filled<00:03:38.519> out<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:38.880> people<00:03:39.030> can

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
get all these filled out and people can

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.220 
get all these filled out and people can
build<00:03:40.139> i'm<00:03:40.739> thinking<00:03:40.950> maybe<00:03:41.310> maybe<00:03:42.230> once

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
build i'm thinking maybe maybe once

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.930 
build i'm thinking maybe maybe once
we<00:03:43.380> get<00:03:43.500> into<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.829> alpha<00:03:44.130> phase<00:03:44.310> everyone

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
we get into the alpha phase everyone

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.409 
we get into the alpha phase everyone
will<00:03:45.269> basically<00:03:45.810> have<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.200> reapply<00:03:46.709> and

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
will basically have to reapply and

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.420 
will basically have to reapply and
building<00:03:48.419> your<00:03:48.450> spot<00:03:48.959> any<00:03:49.290> something<00:03:50.220> like

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
building your spot any something like

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.990 
building your spot any something like
this<00:03:50.639> some<00:03:51.389> sort<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.660> main<00:03:52.489> clustered<00:03:53.489> area<00:03:53.819> of

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
this some sort of main clustered area of

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.720 
this some sort of main clustered area of
a<00:03:54.120> city<00:03:54.359> I<00:03:54.660> think<00:03:55.590> it's<00:03:56.130> not<00:03:56.280> going<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.489> be<00:03:56.579> as

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
a city I think it's not going to be as

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.270 
a city I think it's not going to be as
square<00:03:57.090> as<00:03:57.120> this<00:03:57.680> basically<00:03:58.680> what<00:03:58.889> we<00:03:58.980> have<00:03:59.130> is

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
square as this basically what we have is

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.900 
square as this basically what we have is
will<00:03:59.459> have<00:03:59.579> a<00:03:59.609> large<00:03:59.880> city<00:04:00.540> with<00:04:01.910> something

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
will have a large city with something

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.220 
will have a large city with something
along<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:03.720> lines<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.079> a<00:04:04.200> castle<00:04:04.470> built<00:04:05.060> a

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
along the lines of a castle built a

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.720 
along the lines of a castle built a
little<00:04:07.230> look<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.560> lot<00:04:07.769> like<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:08.010> mountain<00:04:08.549> maybe

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
little look a lot like a mountain maybe

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.250 
little look a lot like a mountain maybe
we'll<00:04:08.940> build<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.329> into<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.690> mountain<00:04:10.109> or

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
we'll build it into a mountain or

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.960 
we'll build it into a mountain or
something<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:12.470> we'll<00:04:13.470> have<00:04:13.700> basically<00:04:14.700> your

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
something and we'll have basically your

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.509 
something and we'll have basically your
city<00:04:15.269> area<00:04:15.629> basically<00:04:15.959> a<00:04:16.260> one<00:04:16.859> spot<00:04:17.190> will<00:04:17.340> be<00:04:17.489> a

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
city area basically a one spot will be a

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.870 
city area basically a one spot will be a
market<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.209> won't<00:04:18.419> be<00:04:18.650> quite<00:04:19.650> as<00:04:19.769> uh<00:04:22.880> what's

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.100 
keep the economy in here for those who
like<00:06:53.930> it<00:06:54.140> but<00:06:54.890> it<00:06:55.400> can't<00:06:56.360> be<00:06:56.510> economy<00:06:56.990> based

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
like it but it can't be economy based

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.380 
like it but it can't be economy based
