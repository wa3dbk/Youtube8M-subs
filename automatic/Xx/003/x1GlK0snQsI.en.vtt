addiction today we're going to talk
about<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.799> jr<00:00:08.370> 378<00:00:09.300> janeiro<00:00:10.730> lately<00:00:11.730> there's

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
about the jr 378 janeiro lately there's

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.289 
about the jr 378 janeiro lately there's
been<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.120> lot<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.330> chatter<00:00:13.290> about<00:00:14.059> why<00:00:15.059> do<00:00:15.120> I

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
been a lot of chatter about why do I

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.630 
been a lot of chatter about why do I
want<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.570> use<00:00:15.750> one<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.500> cheating<00:00:17.070> blah<00:00:17.430> blah

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
want to use one is a cheating blah blah

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.420 
want to use one is a cheating blah blah
blah<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.420> let's<00:00:18.660> put<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.560> rest<00:00:19.710> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
blah so let's put that to rest the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.670 
blah so let's put that to rest the
reason<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.820> want<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.090> use<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> gyro<00:00:21.750> these<00:00:22.350> days

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
reason you want to use a gyro these days

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.330 
reason you want to use a gyro these days
is<00:00:23.990> makes<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.109> small<00:00:25.350> airplane<00:00:25.680> feel<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.189> it's

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
is makes a small airplane feel like it's

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.980 
is makes a small airplane feel like it's
a<00:00:26.369> big<00:00:26.550> airplane<00:00:27.199> basically<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:29.189> adds<00:00:29.990> inertia

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
a big airplane basically it adds inertia

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.740 
a big airplane basically it adds inertia
so<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> airplane<00:00:31.859> stays<00:00:32.850> where<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.239> left<00:00:33.450> it

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
so the airplane stays where you left it

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
so the airplane stays where you left it
but<00:00:34.140> when<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.440> want<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.920> roll<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:36.770> more

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
but when you want it to roll it's a more

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.889 
but when you want it to roll it's a more
responsive<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.700> then<00:00:38.879> stops<00:00:39.420> when<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.690> want

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
responsive and then stops when you want

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.840 
responsive and then stops when you want
it<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.079> stop<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.920> makes<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> airplane<00:00:41.550> fly

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
it to stop just makes the airplane fly

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.470 
it to stop just makes the airplane fly

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
taking advantage of it I like it on

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
elevator is not necessary so let's get

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.270 
elevator is not necessary so let's get
into<00:01:08.880> what<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.080> box<00:01:10.380> there<00:01:11.250> are

into what you get in this box there are
about<00:01:11.520> 165<00:01:12.510> bucks<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:16.070> you<00:01:17.070> got<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
about 165 bucks so you got the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.630 
about 165 bucks so you got the
instruction<00:01:17.850> manual<00:01:18.950> some<00:01:19.950> double-sided

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640

foam<00:01:21.210> tape<00:01:21.570> I've<00:01:21.810> already<00:01:21.990> use<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> square<00:01:22.650> of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
foam tape I've already use the square of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.679 
foam tape I've already use the square of
it<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.880> got<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.350> adjuster<00:01:25.350> tool<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
it you got the adjuster tool and the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.530 
it you got the adjuster tool and the
gyro<00:01:27.960> itself

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.780 

so<00:01:31.540> let's<00:01:31.750> talk<00:01:31.900> about<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.950> controls<00:01:33.369> on<00:01:33.610> the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
so let's talk about the controls on the

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.020 
so let's talk about the controls on the
face<00:01:33.970> of<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.210> gyro<00:01:34.710> we've<00:01:35.710> got<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.159> deadband

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
face of the gyro we've got the deadband

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.870 
face of the gyro we've got the deadband
switch<00:01:37.450> one<00:01:38.380> selection<00:01:38.740> is<00:01:39.010> low<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.460> other<00:01:39.670> is

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
switch one selection is low the other is

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.300 
switch one selection is low the other is
zero<00:01:40.210> what<00:01:40.960> you<00:01:41.050> want<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.350> do<00:01:41.470> with<00:01:41.680> deadband

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
zero what you want to do with deadband

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.999 
zero what you want to do with deadband
is<00:01:42.400> decide<00:01:43.060> if<00:01:43.509> you're<00:01:43.720> using<00:01:43.930> an<00:01:44.259> old<00:01:44.470> analog

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
is decide if you're using an old analog

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.399 
is decide if you're using an old analog
servo<00:01:45.430> if<00:01:45.880> that's<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.390> case<00:01:46.540> you<00:01:46.990> want<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.259> use

with<00:02:22.150> left<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:23.500> if<00:02:23.830> it's<00:02:24.360> not<00:02:25.360> correcting

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
with left so if it's not correcting

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.610 
with left so if it's not correcting
properly<00:02:26.980> we'll<00:02:27.370> flip<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.760> switch<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
properly we'll flip that switch on the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.380 
properly we'll flip that switch on the
next<00:02:29.860> video<00:02:30.100> we'll<00:02:30.370> go<00:02:30.550> over<00:02:30.730> the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
next video we'll go over the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.710 
next video we'll go over the
installation<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.260> setup<00:02:32.470> of<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.430> gyro<00:02:33.819> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
installation and setup of the gyro the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.770 
installation and setup of the gyro the
last<00:02:35.500> feature<00:02:35.799> is<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.700> travel<00:02:37.269> adjustment

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
last feature is the travel adjustment

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.970 
last feature is the travel adjustment
knob<00:02:38.019> and<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:39.750> basically<00:02:40.750> sets<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.320> maximum

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
knob and that basically sets the maximum

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.759 
knob and that basically sets the maximum
allowable<00:02:42.400> deflection<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:43.630> your<00:02:44.079> aileron<00:02:44.530> or

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
allowable deflection of your aileron or

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.009 
allowable deflection of your aileron or
rudder<00:02:45.100> or<00:02:45.430> whatever<00:02:46.150> control<00:02:46.540> surface<00:02:46.900> you

rudder or whatever control surface you

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.720 
rudder or whatever control surface you
put<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.440> toolkit<00:02:51.040> they<00:02:51.340> provide

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
put it on so in the toolkit they provide

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.420 
put it on so in the toolkit they provide
this<00:02:52.329> little<00:02:52.630> wrench<00:02:52.870> you'll<00:02:53.650> see<00:02:53.890> on<00:02:54.040> one<00:02:54.220> end

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
this little wrench you'll see on one end

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.020 
this little wrench you'll see on one end
it<00:02:54.549> has<00:02:54.579> a<00:02:54.730> star<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:56.079> the<00:02:56.680> other<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.280> flat<00:02:57.640> on

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
it has a star and the other is a flat on

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.180 
it has a star and the other is a flat on
the<00:02:59.700> 370<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.730> gyro<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.390> star<00:03:01.989> is<00:03:02.260> completely

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
the 370 a gyro the star is completely

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.920 
the 370 a gyro the star is completely
useless<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:04.239> will<00:03:04.390> not<00:03:04.570> fit<00:03:04.840> into<00:03:04.989> that<00:03:05.280> that

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
useless it will not fit into that that

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.500 
useless it will not fit into that that
screwdriver<00:03:07.930> slot<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:09.130> what<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.180> have<00:03:10.299> to<00:03:10.480> use

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
screwdriver slot so what you have to use

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.770 
screwdriver slot so what you have to use
is<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.680> screw<00:03:12.190> driver<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.760> you'll<00:03:13.510> notice

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
is the screw driver and you'll notice

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.259 
is the screw driver and you'll notice
that<00:03:14.709> if<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.579> looked<00:03:15.820> in<00:03:15.940> there<00:03:16.120> with<00:03:16.239> a

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
that if you looked in there with a

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.680 
that if you looked in there with a
magnifier<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.769> will<00:03:17.950> only<00:03:18.160> fit<00:03:18.459> in<00:03:18.609> to<00:03:19.060> one<00:03:19.450> of

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
magnifier it will only fit in to one of

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.310 
magnifier it will only fit in to one of
the<00:03:20.140> crosshairs<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:22.180> I've<00:03:22.329> got<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.690> inserted<00:03:23.109> I

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
the crosshairs so I've got it inserted I

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.979 
the crosshairs so I've got it inserted I
can<00:03:23.470> feel<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.829> pot<00:03:24.010> turning<00:03:24.459> if<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.239> turn<00:03:25.450> it<00:03:25.600> 90

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
can feel the pot turning if I turn it 90

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.190 
can feel the pot turning if I turn it 90
it<00:03:26.799> won't<00:03:27.040> won't<00:03:27.459> engage<00:03:27.579> so<00:03:28.510> you<00:03:28.570> got<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.140> be

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
it won't won't engage so you got to be

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.319 
it won't won't engage so you got to be
careful<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.709> you're<00:03:29.890> actually<00:03:30.549> locked<00:03:31.120> in

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
careful that you're actually locked in

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.640 
careful that you're actually locked in
so<00:03:31.660> you<00:03:31.720> can<00:03:31.900> feel<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.230> little<00:03:32.410> tension<00:03:34.650> this

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
so you can feel a little tension this

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.430 
so you can feel a little tension this
tool<00:03:36.100> can<00:03:36.370> be<00:03:36.400> used<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.850> flip<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.239> little<00:03:37.440> dip

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
tool can be used to flip the little dip

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.720 
tool can be used to flip the little dip
switches<00:03:38.739> there<00:03:39.130> that's<00:03:39.790> pretty<00:03:40.180> simple

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.300 

to<00:03:43.730> mount<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:44.030> gyro<00:03:44.330> we<00:03:44.900> use<00:03:45.080> the<00:03:45.410> double-sided

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
to mount a gyro we use the double-sided

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.450 
to mount a gyro we use the double-sided
white<00:03:47.060> foam<00:03:47.360> tape<00:03:47.950> so<00:03:48.950> you'd<00:03:49.100> cut<00:03:49.310> out<00:03:49.430> a

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.460 
white foam tape so you'd cut out a

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.850 
white foam tape so you'd cut out a
square<00:03:49.960> as<00:03:50.960> you<00:03:51.080> can<00:03:51.200> see<00:03:51.380> I<00:03:51.410> did<00:03:51.680> that

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
square as you can see I did that

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.340 
square as you can see I did that
previously<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:53.480> just<00:03:53.510> make<00:03:53.900> sure<00:03:54.050> the<00:03:54.170> back

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
previously and just make sure the back

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.760 
previously and just make sure the back
side<00:03:54.620> is<00:03:54.860> clean<00:03:55.400> use<00:03:55.880> alcohol<00:03:56.330> or<00:03:56.360> acetone

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
side is clean use alcohol or acetone

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.680 
side is clean use alcohol or acetone
make<00:03:57.770> sure<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.040> dries<00:03:58.280> out<00:03:58.490> and<00:03:58.820> then<00:03:59.450> whatever

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
make sure it dries out and then whatever

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.470 
make sure it dries out and then whatever
surface<00:04:00.050> you're<00:04:00.380> sticking<00:04:00.740> to<00:04:01.150> just<00:04:02.150> push<00:04:02.330> it

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
surface you're sticking to just push it

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.200 
surface you're sticking to just push it
down<00:04:02.630> firmly<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.700> give<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:04.820> little<00:04:04.910> tug

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
down firmly and give it a little tug

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.400 
down firmly and give it a little tug
twist<00:04:06.140> it<00:04:06.350> make<00:04:06.560> sure<00:04:06.590> it's<00:04:06.890> not<00:04:07.010> coming<00:04:07.280> off<00:04:07.520> a

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
twist it make sure it's not coming off a

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.440 
twist it make sure it's not coming off a
good<00:04:09.410> rule<00:04:09.620> of<00:04:09.650> thumb<00:04:09.770> is<00:04:10.130> to<00:04:10.580> have<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.790> loop<00:04:11.270> of

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
good rule of thumb is to have a loop of

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.650 
good rule of thumb is to have a loop of
velcro<00:04:11.830> go<00:04:12.830> over<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.130> face<00:04:13.340> of<00:04:13.550> it<00:04:13.670> through

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
velcro go over the face of it through

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.290 
velcro go over the face of it through
your<00:04:14.840> board<00:04:15.110> you<00:04:15.950> could<00:04:16.100> use<00:04:16.250> a<00:04:16.280> velcro<00:04:16.940> zip

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.300 
your board you could use a velcro zip

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.860 
your board you could use a velcro zip
tie<00:04:17.510> but<00:04:18.230> I<00:04:18.470> advise<00:04:18.920> you<00:04:19.130> to<00:04:19.550> make<00:04:20.450> sure<00:04:20.510> the

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
tie but I advise you to make sure the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.010 
tie but I advise you to make sure the
gyro<00:04:21.170> can't<00:04:21.470> come<00:04:21.680> loose<00:04:22.480> if<00:04:23.480> it<00:04:23.630> does<00:04:23.810> come

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
gyro can't come loose if it does come

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.040 
gyro can't come loose if it does come
loose<00:04:24.230> the<00:04:25.190> airplane<00:04:25.610> will<00:04:25.760> be<00:04:26.050> virtually

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
loose the airplane will be virtually

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.370 
loose the airplane will be virtually
uncontrollable<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:29.030> let's<00:04:29.390> talk<00:04:29.630> about<00:04:29.810> the

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
uncontrollable so let's talk about the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.890 
uncontrollable so let's talk about the
electrical<00:04:31.130> hookups<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:32.360> got<00:04:32.510> this<00:04:32.660> one

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
electrical hookups you got this one

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.370 
electrical hookups you got this one
connector<00:04:33.380> that<00:04:33.500> is<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.680> junior<00:04:34.520> female<00:04:35.060> and

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
connector that is a junior female and

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.190 
connector that is a junior female and
then<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.830> longer<00:04:37.190> wire<00:04:37.370> has<00:04:38.090> two<00:04:38.390> wires<00:04:38.630> on<00:04:38.930> it

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
then the longer wire has two wires on it

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.560 
then the longer wire has two wires on it
they're<00:04:39.620> both<00:04:39.800> junior<00:04:40.190> males<00:04:40.490> one<00:04:41.000> black<00:04:41.270> one

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
they're both junior males one black one

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.320 
they're both junior males one black one
white<00:04:41.780> notice<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.830> white<00:04:43.070> one<00:04:43.310> only<00:04:43.850> has<00:04:44.090> one

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
white notice the white one only has one

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.050 
white notice the white one only has one
wire<00:04:44.600> and<00:04:44.870> it's<00:04:45.380> on<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.680> signal<00:04:46.100> side<00:04:46.730> of<00:04:46.970> the

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
wire and it's on the signal side of the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.450 
wire and it's on the signal side of the
connector<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:48.380> other<00:04:48.530> connector<00:04:49.010> has<00:04:49.220> the

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
connector the other connector has the

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.060 
connector the other connector has the
standard<00:04:49.820> three<00:04:50.060> wires<00:04:50.270> orange<00:04:51.260> red<00:04:51.860> and

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
standard three wires orange red and

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.990 
standard three wires orange red and
brown<00:04:52.520> and<00:04:54.760> the<00:04:55.780> black<00:04:56.780> one<00:04:57.020> here<00:04:57.820> three<00:04:58.820> wire

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
brown and the black one here three wire

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.970 
brown and the black one here three wire
on<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.450> long<00:04:59.630> lead<00:05:00.020> is<00:05:00.260> what<00:05:00.800> you<00:05:00.890> would

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
on the long lead is what you would

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.910 
on the long lead is what you would
connect<00:05:01.400> to<00:05:01.610> your<00:05:01.940> baler<00:05:02.840> on<00:05:02.990> channel<00:05:03.410> or<00:05:03.650> your

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
connect to your baler on channel or your

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.830 
connect to your baler on channel or your
rudder<00:05:04.160> channel<00:05:04.610> or<00:05:04.820> your<00:05:04.940> elevator<00:05:05.390> channel

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
rudder channel or your elevator channel

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.460 
rudder channel or your elevator channel
so<00:05:06.770> this<00:05:06.920> is<00:05:07.130> what<00:05:07.400> would<00:05:08.330> normally<00:05:08.690> be<00:05:09.050> going

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
so this is what would normally be going

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.120 
so this is what would normally be going
to<00:05:09.680> your<00:05:09.800> control<00:05:10.220> surface<00:05:11.290> the<00:05:12.290> white<00:05:12.500> one<00:05:12.740> is

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
to your control surface the white one is

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.460 
to your control surface the white one is
what<00:05:13.400> we<00:05:13.430> refer<00:05:13.910> to<00:05:14.120> as<00:05:14.420> the<00:05:14.450> gain<00:05:14.840> channel

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
what we refer to as the gain channel

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.630 
what we refer to as the gain channel
what<00:05:16.130> gain<00:05:16.430> is<00:05:16.700> is<00:05:17.050> the<00:05:18.050> I<00:05:18.410> guess<00:05:18.920> the<00:05:18.950> factor

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
what gain is is the I guess the factor

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.450 
what gain is is the I guess the factor
of<00:05:20.350> Correction

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
of Correction

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.960 
of Correction
it's<00:05:22.940> a<00:05:23.090> proportional<00:05:23.780> so<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:25.280> more<00:05:25.550> gain<00:05:25.790> you

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
it's a proportional so the more gain you

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.410 
it's a proportional so the more gain you
have<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.630> more<00:05:26.840> correction<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:28.550> aileron<00:05:29.240> or

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
have the more correction the aileron or

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.890 
have the more correction the aileron or
rudder<00:05:29.600> will<00:05:30.400> will<00:05:31.400> give<00:05:31.670> for<00:05:32.480> the<00:05:32.510> given

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
rudder will will give for the given

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.330 
rudder will will give for the given
error<00:05:33.710> at<00:05:34.340> the<00:05:34.490> gyro<00:05:34.730> senses<00:05:35.270> so<00:05:36.110> if<00:05:36.350> the

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
error at the gyro senses so if the

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.100 
error at the gyro senses so if the
airplane<00:05:37.820> Wiggles<00:05:38.390> in<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:39.080> Y<00:05:39.850> direction<00:05:41.110> the

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
airplane Wiggles in the Y direction the

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.720 
airplane Wiggles in the Y direction the
rudder<00:05:42.770> will<00:05:43.190> wiggle<00:05:44.000> opposite

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
rudder will wiggle opposite

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.920 
rudder will wiggle opposite
proportionate<00:05:46.730> to<00:05:46.910> the<00:05:47.270> amount<00:05:47.300> of<00:05:47.570> gain<00:05:47.750> you

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
proportionate to the amount of gain you

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.740 
proportionate to the amount of gain you
have<00:05:48.110> so<00:05:48.740> a<00:05:48.770> strong<00:05:49.670> wiggle<00:05:50.090> would<00:05:50.600> be<00:05:50.720> a

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
have so a strong wiggle would be a

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.820 
have so a strong wiggle would be a
strong<00:05:51.110> correction

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
strong correction

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.969 
strong correction
so<00:05:52.510> the<00:05:53.510> gain<00:05:53.780> needs<00:05:54.229> to<00:05:54.380> be<00:05:54.470> on<00:05:54.620> its<00:05:54.800> own

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
so the gain needs to be on its own

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.309 
so the gain needs to be on its own
channel

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
channel

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:00.080 
channel
you<00:05:58.319> can<00:05:58.470> set<00:05:58.650> it<00:05:58.740> up<00:05:58.800> on<00:05:58.919> a<00:05:58.979> knob<00:05:59.280> you<00:05:59.699> can<00:05:59.849> set

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
you can set it up on a knob you can set

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.029 
you can set it up on a knob you can set
it<00:06:00.210> up<00:06:00.330> on<00:06:00.870> a<00:06:00.960> switch

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
it up on a switch

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.460 
it up on a switch
there's<00:06:02.460> many<00:06:02.849> ways<00:06:02.940> you<00:06:03.150> can<00:06:03.240> do<00:06:03.479> it<00:06:03.509> but<00:06:04.349> it

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
there's many ways you can do it but it

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.650 
there's many ways you can do it but it
must<00:06:04.620> be<00:06:04.830> connected<00:06:05.130> to<00:06:05.340> the<00:06:05.490> receiver<00:06:05.699> to<00:06:06.479> its

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
must be connected to the receiver to its

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.120 
must be connected to the receiver to its
own<00:06:06.840> channel<00:06:07.880> so<00:06:08.880> we've<00:06:09.180> got<00:06:09.360> the<00:06:10.130> surface

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
own channel so we've got the surface

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.999 
own channel so we've got the surface
coming<00:06:11.699> in<00:06:11.940> from<00:06:12.360> the<00:06:12.479> receiver<00:06:13.009> going

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009 
coming in from the receiver going

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:16.700 
coming in from the receiver going
through<00:06:14.280> the<00:06:14.370> gyro<00:06:14.639> and<00:06:15.289> coming<00:06:16.289> out<00:06:16.410> this

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
through the gyro and coming out this

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.409 
through the gyro and coming out this
connector<00:06:17.130> here<00:06:17.310> so<00:06:17.819> this<00:06:18.000> is<00:06:18.150> what<00:06:18.300> you'd

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
connector here so this is what you'd

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.170 
connector here so this is what you'd
plug<00:06:18.630> your<00:06:18.780> ailerons<00:06:19.259> or<00:06:20.160> your<00:06:20.370> rudder<00:06:20.580> into

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
plug your ailerons or your rudder into

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.860 
plug your ailerons or your rudder into
if<00:06:22.169> you're<00:06:22.710> using<00:06:22.889> ailerons<00:06:23.460> I<00:06:23.870> recommend

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
if you're using ailerons I recommend

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.339 
if you're using ailerons I recommend
using<00:06:25.289> a<00:06:25.530> Wye<00:06:25.770> lead<00:06:26.039> or<00:06:26.550> a<00:06:26.610> match<00:06:27.330> box<00:06:27.599> after

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
using a Wye lead or a match box after

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:30.680 
using a Wye lead or a match box after
this<00:06:28.560> the<00:06:29.520> reason<00:06:29.669> to<00:06:29.849> use<00:06:29.909> a<00:06:30.000> match<00:06:30.240> box

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
this the reason to use a match box

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.230 
this the reason to use a match box
is<00:06:30.840> so<00:06:31.020> you<00:06:31.110> could<00:06:31.759> set<00:06:32.759> your<00:06:32.789> travel

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
is so you could set your travel

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.540 
is so you could set your travel
adjustment<00:06:33.750> for<00:06:34.229> differential<00:06:34.830> if<00:06:35.340> your

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
adjustment for differential if your

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.480 
adjustment for differential if your
airplane<00:06:35.819> requires<00:06:36.150> it<00:06:36.710> but<00:06:37.710> a<00:06:37.889> simple<00:06:38.340> white

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
airplane requires it but a simple white

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.909 
airplane requires it but a simple white
harness<00:06:38.819> is<00:06:38.940> all<00:06:39.060> you<00:06:39.180> need

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
harness is all you need

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.980 
harness is all you need
all<00:06:40.919> right<00:06:41.099> so<00:06:41.340> today<00:06:41.699> we<00:06:41.880> covered<00:06:42.240> the<00:06:42.780> basics

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
all right so today we covered the basics

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.260 
all right so today we covered the basics
of<00:06:43.680> what<00:06:44.220> you<00:06:44.250> get<00:06:44.550> when<00:06:44.729> you<00:06:44.819> open<00:06:44.849> your

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
of what you get when you open your

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.640 
of what you get when you open your

brand-new jr. 370 gyro the next video

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.740 
brand-new jr. 370 gyro the next video
will<00:06:49.889> discuss<00:06:50.280> proper<00:06:50.639> installation<00:06:51.090> and

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
will discuss proper installation and

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.320 
will discuss proper installation and
start<00:06:52.289> going<00:06:52.530> over<00:06:52.909> programming<00:06:53.909> techniques

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
start going over programming techniques

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.439 
start going over programming techniques
we're<00:06:54.870> gonna<00:06:54.990> cover<00:06:55.880> eventually<00:06:56.880> in<00:06:57.120> the<00:06:57.270> long

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.570 
priori or constant gain lately most of

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.749 
priori or constant gain lately most of
us<00:07:03.719> are<00:07:03.870> going<00:07:03.960> to<00:07:04.289> using<00:07:05.039> stick<00:07:05.310> priority

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 
us are going to using stick priority

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.070 
us are going to using stick priority
which<00:07:05.909> is<00:07:05.940> just<00:07:06.240> a<00:07:06.330> little<00:07:06.599> more<00:07:06.719> complicated

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 
which is just a little more complicated

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.760 
which is just a little more complicated
but<00:07:07.590> gives<00:07:08.340> the<00:07:08.490> airplane<00:07:08.849> a<00:07:09.150> very<00:07:09.770> natural

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
but gives the airplane a very natural

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.399 
but gives the airplane a very natural
feel<00:07:11.039> it<00:07:11.669> can<00:07:12.060> almost<00:07:12.210> not<00:07:12.810> even<00:07:13.050> tell<00:07:13.229> there's

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:13.409 
feel it can almost not even tell there's

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:18.800 
feel it can almost not even tell there's
a<00:07:13.500> gyro<00:07:15.590> we'll<00:07:16.590> go<00:07:16.800> over<00:07:17.210> proper<00:07:18.210> technique

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
a gyro we'll go over proper technique

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.379 
a gyro we'll go over proper technique
how<00:07:19.050> to<00:07:19.110> dial<00:07:19.949> it<00:07:20.159> in<00:07:20.310> so<00:07:20.909> that<00:07:21.060> you're<00:07:21.210> not

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:21.389 
how to dial it in so that you're not

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:23.959 
how to dial it in so that you're not
using<00:07:22.229> too<00:07:22.530> much<00:07:22.650> gain<00:07:23.009> if<00:07:23.430> you're<00:07:23.580> using<00:07:23.729> too

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:23.969 
using too much gain if you're using too

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:26.420 
using too much gain if you're using too
much<00:07:24.060> gain<00:07:24.360> it's<00:07:24.659> very<00:07:24.840> noticeable<00:07:25.139> and<00:07:25.919> if

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430 
much gain it's very noticeable and if

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.010 
much gain it's very noticeable and if
you're<00:07:26.610> using<00:07:26.789> an<00:07:26.969> extreme<00:07:27.479> amount<00:07:27.719> of<00:07:27.840> gain

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
you're using an extreme amount of gain

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.290 
you're using an extreme amount of gain
it<00:07:28.380> could<00:07:28.440> be<00:07:28.770> dangerous<00:07:29.460> for<00:07:29.849> the<00:07:29.940> airplane

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.300 
it could be dangerous for the airplane

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.990 
it could be dangerous for the airplane
you'll<00:07:31.169> get<00:07:31.349> into<00:07:31.469> that<00:07:31.680> nasty<00:07:32.310> oscillation

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 
you'll get into that nasty oscillation

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.080 
you'll get into that nasty oscillation
which<00:07:33.960> could<00:07:34.259> damage<00:07:35.069> the<00:07:35.340> airplane<00:07:35.729> or<00:07:35.909> just

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.090 
which could damage the airplane or just

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.520 
which could damage the airplane or just
scare<00:07:36.870> you<00:07:37.190> so<00:07:38.190> we'll<00:07:38.639> start<00:07:38.940> with

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:39.530 
scare you so we'll start with

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.159 
scare you so we'll start with
programming<00:07:40.530> in<00:07:40.620> the<00:07:40.710> next<00:07:40.919> video
