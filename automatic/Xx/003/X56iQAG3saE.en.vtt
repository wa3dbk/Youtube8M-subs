00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
tend to hit down pits all the time so it

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.840 
tend to hit down pits all the time so it
makes<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.010> avoid<00:00:29.310> those<00:00:30.349> and<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:32.040> Mambo<00:00:32.489> just

like<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.149> cha-cha<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.250> songho<00:00:35.250> some

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
like the cha-cha just like songho some

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.209 
like the cha-cha just like songho some
of<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> other<00:00:35.730> ones<00:00:35.969> you're<00:00:36.750> going<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.989> be

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
of the other ones you're going to be

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.459 
of the other ones you're going to be
basically<00:00:38.219> compensating<00:00:38.969> for<00:00:39.210> three<00:00:40.200> or<00:00:40.290> four

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
basically compensating for three or four

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.440 
basically compensating for three or four
missing<00:00:40.800> percussions<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.969> each<00:00:42.120> one<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.300> your

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
missing percussions so each one of your

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.880 
missing percussions so each one of your
limb<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> be<00:00:43.170> doing<00:00:43.379> something

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
limb is going to be doing something

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.869 
limb is going to be doing something
different<00:00:45.170> first<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.280> fast<00:00:47.550> four

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
different first of all it's a fast four

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.819 
different first of all it's a fast four
so<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> go<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.780> two<00:00:49.079> three<00:00:49.110> four

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
so it's going to go one two three four

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.040 
so it's going to go one two three four
one<00:00:50.129> two<00:00:50.489> three<00:00:50.520> four<00:00:51.300> okay

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
one two three four okay

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.319 
one two three four okay
let's<00:00:52.500> kick<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> bass<00:00:53.789> drum<00:00:53.820> first

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
let's kick get with the bass drum first

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.600 
let's kick get with the bass drum first
it's<00:00:54.510> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.870> acting<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.280> Tamayo

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
it's going to be acting to the Tamayo

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.459 
it's going to be acting to the Tamayo
pattern<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> ends<00:00:58.320> of

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
pattern so it's going to be the ends of

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.920 
pattern so it's going to be the ends of
twos<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.820> do<00:01:00.090> there's<00:01:00.719> all

twos for this you can do there's all

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.180 
twos for this you can do there's all
kinds<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.230> variations<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:01.859> do<00:01:02.039> before

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
kinds of variations you can do before

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.799 
kinds of variations you can do before

little bit strange the accents are going
to<00:03:39.040> go<00:03:39.220> 1<00:03:40.060> 2<00:03:40.359> and<00:03:40.989> so<00:03:41.440> accenting<00:03:41.859> one<00:03:42.130> Xing<00:03:42.519> at

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
to go 1 2 and so accenting one Xing at

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.800 
to go 1 2 and so accenting one Xing at
the<00:03:42.730> end<00:03:42.910> of<00:03:43.209> 2<00:03:43.420> 1<00:03:43.660> 2<00:03:44.620> &amp;<00:03:44.889> 3<00:03:45.100> &amp;<00:03:45.400> 4<00:03:45.510> exiting<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.630> end

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
the end of 2 1 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 exiting the end

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.920 
the end of 2 1 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 exiting the end
of<00:03:47.079> 3<00:03:47.410> then<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.459> end<00:03:48.639> of<00:03:48.850> 4<00:03:49.060> is<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.180> non<00:03:49.420> accent

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
of 3 then the end of 4 is a non accent

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.430 
of 3 then the end of 4 is a non accent
so<00:03:50.109> 1<00:03:50.470> 2<00:03:50.950> &amp;<00:03:51.220> 3<00:03:51.459> &amp;<00:03:51.760> 4<00:03:51.850> M<00:03:52.480> it's<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.170> grace<00:03:53.410> note

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
so 1 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 M it's a grace note

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.819 
so 1 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 M it's a grace note
leading<00:03:53.950> up<00:03:54.160> to<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:55.450> 1<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.109> 2<00:03:56.139> which<00:03:56.620> is

together the cool thing about this is

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:55.019 
together the cool thing about this is
nothing<00:04:52.629> in<00:04:52.779> these<00:04:53.199> hands<00:04:53.909> hits<00:04:54.909> a

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:55.029 
nothing in these hands hits a

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:56.789 
nothing in these hands hits a
subdivision<00:04:55.599> that<00:04:55.719> this<00:04:55.959> really<00:04:56.289> doesn't<00:04:56.619> hit

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:56.799 
subdivision that this really doesn't hit

00:04:56.799 --> 00:04:59.009 
subdivision that this really doesn't hit
okay<00:04:57.459> so<00:04:57.879> we're<00:04:58.059> also<00:04:58.239> dividing<00:04:58.779> off<00:04:58.869> at

00:04:59.009 --> 00:04:59.019 
okay so we're also dividing off at

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:00.989 
okay so we're also dividing off at
eighth<00:04:59.199> notes<00:04:59.499> at<00:04:59.679> a<00:04:59.709> fast<00:05:00.129> tip<00:05:00.429> let's<00:05:00.759> get<00:05:00.909> all
