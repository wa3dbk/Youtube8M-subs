a<00:00:12.139> flying<00:00:12.559> change<00:00:12.980> is<00:00:13.280> when<00:00:13.490> the<00:00:13.639> horse

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
a flying change is when the horse

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.000 
a flying change is when the horse
changes<00:00:14.570> from<00:00:14.809> left<00:00:15.110> to<00:00:15.230> right<00:00:15.500> canter

a circle incline back to the track and
we<00:00:47.540> move<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:47.960> horse<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:48.320> little<00:00:48.530> bit<00:00:48.680> over<00:00:49.040> to

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
we move the horse a little bit over to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.600 
we move the horse a little bit over to
the<00:00:49.370> new<00:00:49.610> outer<00:00:49.880> side<00:00:50.210> with<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.630> inner<00:00:50.870> leg

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
the new outer side with the inner leg

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.770 
the new outer side with the inner leg
and<00:00:53.830> right<00:00:54.830> before<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:55.370> corner<00:00:55.760> we<00:00:56.300> move<00:00:56.570> the

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
and right before the corner we move the

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.720 
and right before the corner we move the
inner<00:00:56.960> leg<00:00:57.230> forward<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:57.740> pressure<00:00:58.340> a<00:00:58.490> little

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
inner leg forward and pressure a little

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.840 
inner leg forward and pressure a little
bit<00:00:58.850> with<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.150> outer<00:00:59.329> leg<00:01:00.340> clearly<00:01:01.340> it<00:01:01.520> sounds

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
bit with the outer leg clearly it sounds

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.970 
bit with the outer leg clearly it sounds
very<00:01:01.970> easy<00:01:02.090> but<00:01:02.780> of<00:01:02.900> course<00:01:03.170> it<00:01:03.410> is<00:01:03.590> not<00:01:03.770> that

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
very easy but of course it is not that

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.200 
very easy but of course it is not that
easy<00:01:05.799> when<00:01:06.799> we<00:01:07.009> want<00:01:07.220> to<00:01:07.369> perform<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:07.909> flying

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
easy when we want to perform a flying

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.499 
easy when we want to perform a flying
change<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:09.170> sometimes<00:01:09.799> occurs<00:01:10.220> that<00:01:10.610> when<00:01:11.390> you

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
change it sometimes occurs that when you

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.359 
change it sometimes occurs that when you
move<00:01:11.720> your<00:01:11.899> inner<00:01:12.079> leg<00:01:12.380> forward<00:01:12.890> nothing

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
move your inner leg forward nothing

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.690 
move your inner leg forward nothing
happens<00:01:14.560> then<00:01:15.560> you<00:01:15.740> have<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:16.039> exaggerate<00:01:16.399> a

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
happens then you have to exaggerate a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.669 
happens then you have to exaggerate a
little<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.270> make<00:01:17.539> an<00:01:17.689> extra<00:01:18.020> pressure<00:01:18.380> with

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
little and make an extra pressure with

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.950 
little and make an extra pressure with
your<00:01:18.710> outer<00:01:19.039> leg<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.030> that<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.299> horse<00:01:20.539> makes

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
your outer leg so that the horse makes

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.599 
your outer leg so that the horse makes
the<00:01:21.200> change<00:01:23.590> many<00:01:24.590> times<00:01:24.889> in<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.189> beginning

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:25.609 
the change many times in the beginning

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:27.099 
the change many times in the beginning
you<00:01:25.729> might<00:01:25.909> experience<00:01:26.539> that<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.899> horse

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
you might experience that the horse

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:30.039 
you might experience that the horse
jumps<00:01:27.409> to<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.740> side<00:01:27.979> instead<00:01:28.929> when<00:01:29.929> we

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
jumps to the side instead when we

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.289 
jumps to the side instead when we
practice<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.710> flying<00:01:30.979> change<00:01:31.399> we<00:01:31.969> often

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
practice the flying change we often

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.300 
practice the flying change we often
think<00:01:32.479> about<00:01:32.780> making<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:33.229> hind<00:01:33.649> legs<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:34.100> the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
think about making the hind legs of the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.749 
think about making the hind legs of the
horse<00:01:34.520> change<00:01:35.889> if<00:01:36.889> for<00:01:37.249> instance<00:01:37.340> you

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
horse change if for instance you

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.609 
horse change if for instance you
collapse<00:01:38.149> a<00:01:38.299> little<00:01:38.389> bit<00:01:38.719> and<00:01:38.959> focus<00:01:39.289> on

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
collapse a little bit and focus on

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.289 
collapse a little bit and focus on
making<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:40.069> horse<00:01:40.280> change<00:01:40.759> lead<00:01:40.999> with<00:01:41.209> the

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
making the horse change lead with the

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.809 
making the horse change lead with the
front<00:01:41.569> leg<00:01:41.749> it<00:01:42.229> might<00:01:42.829> happen<00:01:43.069> that<00:01:43.429> in<00:01:43.700> the

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
front leg it might happen that in the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.340 
front leg it might happen that in the
beginning<00:01:43.969> that<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.569> hind<00:01:44.810> legs<00:01:45.049> don't

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
beginning that the hind legs don't

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.230 
beginning that the hind legs don't
change<00:01:45.679> and<00:01:45.950> this<00:01:46.310> way<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.700> horse<00:01:46.939> might

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
change and this way the horse might

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:56.529 
change and this way the horse might
learn<00:01:47.509> to<00:01:48.139> make<00:01:48.319> unclean<00:01:48.859> flying<00:01:49.219> changes<00:01:55.539> if

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
learn to make unclean flying changes if

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.749 
learn to make unclean flying changes if
the<00:01:56.869> horse<00:01:57.079> finds<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.590> unnatural<00:01:58.249> to<00:01:58.429> make<00:01:58.609> the

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
the horse finds it unnatural to make the

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.699 
the horse finds it unnatural to make the
flying<00:01:59.029> change<00:01:59.420> from<00:01:59.689> a<00:01:59.810> counter<00:02:00.200> canter<00:02:00.560> at

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
flying change from a counter canter at

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.550 
flying change from a counter canter at
the<00:02:00.859> long<00:02:01.039> side<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.939> can<00:02:02.119> make<00:02:02.329> a<00:02:02.359> type<00:02:02.719> of<00:02:02.990> of

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
the long side you can make a type of of

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.819 
the long side you can make a type of of
leg<00:02:03.950> you've<00:02:04.249> crossing<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.359> school<00:02:05.689> and<00:02:05.990> then

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
leg you've crossing the school and then

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.510 
leg you've crossing the school and then
when<00:02:07.579> you<00:02:07.700> want<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:08.030> make<00:02:08.240> the<00:02:08.420> flying<00:02:08.690> change

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
when you want to make the flying change

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.220 
when you want to make the flying change
you<00:02:10.520> give<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.880> aid<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.090> little<00:02:11.569> faster<00:02:12.050> and

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
you give the aid a little faster and

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.870 
you give the aid a little faster and
then<00:02:12.530> ride<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.800> little<00:02:12.950> bit<00:02:13.099> in<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.490> opposite

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
then ride a little bit in the opposite

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.870 
then ride a little bit in the opposite
direction<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:14.800> you<00:02:15.800> ride<00:02:16.100> with<00:02:16.310> your<00:02:16.490> left<00:02:16.760> leg

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
direction so you ride with your left leg

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.700 
direction so you ride with your left leg
against<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.540> right<00:02:17.720> side<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.380> when<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
against the right side and when the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.830 
against the right side and when the
horse<00:02:18.860> has<00:02:19.130> made<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.520> flying<00:02:19.790> change<00:02:20.150> with

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
horse has made the flying change with

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.700 
horse has made the flying change with
your<00:02:20.960> right<00:02:21.230> leg

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
your right leg

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.790 
your right leg
against<00:02:22.010> this<00:02:22.190> left<00:02:22.850> side<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:24.200> now<00:02:24.410> he<00:02:24.470> rides

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
against this left side and now he rides

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.610 
against this left side and now he rides
from<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.100> right<00:02:25.250> side<00:02:25.520> up<00:02:25.760> against<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.150> left

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
from the right side up against the left

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.140 
from the right side up against the left
moves<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.830> horse<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.160> little<00:02:28.250> bit<00:02:28.520> puts<00:02:28.970> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
moves the horse a little bit puts the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.060 
moves the horse a little bit puts the
inner<00:02:29.300> leg<00:02:29.540> forward<00:02:29.990> and<00:02:30.110> makes<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.800> change

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
inner leg forward and makes the change

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.220 
inner leg forward and makes the change
and<00:02:31.370> now<00:02:31.820> supports<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.480> horse<00:02:32.690> from<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.050> left

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
and now supports the horse from the left

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.730 
and now supports the horse from the left
side<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.740> right<00:02:33.800> up<00:02:34.130> against<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.580> right<00:02:34.760> side

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
side and right up against the right side

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.320 
side and right up against the right side
when<00:02:36.740> you<00:02:36.860> practice<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.490> flying<00:02:37.760> changes

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
when you practice the flying changes

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.510 
when you practice the flying changes
away<00:02:38.630> from<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.990> wall<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.680> often<00:02:40.100> happens<00:02:40.460> that

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
away from the wall it often happens that

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.060 
away from the wall it often happens that
the<00:02:40.670> horse<00:02:41.030> has<00:02:41.210> become<00:02:41.570> insecure<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.410> seek

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
the horse has become insecure and seek

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.040 
the horse has become insecure and seek
out<00:02:43.340> against<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:43.970> wall<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.390> find<00:02:44.660> some<00:02:44.900> kind

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
out against the wall to find some kind

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.410 
out against the wall to find some kind
of<00:02:45.200> support<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.920> wall<00:02:46.130> so<00:02:46.850> clearly<00:02:47.120> it's

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
of support in the wall so clearly it's

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.840 
of support in the wall so clearly it's
an<00:02:47.540> exercise<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.380> demands<00:02:48.830> more<00:02:49.250> accept<00:02:49.700> of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
an exercise that demands more accept of

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.450 
an exercise that demands more accept of
the<00:02:49.970> legs<00:02:50.210> that<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.170> horse<00:02:51.380> can<00:02:51.650> think<00:02:52.100> fast

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
the legs that the horse can think fast

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.630 
the legs that the horse can think fast
and<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:52.970> is<00:02:53.090> with<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:54.160> clearly<00:02:55.160> if<00:02:55.430> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
and that it is with you clearly if the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.940 
and that it is with you clearly if the
horse<00:02:55.850> is<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.240> an<00:02:56.360> energetic<00:02:56.780> nature<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:57.560> you

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
horse is of an energetic nature and you

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.440 
horse is of an energetic nature and you
start<00:02:58.250> making<00:02:58.430> more<00:02:58.760> pressure<00:02:59.060> with<00:02:59.270> your

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
start making more pressure with your

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.840 
start making more pressure with your
legs<00:02:59.690> it<00:02:59.900> might<00:03:00.200> begin<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:01.070> run<00:03:01.400> off<00:03:01.550> a<00:03:01.580> little

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
legs it might begin to run off a little

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.930 
legs it might begin to run off a little
bit<00:03:02.380> having<00:03:03.380> practiced<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.040> flying<00:03:04.310> change<00:03:04.610> I

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
bit having practiced the flying change I

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.300 
bit having practiced the flying change I
find<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.900> is<00:03:06.050> an<00:03:06.170> advantage<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.950> give<00:03:07.130> the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
find it is an advantage to give the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.520 
find it is an advantage to give the
horse<00:03:07.490> a<00:03:07.640> walking<00:03:08.180> break<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:09.020> make<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.320> breathe

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
horse a walking break to make it breathe

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.280 
horse a walking break to make it breathe
a<00:03:09.560> little<00:03:09.740> bit<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.190> then<00:03:10.760> start<00:03:11.210> again<00:03:11.810> with

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
a little bit and then start again with

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.730 
a little bit and then start again with
the<00:03:12.380> practice<00:03:13.600> with<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.780> older<00:03:15.080> horses<00:03:15.410> we

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
the practice with the older horses we

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.830 
the practice with the older horses we
often<00:03:16.190> practice<00:03:16.670> that<00:03:16.910> that<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.360> horse<00:03:17.570> can

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
often practice that that the horse can

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.030 
often practice that that the horse can
come<00:03:18.470> back<00:03:18.980> in<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.280> canter<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.050> then<00:03:21.050> forward

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
come back in the canter and then forward

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.160 
come back in the canter and then forward
again<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:23.230> now<00:03:24.230> he<00:03:24.980> will<00:03:25.100> ride<00:03:25.280> forward<00:03:25.580> and

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
again and now he will ride forward and

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.280 
again and now he will ride forward and
do<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.320> flying<00:03:27.530> change<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:32.660> help<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.080> horse

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
do the flying change to help the horse

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.860 
do the flying change to help the horse
think<00:03:33.800> forward<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:34.820> that<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.240> flying<00:03:35.480> change

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
think forward so that the flying change

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.410 
think forward so that the flying change
will<00:03:36.140> be<00:03:36.490> completely<00:03:37.490> clean<00:03:39.880> now<00:03:40.880> he<00:03:40.940> will<00:03:41.240> try

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
will be completely clean now he will try

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.960 
will be completely clean now he will try
again<00:03:41.830> he<00:03:42.830> takes<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.310> horse<00:03:43.520> back<00:03:43.790> in<00:03:43.820> the

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
again he takes the horse back in the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.670 
again he takes the horse back in the
cancer<00:03:44.420> put<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:44.720> on<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.930> hind<00:03:45.080> legs<00:03:45.350> and<00:03:45.530> then

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
cancer put it on the hind legs and then

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.390 
cancer put it on the hind legs and then
he<00:03:45.710> writes<00:03:46.010> forward<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:48.010> do<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.040> flying

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
he writes forward and do the flying

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.150 
he writes forward and do the flying
change<00:03:50.110> good<00:03:53.050> this<00:03:54.050> horse<00:03:54.380> is<00:03:54.530> very<00:03:54.830> stable

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
change good this horse is very stable

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.670 
change good this horse is very stable
but<00:03:55.820> clearly<00:03:56.150> when<00:03:56.660> you<00:03:56.780> write<00:03:56.960> forward<00:03:57.500> and

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
but clearly when you write forward and

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.730 
but clearly when you write forward and
if<00:03:58.190> you<00:03:58.340> then<00:03:58.580> fall<00:03:59.120> forward<00:03:59.570> yourself<00:04:00.020> or<00:04:00.260> let

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
if you then fall forward yourself or let

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.980 
if you then fall forward yourself or let
the<00:04:00.920> reins<00:04:01.160> become<00:04:01.610> longer<00:04:01.880> then<00:04:02.690> you<00:04:02.720> might

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
the reins become longer then you might

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.870 
the reins become longer then you might
experience<00:04:03.680> that<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.100> horse<00:04:04.340> makes<00:04:04.700> an

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
experience that the horse makes an

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.840 
experience that the horse makes an
unclean<00:04:05.420> flying<00:04:06.110> change<00:04:06.470> every<00:04:07.430> time<00:04:07.670> you

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
unclean flying change every time you

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.760 
unclean flying change every time you
make<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.060> flying<00:04:08.420> change<00:04:08.810> think<00:04:09.290> about<00:04:09.530> making

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
make a flying change think about making

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:17.050 
make a flying change think about making
the<00:04:09.920> hind<00:04:10.310> legs<00:04:10.610> change<00:04:15.310> flying<00:04:16.310> changes<00:04:16.880> can

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
the hind legs change flying changes can

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.979 
the hind legs change flying changes can
also<00:04:17.180> occur<00:04:17.720> in<00:04:18.020> series<00:04:18.380> like<00:04:19.840> crossing<00:04:20.840> over

series of two flying changes we saw a

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.340 
series of two flying changes we saw a
small<00:04:32.660> series<00:04:33.020> here

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350

change at X and now he's now preparing
up<00:04:55.830> against<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.460> right<00:04:56.730> rein<00:04:57.060> with<00:04:57.360> his<00:04:57.600> left

leg and he keeps the direction that's it

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.340 
leg and he keeps the direction that's it
this<00:05:05.790> way<00:05:06.030> you<00:05:06.090> can<00:05:06.390> keep<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:06.810> shoulder<00:05:07.230> in

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
this way you can keep the shoulder in

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.470 
this way you can keep the shoulder in
place<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:07.890> has<00:05:08.040> a<00:05:08.070> tendency<00:05:08.400> to<00:05:08.850> go<00:05:09.030> against

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
place that has a tendency to go against

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:17.440 
place that has a tendency to go against
the<00:05:09.570> wall<00:05:11.120> you<00:05:12.120> will<00:05:12.240> do<00:05:12.330> it<00:05:12.450> once<00:05:12.660> more<00:05:12.750> here

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.480 

the<00:05:18.450> younger<00:05:18.870> horses<00:05:19.290> also<00:05:19.800> know<00:05:20.010> that<00:05:20.280> when

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
the younger horses also know that when

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.280 
the younger horses also know that when
you<00:05:20.610> start<00:05:20.880> preparing<00:05:21.270> something<00:05:21.750> is<00:05:22.050> about

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
to happen so this is also a good

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:40.460 
to happen so this is also a good
exercise<00:05:24.660> to<00:05:25.350> teach<00:05:25.860> them<00:05:26.130> to<00:05:26.310> relax
