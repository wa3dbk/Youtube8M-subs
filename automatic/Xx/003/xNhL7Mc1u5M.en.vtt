00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.310 
something that I enjoy and it's not as
pronounced<00:01:42.460> as<00:01:42.549> the<00:01:42.880> carbon<00:01:43.330> fiber<00:01:43.509> skin<00:01:43.840> but

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
pronounced as the carbon fiber skin but

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.109 
pronounced as the carbon fiber skin but
it's<00:01:44.470> definitely<00:01:44.710> something<00:01:45.220> worth<00:01:45.549> noting

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
it's definitely something worth noting

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.660 
it's definitely something worth noting
now<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.869> edges<00:01:47.290> of<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.439> skin<00:01:47.740> do<00:01:47.979> feel<00:01:48.220> a<00:01:48.250> bit

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
now the edges of the skin do feel a bit

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.940 
now the edges of the skin do feel a bit
sharp<00:01:49.090> but<00:01:49.509> that<00:01:49.689> should<00:01:49.990> smooth<00:01:50.380> out<00:01:50.560> over

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
sharp but that should smooth out over

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.880 
sharp but that should smooth out over
time<00:01:51.250> so<00:01:51.939> overall<00:01:52.479> this<00:01:52.750> is<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:53.049> great<00:01:53.500> skin

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
time so overall this is a great skin

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.370 
time so overall this is a great skin
from<00:01:54.189> d<00:01:54.460> brand<00:01:54.790> it<00:01:55.240> feels<00:01:55.570> great<00:01:55.869> it<00:01:56.079> looks

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
from d brand it feels great it looks

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.080 
from d brand it feels great it looks
great<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:56.920> as<00:01:57.220> mentioned<00:01:57.520> I'm<00:01:57.790> sure<00:01:57.939> that

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
great and as mentioned I'm sure that

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.120 
great and as mentioned I'm sure that
those<00:01:58.210> edges<00:01:58.659> are<00:01:58.780> going<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.170> get<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.009> little

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
those edges are going to get a little

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.460 
those edges are going to get a little
bit<00:02:00.280> more<00:02:00.460> smooth<00:02:00.850> over<00:02:01.299> time<00:02:01.600> but<00:02:02.200> anyway

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
bit more smooth over time but anyway

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.139 
bit more smooth over time but anyway
