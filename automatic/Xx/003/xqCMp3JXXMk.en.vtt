the<00:00:46.649> increased<00:00:47.309> experience<00:00:47.879> gained<00:00:48.120> from<00:00:48.390> 85

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the increased experience gained from 85

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.319 
the increased experience gained from 85
to<00:00:48.809> 90<00:00:49.200> if<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.710> wasn't<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> case<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.910> would

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
to 90 if that wasn't the case I would

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.850 
to 90 if that wasn't the case I would
never<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.960> been<00:00:52.079> able<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.350> do<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.649> I

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
never have been able to do this I

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.650 
never have been able to do this I
literally<00:00:53.730> hate<00:00:54.210> leveling<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.110> hate<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:56.660> it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
literally hate leveling I hate it but it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.970 
literally hate leveling I hate it but it
went<00:00:57.809> pretty<00:00:58.140> quickly<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.590> would<00:00:58.800> say<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
went pretty quickly I would say I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
went pretty quickly I would say I
actually<00:00:59.399> think<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> pace<00:01:00.660> it

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
actually think this is the pace it

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.799 
actually think this is the pace it
should<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.109> been<00:01:01.789> it<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:03.000> feels<00:01:03.180> better<00:01:03.480> I

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
should have been it just feels better I

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.140 
should have been it just feels better I
wish<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.530> increase<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> pace<00:01:05.489> even<00:01:05.700> earlier

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
wish they increase the pace even earlier

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.149 
wish they increase the pace even earlier
maybe<00:01:06.409> but<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> know<00:01:07.770> why<00:01:08.010> they

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
maybe but you know I know why they

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.310 
maybe but you know I know why they
didn't<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.600> does<00:01:09.840> feel<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.140> lot

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
didn't do it but it does feel a lot

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.680 
didn't do it but it does feel a lot
better<00:01:10.470> than<00:01:10.740> before

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
better than before

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.540 
better than before
I<00:01:12.840> mean<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.620> really<00:01:13.770> did<00:01:13.980> happen<00:01:14.100> pretty<00:01:14.430> fast

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
I mean it really did happen pretty fast

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.350 
I mean it really did happen pretty fast
I<00:01:14.970> did<00:01:15.150> run<00:01:15.450> some<00:01:15.660> dungeons<00:01:16.140> i<00:01:16.440> leveled<00:01:17.370> as<00:01:17.670> ret

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
I did run some dungeons i leveled as ret

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.920 
I did run some dungeons i leveled as ret
because<00:01:19.230> that's<00:01:19.500> I'm<00:01:20.280> pretty<00:01:21.150> more<00:01:21.600> familiar

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
because that's I'm pretty more familiar

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.630 
because that's I'm pretty more familiar
with<00:01:22.050> that<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.380> prod<00:01:23.010> or<00:01:23.220> especially<00:01:23.760> holy

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
with that then prod or especially holy

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.320 
with that then prod or especially holy
once<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.760> did<00:01:27.180> hit<00:01:27.450> 90<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.870> decided<00:01:28.320> well<00:01:29.330> why

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
once I did hit 90 I decided well why

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.150 
once I did hit 90 I decided well why
don't<00:01:30.480> we<00:01:30.540> go<00:01:30.660> prot<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.170> solo<00:01:31.470> some<00:01:31.740> instances

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
don't we go prot and solo some instances

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.560 
don't we go prot and solo some instances
but<00:01:32.340> before<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.760> sell<00:01:32.910> also<00:01:33.120> in<00:01:33.300> some

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
but before we sell also in some

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.690 
but before we sell also in some
instances<00:01:34.050> I<00:01:34.230> want<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.160> get<00:01:35.310> more<00:01:35.460> familiar

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
instances I want to get more familiar

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.020 
instances I want to get more familiar
with<00:01:39.140> you<00:01:40.140> know<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.440> whole<00:01:40.710> prot<00:01:41.220> spec<00:01:41.460> now

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
with you know the whole prot spec now

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.250 
with you know the whole prot spec now
that<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.390> changed<00:01:42.870> it's<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.050> little

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
that it's changed it's a little

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.080 
that it's changed it's a little
different<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:43.620> mean<00:01:43.770> not<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.340> little<00:01:44.700> bit<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:45.000> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
different I mean not a little bit it's a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.220 
different I mean not a little bit it's a
lot<00:01:45.270> different<00:01:45.420> than<00:01:45.690> last<00:01:45.870> time<00:01:46.050> I<00:01:46.200> played

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
lot different than last time I played

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.860 
lot different than last time I played
prob<00:01:46.590> which<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.830> probably<00:01:47.040> level<00:01:47.400> 80<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.940> think

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
prob which is probably level 80 I think

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.120 
prob which is probably level 80 I think
I<00:01:48.930> might<00:01:49.230> have<00:01:49.260> played<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.590> little<00:01:49.740> bit<00:01:49.890> no<00:01:50.100> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
I might have played a little bit no I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.290 
I might have played a little bit no I
don't<00:01:50.340> think<00:01:50.370> you<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.730> did<00:01:50.880> product<00:01:51.180> all

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
don't think you think I did product all

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.810 
don't think you think I did product all
level<00:01:51.780> 85<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.890> probably<00:01:53.220> level<00:01:53.430> 80<00:01:53.580> was<00:01:53.760> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
level 85 so probably level 80 was the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.040 
level 85 so probably level 80 was the
last<00:01:53.940> time<00:01:54.120> I<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.270> would<00:01:54.540> mess<00:01:54.660> around<00:01:54.810> this

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
last time I I would mess around this

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.580 
last time I I would mess around this
prot<00:01:56.060> or<00:01:57.060> 985<00:01:57.450> level<00:01:57.810> 80<00:01:57.960> was<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.290> last<00:01:58.440> time

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
prot or 985 level 80 was the last time

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.160 
prot or 985 level 80 was the last time
and<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.729> significantly<00:02:00.720> different<00:02:00.840> I

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and it is significantly different I

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.900 
and it is significantly different I
decided<00:02:01.470> let's<00:02:01.740> hop<00:02:01.979> into<00:02:02.220> proving<00:02:02.400> grounds<00:02:02.790> I

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
decided let's hop into proving grounds I

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.910 
decided let's hop into proving grounds I
have<00:02:03.270> really<00:02:03.600> crap<00:02:03.870> gear<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.260> barely<00:02:04.560> had<00:02:04.770> any

have really crap gear I barely had any
prot<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:05.990> but<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.020> did<00:02:07.350> decide<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.650> hop<00:02:07.830> in

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
prot here but I did decide to hop in

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.830 
prot here but I did decide to hop in
there<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.369> got<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> first<00:02:09.240> wave<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.570> is<00:02:09.720> on

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
there I got to the first wave this is on

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.520

wave<00:02:15.120> was<00:02:15.300> no<00:02:15.390> problem<00:02:15.660> till<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.870> extra<00:02:16.260> pack

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
wave was no problem till that extra pack

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.560 
wave was no problem till that extra pack
came<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.070> then<00:02:17.670> my<00:02:17.970> health<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.300> starting<00:02:18.510> to

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
came and then my health is starting to

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.900 
came and then my health is starting to
drop<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.050> even<00:02:19.800> like<00:02:20.010> she'll<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.459> righteous

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
drop and even like she'll the righteous

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.180 
drop and even like she'll the righteous
all<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.750> stuff<00:02:22.050> did<00:02:22.350> not<00:02:22.560> really<00:02:23.010> make<00:02:23.160> a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
all that stuff did not really make a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.680 
all that stuff did not really make a
difference<00:02:23.430> i<00:02:23.730> almost<00:02:23.970> lay<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.150> in<00:02:24.239> hands<00:02:24.420> but

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
difference i almost lay it in hands but

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.290 
difference i almost lay it in hands but
apparently<00:02:25.530> i<00:02:25.560> was<00:02:25.709> too<00:02:25.860> late<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.220> i<00:02:26.790> lost<00:02:27.030> i

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
apparently i was too late and i lost i

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.580 
apparently i was too late and i lost i
didn't<00:02:27.450> realize<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.750> lost<00:02:28.140> at<00:02:28.290> first<00:02:28.500> as

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
didn't realize that lost at first as

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.830 
didn't realize that lost at first as
like<00:02:28.709> ho<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.940> I'd<00:02:30.030> not<00:02:30.300> make<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.660> through<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
like ho so I'd not make it through the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.050 
like ho so I'd not make it through the
trial<00:02:31.140> did<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.680> not<00:02:31.830> make<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.190> through<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.489> so
