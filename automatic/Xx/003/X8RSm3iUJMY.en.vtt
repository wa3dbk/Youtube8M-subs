00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:12.350 
merging engineering and art is exactly

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.310 
merging engineering and art is exactly
what<00:00:12.469> I'm<00:00:12.559> all<00:00:12.680> about<00:00:12.709> a<00:00:13.930> lot<00:00:14.930> of<00:00:15.019> people<00:00:15.200> will

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
what I'm all about a lot of people will

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.840 
what I'm all about a lot of people will
ask<00:00:15.530> me<00:00:15.769> that<00:00:15.860> question<00:00:16.100> and<00:00:16.309> say<00:00:16.670> you<00:00:16.730> know

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
ask me that question and say you know

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.070 
ask me that question and say you know
how<00:00:17.000> do<00:00:17.060> you<00:00:17.180> come<00:00:17.420> up<00:00:17.510> with<00:00:17.539> your<00:00:17.720> designs

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
how do you come up with your designs

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.689 
how do you come up with your designs
like<00:00:18.320> where<00:00:18.529> is<00:00:18.619> your<00:00:18.770> inspiration<00:00:19.010> come<00:00:19.520> from

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
like where is your inspiration come from

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.160 
like where is your inspiration come from
how<00:00:19.820> do<00:00:19.880> you<00:00:19.970> tie<00:00:20.270> these<00:00:20.330> two<00:00:20.660> factors<00:00:21.019> in

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
how do you tie these two factors in

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.290 
how do you tie these two factors in
together<00:00:21.289> for<00:00:21.740> me<00:00:22.550> I<00:00:22.580> want<00:00:22.939> to<00:00:23.000> be<00:00:23.090> able<00:00:23.180> to

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
together for me I want to be able to

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.790 
together for me I want to be able to
look<00:00:23.480> at<00:00:23.630> something<00:00:24.019> and<00:00:24.199> use<00:00:24.380> my<00:00:24.560> imagination

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
look at something and use my imagination

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:33.450 
look at something and use my imagination
and<00:00:25.579> say<00:00:25.999> hey<00:00:26.210> what<00:00:26.570> about<00:00:26.599> this

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.460 

my<00:00:34.460> name<00:00:34.640> is<00:00:34.910> Paula<00:00:35.329> France<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:36.140> I'm<00:00:36.440> a

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
my name is Paula France and I'm a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.220 
my name is Paula France and I'm a
musician<00:00:37.190> who<00:00:37.370> ended<00:00:37.550> up<00:00:37.640> building<00:00:38.000> decks<00:00:38.230> for

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
musician who ended up building decks for

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.750 
musician who ended up building decks for
me<00:00:39.320> this<00:00:39.470> deck<00:00:39.739> really<00:00:40.100> personifies

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
me this deck really personifies

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.370 
me this deck really personifies
engineering<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.540> artistry<00:00:41.870> tied<00:00:42.170> in

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
engineering and artistry tied in

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.910 
engineering and artistry tied in
together

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
together

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.619 
together
we've<00:00:43.370> got<00:00:43.550> multiple<00:00:43.730> levels<00:00:44.330> that<00:00:44.420> are<00:00:44.480> all

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
we've got multiple levels that are all

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.090 
we've got multiple levels that are all
intersecting<00:00:45.320> so<00:00:45.440> there's<00:00:45.590> a<00:00:45.680> lot<00:00:45.950> of

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
intersecting so there's a lot of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.650 
intersecting so there's a lot of
engineering<00:00:46.220> involved<00:00:46.940> to<00:00:47.030> make<00:00:47.300> sure<00:00:47.540> it

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
engineering involved to make sure it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.810 
engineering involved to make sure it
works<00:00:47.930> but<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.890> whole<00:00:49.040> point<00:00:49.340> of<00:00:49.400> all<00:00:49.550> of<00:00:49.610> that

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
works but the whole point of all of that

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.750 
works but the whole point of all of that
engineering<00:00:50.330> is<00:00:50.570> to<00:00:51.080> elevate<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.890> artistry<00:00:52.340> a

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
engineering is to elevate the artistry a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.939 
engineering is to elevate the artistry a
deck<00:00:53.480> is<00:00:53.750> only<00:00:54.140> as<00:00:54.230> good<00:00:54.379> as<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.650> structure

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
deck is only as good as the structure

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:55.780 
deck is only as good as the structure
beneath<00:00:55.309> it

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
beneath it

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.299 
beneath it
you<00:00:56.120> can<00:00:56.239> have<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.600> transcend<00:00:57.320> surface<00:00:57.860> but<00:00:58.129> if

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
you can have a transcend surface but if

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.640 
you can have a transcend surface but if
your<00:00:58.460> structure<00:00:58.820> beneath<00:00:59.269> the<00:00:59.420> deck<00:00:59.629> is<00:01:00.230> not

your structure beneath the deck is not

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.860 
your structure beneath the deck is not

sound and is not going to last as long

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.079 
sound and is not going to last as long
as<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.170> deck<00:01:03.350> surface<00:01:03.640> well<00:01:04.640> then<00:01:04.790> what's<00:01:04.940> the

we have the trucks transcend product and
we're<00:01:08.420> incorporating<00:01:09.080> two<00:01:09.590> new<00:01:09.740> colors<00:01:09.920> lava

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
we're incorporating two new colors lava

rock and spiced rum it's durable it
looks<00:01:13.340> gorgeous<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.119> it<00:01:14.600> looks<00:01:14.750> like<00:01:14.869> natural

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
looks gorgeous and it looks like natural

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.859 
looks gorgeous and it looks like natural
wood<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.130> many<00:01:16.340> composites<00:01:16.700> in<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.180> past<00:01:17.450> what

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
wood so many composites in the past what

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.180 
wood so many composites in the past what
they<00:01:17.899> look<00:01:18.170> like<00:01:18.320> plastic<00:01:18.500> they<00:01:18.860> don't<00:01:19.039> look

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
they look like plastic they don't look

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.190 
they look like plastic they don't look
real<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:19.670> for<00:01:19.880> me<00:01:19.970> these<00:01:20.210> look<00:01:20.479> natural<00:01:20.990> they

that that means that every single
project<00:01:41.439> I'm<00:01:42.340> gonna<00:01:42.610> look<00:01:42.789> at<00:01:43.000> from<00:01:43.270> an

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
project I'm gonna look at from an

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.020 
project I'm gonna look at from an
entirely<00:01:43.689> different<00:01:43.810> perspective<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:45.579> me<00:01:45.640> a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
entirely different perspective for me a

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.510 
entirely different perspective for me a
deck<00:01:46.330> is<00:01:46.570> not<00:01:46.840> complete<00:01:47.350> without<00:01:47.860> lighting

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
deck is not complete without lighting

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.580 
deck is not complete without lighting
lighting<00:01:49.390> gives<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:49.990> opportunity<00:01:50.259> to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
lighting gives you the opportunity to

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.550 
lighting gives you the opportunity to
create<00:01:50.860> an<00:01:51.220> entirely<00:01:51.850> different<00:01:52.149> space<00:01:52.990> even

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
create an entirely different space even

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.399 
create an entirely different space even
though<00:01:53.590> you're<00:01:53.829> still<00:01:54.009> in<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.250> same<00:01:54.460> space<00:01:54.759> I
