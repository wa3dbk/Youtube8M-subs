 resentment that you know now from me that I have 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.229

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.649

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.259
 right away from our house please 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.090
 he a knight does not oblige him to 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.530
 chasing you up papi will never arrive 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.630
 kick me out of my house 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.630
 you saw it said I was careful 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.490
 I understand that it is not the band known a 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.689
 respectable breath 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.430
 I 'm leaving but what's up with you 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.570
 I don't know, Camilla, I want to stop 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.250
 give me illusions 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.930
 the truth is that it makes no sense that I mark 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.970
 I continue to hope for the impossible 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.590
 well you told me that if you mark 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.940
 if he returned he would be more romantic 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.560
 things closer would have changed 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.829
 well we want for a moment I thought 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.329
 just like that and I repented because 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.120
 I'm not sure I'm not sure not 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:28.820
 wait it's easy love it or love it not it 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.260
 I know I don't know landslide is the time to 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.420
 understand it I'm sorry because otherwise 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.750
 suffering him to suffer the two is not 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.630
 right for anyone 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.000
 and anyway another thing you saw that 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.880
 cute diego was of wine that friend 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.770
 charmed me enchanted who was understood 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.270
 the bad moment he is experiencing is 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.670
 approached took mark I brought it 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.190
 he took it away from embarrassment 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.920
 the truth is that I would like to have a man 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.530
 so a boy to protect me and broth 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.250
 who heard about those who leave 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.880
 heard 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:05.420
 I do not know, however, look how easy you run 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.420
 invaded
