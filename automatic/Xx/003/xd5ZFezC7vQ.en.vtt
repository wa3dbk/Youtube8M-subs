different<00:01:48.130> on<00:01:48.220> planet<00:01:48.580> wisdom<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:49.060> think<00:01:49.300> we

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
different on planet wisdom I think we

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.480 
different on planet wisdom I think we
actually<00:01:49.540> wait<00:01:49.900> a<00:01:49.990> little<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.440> little<00:01:51.130> less<00:01:51.310> we

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
actually wait a little a little less we

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.100 
actually wait a little a little less we
weigh<00:01:51.670> less<00:01:51.910> it's<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.330> confidence<00:01:52.720> boost

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
weigh less it's a confidence boost

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.020 
weigh less it's a confidence boost
