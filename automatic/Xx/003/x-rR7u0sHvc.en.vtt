the<00:00:16.560> difference<00:00:16.860> between<00:00:17.039> an<00:00:17.520> undulation<00:00:18.210> and

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
the difference between an undulation and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.350 
the difference between an undulation and
a<00:00:19.619> camel<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.520> can<00:00:20.699> go<00:00:20.820> back<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.150> check<00:00:21.300> my

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
a camel you can go back and check my

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.490 
a camel you can go back and check my
channel<00:00:21.630> for<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:21.930> if<00:00:22.110> you<00:00:22.230> missed<00:00:22.410> that

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
channel for that if you missed that

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.229 
channel for that if you missed that
today<00:00:23.160> we're<00:00:23.369> going<00:00:23.489> to<00:00:23.579> do<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> little<00:00:24.029> bit<00:00:24.210> of

a longer drill and we're going to add
one<00:00:25.949> more<00:00:25.980> little<00:00:26.400> variation<00:00:27.089> in<00:00:27.300> here<00:00:27.750> so

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
one more little variation in here so

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.560 
one more little variation in here so
let's<00:00:28.439> go<00:00:28.560> over<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:29.009> variation<00:00:29.699> first<00:00:29.970> so

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
let's go over that variation first so

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.990 
let's go over that variation first so
the<00:00:30.750> variation<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.830> under<00:00:32.460> turned<00:00:32.699> a<00:00:32.850> little

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the variation is under turned a little

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.610 
the variation is under turned a little
bit<00:00:33.120> sideways<00:00:33.510> here<00:00:34.019> first

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
bit sideways here first

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.430 
bit sideways here first

pulling back and help to increase the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.130 
pulling back and help to increase the
visual<00:00:52.829> effect<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.760> as<00:00:53.940> well<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.449> what

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
visual effect on this as well so what

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.200 
visual effect on this as well so what
we're<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.530> be<00:00:55.649> doing<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.210> coming

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
we're going to be doing is coming

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.509 
forward and then I'm pulling back on my
left<00:01:00.870> side<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.469> little<00:01:01.739> more<00:01:01.949> than<00:01:02.070> my<00:01:02.250> right

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
left side a little more than my right

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.180 
left side a little more than my right

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
it in so I'm getting a little bit more

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.529 
it in so I'm getting a little bit more
of<00:01:07.890> an<00:01:08.009> annual<00:01:08.429> look<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.940> this<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> nice

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
of an annual look on this it's a nice

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:12.889 
of an annual look on this it's a nice
deep<00:01:09.840> muscular<00:01:10.530> look<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.030> because<00:01:12.660> it's<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
deep muscular look so because it's a

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.050 
deep muscular look so because it's a
deep<00:01:13.050> muscular<00:01:13.470> movement<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.550> we're

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
deep muscular movement and so we're

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.719 
deep muscular movement and so we're
using<00:01:15.300> our<00:01:15.660> leaks<00:01:16.289> and<00:01:16.590> we're<00:01:16.770> using<00:01:17.039> our<00:01:17.280> soaz

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
using our leaks and we're using our soaz

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.370 
using our leaks and we're using our soaz
muscles<00:01:18.149> and<00:01:18.360> we're<00:01:18.509> using<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.929> ones<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
muscles and we're using the ones on the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.290 
muscles and we're using the ones on the
side<00:01:19.410> more<00:01:20.009> than<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.340> ones<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.849> side<00:01:20.910> in

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
side more than the ones on this side in

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.600 
side more than the ones on this side in
this<00:01:21.750> case<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.440> if<00:01:22.679> I<00:01:22.800> went<00:01:23.039> to<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> other<00:01:23.369> way

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
this case and if I went to the other way

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.150 
this case and if I went to the other way
I<00:01:23.940> would<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.539> pulling<00:01:24.780> back<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.440> it's

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
I would be pulling back here it's

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.800 
I would be pulling back here it's
important<00:01:26.550> to<00:01:26.640> keep<00:01:26.819> your<00:01:26.970> chest<00:01:27.179> up<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.660> you

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
important to keep your chest up as you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.139 
important to keep your chest up as you
do<00:01:27.959> this<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.340> three<00:01:29.610> movements<00:01:29.819> that

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
do this so the three movements that

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.779 
do this so the three movements that
we'll<00:01:30.300> be<00:01:30.420> using<00:01:30.599> for<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.140> drill<00:01:31.440> are<00:01:31.800> the

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
we'll be using for this drill are the

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.699 
we'll be using for this drill are the
full<00:01:33.060> undulation<00:01:33.569> which<00:01:34.110> leads<00:01:34.380> from<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:34.709 
full undulation which leads from the

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:37.850 
full undulation which leads from the
chest<00:01:35.039> a<00:01:35.479> camel<00:01:36.479> which<00:01:36.840> happens<00:01:37.319> all<00:01:37.560> below

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
chest a camel which happens all below
