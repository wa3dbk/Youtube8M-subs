00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.189
 hello how about friends and are welcome 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.500
 this time, we are already here with 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.380
 this new game is the great expected 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.300
 mortal kombat x we have it here in 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.490
 screen here as we are watching the 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.520
 intro of the game but this time the 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.169
 let's jump to start playing then 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.079
 and that you see the graphics and other 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.120
 We're already on the road menu 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.300
 principal then we're going quickly to the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.250
 battle mode and here we see 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.290
 the map of the story mode that we're going to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.199
 have to go unlocking while 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.630
 we are fighting with the different 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.640
 character we're going here is 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.130
 to this mission let's say so we go for the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.290
 combat number 2 of 5 here we are 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.970
 watching my team on the left side 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.490
 we also have the option to modify 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.010
 to add and remove characters we are going to 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.070
 I can have three teams but I'm going 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.910
 starting then I have for the moment 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.170
 few few fighters equally in the 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.810
 then we will be able to unlock 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.810
 many more so we're going to fight 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.110
 As you can see, we are here ready to 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.580
 start fighting meanwhile I'm going 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.440
 commenting that this game we're going 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.630
 to be able to find totally free in 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.390
 the google play requires a version of 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.230
 Android 4.0 at least and the size then 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.090
 is 1.5 gb here we are already observing 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.220
 Well, the excellent graphics that the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.170
 game as I always remind you that in 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.490
 the description will not be in command all 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.040
 the necessary links so that it 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.870
 download as much as the place 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.570
 thor so that you are visiting it is 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.820
 excellent that attack that I did as 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.200
 also the link makes my spot block here 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.020
 as we are seeing in the part 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.640
 left because we are changing in the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.250
 different team rivals here we go 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.730
 with the special attack of this and how 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.920
 come then everyone has a 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.020
 a different way to activate the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.940
 special attack where is the fatal but 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.000
 if it's a special attack here we're going 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.710
 with this other one we go and as I was already 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.500
 observing therefore the modality of the same 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.280
 it is with gesture on the screen we are going 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.280
 here we are loading 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.330
 there we are carrying an attack and between 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.120
 the requirements because I would recommend them 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.640
 at least one gigabyte of ram memory 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.670
 We already talked about the size of the weight 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.319
 is 1.5 gb as you can see we've finished this 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.319
 combat so we're going to next 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.580
 next we go with combat 3 of 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.440
 5 but before we leave here because 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.480
 we unfold the menu where we are going to have 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.800
 to go to the main menu to 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.900
 review our profile 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.500
 the collection of our characters by 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.270
 example 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.510
 these are the ones that I have at the moment 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.510
 here 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.659
 here we are going to observe another option of 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.420
 equipment that we will be able to add 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.760
 equally supportive and some improvements 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.620
 for example if we go here in store 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.209
 and we will be able to unlock the 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.439
 different characters here and the 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.980
 we are seeing everything that are 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:16.420
 available for example here we have 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.420
 to network tilda sub zero 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.980
 in short we have enough we have there 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.230
 is sonya blade we also have scorpion 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.440
 all the classics here we already have them 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.160
 we also have johnny cage and in short 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.980
 so we're going quickly to another 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.720
 battle so you are watching 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.620
 again the graphics of this game 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.620
 we are going to fight 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.650
 so we are ready and so they 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.410
 I remember that in the description too 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.940
 I will leave you in ignacia the play store for 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.400
 who are seeing compatibility and if 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.650
 tells them that is not available in your 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.090
 country or something like that too 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.610
 is someone who says all the files 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.580
 here to download it from the 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.990
 spot block that we are going to load as 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.900

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.720

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.610
 equally then they say if we make a 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.980
 Small series of this deadly kombat x 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.960

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.450
 finish with this last 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:44.479
 with this last combat 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.479
 there's that good precision 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.220
 we are going 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.820
 um 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.320
 there was excellent 95% damage every time 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.320
 It's getting harder 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.970
 or apparently we are going 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.040
 we go 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.690
 let's lose I think let's go 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.219
 well we win so I hope I have them 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:35.569
