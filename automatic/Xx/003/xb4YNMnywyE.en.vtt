just a little bit some olive oil is that

just a little bit some olive oil is that
guy<00:01:28.119> spawns<00:01:28.630> in<00:01:28.959> it<00:01:29.799> gets<00:01:30.009> nope<00:01:30.639> scoped<00:01:31.569> and

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
guy spawns in it gets nope scoped and

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.760 
guy spawns in it gets nope scoped and
that's<00:01:31.810> one<00:01:31.990> thing<00:01:32.079> you<00:01:32.170> have<00:01:32.259> to<00:01:32.350> worry<00:01:32.590> about

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
that's one thing you have to worry about

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.289 
that's one thing you have to worry about
when<00:01:33.009> you're<00:01:33.130> playing<00:01:33.340> hardline<00:01:33.729> is<00:01:33.909> a<00:01:33.939> spawn

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
when you're playing hardline is a spawn

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.480 
when you're playing hardline is a spawn
and<00:01:34.479> vulnerability<00:01:35.139> there<00:01:35.679> is<00:01:35.859> about<00:01:36.189> a<00:01:36.219> half

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
and vulnerability there is about a half

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.910 
and vulnerability there is about a half
a<00:01:36.609> second<00:01:37.029> where<00:01:37.209> people<00:01:37.569> simply<00:01:37.920> cannot

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
a second where people simply cannot

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.399 
a second where people simply cannot
shoot<00:01:39.549> you<00:01:39.759> and<00:01:40.029> more<00:01:40.630> importantly<00:01:40.719> they<00:01:41.229> will

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
shoot you and more importantly they will

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.620 
shoot you and more importantly they will
absorb<00:01:41.590> every<00:01:42.100> piece<00:01:42.249> of<00:01:42.429> damage<00:01:42.789> so<00:01:42.819> what<00:01:43.600> I

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
absorb every piece of damage so what I

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.449 
absorb every piece of damage so what I
usually<00:01:43.869> do<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.469> either<00:01:44.619> count<00:01:45.009> it<00:01:45.100> out<00:01:45.189> in<00:01:45.340> my

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
usually do is either count it out in my

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.399 
usually do is either count it out in my
head<00:01:45.670> or<00:01:46.060> wait<00:01:46.509> for<00:01:46.539> them<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:46.840> move<00:01:47.079> and

head or wait for them to move and

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.469

there's another note scope and this

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.940 
there's another note scope and this

kiss but its power is of course that
rate<00:02:02.829> of<00:02:02.859> fire<00:02:03.189> cuz<00:02:03.459> I<00:02:03.549> talked<00:02:03.759> about<00:02:03.849> this

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
rate of fire cuz I talked about this

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.019 
rate of fire cuz I talked about this
before<00:02:04.149> I<00:02:04.810> my<00:02:05.679> grind<00:02:06.069> with<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.429> awm<00:02:06.909> and

goes down to thirty five rate of fire

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.410 
goes down to thirty five rate of fire
well<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.739> bad<00:02:17.980> boy<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.760> keep<00:02:19.000> your<00:02:19.239> rate<00:02:19.390> of

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
well this bad boy you keep your rate of

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.840 
well this bad boy you keep your rate of
fire<00:02:19.569> around<00:02:19.959> sixteen<00:02:20.590> that's<00:02:21.069> great

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
fire around sixteen that's great

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.600 
fire around sixteen that's great
shot<00:02:22.120> every<00:02:22.900> second<00:02:23.320> especially<00:02:23.890> let's<00:02:24.460> get

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
shot every second especially let's get

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.780 
shot every second especially let's get
heavy<00:02:25.240> like<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.470> guy<00:02:26.620> need<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.490> kiss

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
heavy like this and that guy need a kiss

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.970 
heavy like this and that guy need a kiss
cuz<00:02:28.120> he<00:02:28.240> got<00:02:28.270> just<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.780> little<00:02:29.110> bit<00:02:29.260> too<00:02:29.740> close

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
cuz he got just a little bit too close

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.890 
cuz he got just a little bit too close
so<00:02:30.280> here<00:02:30.610> we<00:02:30.730> are<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.970> figure<00:02:31.420> out<00:02:31.510> these<00:02:31.690> guys

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
so here we are I figure out these guys

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.170 
so here we are I figure out these guys
are<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.320> roof<00:02:32.560> we<00:02:33.160> are<00:02:33.310> surrounded<00:02:33.640> and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
are on the roof we are surrounded and

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.640 
are on the roof we are surrounded and
the<00:02:34.510> other<00:02:34.630> thing<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:34.840> kind<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.140> balances

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
the other thing that kind of balances

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.160 
the other thing that kind of balances
out<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.760> low<00:02:37.030> velocity<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:37.990> there<00:02:38.110> you

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
out is the low velocity and there you

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.300 
out is the low velocity and there you
see<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.350> head<00:02:38.530> shot<00:02:38.740> in<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.890> background

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
see a head shot in the background

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.440 
see a head shot in the background
doesn't<00:02:39.520> matter<00:02:39.640> how<00:02:39.790> far<00:02:40.030> he<00:02:40.210> would<00:02:40.330> have

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
doesn't matter how far he would have

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.670 
doesn't matter how far he would have
been<00:02:40.570> away<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.870> would<00:02:40.960> have<00:02:41.050> dropped<00:02:41.260> them<00:02:41.440> is

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
been away it would have dropped them is

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.890 
been away it would have dropped them is
the<00:02:42.520> low<00:02:42.670> velocity<00:02:43.210> you<00:02:43.300> got<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.540> really

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
the low velocity you got to really

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.840 
the low velocity you got to really
really<00:02:44.020> worry<00:02:44.500> about<00:02:44.590> leads<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.520> of<00:02:45.580> course

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
really worry about leads and of course

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.790 
really worry about leads and of course
the<00:02:46.300> drop<00:02:46.600> there's<00:02:46.930> quite<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.140> bit<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.620> as

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
the drop there's quite a bit of that as

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.360 
the drop there's quite a bit of that as
well<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:48.850> targets<00:02:49.600> at<00:02:49.750> far<00:02:50.140> distances<00:02:50.370> moving

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
well so targets at far distances moving

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.890 
well so targets at far distances moving
are<00:02:51.760> gonna<00:02:51.910> be<00:02:52.030> problematic<00:02:52.420> unless<00:02:52.750> you

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
are gonna be problematic unless you

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.540 
are gonna be problematic unless you
throw<00:02:53.050> on<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.200> different<00:02:53.590> optic<00:02:54.100> but<00:02:54.280> that's

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
throw on a different optic but that's

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.100 
throw on a different optic but that's
not<00:02:54.850> really<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.210> point<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.570> 300<00:02:55.990> knockout

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
not really the point of a 300 knockout

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.650 
not really the point of a 300 knockout
for<00:02:56.500> me<00:02:56.620> whenever<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:57.100> equip<00:02:57.550> this<00:02:57.760> bad<00:02:58.060> boy<00:02:58.360> I

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
for me whenever I equip this bad boy I

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.770 
for me whenever I equip this bad boy I
want<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.260> get<00:02:59.380> up<00:02:59.650> close<00:02:59.710> and<00:03:00.370> personal<00:03:00.780> reach

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
want to get up close and personal reach

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.840 
want to get up close and personal reach
out<00:03:02.020> and<00:03:02.140> kind<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.470> touch<00:03:02.980> somebody<00:03:03.460> let<00:03:03.700> them

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
out and kind of touch somebody let them

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.880 
out and kind of touch somebody let them
know<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.060> I'm<00:03:04.720> just<00:03:04.990> basically<00:03:05.350> whispering

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
take out multiple people because that's

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.190 
take out multiple people because that's
what<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.060> rate<00:03:10.240> of<00:03:10.360> fire<00:03:10.510> allows<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.050> do

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
what the rate of fire allows you to do

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.330 
what the rate of fire allows you to do
with<00:03:11.350> this<00:03:11.470> thing<00:03:11.650> as<00:03:11.770> long<00:03:11.980> as<00:03:12.100> you<00:03:12.190> could

bunny-hopping the jumping and I see more
guys<00:03:17.800> in<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:18.040> roof<00:03:18.220> it's<00:03:18.520> kind<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.940> key<00:03:19.150> to

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
guys in the roof it's kind of the key to

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.790 
guys in the roof it's kind of the key to
the<00:03:19.330> survival<00:03:19.480> especially<00:03:19.960> a<00:03:20.260> server<00:03:20.530> like
