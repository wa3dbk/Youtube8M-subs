had to increase the security we've seen
over<00:05:57.030> previous<00:05:57.389> years<00:05:57.419> where<00:05:58.050> fans<00:05:59.009> have<00:05:59.400> been

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
over previous years where fans have been

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.399 
over previous years where fans have been

running not just to the track edge but
actually<00:06:01.770> across<00:06:02.069> the<00:06:02.310> track<00:06:02.580> and<00:06:03.050> there<00:06:04.050> is

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
actually across the track and there is

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.959 
actually across the track and there is
very<00:06:04.409> very<00:06:04.680> high<00:06:04.830> security<00:06:05.370> fencing<00:06:05.699> you<00:06:05.759> see

very very high security fencing you see

very very high security fencing you see
it<00:06:06.060> here<00:06:06.330> it<00:06:06.870> is<00:06:06.990> like<00:06:07.139> that<00:06:07.319> all<00:06:07.530> round<00:06:07.830> the

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
it here it is like that all round the

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.459 
it here it is like that all round the
circuit<00:06:08.340> and<00:06:08.719> well<00:06:09.719> I<00:06:09.750> think<00:06:10.050> what's<00:06:10.229> in<00:06:10.379> our

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:10.469 
circuit and well I think what's in our

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:11.809 
circuit and well I think what's in our
hope<00:06:10.680> was<00:06:10.860> that<00:06:10.919> somebody<00:06:11.280> might<00:06:11.490> throw<00:06:11.789> a

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
hope was that somebody might throw a

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:13.909 
hope was that somebody might throw a
flag<00:06:12.150> across<00:06:12.479> to<00:06:12.810> a<00:06:12.870> marshal<00:06:13.110> the<00:06:13.409> marshal<00:06:13.800> may

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
flag across to a marshal the marshal may

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.100 
flag across to a marshal the marshal may
then<00:06:14.099> bring<00:06:14.190> it<00:06:14.370> to<00:06:14.400> centre<00:06:14.789> but<00:06:15.690> the<00:06:15.840> missus

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
then bring it to centre but the missus

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.469 
then bring it to centre but the missus
didn't<00:06:16.349> get<00:06:16.530> across<00:06:16.860> we<00:06:17.729> know<00:06:17.940> how<00:06:18.150> expensive

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
didn't get across we know how expensive

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.749 
didn't get across we know how expensive
the<00:06:18.810> flags<00:06:19.080> are<00:06:19.349> in<00:06:19.530> Japan<00:06:19.830> well<00:06:20.400> I<00:06:20.430> think

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 
the flags are in Japan well I think

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.640 
the flags are in Japan well I think
anybody<00:06:21.599> would<00:06:21.780> be<00:06:21.870> delighted<00:06:22.139> to<00:06:22.289> let<00:06:22.500> the
