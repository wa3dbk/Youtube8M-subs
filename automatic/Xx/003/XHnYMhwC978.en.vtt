00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
we were pretty much finished and then

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.220 
we were pretty much finished and then
Twitter<00:00:41.430> decided<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.059> completely<00:00:42.360> we're<00:00:43.079> not

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
Twitter decided to completely we're not

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.319 
Twitter decided to completely we're not
completely<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:43.910> fundamentally<00:00:44.910> change<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
completely but fundamentally change the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.760 
completely but fundamentally change the
API<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.850> yeah<00:00:47.850> bit<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.300> nightmare<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:48.989> they

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
API so yeah bit of a nightmare but they

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.670
