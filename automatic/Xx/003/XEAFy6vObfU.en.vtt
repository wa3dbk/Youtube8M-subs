00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
never even see it really so that's going

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:37.620 
never even see it really so that's going
to<00:06:35.979> be<00:06:36.099> it<00:06:36.220> for<00:06:36.250> this<00:06:36.580> one<00:06:36.849> like<00:06:37.030> I<00:06:37.180> said<00:06:37.210> if<00:06:37.569> you

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
to be it for this one like I said if you

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.659 
to be it for this one like I said if you
use<00:06:37.660> multicolor<00:06:38.319> to<00:06:38.560> come<00:06:38.830> more<00:06:39.009> you<00:06:39.550> know

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
use multicolor to come more you know

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:42.150 
use multicolor to come more you know
more<00:06:40.030> or<00:06:40.120> less<00:06:40.150> looking<00:06:40.479> like<00:06:40.720> this<00:06:40.979> if<00:06:41.979> you

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
more or less looking like this if you

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.129 
more or less looking like this if you
use<00:06:42.370> two<00:06:42.580> pieces<00:06:42.819> I<00:06:43.150> use<00:06:43.360> one<00:06:43.599> piece<00:06:43.810> for<00:06:44.020> the

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:44.139 
use two pieces I use one piece for the

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:48.480 
use two pieces I use one piece for the
outside<00:06:44.759> stitch<00:06:45.759> here<00:06:46.090> and<00:06:46.800> if<00:06:47.800> you<00:06:48.039> use<00:06:48.220> two

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
outside stitch here and if you use two

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.279 
outside stitch here and if you use two
you<00:06:48.789> would<00:06:48.940> you<00:06:49.210> know<00:06:49.300> the<00:06:49.690> center<00:06:49.990> would<00:06:50.110> be<00:06:50.259> a

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:50.289 
you would you know the center would be a

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.550 
you would you know the center would be a
different<00:06:50.710> color<00:06:50.889> than<00:06:51.190> the<00:06:51.220> outside<00:06:52.229> so<00:06:53.229> I

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
different color than the outside so I

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.939 
different color than the outside so I
think<00:06:54.340> this<00:06:54.610> would<00:06:54.759> look<00:06:54.909> nice<00:06:55.150> if<00:06:55.419> the<00:06:55.539> saw

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
think this would look nice if the saw

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.550 
think this would look nice if the saw
inside<00:06:56.949> was<00:06:57.250> solid<00:06:57.669> red<00:06:57.880> and<00:06:58.270> the<00:06:58.930> outside<00:06:59.349> was

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
inside was solid red and the outside was

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.469 
inside was solid red and the outside was
green<00:06:59.800> be<00:07:00.159> like<00:07:00.340> a<00:07:00.370> zombie<00:07:00.880> bracelet<00:07:01.330> look

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 
green be like a zombie bracelet look

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:03.749 
green be like a zombie bracelet look

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 
kind of cool so we may do one of those
