00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.960
 we look at the good hope from 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.579
 the year 2006 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.210
 We count and have only bought 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.539
 teams 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.050
 jcb and to date we have 10 types 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.050
 of the brand 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.900
 we had experienced before 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:22.300
 with the robot model 11 10 with 2 units 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:26.000
 and a unit of the robot model or 170 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.180
 now about 5 months ago we have 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.100
 the first model unit 260 that we're 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.030
 knowing and testing has been 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.030
 giving very good results 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.759
 in general we have perceived the 260 model 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.710
 pretty good with some 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.800
 features that stand out as the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.920
 operator seat 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.590
 the jcb engine and it comes more powered with 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.420
 turbo I think it's a system of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.869
 cooling that changes from the other model 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.299
 in addition to the cage which is wider 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.160
 In general, our operators have not 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.720
 perceived pretty well 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.840
 I would emphasize that comfort has the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.660
 browns with edges is wider and more 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.240
 Agile has more power and the other issue 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.350
 that of visibility because it facilitates 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.350
 operation of the machine 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.290
 yes
