00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 Today I'm going to talk about the pendrives 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.780
 I'm going to give you a couple of few 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.530
 advice to say so that you 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.170
 decide what kind of pendrive you want and 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.200
 what do you want it for? 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.810
 There are many types of pen drives vale 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.910
 here I have four and they are in the order of 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.410
 smaller memory to larger memory 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:32.879
 that are 8 gigas as we see there the most 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.120
 small are 512 megabytes worth what 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.940
 means this on each pendrive is 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.739
 specialized for a function if you go 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.739
 to use a pendrive 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.890
 a normal usb for documents and things 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:56.070
 so obviously you will need a 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.680
 pendrive with little memory worth but if 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.140
 you work with many documents if 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.559
 you need to have them stored in a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.440
 pendrive a little bit bigger respect 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.289
 to memory buy a pendrive of 2 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.450
 gigas are worth very cheap 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:17.470
 This is 2gb do not know if it is hard to see 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.730
 for the good camera 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.680
 that's going to give respect to 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.940
 documents so you need to go saving 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:33.220
 the to go from one computer to another etc 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:37.540
 ok then there are the pendrive of 48 16 and 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:42.160
 32 gb for what will these be because it is for 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:47.650
 if you work with documents very very 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:52.420
 large 500 megabytes of a giga vale 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:56.170
 according to which document that file 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.060
 you are working without according to what memory 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.600
 depend you need it 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.650
 Obviously buy yourself one of 16 or 32 GB 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.160
 that are very cheap lately 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:13.780
 there are also 64, but that's 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.760
 is to spend yourself, you focus on the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.740
 documents documents that you are using 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:24.340
 for your work for the events that 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:27.120
 doing and things like that I'm worth what you 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.960
 I recommend it is very very good advice 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.570
 do not buy a 16 GB pendrive for 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.110
 that later you are not going to use your purchase 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.050
 what you really need if you believe 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.180
 that you need a 4GB pendrive and you see 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.440
 that will be too small for you 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:51.400
 buy one of 8 gigabytes that walks in 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.820
 Price goes between 16 and 25 euros 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.300
 8 gb 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.209
 to talk very small memory be 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.069
 512 megabytes is no longer sold in any 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:09.069
 store this is 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:13.299
 very old of the 90s or so the 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:16.240
 years 0 of 2000 so it's only to try 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.490
 with documents like this 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.770
 Well that's the advice I hope you 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.630
 I liked the advice and my advice 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:27.180
 of purchase on the pendrives and we 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.180
 we see another time until the next
