00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.260 

okay<00:00:01.930> you<00:00:02.260> can<00:00:02.440> see<00:00:02.680> I<00:00:02.710> have<00:00:03.010> that<00:00:03.250> rear<00:00:03.970> tube

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:04.270 
okay you can see I have that rear tube

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.900 
okay you can see I have that rear tube
in<00:00:04.540> place<00:00:04.569> it's<00:00:05.169> not<00:00:05.319> tack<00:00:05.620> welded<00:00:06.160> on<00:00:06.549> the

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:06.910 
in place it's not tack welded on the

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.549 
in place it's not tack welded on the
front<00:00:07.180> and<00:00:07.269> back<00:00:07.479> and<00:00:07.720> I<00:00:07.809> heated<00:00:08.050> it<00:00:08.170> just<00:00:08.410> like

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 
front and back and I heated it just like

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.020 
front and back and I heated it just like
I<00:00:08.710> explained<00:00:09.070> in<00:00:09.190> the<00:00:09.280> previous<00:00:09.490> video<00:00:10.000> so

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
I explained in the previous video so

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.839 
I explained in the previous video so
there<00:00:10.420> really<00:00:10.750> is<00:00:10.990> no<00:00:11.170> warping<00:00:11.769> in<00:00:11.950> that<00:00:12.669> wing

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:12.849 
there really is no warping in that wing

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.890 
there really is no warping in that wing
tube<00:00:13.089> whatsoever<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:16.059> I<00:00:16.150> came<00:00:16.359> down

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
tube whatsoever and I came down

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.550 
tube whatsoever and I came down
that's<00:00:17.199> tact<00:00:17.590> so<00:00:18.220> we're<00:00:18.340> good<00:00:18.490> to<00:00:18.580> go<00:00:18.609> so<00:00:19.560> the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
that's tact so we're good to go so the

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.130 
that's tact so we're good to go so the
next<00:00:20.769> step<00:00:21.070> and<00:00:21.310> and<00:00:21.640> this<00:00:21.970> is<00:00:22.150> just<00:00:22.359> really

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
next step and and this is just really

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.259 
next step and and this is just really
gets<00:00:23.529> to<00:00:23.619> be<00:00:23.800> repetitive<00:00:24.099> at<00:00:24.519> at<00:00:24.730> some<00:00:25.000> point

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
gets to be repetitive at at some point

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.540 
gets to be repetitive at at some point
but<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:27.580> know<00:00:28.230> these<00:00:29.230> go<00:00:29.529> in<00:00:29.710> next

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
but you know these go in next

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.360 
but you know these go in next
now<00:00:30.970> I<00:00:31.330> already<00:00:32.110> fitted<00:00:32.349> them<00:00:32.529> in<00:00:32.680> tag<00:00:32.950> welded

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
now I already fitted them in tag welded

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.000 
now I already fitted them in tag welded
the<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.910> bottoms<00:00:34.300> and<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.320> tops<00:00:35.649> are<00:00:35.829> just

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
the the bottoms and the tops are just

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.610 
the the bottoms and the tops are just
floating<00:00:36.399> there<00:00:36.570> okay<00:00:37.570> because<00:00:38.260> I<00:00:38.410> want<00:00:38.590> to

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
floating there okay because I want to

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.979 
floating there okay because I want to
make<00:00:38.800> sure<00:00:38.829> that<00:00:39.730> before<00:00:40.120> I<00:00:40.390> start<00:00:40.690> attacking

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
make sure that before I start attacking

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.130 
make sure that before I start attacking
that<00:00:41.410> wing<00:00:41.649> tube<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:43.000> any<00:00:43.600> amount<00:00:44.079> of

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
that wing tube that any amount of

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.069 
that wing tube that any amount of
pressure<00:00:44.440> I<00:00:44.620> create<00:00:45.160> from<00:00:45.460> heat<00:00:45.730> has<00:00:46.719> been

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
pressure I create from heat has been

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.130 
pressure I create from heat has been
reduced<00:00:47.829> to<00:00:47.949> a<00:00:48.039> minimum<00:00:48.610> so<00:00:49.300> by<00:00:49.449> tack<00:00:49.750> welding

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
reduced to a minimum so by tack welding

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.689 
reduced to a minimum so by tack welding
this<00:00:50.260> first<00:00:50.590> and<00:00:50.860> just<00:00:51.010> letting<00:00:51.219> this<00:00:51.430> flow

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
this first and just letting this flow

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.470 
this first and just letting this flow
you<00:00:52.000> can<00:00:52.120> see<00:00:52.390> it<00:00:52.480> can<00:00:52.600> still<00:00:52.870> wiglet<00:00:53.289> okay<00:00:54.480> I'm

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
you can see it can still wiglet okay I'm

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.180 
you can see it can still wiglet okay I'm
not<00:00:55.750> really<00:00:55.899> putting<00:00:56.199> too<00:00:56.410> much<00:00:56.530> pressure<00:00:56.800> on

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
not really putting too much pressure on

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.150 
not really putting too much pressure on
this<00:00:57.340> on<00:00:57.670> this<00:00:58.030> wing<00:00:58.239> to<00:00:58.480> I<00:00:58.750> don't<00:00:59.620> want<00:00:59.890> to

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
this on this wing to I don't want to

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.279 
this on this wing to I don't want to
warp<00:01:00.430> this<00:01:00.670> I<00:01:00.879> really<00:01:01.480> want<00:01:01.629> to<00:01:01.719> keep<00:01:01.870> this<00:01:02.079> as

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
warp this I really want to keep this as

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.380 
warp this I really want to keep this as
straight<00:01:02.500> as<00:01:02.649> I<00:01:02.710> can<00:01:02.859> get<00:01:03.010> it<00:01:03.190> or<00:01:03.340> parallel<00:01:03.969> to

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
straight as I can get it or parallel to

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.090 
straight as I can get it or parallel to
the<00:01:04.510> sound<00:01:04.960> line<00:01:05.170> of<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.380> aircraft<00:01:05.860> okay<00:01:06.850> so

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the sound line of the aircraft okay so

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.800 
the sound line of the aircraft okay so
fitting<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.220> was<00:01:09.370> pretty<00:01:09.610> easy<00:01:09.820> if<00:01:10.510> you<00:01:10.660> can

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
fitting it was pretty easy if you can

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.400 
fitting it was pretty easy if you can
kind<00:01:11.020> of<00:01:11.200> see<00:01:11.680> I<00:01:11.710> know<00:01:11.920> it's<00:01:12.190> difficult<00:01:12.460> but

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
kind of see I know it's difficult but

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.490 
kind of see I know it's difficult but
this<00:01:14.410> edge<00:01:14.740> it<00:01:15.610> lays<00:01:15.880> right<00:01:15.910> in<00:01:16.450> there<00:01:16.660> and<00:01:16.960> and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
this edge it lays right in there and and

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.560 
this edge it lays right in there and and
how<00:01:17.620> I<00:01:17.650> did<00:01:18.010> that<00:01:18.190> was<00:01:18.810> nothing<00:01:19.810> magical<00:01:20.350> I

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
how I did that was nothing magical I

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.420 
how I did that was nothing magical I
basically<00:01:22.570> just<00:01:22.690> guessed<00:01:23.230> at<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.560> angle<00:01:23.920> so<00:01:24.400> I

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
basically just guessed at the angle so I

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.910 
basically just guessed at the angle so I
had<00:01:24.670> a<00:01:24.700> straight<00:01:25.030> tube<00:01:25.300> here<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:25.780> I<00:01:26.560> just<00:01:26.740> kind

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
had a straight tube here and I just kind

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.230 
had a straight tube here and I just kind
of<00:01:26.950> looked<00:01:27.130> at<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.310> angle<00:01:27.700> I<00:01:27.760> took<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:28.030> on<00:01:28.090> my

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
of looked at the angle I took it on my

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.660 
of looked at the angle I took it on my
disc<00:01:28.480> grinder<00:01:28.660> which<00:01:29.500> I<00:01:29.680> keep<00:01:29.920> next<00:01:30.370> to<00:01:30.490> me<00:01:30.580> at

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
disc grinder which I keep next to me at

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.570 
disc grinder which I keep next to me at
all<00:01:30.820> times<00:01:31.090> everywhere<00:01:31.900> I<00:01:31.960> go<00:01:32.260> I<00:01:32.530> move<00:01:33.160> my<00:01:33.340> disc

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
all times everywhere I go I move my disc

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.310 
all times everywhere I go I move my disc
grinder<00:01:33.790> around<00:01:34.330> okay

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
grinder around okay

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.120 
grinder around okay
you<00:01:36.130> can<00:01:36.310> just<00:01:36.490> see<00:01:36.730> I<00:01:37.650> had<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.680> build<00:01:38.920> some

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
you can just see I had to build some

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.800 
you can just see I had to build some
feet<00:01:39.370> cuz<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.610> previous<00:01:39.970> guy<00:01:40.150> built<00:01:40.450> this<00:01:40.660> out

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
feet cuz the previous guy built this out

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.240 
feet cuz the previous guy built this out
of<00:01:40.930> particle<00:01:41.170> board<00:01:41.470> which<00:01:41.710> was<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.890> big

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
of particle board which was a big

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.700 
of particle board which was a big
mistake<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.660> ends<00:01:43.900> got<00:01:44.080> kind<00:01:44.350> of<00:01:44.410> goofy

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
mistake and the ends got kind of goofy

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.230 
mistake and the ends got kind of goofy
so<00:01:44.890> I<00:01:44.920> just<00:01:45.160> threw<00:01:45.280> some<00:01:45.340> two<00:01:45.640> by<00:01:45.760> fours<00:01:46.030> on<00:01:46.150> the

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
so I just threw some two by fours on the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.640 
so I just threw some two by fours on the
bottom<00:01:46.600> built<00:01:46.810> another<00:01:47.020> base<00:01:47.260> but<00:01:48.330> I<00:01:49.650> dragged

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
bottom built another base but I dragged

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.260 
bottom built another base but I dragged
it<00:01:50.680> around<00:01:50.890> it<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.490> know<00:01:51.520> if<00:01:51.910> I'm<00:01:52.060> gonna<00:01:52.180> be

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
it around it you know if I'm gonna be

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.470 
it around it you know if I'm gonna be
working<00:01:52.570> I'll<00:01:53.410> say<00:01:53.740> over<00:01:53.980> here<00:01:54.310> I'll<00:01:54.850> drag<00:01:55.300> it

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
working I'll say over here I'll drag it

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.300 
working I'll say over here I'll drag it
right<00:01:55.510> next<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:56.020> me<00:01:56.110> that<00:01:56.950> way<00:01:57.070> it's<00:01:57.220> just

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
right next to me that way it's just

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.930 
right next to me that way it's just
handy<00:01:57.880> less<00:01:58.060> movement<00:01:58.390> but<00:01:59.290> I<00:01:59.650> just<00:02:00.340> ground

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
handy less movement but I just ground

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.640 
handy less movement but I just ground
climb<00:02:01.210> an<00:02:01.330> angle<00:02:01.660> I<00:02:01.780> set<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.140> up<00:02:02.230> there<00:02:02.500> and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
climb an angle I set it up there and

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.340 
climb an angle I set it up there and
said<00:02:02.860> I<00:02:02.890> should<00:02:03.130> take<00:02:03.370> off<00:02:03.580> a<00:02:03.610> little<00:02:03.850> more

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
said I should take off a little more

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.650 
said I should take off a little more
just<00:02:05.350> sander<00:02:05.740> boom<00:02:05.980> fixed<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.120> and<00:02:07.270> then<00:02:07.540> it

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
just sander boom fixed it and then it

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.870 
just sander boom fixed it and then it
kind<00:02:07.780> of<00:02:07.930> fit<00:02:08.140> well<00:02:08.320> and<00:02:08.800> then<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:09.250> just<00:02:09.550> let<00:02:09.729> the

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
kind of fit well and then I just let the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.370 
kind of fit well and then I just let the
ends<00:02:10.060> fly<00:02:10.390> long<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:10.930> let<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.410> go<00:02:11.560> past<00:02:11.940> okay

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
ends fly long I let it go past okay

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.240 
ends fly long I let it go past okay
now<00:02:13.740> obviously<00:02:14.370> if<00:02:15.330> it's<00:02:15.660> passed<00:02:16.040> in<00:02:17.040> its

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
now obviously if it's passed in its

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.160 
now obviously if it's passed in its
final<00:02:17.640> form<00:02:17.880> it'll<00:02:18.330> want<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.570> lay<00:02:18.660> down<00:02:18.690> more

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
final form it'll want to lay down more

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.320 
final form it'll want to lay down more
which<00:02:19.320> will<00:02:19.500> change<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:19.890> angle<00:02:20.190> but<00:02:20.580> you

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
which will change this angle but you

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.940 
which will change this angle but you
know<00:02:21.450> you're<00:02:21.990> gonna<00:02:22.110> kind<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.560> look<00:02:22.710> at<00:02:22.830> this

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
know you're gonna kind of look at this

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.490 
know you're gonna kind of look at this
and<00:02:23.160> say<00:02:23.340> hey<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.820> totally<00:02:24.600> see<00:02:24.780> what's<00:02:25.230> going

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
and say hey I totally see what's going

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.310 
and say hey I totally see what's going
on<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.010> you'll<00:02:26.370> adjust<00:02:26.490> accordingly

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
on here and you'll adjust accordingly

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.840 
on here and you'll adjust accordingly
there's<00:02:28.320> nothing<00:02:28.740> complicated<00:02:28.950> about<00:02:29.400> this

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
there's nothing complicated about this

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.300 
there's nothing complicated about this
I've<00:02:30.540> said<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:30.870> before<00:02:31.020> this<00:02:31.470> fuselage<00:02:32.010> in

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
I've said this before this fuselage in

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.490 
I've said this before this fuselage in
the<00:02:32.400> realm<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.700> airplanes<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.200> almost

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
the realm of airplanes this is almost

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.070 
the realm of airplanes this is almost
child<00:02:34.950> play<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.520> mean<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.300> fuselage<00:02:36.780> is

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
child play I mean that this fuselage is

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.630 
child play I mean that this fuselage is
that<00:02:37.290> simple<00:02:37.800> there's<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.400> nothing

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
that simple there's just nothing

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.740 
that simple there's just nothing
complicated<00:02:39.510> about<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:41.510> mean<00:02:42.510> I've<00:02:42.720> been

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
complicated about it I mean I've been

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.350 
complicated about it I mean I've been
working<00:02:43.200> on<00:02:43.320> this<00:02:43.500> for<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.770> week<00:02:44.090> about<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> week

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
working on this for a week about a week

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.180 
working on this for a week about a week
in<00:02:45.540> two<00:02:45.960> days<00:02:46.170> what<00:02:46.440> week<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.800> three<00:02:47.040> days

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
in two days what week in three days

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.470 
in two days what week in three days
maybe<00:02:48.350> if<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.530> take<00:02:49.740> away<00:02:50.390> building<00:02:51.390> the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
maybe if you take away building the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.570 
maybe if you take away building the
table<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.320> jigs<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.860> just<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.340> know<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
table and the jigs and just you know the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.750 
table and the jigs and just you know the
actual<00:02:53.820> fuselage<00:02:54.330> itself<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.140> got<00:02:56.010> less<00:02:56.730> than

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
actual fuselage itself I got less than

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.290 
actual fuselage itself I got less than
15<00:02:57.180> hours<00:02:57.950> into<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.490> I<00:02:59.520> mean<00:02:59.790> there's<00:03:00.180> no

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
15 hours into this so I mean there's no

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.380 
15 hours into this so I mean there's no
reason<00:03:00.920> not<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:01.980> build<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.670> few<00:03:03.150> slides

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
reason not to build a few slides

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.150 
reason not to build a few slides
yourself<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.990> mean<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.410> just<00:03:04.650> as<00:03:04.800> easy<00:03:04.980> as

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
yourself I mean this is just as easy as

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.230 
yourself I mean this is just as easy as
it<00:03:05.280> gets<00:03:05.520> you<00:03:05.880> know

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
it gets you know

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.950 
it gets you know
so<00:03:07.050> ah<00:03:07.320> but<00:03:08.220> that's<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:08.970> I'm<00:03:09.570> gonna<00:03:09.750> focus

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
so ah but that's that so I'm gonna focus

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.100 
so ah but that's that so I'm gonna focus
on<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.920> I'm<00:03:11.580> gonna<00:03:11.700> tack<00:03:12.480> weld<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.900> in

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
on that and I'm gonna tack weld that in

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.530 
on that and I'm gonna tack weld that in
okay<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:14.160> then<00:03:14.520> what<00:03:14.640> I'm<00:03:14.700> going<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:14.850> do<00:03:15.030> is

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
okay and then what I'm going to do is

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.470 
okay and then what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:03:15.750> going<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.430> put<00:03:17.430> these<00:03:17.610> angle<00:03:17.970> pieces<00:03:18.180> and

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
I'm going to put these angle pieces and

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.650 
I'm going to put these angle pieces and
then<00:03:18.600> go<00:03:18.720> back<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:18.960> here<00:03:19.560> okay<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.610> then<00:03:21.510> I'm

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
then go back to here okay and then I'm

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.300 
then go back to here okay and then I'm
gonna<00:03:21.780> have<00:03:21.990> to<00:03:22.080> come<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.650> grips<00:03:22.860> with<00:03:23.070> the

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
gonna have to come to grips with the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.790 
gonna have to come to grips with the
fact<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.850> got<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.090> cut<00:03:24.270> this<00:03:24.450> out<00:03:24.710> you<00:03:25.710> know

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
fact that I got to cut this out you know

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.650 
fact that I got to cut this out you know
I<00:03:25.860> kind<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.250> marked<00:03:26.520> it<00:03:26.670> there<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:26.910> might<00:03:27.210> go<00:03:27.510> in

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
I kind of marked it there I might go in

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.660 
I kind of marked it there I might go in
a<00:03:27.720> little<00:03:27.810> further<00:03:28.100> but<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.130> don't<00:03:29.400> want<00:03:29.520> to<00:03:29.580> go

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
a little further but I don't want to go

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.510 
a little further but I don't want to go
too<00:03:30.000> far<00:03:30.270> because<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.740> a<00:03:31.770> somewhat

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
too far because this this is a somewhat

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.140 
too far because this this is a somewhat
of<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.700> severe<00:03:33.120> angle<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:35.700> tubing

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
of a severe angle and so the tubing

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.880 
of a severe angle and so the tubing
probably<00:03:36.750> will<00:03:36.900> come<00:03:37.080> off<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.440> here<00:03:37.740> I'm

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
probably will come off to here I'm

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.490 
probably will come off to here I'm
guessing<00:03:38.450> by<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.480> time<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.750> don't<00:03:39.900> at<00:03:40.140> an<00:03:40.230> angle

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
guessing by the time I don't at an angle

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.020 
guessing by the time I don't at an angle
so<00:03:40.620> I'm<00:03:40.710> already<00:03:40.920> pretty<00:03:41.160> close<00:03:41.490> to<00:03:41.700> here<00:03:41.850> and

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
so I'm already pretty close to here and

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.540 
so I'm already pretty close to here and
then<00:03:42.990> maybe<00:03:43.380> I'll<00:03:43.560> weld<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.920> little<00:03:44.130> cap<00:03:44.340> on

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
then maybe I'll weld a little cap on

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.190 
then maybe I'll weld a little cap on
here<00:03:44.760> make<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.000> look<00:03:45.240> good<00:03:45.420> maybe<00:03:45.660> at<00:03:45.810> an<00:03:45.900> angle
