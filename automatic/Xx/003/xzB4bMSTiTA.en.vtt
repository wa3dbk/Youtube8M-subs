it's nice and smooth right across right

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.090 
it's nice and smooth right across right
so<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.150> when<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.450> move<00:02:28.720> across<00:02:28.989> I<00:02:29.470> move

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
so it's like when I move across I move

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.100 
so it's like when I move across I move
as<00:02:30.280> little<00:02:30.489> as<00:02:30.730> possible<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.540> my<00:02:31.870> hand

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
as little as possible and my hand

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.350 
as little as possible and my hand
doesn't<00:02:32.470> twist<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.980> way<00:02:33.130> out<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.549> my

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
doesn't twist on the way out and my

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.229 
doesn't twist on the way out and my
fingers<00:02:34.690> still<00:02:34.959> don't<00:02:35.530> move<00:02:36.190> like<00:02:36.489> radically

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
fingers still don't move like radically

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.009 
fingers still don't move like radically
or<00:02:37.540> erratic<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.950> know<00:02:39.069> it's<00:02:39.910> one<00:02:40.569> note<00:02:40.780> at<00:02:40.959> a

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
or erratic you know it's one note at a

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.140 
or erratic you know it's one note at a
time<00:02:43.320> nicely<00:02:44.320> nice<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.769> smooth<00:02:44.950> across<00:02:45.190> and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
time nicely nice and smooth across and

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.030 
time nicely nice and smooth across and
notice<00:02:46.480> my<00:02:46.690> hand<00:02:46.930> does<00:02:47.140> not<00:02:47.170> twist<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.950> my

thumb doesn't wrap around my thumb's
actually<00:02:50.500> behind<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:51.100> fretboard<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:52.410> I

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
actually behind the fretboard and I

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.900 
actually behind the fretboard and I
don't<00:02:53.470> use<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.920> flat<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.310> my<00:02:54.400> thumb<00:02:54.609> I'm<00:02:54.760> using

chromatic scale that I'm using here it's

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.759 
chromatic scale that I'm using here it's
just<00:03:35.250> four<00:03:36.250> fingers<00:03:36.700> for<00:03:37.540> each<00:03:37.630> string<00:03:38.139> four

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
just four fingers for each string four

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.910 
just four fingers for each string four
frats<00:03:39.100> force<00:03:39.519> you<00:03:39.970> know<00:03:40.090> so<00:03:40.410> it's<00:03:41.410> not<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.620> pure

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
frats force you know so it's not a pure

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.729 
frats force you know so it's not a pure
chromatic<00:03:42.459> scale<00:03:42.730> that's<00:03:43.000> for<00:03:43.209> sure<00:03:43.739> pure

the<00:03:46.420> notes<00:03:46.600> I'm<00:03:46.810> missing<00:03:47.140> but<00:03:47.319> this<00:03:47.739> is<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:47.950> good

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
the notes I'm missing but this is a good

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:53.550 
the notes I'm missing but this is a good
exercise<00:03:48.519> and<00:03:48.790> it's<00:03:49.209> use<00:03:52.319> trying<00:03:53.319> to<00:03:53.349> keep

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
exercise and it's use trying to keep

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.410 
exercise and it's use trying to keep
your<00:03:53.680> fingers<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.129> a<00:03:54.159> minimum<00:03:54.640> of<00:03:54.790> movement<00:03:55.239> I

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
your fingers to a minimum of movement I

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.780 
your fingers to a minimum of movement I
mean<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.989> depends<00:03:56.409> on<00:03:56.530> what<00:03:56.650> I'm<00:03:56.769> doing<00:03:56.799> but

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
mean it depends on what I'm doing but

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.160 
mean it depends on what I'm doing but
when<00:03:57.940> I'm<00:03:58.030> practicing<00:03:58.269> when<00:03:58.870> I'm<00:03:58.959> actually

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
when I'm practicing when I'm actually

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.070 
when I'm practicing when I'm actually
just<00:03:59.440> practicing<00:04:00.190> this<00:04:00.310> scale<00:04:00.670> I'm

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
just practicing this scale I'm

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.119 
just practicing this scale I'm
concentrating<00:04:02.080> on<00:04:02.170> moving<00:04:02.500> my<00:04:02.620> fingers<00:04:02.950> as

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
concentrating on moving my fingers as

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.050 
concentrating on moving my fingers as
little<00:04:03.400> as<00:04:03.519> possible<00:04:05.220> last<00:04:06.220> movement<00:04:06.790> means

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
little as possible last movement means

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.910 
little as possible last movement means
more<00:04:07.360> efficiency<00:04:08.080> it<00:04:08.140> means<00:04:08.409> you<00:04:08.590> can<00:04:08.769> move

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
more efficiency it means you can move

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.929 
more efficiency it means you can move
faster<00:04:09.159> in<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.640> end

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
faster in the end

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.199

you this will be fast but for me it's

scale<00:04:20.409> for<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.680> long<00:04:20.890> time<00:04:21.220> right<00:04:22.169> so<00:04:23.169> you'll

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
scale for a long time right so you'll

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.930 
scale for a long time right so you'll
notice<00:04:23.560> how<00:04:23.740> nice<00:04:23.919> to<00:04:24.130> square<00:04:24.490> this<00:04:24.640> my

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.810 
course said learn to move them up the
fretboard<00:04:35.229> I'll<00:04:35.560> start<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.070> scale<00:04:36.340> first<00:04:36.640> on

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
fretboard I'll start the scale first on

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.110 
fretboard I'll start the scale first on
a<00:04:36.849> Down<00:04:37.120> stroke<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.840> because<00:04:38.820> we've<00:04:39.820> got<00:04:40.030> an

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
a Down stroke and because we've got an

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.899 
a Down stroke and because we've got an
even<00:04:40.479> amount<00:04:40.570> of<00:04:40.870> notes<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:42.610> know<00:04:42.700> by<00:04:42.849> the

even amount of notes you know by the

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.909 
even amount of notes you know by the

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
time I get to the the end of the scale

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.040 
time I get to the the end of the scale
back<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.550> starting<00:04:46.000> note<00:04:46.180> I'll<00:04:46.630> have<00:04:47.020> a

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
back to the starting note I'll have a

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.050 
back to the starting note I'll have a
Down<00:04:47.409> stroke<00:04:47.830> right<00:04:48.130> so<00:04:48.400> I'll<00:04:48.520> go<00:04:48.669> all<00:04:48.789> through

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
Down stroke right so I'll go all through

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.500 
Down stroke right so I'll go all through
this<00:04:49.210> scale<00:04:49.539> when<00:04:50.140> I<00:04:50.169> get<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.150> end<00:04:52.270> of<00:04:52.419> the

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
scale it's on a Down stroke now I'm

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.339 
scale it's on a Down stroke now I'm
moving<00:04:54.729> up<00:04:54.849> a<00:04:54.940> fret<00:04:55.210> I<00:04:55.360> start<00:04:55.720> on<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:55.900> upstroke

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
moving up a fret I start on the upstroke

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.200 
moving up a fret I start on the upstroke
and<00:04:57.010> I'll<00:04:57.159> go<00:04:57.340> through<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.669> whole<00:04:57.700> scale

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
and I'll go through the whole scale

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.260 
and I'll go through the whole scale
again<00:04:58.599> you<00:04:59.590> know<00:04:59.880> starting<00:05:00.880> with<00:05:00.970> an<00:05:01.120> AB

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
again you know starting with an AB

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.510 
again you know starting with an AB
stroke<00:05:01.599> and<00:05:01.870> I'll<00:05:02.050> end<00:05:02.380> with<00:05:02.710> an<00:05:03.070> AB<00:05:03.190> stroke

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
stroke and I'll end with an AB stroke

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.029 
stroke and I'll end with an AB stroke
that<00:05:03.760> means<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.240> next<00:05:04.450> time<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:05.530> next<00:05:05.560> fret

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
starting to scale with a Down stroke and

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.890 
starting to scale with a Down stroke and
enough<00:05:12.490> stroke<00:05:12.820> and<00:05:13.090> that's<00:05:13.210> a<00:05:13.300> good<00:05:13.419> habit<00:05:13.810> to

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
enough stroke and that's a good habit to
