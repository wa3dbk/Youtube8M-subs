00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
knew I would be pretty well but someone

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.509

showed me this the other day and I was
amazed<00:00:08.849> because<00:00:09.179> it's<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:10.260> huge<00:00:10.710> time<00:00:10.769> saver<00:00:11.460> if

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
amazed because it's a huge time saver if

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.039 
amazed because it's a huge time saver if
you<00:00:11.639> want<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.820> do<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:11.969> sort<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.210> thing<00:00:12.389> there

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
you want to do this sort of thing there

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.620 
you want to do this sort of thing there
are<00:00:13.170> times<00:00:13.410> when<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.740> want<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:13.950> create<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.630> like

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
are times when you want to create a like

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.650 
are times when you want to create a like
a<00:00:15.660> slideshow<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.910> want<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.270> slides<00:00:18.510> to

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
a slideshow and you want the slides to

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.250 
a slideshow and you want the slides to
actually<00:00:18.930> change<00:00:19.140> exactly<00:00:19.710> on<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.890> beat<00:00:20.070> so

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
actually change exactly on the beat so

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.540 
actually change exactly on the beat so
it<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.410> be<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> bit<00:00:22.740> tedious<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.189> do<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
it can be a bit tedious to do that the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.189 
it can be a bit tedious to do that the
long<00:00:23.699> way<00:00:23.820> because<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.330> basically<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:25.140> to

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
long way because you basically have to

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.660 
long way because you basically have to
listen<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> music<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.010> trim<00:00:26.310> beyond<00:00:26.519> each

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
listen to the music and trim beyond each

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.000 
listen to the music and trim beyond each
one<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.210> fit<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.449> music<00:00:27.810> exactly<00:00:28.230> I'll<00:00:28.769> show

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
one to fit the music exactly I'll show

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.919 
one to fit the music exactly I'll show

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
want them so make sure that's turned off

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.139 
want them so make sure that's turned off
and<00:00:46.620> also<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.070> probably<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.670> don't<00:00:47.850> want<00:00:48.090> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
and also just probably I don't want a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.819 
and also just probably I don't want a
theme<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.840> one<00:00:49.020> said<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.620> none

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
theme for this this one said it to none

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.639 
theme for this this one said it to none
so<00:00:50.239> with<00:00:51.239> those<00:00:51.420> settings<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.110> create

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
so with those settings so they create

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.709 
so with those settings so they create
and<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.670> gives<00:00:53.789> me<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> new<00:00:54.149> project<00:00:54.360> with

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
and it gives me a new project with

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.680 
and it gives me a new project with
nothing<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.110> now<00:00:56.239> normally<00:00:57.239> you'd<00:00:57.420> put<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
nothing in it now normally you'd put the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.810 
nothing in it now normally you'd put the
photos<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.230> ignore<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> way<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> used<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.640> do<00:00:59.730> it

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
photos in ignore the way I used to do it

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.430 
photos in ignore the way I used to do it
we<00:00:59.910> split<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> photos<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.899> then<00:01:01.199> put<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
we split the photos in and then put the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.750 
we split the photos in and then put the
music<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.370> try<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.579> make

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
music in and then try and make

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.549 
music in and then try and make
everything<00:01:02.969> fit<00:01:03.180> together<00:01:03.409> it's<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> much

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
everything fit together it's a much

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.660 
everything fit together it's a much
better<00:01:04.739> way<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.640> just

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
better way to do it and that is just

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.580 
better way to do it and that is just
start<00:01:06.119> with<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.360> music<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> click

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
start with the music it's going to click

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.240 
start with the music it's going to click
on<00:01:07.770> my<00:01:08.430> music<00:01:08.820> browser<00:01:09.780> down<00:01:09.930> here<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:11.010> I'm

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
on my music browser down here and I'm

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.440 
on my music browser down here and I'm
going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> go<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.729> pick<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> piece<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.210> music

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
going to go and pick a piece of music

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.700 
going to go and pick a piece of music
it's<00:01:12.540> got<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> bit<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> beat<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.590> this

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
it's got a bit of a beat to it so this

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.190 
it's got a bit of a beat to it so this
one<00:01:13.920> cha-cha<00:01:14.790> kuba<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.540> example<00:01:15.960> I'm<00:01:16.170> going

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
one cha-cha kuba for example I'm going

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.690 
one cha-cha kuba for example I'm going
to<00:01:16.409> take<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.890> drag<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:17.430> into<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
to take that and drag it up into the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.840 
to take that and drag it up into the
project<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.600> there<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.439> there<00:01:19.680> now<00:01:20.009> if

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
project and there it is there now if

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.240 
project and there it is there now if
you've<00:01:21.000> used<00:01:21.119> iMovie<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.630> know<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.140> if<00:01:23.040> you

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you've used iMovie you know that if you

what<00:03:36.930> happens<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.530> these<00:03:37.950> as<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.520> music<00:03:38.820> plays

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.539 

maybe<00:03:57.170> my<00:03:57.349> tapping<00:03:57.709> wasn't<00:03:57.980> so<00:03:58.099> great<00:03:58.340> on<00:03:58.519> the

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
maybe my tapping wasn't so great on the

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.539 
maybe my tapping wasn't so great on the
beat<00:03:58.849> but<00:03:58.879> you<00:03:59.120> get<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.390> idea<00:03:59.560> then<00:04:00.560> slides

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
beat but you get the idea then slides

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.039 
beat but you get the idea then slides
will<00:04:01.700> actually<00:04:01.969> change<00:04:02.239> wherever<00:04:02.719> you<00:04:02.810> put<00:04:02.989> a

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
will actually change wherever you put a

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.390 
will actually change wherever you put a
beat<00:04:03.260> marker<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:03.859> it<00:04:03.920> just<00:04:04.099> does<00:04:04.280> it

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
beat marker and it just does it

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.190 
beat marker and it just does it
automatically<00:04:04.879> so<00:04:05.599> it's<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.810> really<00:04:05.989> simple

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
automatically so it's a really simple

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.099 
automatically so it's a really simple
process<00:04:06.379> to<00:04:06.890> get<00:04:07.069> that<00:04:07.250> sort<00:04:07.459> of<00:04:07.519> that<00:04:07.670> catchy

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
process to get that sort of that catchy

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.559 
process to get that sort of that catchy
very<00:04:09.109> quick<00:04:09.260> changing<00:04:09.879> imagery<00:04:10.879> to<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.420> beat

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
very quick changing imagery to the beat

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.930 
very quick changing imagery to the beat
of<00:04:11.599> some<00:04:11.810> music
