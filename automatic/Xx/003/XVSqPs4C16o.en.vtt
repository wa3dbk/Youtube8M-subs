00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
for them now I'm thinking you just might

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.120 
for them now I'm thinking you just might
be<00:01:42.810> able<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.109> accommodate<00:01:43.590> them<00:01:43.709> after<00:01:44.100> all

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
be able to accommodate them after all

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.809 
be able to accommodate them after all
she<00:01:44.609> says<00:01:44.819> with<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> grin<00:01:45.389> we<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.499> you<00:01:46.740> say<00:01:46.979> we

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
she says with a grin we can you say we
