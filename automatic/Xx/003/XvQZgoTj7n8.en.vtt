hello<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.040> shuttling<00:00:02.840> 773<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.020> I'm

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
hello this is shuttling 773 and I'm

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.249 
hello this is shuttling 773 and I'm
doing<00:00:04.680> another<00:00:05.460> transformers<00:00:06.240> review<00:00:06.540> and

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
doing another transformers review and

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.140 
doing another transformers review and
this<00:00:07.710> one<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.360> Autobot<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:10.110> it's<00:00:10.800> me<00:00:11.219> Lego

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
this one is Autobot and it's me Lego

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.330 
this one is Autobot and it's me Lego
Optimus<00:00:12.809> Prime<00:00:15.410> so<00:00:16.410> he's<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> pocket<00:00:17.100> model

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
Optimus Prime so he's a pocket model

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.439 
Optimus Prime so he's a pocket model
although<00:00:17.570> he<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.840> much<00:00:19.230> bigger<00:00:20.300> vehicle<00:00:21.300> mode

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
although he is much bigger vehicle mode

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.429 
although he is much bigger vehicle mode
and<00:00:21.720> some<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.769> my<00:00:22.800> other<00:00:23.250> transformers<00:00:24.439> like

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
and some of my other transformers like

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:34.810 
and some of my other transformers like
for<00:00:25.800> example<00:00:27.230> compared<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:30.380> blackouts<00:00:33.620> he

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
for example compared to blackouts he

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.610 
for example compared to blackouts he
there<00:00:35.820> about<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.390> same<00:00:36.420> width<00:00:37.850> although<00:00:39.620> he's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
there about the same width although he's

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.970 
there about the same width although he's
much<00:00:40.980> longer<00:00:41.550> blackout<00:00:42.559> mostly<00:00:43.559> cuz<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
much longer blackout mostly cuz the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.130 
much longer blackout mostly cuz the
front<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> car<00:00:45.350> compared<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> another<00:00:46.500> 10

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
front of the car compared to another 10

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.650 
front of the car compared to another 10
scrapper<00:00:50.000> scrappers<00:00:51.000> another<00:00:51.300> big<00:00:51.510> one

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
scrapper scrappers another big one

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.840 
scrapper scrappers another big one
that's<00:00:51.840> why<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:53.039> these<00:00:53.190> ones<00:00:53.430> are<00:00:53.579> probably

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
that's why so these ones are probably

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.700 
that's why so these ones are probably
like<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> same<00:00:54.800> length<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.809> again<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.530> doesn't

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
like the same length so again it doesn't

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.889 
like the same length so again it doesn't
have<00:00:58.890> any<00:00:59.190> wheels<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.820> roll<00:01:00.059> although<00:01:00.629> I

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
have any wheels that can roll although I

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.429 
have any wheels that can roll although I
could<00:01:01.500> add<00:01:01.829> some<00:01:01.859> wheels<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:03.270> little<00:01:04.260> black

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
could add some wheels here little black

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.240 
could add some wheels here little black
circles<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.450> back<00:01:06.740> well<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:08.100> add

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
circles and in the back well I just add

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.109 
circles and in the back well I just add
these<00:01:09.240> aren't<00:01:10.020> exactly<00:01:10.380> round<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.820> they<00:01:11.970> look

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
these aren't exactly round but they look

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.070 
these aren't exactly round but they look
like<00:01:12.270> wheels<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.810> yeah<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.040> window<00:01:14.430> here

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
like wheels so yeah it's a window here

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.940 
like wheels so yeah it's a window here
there's<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> big<00:01:16.380> front<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> car<00:01:17.460> hood<00:01:18.950> so

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
there's the big front of the car hood so

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.870 
there's the big front of the car hood so
yeah<00:01:21.049> you<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.670> transform<00:01:23.670> Optimus<00:01:24.570> Prime

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
yeah you know transform Optimus Prime

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.420 
yeah you know transform Optimus Prime
first<00:01:27.409> you<00:01:28.460> take<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.150> split<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.960> half

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
first you take this and split it in half

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:39.260 
first you take this and split it in half
and<00:01:32.630> put<00:01:35.060> like<00:01:36.079> this<00:01:37.700> now<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.759> take<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.210> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and put like this now you take all of

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.050 
and put like this now you take all of
this<00:01:39.659> down<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.950> put<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.310> down<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.610> that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
this down here and put it down like that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.490 
this down here and put it down like that
and<00:01:43.640> see<00:01:44.640> how<00:01:44.670> he's<00:01:44.880> pretty<00:01:45.420> tall<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.409> you

really good i say so yeah another size
comparisons<00:02:39.450> with<00:02:42.150> scrapper<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:44.019> robot<00:02:44.530> mode

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
comparisons with scrapper and robot mode

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.819 
comparisons with scrapper and robot mode
second<00:02:46.900> let<00:02:47.379> me<00:02:47.409> transform<00:02:49.829> scrappers

second let me transform scrappers

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:58.170 
second let me transform scrappers
another<00:02:51.159> big<00:02:51.669> one<00:02:53.129> so<00:02:54.129> i<00:02:56.189> move<00:02:57.189> out<00:02:57.519> there
