00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
that time there's a bit of a look

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.850 
that time there's a bit of a look
element<00:01:21.000> into<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.720> suppose<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.619> just

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
element into this one suppose this just

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.560 
element into this one suppose this just
depends<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.610> whether<00:01:23.759> there's<00:01:24.030> an<00:01:24.150> enemy<00:01:24.270> down

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
probably gonna kill them it's actually a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.440 
probably gonna kill them it's actually a
good<00:01:31.950> idea<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.729> sneak<00:01:32.970> into<00:01:33.240> that

around gun people down from the air it's
actually<00:03:23.049> not<00:03:23.199> the<00:03:23.349> most<00:03:23.379> effective<00:03:24.540> pickup

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
actually not the most effective pickup

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.800 
actually not the most effective pickup
in<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.780> game<00:03:26.049> really<00:03:26.500> but<00:03:27.069> you<00:03:27.970> should<00:03:28.720> be

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
in the game really but you should be

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.180 
in the game really but you should be

trying<00:03:30.459> you<00:03:30.849> could<00:03:31.120> always<00:03:31.269> go<00:03:31.449> for<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.629> road

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
trying you could always go for the road

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.530 
trying you could always go for the road

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
with this weapon it's also really good

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.839

for taking out choppers and the last one

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.479 
for taking out choppers and the last one
you've<00:04:01.239> got<00:04:01.269> to<00:04:01.449> get<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.599> kill<00:04:01.780> with<00:04:01.930> the

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
you've got to get a kill with the

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.050 
you've got to get a kill with the
shipping<00:04:03.489> of<00:04:03.609> 42<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:06.040> really<00:04:06.639> can<00:04:06.790> really

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
shipping of 42 and I really can really

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.689 
shipping of 42 and I really can really
shit<00:04:07.239> at<00:04:07.389> saying<00:04:07.540> these<00:04:07.750> but<00:04:08.109> shit<00:04:08.919> not<00:04:09.129> 42<00:04:09.549> I

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
shit at saying these but shit not 42 I

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.550 
shit at saying these but shit not 42 I
think<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:10.209> and<00:04:10.389> that's<00:04:11.139> basically<00:04:11.470> the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
think it is and that's basically the

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.249 
think it is and that's basically the
little<00:04:11.970> it's<00:04:12.970> like<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.120> little<00:04:13.389> shotgun<00:04:13.659> turret

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:14.259 
little it's like a little shotgun turret

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:18.089 
little it's like a little shotgun turret
you<00:04:14.979> can<00:04:15.159> find<00:04:15.430> around<00:04:15.879> the<00:04:16.389> maps<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.859> you<00:04:17.919> sit

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
you can find around the maps so you sit

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.560 
you can find around the maps so you sit
in<00:04:18.190> these<00:04:18.280> little<00:04:18.489> turrets<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.090> you<00:04:19.449> can

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
in these little turrets and you can

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.019 
in these little turrets and you can
guard<00:04:19.810> areas<00:04:20.259> and<00:04:20.530> it<00:04:21.159> fires<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.549> load<00:04:21.700> of<00:04:21.849> like

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:22.029 
guard areas and it fires a load of like

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.570 
guard areas and it fires a load of like
bullets<00:04:22.659> and<00:04:22.810> pellets<00:04:23.139> and<00:04:23.289> things<00:04:23.529> just<00:04:24.400> try

trophy and it's basically a lot like

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.160 
trophy and it's basically a lot like
some<00:04:36.850> of<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.000> other<00:04:37.150> DLCs<00:04:37.510> where<00:04:37.750> you<00:04:37.840> have<00:04:38.020> to

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
some of the other DLCs where you have to

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.430 
some of the other DLCs where you have to
complete<00:04:38.710> all<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.190> assignments<00:04:39.960> now<00:04:40.960> this<00:04:41.290> is

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
complete all the assignments now this is

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.010 
complete all the assignments now this is
quite<00:04:41.740> tricky<00:04:42.070> because<00:04:42.660> assignments<00:04:43.660> aren't

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
quite tricky because assignments aren't

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.270 
quite tricky because assignments aren't
the<00:04:44.080> easiest<00:04:44.440> to<00:04:44.650> get<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:44.950> I'm<00:04:45.010> going<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.190> go

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
the easiest to get and I'm going to go

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.610 
the easiest to get and I'm going to go
over<00:04:45.310> all<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:45.820> assignments<00:04:46.090> next<00:04:46.620> probably

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
over all the assignments next probably

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.930 
over all the assignments next probably
gonna<00:04:47.830> be<00:04:48.010> one<00:04:48.220> of<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.370> more<00:04:48.520> time-consuming

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
gonna be one of the more time-consuming

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.990 
gonna be one of the more time-consuming
ones<00:04:50.070> okay<00:04:51.070> so<00:04:51.130> there's<00:04:51.400> a<00:04:51.460> total<00:04:51.580> of<00:04:51.760> eight

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
ones okay so there's a total of eight

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.900 
ones okay so there's a total of eight
assignments<00:04:52.810> in<00:04:53.110> the<00:04:53.560> final<00:04:53.890> stand<00:04:54.100> DLC<00:04:54.160> the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
assignments in the final stand DLC the
