00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 see which model we allow 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.069
 buy an apartment in new building 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.840
 I'm worth for example for example 2 million 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.750
 rubles 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.199
 for example 2 million rubles a and 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.050
 of these first installment we make well 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.560
 let's say 15 percent is empty three hundred thousand 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.490
 rubles 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.810
 credit loan we get 85 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.820
 percent 1 million 700 thousand rubles in 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.769
 In general, everything is clear the standard is necessary now 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.200
 imagine the apartments lined up 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.559
 Itâ€™s been there a full year and a half 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.809
 apartment rose in price that is if you 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.100
 well picked up 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.200
 the apartment is worth three 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.250
 million rubles or even more especially 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.320
 if you made a repair 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.510
 but let's even take spare you 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.660
 made repair 3 million 400 too 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.340
 standing now 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.620
 who can calculate how much now 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.870
 what percentage of the apartment is that is 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.180
 we still have a loan of the same million 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.850
 Seven hundred, that is, how much do we have? 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.610
 apartments and leave at this moment laid 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.320
 50 percent is correct 50 percent 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.350
 the apartment is laid that is what we can 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.450
 do we come to the bank talking about 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.060
 can you finance us back 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.400
 i.e. 50 percent 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.040
 transfer back that is to sell more 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.780
 money out so i will have mortgaged 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.850
 85 percent of the apartments then now 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.090
 have they give us extra under 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.369
 bail the same apartment number 85 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.200
 percent of 3,400 how much is 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.320
 But who can count 85 now 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.570
 percent of 3-4 st well, roughly this is about 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.560
 3 million probably it will be right 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:52.799
 I think so maybe 2 900 although will give 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:55.530
 45 there are no four fifths so if 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.439
 calculator 2 890 but 2 900 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.430
 only look now we can pull out 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.600
 one million 200 thousand rubles 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.269
 few 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.769
 clear idea that is, we look 

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:13.010
 we are doing this 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.170
 refinancing ie we seem to be 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.190
 nothing but what we have bought an apartment and 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.010
 need to be built 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.730
 and we because of the same apartment she stays 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.480
 for us we pass it continue to pass and 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.000
 still see you speak correctly when 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.849
 provided there is a credit limit but we 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.819
 what are you doing, my friends, we are doing this 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.250
 we are starting to rent an apartment and this apartment 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.530
 brings us additional income income 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.319
 let her bring us then we 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.690
 pitched to the studio let her bring 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.129
 35,000 rubles and what do you think 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.290
 up to extra income 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.329
 confirmed you are official 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.459
 officially you will take everything in 35 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.590
 thousand rubles how much extra 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.450
 loan you can take if you 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.849
 bring an additional 35,000 rubles 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.989
 How much credit do you need for this? 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.910
 will allocate more but under it officially 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.500
 monthly income confirmed you 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.380
 there are lease agreements that you 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.790
 taking about more really then 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.420
 there is this about one and a half two million 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.799
 approximately under the extra money well, well 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.889
 let's simplify half a million 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.139
 a million and a half 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:23.389
 approximately because it is an income which 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:27.709
 already going beyond your basic income then 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:30.319
 there we are we have this asset 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.239
 creates us a cash flow under which 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.419
 we can continue to be credited plus with us 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.299
 there is a pledge that we have a pledge under 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:40.010
 which we can pull out ie we 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.380
 pull us out this apartment brings 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.690
 cash flow plus is whether we want it 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.000
 also gives us a bunch of cash on 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.209
 which we can next let me you 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.230
 Further diagram on show if you are active 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:58.310
 investor come out a million two hundred you crush 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.780
 let's say for 3 piles of 400 thousand and 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.780
 buy four more objects 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:08.510
 why because we have a down payment then 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.519
 300 thousand and what happens is that we from 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.310
 single object here if further you 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.370
 seriously go but how would you get carried away 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.570
 by investing you will see that in 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.730
 investing we are with you tomorrow 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.680
 the project will be difficult to start 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.240
 But it's really hard to start because 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.040
 that in the beginning it is necessary to invest 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.620
 tear away from everyday life some 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.710
 money but further than that the more you 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.030
 gaining momentum and the easier it is for you 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.070
 becomes because you appear 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.320
 objects under which you can take more 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.480
 money under which you appear 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.280
 additional income and so on that is 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.110
 my bank show that we rent an apartment in 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.170
 mortgage rent same above bank agree 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.290
 Before you need to agree Michael formally 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:51.370
 but what really happens is that 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:54.230
 no one usually agrees on this matter and 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.780
 One important jar is that you regularly 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.210
 paid as long as you are stable 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.880
 pay no questions to you no one 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.980
 asks questions can only be in 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.350
 the moment you start but if you don't 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.450
 pay on time then yes then the bank 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.730
 can make claims but in 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.320
 Basically, I'm in all the banks I have 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.600
 I asked what I can and rent 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.040
 no problem can produce unity 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.170
 does not require additional fear 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.520
 extra some kind of insurance in 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:25.120
 this case is so clear yes 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.120
 model
