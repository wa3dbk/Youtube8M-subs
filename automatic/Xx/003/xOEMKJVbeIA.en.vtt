00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello everyone so I introduce you 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.330
 a video today that will consist 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.980
 a worker the tip of your days by 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.009
 example yssingeaux passionate def jam 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.809
 Frankfurt New York Date of 2005 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.510
 so the weather is wreaking havoc 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.380
 see the box very well 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.369
 the plastic is very dirty so me 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.000
 I like to see clean boxes that's 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.099
 still nice 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.980
 I will show you how to clean 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.539
 so already I advise to take the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.830
 same as me it works very well I do not 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.410
 do not know if the others have me as well 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:41.969
 another having fast starbucks with alcohol 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:44.940
 so a spray was enough a 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.879
 time is not enough to take 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.750
 special rags so the fault is fine 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.250
 distributed did well if you 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.360
 want to really have a result 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:02.430
 effective you spend a second life 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.870
 authorization will be even better at the end 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.030
 thirty seconds of receipts 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.740
 fear here is the dry cdu 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.450
 it's really very slippery honestly 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.390
 there is no picture it's really 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.189
 ultra smooth compared there was so there 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.710
 this is what has given particular side 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.780
 traces of scratches 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.630
 by dint of having stacked game there it was 3 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.960
 of labels that I have not removed but 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.560
 the game found is his late box 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.280
 July is fine he is very clean 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.119
 and smooth we really hear the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.119
 difference in sound 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.110
 the dirty side cotter clean 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.970
 so I did that on the games 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.700
 playstation 2 grand theft auto san 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.630
 andreas fault city but also those of 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.450
 right on a center a revelation 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.500
 still grow all 4 so I'll you 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.880
 advise to do that if you want 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.740
 sell games including via a cro 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.390
 way you will have a better chance of 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.130
 sell a game in the box is clean 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.110
 that only has one game of the ray box 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.310
 really dirty it gives me month by month 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.280
 for example it would not want me 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.930
 to buy a game whose box is dirty 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.050
 so once the man so if you 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.470
 want to do his method in glass 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:23.580
 handkerchiefs do you apply that on 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.660
 the box and rubs about thirty 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.730
 seconds let you dry then it's 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.850
 good I advise you to do this or a 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.200
 once a year is enough then you will keep 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.390
 one of the woods deposit boxes of young people 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:40.220
 men a pretty good and a blind and 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.220
 staring at this hi video
