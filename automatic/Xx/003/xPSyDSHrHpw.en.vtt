check out what that does so let's try

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.010 
check out what that does so let's try
out<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
out the

out the
other<00:02:13.170> app<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:14.010> can<00:02:14.040> see<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.340> it

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
other app and you can see that it

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.730 
other app and you can see that it
basically<00:02:14.700> just<00:02:14.970> gives<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.630> brighter<00:02:16.020> look

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
this was the dark gray before now it's

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.720 
this was the dark gray before now it's
more<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:18.840> white<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:20.130> let's<00:02:20.340> go<00:02:20.430> back<00:02:20.460> into

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
more just white so let's go back into

faster animation so if you want to speed

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.160 
faster animation so if you want to speed
it<00:02:24.060> up<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.240> bit<00:02:24.270> then<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.660> can<00:02:24.810> do<00:02:24.960> that<00:02:25.140> right

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
open for other developers to make

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.070 
open for other developers to make
plugins<00:03:02.550> for<00:03:02.850> this<00:03:03.030> particular<00:03:03.180> tweak<00:03:03.870> so

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
plugins for this particular tweak so

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.630 
plugins for this particular tweak so
that's<00:03:04.590> really<00:03:04.860> nice<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.160> always<00:03:05.310> have

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
that's really nice to always have

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.490 
that's really nice to always have
especially<00:03:06.090> when<00:03:06.690> it's<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.870> tweak<00:03:07.080> like<00:03:07.260> this

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
especially when it's a tweak like this

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.830 
especially when it's a tweak like this
people<00:03:07.950> have<00:03:08.160> preferences<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:08.970> would<00:03:09.600> really

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
people have preferences and would really

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.090 
people have preferences and would really
like<00:03:09.990> to<00:03:10.080> have<00:03:10.170> specialized<00:03:10.650> views<00:03:10.890> for

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
like to have specialized views for

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.370 
like to have specialized views for
specific<00:03:11.580> applications<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:12.390> possibly<00:03:12.900> the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
specific applications that possibly the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.990 
specific applications that possibly the
developer<00:03:13.860> isn't<00:03:14.190> going<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.490> have<00:03:14.640> time<00:03:14.940> to

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
developer isn't going to have time to

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.840 
developer isn't going to have time to
just<00:03:15.270> you<00:03:15.660> know<00:03:15.690> do<00:03:16.260> for<00:03:16.500> every<00:03:16.800> single<00:03:17.220> app<00:03:17.400> so

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
just you know do for every single app so

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.370 
just you know do for every single app so
it's<00:03:17.970> really<00:03:18.120> nice<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.360> have<00:03:18.660> something<00:03:19.230> like

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
it's really nice to have something like

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.199 
it's really nice to have something like
this<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.740> allows<00:03:20.100> other<00:03:20.400> developers<00:03:20.970> to

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
this that allows other developers to

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.640 
this that allows other developers to
make<00:03:21.240> those<00:03:21.660> specialized<00:03:22.080> views<00:03:22.380> for

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
make those specialized views for

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.900 
make those specialized views for
applications<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.490> then<00:03:23.580> we<00:03:23.700> can<00:03:23.880> just

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
applications and then we can just

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.030 
applications and then we can just
install<00:03:24.300> them<00:03:24.630> as<00:03:24.780> users<00:03:25.170> then<00:03:25.830> right<00:03:26.010> down

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
install them as users then right down

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.980 
install them as users then right down
here<00:03:26.340> we<00:03:26.459> also<00:03:26.610> have<00:03:26.850> velox<00:03:27.209> do<00:03:27.420> for<00:03:27.600> app<00:03:27.720> so

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
here we also have velox do for app so

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.080 
here we also have velox do for app so
choose<00:03:28.350> which<00:03:28.650> velox<00:03:29.100> view<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.820> would<00:03:29.910> like

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
choose which velox view you would like

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.670 
choose which velox view you would like
to<00:03:30.240> have<00:03:30.360> for<00:03:30.600> each<00:03:30.720> app<00:03:30.990> so<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:31.470> another

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
to have for each app so this is another

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.590 
to have for each app so this is another
really<00:03:31.920> cool<00:03:32.190> thing<00:03:32.250> so<00:03:32.700> right<00:03:33.150> here<00:03:33.360> we<00:03:33.480> have

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
really cool thing so right here we have

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.900 
really cool thing so right here we have
notification<00:03:34.230> view<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.890> we<00:03:34.980> also<00:03:35.130> have<00:03:35.280> velox

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
notification view and we also have velox

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.400 
notification view and we also have velox
amazon<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:36.540> this<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.780> basically<00:03:36.900> where<00:03:37.260> you're

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
amazon so this is basically where you're

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.980 
amazon so this is basically where you're
going<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.770> select<00:03:38.250> what<00:03:39.209> plug-in<00:03:39.810> you're

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
going to select what plug-in you're

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.710 
going to select what plug-in you're
going<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.290> get<00:03:40.440> for<00:03:40.830> that<00:03:41.010> particular

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
going to get for that particular

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.580 
going to get for that particular
application<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:42.900> let's<00:03:43.110> just<00:03:43.260> say<00:03:43.350> that<00:03:43.530> you

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
application so let's just say that you

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.240 
application so let's just say that you
had<00:03:43.850> multiple<00:03:45.050> plugins<00:03:46.050> for<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.590> amazon<00:03:47.040> app

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
had multiple plugins for the amazon app

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.680 
had multiple plugins for the amazon app
so<00:03:47.520> this<00:03:47.700> is<00:03:47.790> basically<00:03:47.910> where<00:03:48.330> you're<00:03:48.480> going

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
so this is basically where you're going

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.690 
so this is basically where you're going
to<00:03:48.780> decide<00:03:49.110> which<00:03:49.590> plugin<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.310> want<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.550> use

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
to decide which plugin you want to use

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.120 
to decide which plugin you want to use
for<00:03:51.060> what<00:03:51.330> particular<00:03:51.660> application<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.709> we

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
for what particular application so we

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.040 
for what particular application so we
obviously<00:03:53.250> have<00:03:53.670> velox<00:03:54.000> amazon<00:03:54.480> or<00:03:54.660> we<00:03:54.900> could

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
obviously have velox amazon or we could

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.290 
obviously have velox amazon or we could
use<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.410> notification<00:03:56.100> view<00:03:56.310> so<00:03:56.550> that's<00:03:57.090> all

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
use the notification view so that's all

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.240 
use the notification view so that's all
that<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.600> really<00:03:57.900> does<00:03:58.110> and<00:03:58.410> once<00:03:59.160> you

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
that this really does and once you

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.500 
that this really does and once you
select<00:03:59.610> that<00:03:59.670> then<00:04:00.000> it's<00:04:00.120> going<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.330> take

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
select that then it's going to take

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.510 
select that then it's going to take
effect<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.140> right<00:04:01.920> here<00:04:02.130> we<00:04:02.250> have<00:04:02.280> another

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
effect and right here we have another

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.670 
effect and right here we have another
more<00:04:03.270> option<00:04:03.810> so<00:04:03.959> if<00:04:04.020> we<00:04:04.140> just<00:04:04.290> tap<00:04:04.440> on<00:04:04.620> that

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
more option so if we just tap on that

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.920 
more option so if we just tap on that
this<00:04:05.040> is<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.340> new<00:04:05.700> developer<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.240> veelox<00:04:06.720> he's

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
this is the new developer of veelox he's

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.960 
this is the new developer of veelox he's
not<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.200> original<00:04:07.350> developer<00:04:08.010> but<00:04:08.550> he<00:04:08.820> was

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
not the original developer but he was

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.949 
not the original developer but he was
reached<00:04:09.150> out<00:04:09.300> to<00:04:09.450> buy<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.690> original

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
reached out to buy the original

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.110 
reached out to buy the original
developer<00:04:10.590> velox<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.489> kind<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:11.760> take<00:04:11.940> over

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
developer velox to kind of take over

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.610 
developer velox to kind of take over
just<00:04:12.450> because<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.840> original<00:04:12.930> developer

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
just because the original developer

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.900 
just because the original developer
didn't<00:04:13.980> have<00:04:14.160> time<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.580> up

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
didn't have time to up

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.360 
didn't have time to up
tweaked<00:04:15.330> so<00:04:16.050> I'm<00:04:16.620> not<00:04:16.769> sure<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:17.100> price<00:04:17.310> that

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
tweaked so I'm not sure the price that

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.850 
tweaked so I'm not sure the price that
this<00:04:17.670> is<00:04:17.760> going<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:18.000> be<00:04:18.209> in<00:04:18.480> cydia<00:04:19.350> once<00:04:19.680> it's

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
this is going to be in cydia once it's
