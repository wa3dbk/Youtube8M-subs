I am maybe if not more for flippers so I
decided<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.890> make<00:00:16.949> her<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.279> mini<00:00:17.520> version<00:00:17.730> of

decided to make her a mini version of

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.529 
decided to make her a mini version of
the<00:00:18.359> co<00:00:18.779> Aiken<00:00:19.109> she<00:00:19.859> really<00:00:20.039> likes<00:00:20.390> larger<00:00:21.390> one

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.480 
the co Aiken she really likes larger one
I've<00:00:21.689> been<00:00:21.840> carrying<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.769> she<00:00:22.830> wanted<00:00:23.400> a

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
I've been carrying so she wanted a

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.839 
I've been carrying so she wanted a
little<00:00:23.730> something<00:00:24.060> smaller<00:00:25.820> unfortunately<00:00:26.820> I

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
little something smaller unfortunately I

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.849 
little something smaller unfortunately I
couldn't<00:00:27.090> go<00:00:27.240> thinner<00:00:27.750> stock<00:00:28.230> just<00:00:28.650> because

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
couldn't go thinner stock just because

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.550 
couldn't go thinner stock just because
it's<00:00:29.039> such<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> pain<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.699> remove<00:00:30.029> material<00:00:30.560> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
it's such a pain to remove material the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.110 
it's such a pain to remove material the
blade<00:00:31.769> steel<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> same<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
blade steel and this is the same as the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.310 
blade steel and this is the same as the
larger<00:00:33.870> quake<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.260> its<00:00:34.410> s<00:00:34.559> 125v<00:00:36.110> super<00:00:37.110> hard

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
larger quake in its s 125v super hard

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.560 
larger quake in its s 125v super hard
stuff<00:00:37.680> rock<00:00:38.250> walls<00:00:38.460> out<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:38.820> 71<00:00:39.420> or

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
stuff rock walls out like 71 or

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.110 
stuff rock walls out like 71 or
something<00:00:39.840> like<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.670> extremely<00:00:41.670> abrasion

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
something like that extremely abrasion

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.510 
something like that extremely abrasion
resistant<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.170> problem<00:00:43.500> lies<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.860> taking

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
resistant so the problem lies in taking

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.060 
resistant so the problem lies in taking
the<00:00:44.579> material<00:00:44.969> down<00:00:45.180> from<00:00:45.539> where<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:45.870> at

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
the material down from where it's at

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.709 
the material down from where it's at
it's<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.160> bit<00:00:47.370> difficult<00:00:47.610> especially<00:00:48.210> since<00:00:48.660> I

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
it's a bit difficult especially since I

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:49.790 
it's a bit difficult especially since I
don't<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.050> surface<00:00:49.200> grinder<00:00:49.620> at<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
don't have a surface grinder at the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.060 
don't have a surface grinder at the
moment<00:00:50.600> but<00:00:51.600> yeah<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.230> made<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> three-inch

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
moment but yeah so I made a three-inch

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.209 
moment but yeah so I made a three-inch
blade<00:00:53.160> version<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> four-inch<00:00:54.510> blade

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
blade version this is a four-inch blade

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.170 
blade version this is a four-inch blade
so<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.430> kind<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> size

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
so you can kind of see the size

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.590 
so you can kind of see the size
difference<00:00:57.210> here<00:00:57.859> all<00:00:58.940> close<00:00:59.940> together<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.510> I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
difference here all close together if I

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.160 
difference here all close together if I
can<00:01:01.129> we<00:01:02.129> go<00:01:02.660> so<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.750> about<00:01:03.840> an<00:01:04.019> inch

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
can we go so it's about an inch

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:15.130 
can we go so it's about an inch
difference<00:01:04.439> handle<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:05.640> inch<00:01:06.240> blade

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:28.120 

you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.290> see<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> little<00:01:16.890> better

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.859 

did<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.219> backspacer<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.030> bit<00:01:30.359> different<00:01:30.750> on

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
did the backspacer a bit different on

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.609 
did the backspacer a bit different on
this<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:33.649> hard<00:01:34.649> to<00:01:34.829> see<00:01:35.039> it<00:01:36.350> I'm<00:01:37.350> milled

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
this one hard to see it I'm milled

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.770 
this one hard to see it I'm milled
jimping<00:01:38.429> but<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.670> also<00:01:38.820> milled<00:01:39.179> straight<00:01:39.630> down

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
jimping but I also milled straight down

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.830 
jimping but I also milled straight down
the<00:01:39.899> center<00:01:43.670> this<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.060> straight

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the center this one is just straight

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.910 
the center this one is just straight
jumping<00:01:47.390> same<00:01:48.390> frame<00:01:48.689> thickness<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.770> like

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
jumping same frame thickness it's like

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.999 
jumping same frame thickness it's like
1020<00:01:50.610> thousands<00:01:51.090> little<00:01:51.450> over<00:01:52.009> blade

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
1020 thousands little over blade

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.590 
1020 thousands little over blade
thickness<00:01:53.219> is<00:01:53.549> 200<00:01:53.909> thousands<00:01:54.270> on<00:01:54.360> both<00:01:54.569> of

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
thickness is 200 thousands on both of

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.600 
thickness is 200 thousands on both of
them<00:01:54.979> so<00:01:55.979> same<00:01:56.399> width<00:01:57.060> wise<00:01:57.329> thickness<00:01:58.610> or

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
them so same width wise thickness or

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.940 
them so same width wise thickness or
excuse<00:02:00.030> me<00:02:00.149> I'm<00:02:00.270> sorry<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.259> titanium<00:02:01.739> on<00:02:01.799> this

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.609

then this one is sorry mine's a lefty
hers<00:02:10.829> is<00:02:10.979> RIT<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:12.709> set<00:02:13.709> them<00:02:13.829> up<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.190> can

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
hers is RIT so set them up so you can

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.809 
hers is RIT so set them up so you can
see<00:02:15.500> thickness<00:02:16.500> difference<00:02:16.890> alright

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
see thickness difference alright

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:26.030 
see thickness difference alright
one-handed<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.049> a<00:02:19.290> bit<00:02:19.920> difficult

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.220 

thickness<00:02:26.879> wise<00:02:27.090> hard<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.689> tell<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.110> video

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
thickness wise hard to tell in the video

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.429 
thickness wise hard to tell in the video
you<00:02:28.439> can't<00:02:28.829> tell<00:02:29.549> a<00:02:29.579> lot<00:02:30.060> as<00:02:30.629> I<00:02:30.750> Billy<00:02:31.170> edges

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
you can't tell a lot as I Billy edges

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:37.130 
you can't tell a lot as I Billy edges
quite<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> bit<00:02:32.510> it's<00:02:33.510> oh<00:02:35.090> about<00:02:36.090> 40,000<00:02:37.079> s

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
quite a bit it's oh about 40,000 s

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.250 
quite a bit it's oh about 40,000 s
difference<00:02:37.500> i<00:02:37.620> guess<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.299> said<00:02:39.359> 316<00:02:40.170> s

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
difference i guess so like I said 316 s

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.530 
difference i guess so like I said 316 s
on<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:40.469> mini<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.859> then<00:02:41.239> just<00:02:42.239> under<00:02:42.510> a

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
on the mini and then just under a

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.580 
on the mini and then just under a
quarter<00:02:42.720> on<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:44.010> larger<00:02:44.340> one<00:02:44.689> I<00:02:45.689> have<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.409> did

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
quarter on the larger one I have I did

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.110 
quarter on the larger one I have I did
change<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.890> couple<00:02:47.040> things<00:02:47.189> since<00:02:47.579> I<00:02:47.670> prototype

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
change a couple things since I prototype

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.179 
change a couple things since I prototype
this<00:02:48.269> first<00:02:48.480> one<00:02:48.659> I<00:02:49.290> switched<00:02:49.769> over<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.069> a

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
this first one I switched over to a

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.039 
this first one I switched over to a
three<00:02:50.430> sixteenth<00:02:50.879> stop<00:02:51.150> pin<00:02:51.390> over<00:02:51.629> the<00:02:51.900> eighth

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
three sixteenth stop pin over the eighth

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.229 
three sixteenth stop pin over the eighth
inch<00:02:52.260> stop<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.739> just<00:02:53.370> one<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.670> little<00:02:53.760> extra

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
inch stop in just one the little extra

beefiness to it it's got a bearing

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.629 
beefiness to it it's got a bearing
system<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:56.909> the<00:02:57.000> pivot<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:57.359> both<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.569> them<00:02:57.870> I

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
system on the pivot on both of them I

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.830 
system on the pivot on both of them I
have<00:02:59.639> a<00:02:59.670> new<00:02:59.909> bearing<00:03:00.239> system<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.750> I'm

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
have a new bearing system that I'm

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.080 
have a new bearing system that I'm
developing<00:03:01.109> right<00:03:01.530> now<00:03:01.590> prototyping<00:03:02.370> i<00:03:02.639> may

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
developing right now prototyping i may

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.759 
developing right now prototyping i may
do<00:03:03.569> another<00:03:03.810> quake<00:03:04.079> and<00:03:04.230> I'm<00:03:04.349> thinking<00:03:04.560> maybe

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
do another quake and I'm thinking maybe

see it for a little while but I can
guarantee<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.959> it's<00:03:13.290> going<00:03:13.379> to<00:03:13.470> be<00:03:13.620> even<00:03:14.519> more

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
guarantee you it's going to be even more

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.909 
guarantee you it's going to be even more
epic<00:03:15.090> than<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.629> hrd<00:03:16.349> system<00:03:18.169> so<00:03:19.169> I'll<00:03:19.680> let<00:03:19.799> you

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
epic than the hrd system so I'll let you

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.830 
epic than the hrd system so I'll let you
look<00:03:20.069> this<00:03:20.250> one<00:03:20.400> over<00:03:20.609> this<00:03:21.120> one<00:03:21.299> I<00:03:21.480> put<00:03:21.720> some

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
look this one over this one I put some

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.960 
look this one over this one I put some
bronze<00:03:22.470> phosphorus<00:03:22.980> spacers<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.400> there<00:03:23.700> I

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
bronze phosphorus spacers in there I

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.300 
bronze phosphorus spacers in there I
didn't<00:03:24.450> have<00:03:24.599> any<00:03:24.829> titanium<00:03:25.829> that<00:03:26.010> was<00:03:26.159> as

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
didn't have any titanium that was as

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.009 
didn't have any titanium that was as
thick<00:03:26.340> as<00:03:26.669> this<00:03:26.790> blade<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.359> I<00:03:27.389> needed<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.780> space

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
thick as this blade so I needed to space

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.420 
thick as this blade so I needed to space
it<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:28.349> i<00:03:28.379> thought<00:03:28.590> this<00:03:28.799> bronze<00:03:29.099> would<00:03:29.280> look

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
it so i thought this bronze would look

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.309 
it so i thought this bronze would look
pretty<00:03:29.609> good<00:03:29.700> gives<00:03:30.659> it<00:03:30.780> just<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:31.049> little<00:03:31.079> bit

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
pretty good gives it just a little bit

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.300 
pretty good gives it just a little bit
of<00:03:31.470> color<00:03:31.729> i<00:03:32.750> did<00:03:33.750> modify<00:03:34.019> also<00:03:34.650> i<00:03:34.889> brought<00:03:35.190> the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
of color i did modify also i brought the

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.890 
of color i did modify also i brought the
lock<00:03:35.459> bar<00:03:35.669> a<00:03:35.699> little<00:03:35.879> further<00:03:36.209> forward<00:03:36.569> then

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
lock bar a little further forward then

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.099 
lock bar a little further forward then
on<00:03:37.220> this<00:03:38.220> one<00:03:38.430> just<00:03:38.729> a<00:03:38.909> touch<00:03:39.150> about<00:03:39.690> 30

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
on this one just a touch about 30

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.469 
on this one just a touch about 30
thousands<00:03:40.620> i<00:03:40.769> wanted<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.609> as<00:03:41.760> close<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.359> the

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
thousands i wanted it as close to the

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.030 
thousands i wanted it as close to the
pivot<00:03:42.810> as<00:03:42.900> possible<00:03:43.319> that<00:03:43.470> leads<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.919> the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
pivot as possible that leads to the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.849 
pivot as possible that leads to the
strongest<00:03:44.400> lock<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.900> i<00:03:45.930> relieved<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.650> lock

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
strongest lock so i relieved the lock

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.619 
strongest lock so i relieved the lock
bar<00:03:47.099> for<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.579> bearing<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.209> can<00:03:48.329> just<00:03:48.359> see

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
bar for the bearing so you can just see

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.849 
bar for the bearing so you can just see
the<00:03:48.659> red<00:03:48.959> part<00:03:49.229> there<00:03:49.470> that's<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.769> bearing

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
the red part there that's the bearing

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.099 
the red part there that's the bearing
and<00:03:53.120> smooth<00:03:54.120> out<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.389> gym<00:03:54.569> ping<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:54.870> doesn't

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
and smooth out the gym ping so doesn't

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.339 
and smooth out the gym ping so doesn't
Jam<00:03:55.349> your<00:03:55.530> finger<00:03:55.829> when<00:03:56.010> he<00:03:56.129> hit<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:56.909> flipper

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
Jam your finger when he hit the flipper

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.479 
Jam your finger when he hit the flipper
my<00:03:58.349> fingers<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.680> little<00:03:58.769> tore<00:03:59.099> up<00:03:59.280> from<00:03:59.400> the

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
my fingers a little tore up from the

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.789 
my fingers a little tore up from the
grinder<00:03:59.849> or<00:03:59.879> so<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.389> kind<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.109> kind<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.530> do<00:04:01.680> it

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
grinder or so I kind of I kind of do it

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.649 
grinder or so I kind of I kind of do it
from<00:04:01.979> the<00:04:02.099> corner<00:04:02.430> of<00:04:02.459> my<00:04:02.639> finger<00:04:03.030> here<00:04:03.239> but<00:04:03.419> I

from the corner of my finger here but I

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.259 
from the corner of my finger here but I
said<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.199> detents<00:04:04.680> pretty<00:04:05.159> tight<00:04:05.430> because<00:04:05.609> my

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
said the detents pretty tight because my

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.569 
said the detents pretty tight because my
wife<00:04:06.419> Megan<00:04:06.870> she<00:04:07.109> really<00:04:07.349> likes<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.799> kind<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.489> an

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
assisted opener kind of so really

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.219 
assisted opener kind of so really
doesn't<00:04:11.669> take<00:04:11.790> much<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.659> I'm<00:04:12.780> just<00:04:12.989> barely

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
doesn't take much and I'm just barely

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:21.490 
doesn't take much and I'm just barely
pushing<00:04:13.560> on<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.859> thing

this one doesn't have my hrd system
neither<00:04:26.810> does<00:04:27.050> this<00:04:27.320> one<00:04:27.530> honestly<00:04:28.100> it's<00:04:28.460> just

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
neither does this one honestly it's just
