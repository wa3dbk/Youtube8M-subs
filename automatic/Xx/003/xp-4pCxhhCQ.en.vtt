00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.069
 today 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.450
 we are going today to talk about a game 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.310
 interesting for nintendo 64 we could 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.050
 consider it as the first game of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.720
 extreme sports that he has done was 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.089
 considered as good you have and o'neal 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.980
 80 degrees is a snowboarding title 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:33.690
 for nintendo 64 released in the year 1998 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.550
 developed by nintendo for the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.680
 today's standards the game has 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.510
 aged poorly but let's try to be 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.460
 fair and talk about the big 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.890
 innovations that he presented for the genre 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.770
 of sports games the game counts 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.960
 with six game modes max race 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.570
 where you compete in racing tournaments 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.120
 against the computer throughout 4 5 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.730
 or 6 levels depending on the difficulty 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.920
 you have chosen, it is worth mentioning that the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.720
 game is frustrating until the fuck and not 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.330
 because the opponents are masters 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.280
 of the sport of snowboarding but because 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.560
 the control is a bit screwed but 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.600
 I'll talk about that later and it's not 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.000
 the worst control I have touched in my 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.580
 let's talk a little more about the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.130
 game modes before arriving 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.050
 to the control to play we can choose 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.610
 between 5 different competitors 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.500
 countries 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.050
 kensuke key machine and hacarÃ­ ajami de 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.940
 Japan Rikin Winterbourne of Canada Dion 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.580
 Blaster of the United Kingdom- and Roy Haynes 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.100
 world of the us and it is assumed that every 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.660
 one has its own characteristics 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.270
 but I find that it feels the same 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.880
 play with all the game also we 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.010
 allows to choose a table equally with 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.710
 supposedly different statistics 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.290
 but I feel the same is all in addition 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.180
 having a table with all its stands 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.040
 tall and well balanced why 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.350
 fucking somebody was going to choose this 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.960
 another one seriously I do not understand the point 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.300
 you would usually expect a table 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.580
 has some stats higher than another and 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.250
 that swing between them but look 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.680
 these two the first one is better at all 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.869
 so send the shit to the tables 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.610
 lower and choose the cutest for 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.380
 do not lose but I personally feel 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.600
 all the tables and all the 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.430
 characters alike but it's interesting 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.680
 have this large amount of options 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.440
 to personalize the experience though 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.060
 during the game do not feel 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.480
 significantly but having so many 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.430
 boards 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.500
 and enough characters what more 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.739
 disappoints is the amount of clues 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.549
 available to play seriously only 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.560
 six even a game like Mario Kart 64 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.099
 had four cups with four tracks 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.349
 each one, that is, 16 tracks 6 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.269
 pathetic for a game like this but 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.519
 at least the design team made 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.920
 6 tracks all very different 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.349
 Crystal Lake is the first and the most 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.450
 easy you start defending for a 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.579
 corridor with small mounds and a 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.280
 straight section until you reach an area 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.079
 rocky with a leap forward and I swear 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.030
 I do not understand what the shit criteria of the 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.790
 game decides if you land well or badly 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.220
 but I'll talk about the controls later 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.400
 you can take two roads one faster 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.930
 and easy and the other longer and harder 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.209
 you should be a great animal 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.010
 to grab the difficult path but to 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.170
 get to the fastest you have to do 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.720
 some maneuvers that look easier 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.549
 of what they are then you get to a straight 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.180
 end with some mounds up 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.180
 getting to the finish line 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.330
 crystal peak is another section as well 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.860
 say it of crystal lake but harder 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.110
 you start with a simple runner but 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.090
 coming to a more mountainous area to 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.100
 then go down at full speed for a 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.250
 pending from the tip of the mountain and 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.840
 get to a kind of ice tunnel 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.210
 you can again choose a path and 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.700
 as before one is faster and the other 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.430
 it's more difficult so you already know take the 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.740
 another or you will lose the fucking career you advance 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.930
 through a mountainous area and then arrive 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.210
 to a corridor with many small hills 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.430
 of snow a part a little harder 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.690
 what it looks like and you end up on a straight 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.690
 similar to crystal beats 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.360
 golden forest is one of my favorites 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.730
 defend by a wooded area with the 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.350
 Evening light the whole track provides 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.170
 different paths you can take 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.000
 all interesting this time with a background 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.130
 from a great mountain 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.140
 awesome for your time the 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.570
 feeling of a forest is very good 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.820
 transported to the game and you'll arrive 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.060
 to a frozen river and you can jump by 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.820
 the waterfall and kill you high high not what 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.950
 I say like a metaphor in this game you 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.680
 you kill the character is going to fuck 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.840
 you have a small energy bar and 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.360
 when you crash too much, 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.370
 character gets killed stays there 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.150
 dead the imbecile watch him kill himself or 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.150
 poor idiot 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.820
 good but revive later and go back to 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.310
 the character selection hut does not 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.260
 I know how the very bastard finally 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.950
 you cross more snowy corridors of 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.290
 that forest and you reach the goal 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.170
 Mountain village is a bit annoying 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.880
 but very creative as a clue and I think 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.400
 a good time to explain the 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.650
 controls moving with the stick 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.380
 analog accelerating automatically 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.570
 jumping with increasing speed with 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.550
 z and performing tricks in the air 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.470
 pressing various combinations of 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.660
 buttons when jumping that do not come out to me and 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.090
 I just killed the assholes characters like that 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.710
 that I do not do anything the control in 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.870
 general feels a bit stiff and 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.850
 forced although I remember feeling 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.310
 very good for your time when I played it 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.500
 for the first time going back to mountain 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.690
 village the whore track has many 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.090
 jumps that can be exploited but 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.860
 as the control is not precise the only thing 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.470
 what you will do is kill you all the time 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.260
 even the computer has problems 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.900
 playing here the slightest mistake makes you 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.120
 fall or crash with something the design is 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.700
 creative but frustrating with several 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.710
 big dragon jumps I made is another 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.350
 similar but its nocturnal atmosphere the 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.300
 it becomes more pleasant to play for me the 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.580
 track has many alternative paths 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.620
 fun to drink and a somersault 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.000
 where you can kill yourself getting a 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.100
 Most holy and reverend 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.110
 to whores or when falling then going down 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.690
 mountainous areas up to slopes 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.120
 simpler and finally the goal the 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.240
 Billy's last track I can not 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.430
 to go from fucking to death is too difficult 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.290
 and I'm frustrated trying to make this 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.900
 asshole land well from this little 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:30.180
 I jump that you do not mame and not imbecil all the 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.730
 track is a wide descent with multiple 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.010
 obstacles on the way to this point 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.170
 sure they have already noticed a characteristic 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.940
 interesting and is that you can record your 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.830
 races to be seen in a way 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.710
 professional and you can look at the graphs 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.930
 of the game that are pretty good there 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.270
 snow effects falling from the table 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.919
 throwing snow sideways and even 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.440
 you can see your character's clothes 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:55.140
 move with the wind a bit a detail 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.240
 unusual for its time the game has 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.010
 two other crap tracks used in the 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.140
 trick attack mode where the most 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.840
 important is to do tricks to get 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.150
 high points but as I said I am a 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.580
 shit I can not even land well 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.360
 Holy God, tell me what the hell I am 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.910
 doing wrong 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.220
 the answer mode puts it back together 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.449
 points but also going through areas 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.729
 marked with flags 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:20.309
 that indicate your way the way of two 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:22.499
 players is usually more fun since 

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:24.539
 that you compete against a friend and in this 

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:26.669
 game is much more fun than playing 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:28.710
 against the damn computer 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:31.319
 finally I must mention that the music 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:34.639
 Rate from regular to shit listen 

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:34.639
 this song for example 

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:41.220
 Hello 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.220
 what the fuck was that 

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:52.330
 I can then conclude that the game is 

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:54.460
 good for 1998 standards the years 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.350
 they have not done well and sincerely 

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.600
 is a title that I would download from the 

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.850
 virtual console unless you have with 

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.820
 who play it or if you really enjoy the 

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:06.930
 extreme sports games greetings and 

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.930
 until the next video
