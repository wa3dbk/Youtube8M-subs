00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.409 
it off until later in the day you want
to<00:05:17.430> take<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:17.669> off<00:05:17.760> all<00:05:17.940> my<00:05:18.060> makeup<00:05:18.180> because

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
to take it off all my makeup because

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.570 
to take it off all my makeup because
seriously<00:05:18.900> I<00:05:19.050> rubbed<00:05:19.410> my<00:05:19.530> lips<00:05:19.830> for<00:05:20.099> so<00:05:20.340> long

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
seriously I rubbed my lips for so long

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.270 
seriously I rubbed my lips for so long
already<00:05:20.909> and<00:05:21.180> they<00:05:21.690> burn<00:05:22.110> so<00:05:22.620> that's<00:05:23.039> the<00:05:23.190> only

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
already and they burn so that's the only

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.010 
already and they burn so that's the only
kind<00:05:23.580> but<00:05:24.120> I<00:05:24.150> guess<00:05:24.390> that's<00:05:24.570> also<00:05:24.840> a<00:05:24.870> good

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
kind but I guess that's also a good
