the last thing Chopin and Xuan need is

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.740 
the last thing Chopin and Xuan need is

to be reminded it's their 200th birthday

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.919 
to be reminded it's their 200th birthday
I<00:00:28.199> everybody<00:00:28.970> knows<00:00:29.970> they're<00:00:30.359> very<00:00:30.599> famous

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
I everybody knows they're very famous

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.459 
I everybody knows they're very famous
it's<00:00:31.320> more<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> chance<00:00:32.250> for<00:00:32.489> us<00:00:32.550> really<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.540> do

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
it's more a chance for us really to do

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.650 
it's more a chance for us really to do
that<00:00:34.500> music

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.220 

I<00:00:41.720> always<00:00:42.710> thought<00:00:43.310> of<00:00:43.579> Schumann<00:00:44.150> as<00:00:44.570> somebody

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
I always thought of Schumann as somebody

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.560 
I always thought of Schumann as somebody
much<00:00:45.410> older

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
much older

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.030 
much older
partly<00:00:47.570> because<00:00:47.720> Schumann<00:00:48.380> was<00:00:48.590> someone<00:00:48.920> who

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
partly because Schumann was someone who

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.070 
partly because Schumann was someone who
who<00:00:49.309> wrote<00:00:49.550> about<00:00:49.760> music<00:00:50.360> as<00:00:50.510> well<00:00:50.690> as<00:00:50.840> writing

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
who wrote about music as well as writing

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.770 
who wrote about music as well as writing
music<00:00:51.559> he<00:00:52.100> was<00:00:52.309> actually<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:53.120> first<00:00:53.300> one<00:00:53.570> to

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
music he was actually the first one to

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.229 
music he was actually the first one to
recognize<00:00:53.960> Chopin<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.250> first<00:00:55.670> phrase<00:00:56.000> he

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
recognize Chopin the first phrase he

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.729 
recognize Chopin the first phrase he
wrote<00:00:56.420> about<00:00:56.540> Chopin<00:00:57.080> was<00:00:57.230> hats<00:00:57.559> off

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
wrote about Chopin was hats off

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.369 
wrote about Chopin was hats off
gentleman<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.430> genius<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.690> you<00:00:59.750> always<00:00:59.989> think

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
gentleman and genius so you always think

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.410 
gentleman and genius so you always think
I<00:01:00.530> always<00:01:00.980> thought<00:01:01.129> of<00:01:01.190> him<00:01:01.460> as<00:01:01.489> maybe<00:01:01.820> 10

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
I always thought of him as maybe 10

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.290 
I always thought of him as maybe 10
years<00:01:02.570> older<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.309> writing<00:01:04.309> about<00:01:04.550> Chopin<00:01:04.879> but

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
years older and writing about Chopin but

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:14.150 
years older and writing about Chopin but
it<00:01:05.420> turns<00:01:05.660> out<00:01:06.400> they<00:01:07.400> are<00:01:07.540> exact<00:01:08.540> contemporary

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.430 

with<00:01:15.160> Chopin<00:01:15.640> what<00:01:15.880> always<00:01:16.090> amazes<00:01:16.630> me<00:01:16.840> is

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
with Chopin what always amazes me is

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.390 
with Chopin what always amazes me is
that<00:01:18.930> although<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.110> actual<00:01:20.290> length<00:01:20.860> of<00:01:21.250> the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
that although the actual length of the

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.180 
that although the actual length of the
piece<00:01:21.670> is<00:01:23.580> short<00:01:24.580> I<00:01:24.970> guess<00:01:25.540> by<00:01:25.780> by<00:01:26.190> standards

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
piece is short I guess by by standards

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.940 
piece is short I guess by by standards
of<00:01:27.340> sonatas<00:01:27.940> of<00:01:27.970> various<00:01:28.660> people<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:29.380> actually

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
of sonatas of various people it actually

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.910 
of sonatas of various people it actually
feels<00:01:30.430> like<00:01:30.880> an<00:01:31.090> enormous<00:01:31.930> piece<00:01:32.530> of

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
feels like an enormous piece of

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.450 
feels like an enormous piece of
something<00:01:33.310> like<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:34.510> fourth<00:01:34.810> Balad<00:01:35.170> or<00:01:36.130> the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
something like the fourth Balad or the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.609 
something like the fourth Balad or the
polonaise<00:01:37.150> fantasy<00:01:37.720> which<00:01:37.869> I'll<00:01:38.050> actually<00:01:38.229> be

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
polonaise fantasy which I'll actually be

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.160 
polonaise fantasy which I'll actually be
playing<00:01:38.890> in<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.460> program<00:01:39.850> it's<00:01:40.450> only<00:01:40.690> 11

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
playing in the program it's only 11

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.400 
playing in the program it's only 11
minutes<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:42.400> it<00:01:42.520> feels<00:01:42.820> like<00:01:43.090> an<00:01:43.479> incredibly

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
minutes but it feels like an incredibly

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.050 
minutes but it feels like an incredibly
big<00:01:44.890> piece<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.310> feels<00:01:45.520> like<00:01:45.670> a<00:01:45.700> big<00:01:45.940> dough

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
big piece it feels like a big dough

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.800 
big piece it feels like a big dough
Ensenada

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.090 

and<00:01:52.810> with<00:01:53.080> Shuman<00:01:53.560> i<00:01:55.770> can't<00:01:56.770> say<00:01:56.920> it's<00:01:57.070> the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
and with Shuman i can't say it's the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.770 
and with Shuman i can't say it's the
opposite<00:01:57.790> but<00:01:58.240> you're<00:01:58.450> very<00:01:58.659> aware<00:01:59.200> of<00:01:59.650> these

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
opposite but you're very aware of these

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.050 
opposite but you're very aware of these
little<00:02:01.780> vignettes<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.950> fantasy<00:02:03.580> even<00:02:03.940> though

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
little vignettes the fantasy even though

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.699 
little vignettes the fantasy even though
it's<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.330> full-scale<00:02:05.159> big<00:02:06.159> piece<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:08.320> still

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
it's a full-scale big piece is still

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.449 
it's a full-scale big piece is still
very<00:02:08.890> episodic<00:02:13.320> Schumann<00:02:14.320> certainly<00:02:14.980> was<00:02:15.160> not

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
very episodic Schumann certainly was not

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.320 
very episodic Schumann certainly was not
the<00:02:15.850> prodigy<00:02:16.570> that<00:02:16.780> Chopin<00:02:17.200> was<00:02:17.440> but<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.430> think

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
the prodigy that Chopin was but I think

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.400 
the prodigy that Chopin was but I think
Schumann<00:02:19.959> had<00:02:20.140> more<00:02:20.350> of<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.500> network<00:02:20.980> maybe<00:02:22.410> he

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
Schumann had more of a network maybe he

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.530 
Schumann had more of a network maybe he
first<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.459> all<00:02:24.610> because<00:02:24.970> he<00:02:25.000> wrote<00:02:25.330> about

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
first of all because he wrote about

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.590 
first of all because he wrote about
music<00:02:26.050> second<00:02:26.470> of<00:02:26.590> all<00:02:26.709> because<00:02:27.160> he<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.730> guess

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
music second of all because he I guess

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.290 
music second of all because he I guess
had<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:29.260> girlfriend<00:02:29.920> who<00:02:30.310> played<00:02:30.580> who<00:02:31.000> played

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
had a girlfriend who played who played

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.900 
had a girlfriend who played who played
the<00:02:31.480> piano<00:02:31.660> very<00:02:31.900> well<00:02:32.489> Schumann<00:02:33.489> was<00:02:33.760> an

the piano very well Schumann was an

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.210 
the piano very well Schumann was an
incredibly<00:02:34.720> generous<00:02:34.980> man
