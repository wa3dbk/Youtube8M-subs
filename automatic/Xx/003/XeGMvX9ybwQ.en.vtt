spices but honestly coriander is got a
very<00:05:54.500> mild<00:05:55.130> flavor<00:05:55.580> so<00:05:56.540> it's<00:05:56.810> not<00:05:57.140> an

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
very mild flavor so it's not an

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:03.010 
very mild flavor so it's not an
overwhelmingly<00:05:58.340> in<00:05:59.240> a<00:05:59.360> strong<00:05:59.750> amount<00:06:02.020> and

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
overwhelmingly in a strong amount and

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.050 
overwhelmingly in a strong amount and
since<00:06:03.230> we<00:06:03.380> have<00:06:03.530> a<00:06:03.560> lot<00:06:03.800> of<00:06:03.830> dry<00:06:04.190> spices<00:06:04.730> in

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
since we have a lot of dry spices in

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.190 
since we have a lot of dry spices in
here<00:06:05.090> we<00:06:05.360> can<00:06:05.480> just<00:06:05.600> take<00:06:05.750> a<00:06:05.780> little<00:06:05.990> bit<00:06:06.140> of

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
here we can just take a little bit of

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.820 
here we can just take a little bit of
water<00:06:06.470> and<00:06:06.740> just<00:06:06.830> gently<00:06:07.580> sprinkle<00:06:07.970> over<00:06:08.180> it

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
water and just gently sprinkle over it

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.440 
water and just gently sprinkle over it
not<00:06:09.830> too<00:06:10.040> much<00:06:10.190> but<00:06:10.430> it<00:06:10.550> so<00:06:10.640> this<00:06:10.820> create<00:06:11.420> a

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
not too much but it so this create a

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.550 
not too much but it so this create a
little<00:06:11.690> bit<00:06:11.780> of<00:06:11.840> steam<00:06:12.080> and<00:06:12.260> help<00:06:12.440> the

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
little bit of steam and help the

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.400 
little bit of steam and help the
moisture<00:06:12.920> Logan<00:06:13.810> so<00:06:14.810> we<00:06:14.990> let<00:06:15.140> this<00:06:15.230> cook

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
moisture Logan so we let this cook

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.590 
moisture Logan so we let this cook
stirring<00:06:15.860> often<00:06:16.400> for<00:06:16.760> just<00:06:16.970> about<00:06:17.120> 2<00:06:17.420> or<00:06:17.450> 3

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.780 
stirring often for just about 2 or 3
minutes<00:06:17.900> and<00:06:18.530> our<00:06:18.770> final<00:06:19.100> step<00:06:19.310> is<00:06:19.550> we<00:06:19.760> have

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
minutes and our final step is we have

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.720 
minutes and our final step is we have
some<00:06:20.270> Tomatoes<00:06:20.960> it's<00:06:21.350> just<00:06:21.560> one<00:06:21.770> tomato<00:06:22.100> which
