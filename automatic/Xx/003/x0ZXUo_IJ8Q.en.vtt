00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 zdarova everything with you, I just might I 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.240
 keep playing maynkravt just for the sake of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.110
 order to build houses on schemes 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.660
 villages and pisi 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.070
 well and at the same time teach you today we will 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.690
 build a house called a library 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.560
 before building a library i 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.810
 here made a small path somewhere 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.769
 there to the village did not develop 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.769
 stripe 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.500
 Well, now let's start building a house 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.390
 for this 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.360
 need a cobblestone and build the first row 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.280
 cobblestones are 9 blocks long 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.320
 width 6 blocks 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.620
 well let's first build one two three y 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.020
 you should get something like this 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.850
 let's probably just build a floor floor 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.809
 built from the same material as 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.750
 foundation of cobblestones lining up 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:07.070
 here is a hole cobble well should 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:11.110
 get something like this 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:17.840
 building 2 rows about building it all 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:19.440
 around the cobblestone well and for the entrance we are from 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.090
 corner 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.090
 the second block we break 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.969
 you should have something like this 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.560
 sold continue to customize cobblestones 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.759
 now we build columns 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.079
 6 blocks here these two blocks 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:45.299
 inclusive it turns out well, about here 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:49.859
 so immediately connect the tips of the points here 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:54.659
 these Alans also cobble turns out well 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:58.409
 something like this and let's probably 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:02.729
 just behind the formation because still on 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.170
 scheme everything so you should get 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.020
 something like this 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.239
 and probably let's make walls for 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:20.920
 slate they are also made of cobblestone 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:23.520
 we deliver cobblestones like this 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.080
 rebuild the same way 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.590
 you should 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.590
 learn well, something like this then 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:40.260
 we build up blocks of cobblestones we connect 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.120
 points for our slate or roof well 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.170
 who is more comfortable for me personally 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.680
 will slate you have to 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.580
 learn something like this so much more 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:03:07.020
 cobblestone is not needed and as long as residents 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:07.870
 incomprehensible but throw out the trash in the well 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.430
 hand over 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.430
 we will need to build our boards and so 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.330
 from the entrance 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.550
 Here is this background from this we build 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.640
 wooden blocks 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:29.890
 size 2 here leave a gap in 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.880
 the size of 3 blocks and at the end here we put 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.680
 block of boards 2 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.860
 actually doing the same thing with one 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.860
 except for 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.799
 there will be a wooden one above the door 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.799
 block 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:55.200
 last top row 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:59.520
 on the roof is completely built up well 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.170
 it turns out something like this now also 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.430
 on the right 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.650
 error in the length of the floor more precisely 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:14.549
 here here here 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:18.120
 if here we put pablo block boards and 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:21.910
 also put two dose units on top 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.020
 stop hand repeat the same operation well 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:29.200
 it turns out like this 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.120
 then this side 2 is the topmost one 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.290
 row and middle row 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:40.289
 we will furnish completely with blocks of oak boards 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:43.979
 and put on the block boards and here 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:48.919
 and here we put in the middle too 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:52.099
 boards well, it turns out like this 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:57.559
 let's probably make slate right away 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:05:02.810
 arrange them completely in blocks of 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:04.790
 wooden steps you should 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.460
 slate should get about here 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:12.520
 So 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:16.300
 then we put the window panels and the door 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:20.099
 we put on the inside and excitement and in 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.099
 in the end everything should turn out like this 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.910
 Well, let's do the inner house 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:33.550
 here 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:39.099
 we build blocks of boards this side 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:44.620
 we also arrange the blocks of the boards above the windows 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:56.259
 2 blocks high wait a minute set 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:59.500
 blocks out for shelves for books and here 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:04.110
 about should get like this in 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:07.280
 this corner will leave a block of wooden boards 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.430
 from here we put one block a 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:17.270
 starting from here four gods themselves 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:19.710
 steps then put a fence here and 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:25.130
 here and put them push 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:25.130
 there is a wooden plate here too 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:38.839
 her spawning appropriate 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:43.279
 resident he is dressed pure white and how 

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:47.930
 always before entering we put a step out 

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:52.159
 cobblestone that's all 

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:56.389
 the library is ready well that's all with you 

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:59.559
 was a time who could have arranged these up 

00:07:56.389 --> 00:08:03.159
 Fly subscribe put likes 

00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:03.159
 well so far
