00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.129
 here here here somewhere on the screen parody 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.859
 which mouse wired mouse is very 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:55.629
 not bad wrap up in such a good computer 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:57.390
 Pupyrka layer can be straight polakat and asoka 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.460
 tano mouse 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.420
 so here is a cable made of fabric 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.140
 cop she has so many drops enough 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:13.869
 long long 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:17.460
 such a visby connector and wax the mouse itself is straight 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:20.500
 such a cool mouse in mind 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.560
 supposedly here is such a firm 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.869
 maybe I confuse something they supposedly 7 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:31.539
 minus can say such a move is good 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.369
 so straight, even though I'm not into the game 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.740
 I do not play shell games at all 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.689
 especially for review so here is the mouse 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.520
 I also needed these keys here 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.390
 so that there in the browser when you exit 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.340
 so quickly from early 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.689
 stage 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.229
 page then press this button and it 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.840
 it comes out it goes so the whole double click 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.090
 so here it is now also have as key 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.479
 we are highlighted now I tell you all this 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.789
 did at the end of the video will demonstrate so 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.049
 Well, the main drawback of this mouse from 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.140
 probably the fact that it is easy 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.979
 really, really, very easy 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.679
 visas boas 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.510
 weights there it is clear that the gaming mice 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.710
 can somehow 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.130
 send any weight and straight 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:18.860
 regulate yop 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:22.160
 weight well by itself 10 but right on design 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.830
 on very cool we are straight key there everything 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.350

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.330

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.280
