paradiddle the single flam mill and the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.999 
paradiddle the single flam mill and the
flam<00:00:11.849> paradiddle<00:00:12.599> diddle<00:00:12.900> let's<00:00:13.469> get<00:00:13.650> started

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
flam paradiddle diddle let's get started

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.790 
flam paradiddle diddle let's get started
first<00:00:14.759> up<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.269> flam<00:00:15.540> EQ<00:00:15.960> now<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
first up is the flam EQ now this is a

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.400 
first up is the flam EQ now this is a
strange<00:00:17.190> pattern<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.910> has<00:00:17.940> unaccented<00:00:18.630> flam's

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
strange pattern it has unaccented flam's

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.500 
strange pattern it has unaccented flam's
in<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.520> beginning<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.210> end<00:00:21.359> of

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
in it so in the beginning and the end of

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.150 
in it so in the beginning and the end of
the<00:00:21.570> pattern<00:00:21.900> there's<00:00:22.109> unaccented<00:00:22.500> flam's

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
the pattern there's unaccented flam's

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.310 
the pattern there's unaccented flam's
and<00:00:23.519> then<00:00:23.939> our<00:00:24.090> accent<00:00:24.630> actually<00:00:24.810> comes<00:00:25.140> on

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and then our accent actually comes on

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.679 
and then our accent actually comes on
our<00:00:25.439> left<00:00:25.769> hand<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.519> e<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.449> we're<00:00:27.539> going<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
our left hand on the e so we're going to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.120 
our left hand on the e so we're going to
have<00:00:27.779> unaccented<00:00:28.439> flam<00:00:29.750> accent<00:00:30.859> two<00:00:31.859> more

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
have unaccented flam accent two more

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.060 
have unaccented flam accent two more
notes<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.790> then<00:00:33.630> another<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.200> accented<00:00:34.739> flam

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
notes and then another and accented flam

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.240 
notes and then another and accented flam

last up is our flam paradiddle diddle
now<00:04:04.459> this<00:04:04.670> pattern<00:04:04.910> is<00:04:05.299> exactly<00:04:05.480> like<00:04:05.989> it

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
now this pattern is exactly like it

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.860 
now this pattern is exactly like it
sounds<00:04:06.200> it's<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:06.829> flam<00:04:07.160> paradiddle<00:04:08.060> diddle<00:04:08.360> so

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
sounds it's a flam paradiddle diddle so

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.750 
sounds it's a flam paradiddle diddle so
we're<00:04:08.989> going<00:04:09.079> to<00:04:09.140> have<00:04:09.519> right-handed<00:04:10.519> flam
