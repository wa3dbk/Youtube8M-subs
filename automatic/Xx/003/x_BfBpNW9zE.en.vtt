00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
 Hi there, let's consider the procedure 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:13.139
 replacing the speed sensor on the injection 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:15.240
 cars vaz 2110 2111 2112 so I will 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.660
 show by example 8 valve 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.660
 motor 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.130
 here that set the lighting that all 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.960
 It was seen once more to remove 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.580
 do not need anything if the engine 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.570
 8-valve can get to the sensor 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.520
 Nothing takes off so now I will 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.239
 show where it is for those who 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.270
 So he knows we probe and sensor from 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.120
 chupa 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.670
 is a little to the right if along the way 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:59.329
 vehicle movement and to the left if you stand 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:04.110
 face-to-drive here I think I have seen 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:10.740
 so now you need to disconnect the plug 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:13.439
 from the sensor there is a lock in 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.030
 the form of a metal bracket is small here 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.030
 you need to push it 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.740
 slightly and pull the latch up for 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.290
 the bayonets are more accurate and it is removed without problems 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:32.250
 I do not know how much you will see it 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:34.050
 clearly but I will try 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.900
 I hardly wanted to show anything 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:42.840
 see so here it is a click and all the plug 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.600
 disconnected here metal bracket then 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:51.660
 there is a pressure on it and a plug 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:02:02.340
 removed from sensor 5 here it is with us 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:02:06.500
 Dacha himself so here he is the speed sensor he 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.739
 plastic case in order to 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.450
 you can replace it at all 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.650
 hand that is effort there usually 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.340
 small is applied when 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.410
 wrapping 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.989
 so most likely it will be possible to hand 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.610
 buy and if suddenly 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:26.520
 hand effort fails to unscrew it 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:30.780
 then if I 'm not mistaken, the 22 key will help 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:38.900
 but now we will try after that 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.900
 in hand a little effort relative 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:51.600
 unscrewed and here it is our speed sensor in 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.450
 depending on the car model by year 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.450
 release us install different 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:03.900
 speed sensors that is, the appearance of 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:09.810
 they were different and the part code was different in 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:12.690
 In principle, the replacement judge will be one and 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.410
 the same even if the sensor is different 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.510
 another sensor immediately comes with a plug and from 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.290
 the plug still runs the wire along the length and then 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:26.640
 There is, in principle, in this form even 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:30.810
 it will be more convenient to change it so i'm trying to 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.500
 find the detail code and show now 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.500
 we'll see 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.660
 if I am not mistaken 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.490
 Here it is our code details preferably 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.670
 buy the exact same sensor which 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.360
 It was installed, that is, at least by code 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.490
 spare parts 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.680
 look at the factory catalog 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.549
 because now they are different 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:22.680
 Kalinovsky sensors priorovskie they all 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:25.330
 different in principle for installation 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.870
 show even really nothing and put 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.450
 we wrap the sensor in place in the thread 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:36.520
 there will also be efforts quite hands 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:47.200
 not enough there's nothing you need to turn on 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:52.740
 tighten tightened 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:58.990
 with average effort out on the spot now 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:01.860
 take our plug and again the same 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.130
 side put it in its place 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:09.400
 connect 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:13.210
 that is, until the click is clicked, the plug is heard 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:16.450
 probably connected to the sensor 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:21.370
 on this all no extra 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:23.590
 you don't need tools 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.740
 for channel update like if 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.520
 I liked the video and see you in 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.520
 the following videos
