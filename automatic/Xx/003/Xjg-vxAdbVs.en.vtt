00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.960 
it looks like it is quite soft it's not
very<00:06:30.930> dense<00:06:31.350> at<00:06:31.620> all<00:06:31.770> I<00:06:32.070> wouldn't<00:06:32.430> say<00:06:32.490> it's

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
very dense at all I wouldn't say it's

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.880 
very dense at all I wouldn't say it's
like<00:06:33.150> a<00:06:33.419> brush<00:06:33.870> i<00:06:34.050> would<00:06:34.200> use<00:06:34.409> on<00:06:34.560> a<00:06:34.590> daily

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890

basis

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.999 
basis
but<00:06:36.490> in<00:06:36.699> my<00:06:36.729> purse<00:06:37.210> I<00:06:37.539> think<00:06:37.840> it<00:06:38.080> would<00:06:38.409> do<00:06:38.650> in<00:06:38.919> a

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:39.009 
but in my purse I think it would do in a

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:41.820 
but in my purse I think it would do in a
pinch<00:06:39.449> just<00:06:40.449> like<00:06:40.599> all<00:06:40.780> over<00:06:41.020> powder<00:06:41.319> maybe

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
pinch just like all over powder maybe

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.680 
pinch just like all over powder maybe
like<00:06:42.099> blotting<00:06:42.669> powder<00:06:43.060> or<00:06:43.300> something<00:06:43.569> like

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
like blotting powder or something like

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.020 
like blotting powder or something like
that<00:06:43.750> or<00:06:44.110> like<00:06:44.139> a<00:06:44.530> blush<00:06:45.099> you<00:06:45.669> can<00:06:45.849> definitely

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
that or like a blush you can definitely

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.240 
that or like a blush you can definitely
kind<00:06:46.389> of<00:06:46.539> bring<00:06:47.500> it<00:06:47.620> up<00:06:47.710> a<00:06:47.800> little<00:06:47.919> bit<00:06:48.039> and

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
kind of bring it up a little bit and

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.499 
kind of bring it up a little bit and
make<00:06:48.370> it<00:06:48.490> a<00:06:48.520> little<00:06:48.610> bit<00:06:48.759> more<00:06:48.879> dense<00:06:49.180> if<00:06:49.419> you

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:49.509 
make it a little bit more dense if you

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.270
