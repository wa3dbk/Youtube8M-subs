00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 very good to all welcome to the new 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.319
 video and today I bring you the top 5 of the 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.120
 stronger water type pokemon if I know 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.980
 I raised this top a long time ago 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.049
 but youtube wanted to touch me 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.490
 noses and forced me to erase it so 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.049
 I have to do it again 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.910
 I also lost the audio note where 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.340
 I had everything I had said and I have 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.930
 to say it again but good as 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.699
 I always say in these tops do not find 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.220
 the pokemon that have on this guy like 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.289
 primary and in the types of fire water and 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.800
 plant I do not count the initial pokemon 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.290
 I said this we started in the post 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.090
 number 5 we have steam yum the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.129
 ibi evolutions are in all 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.140
 tops of types and this is the case of 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.300
 steam in the putting is a pokÃ©mon with 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.010
 Quite a balance highlights the points 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.390
 of health and in the special defense 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.480
 everything besides that in the balance that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.000
 he is very well in the position number 4 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.800
 we have cloisters cruises highlights 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.449
 very much for his defense is one of the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.309
 pokemon with more defense among the 10 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.859
 better I would even say between 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.770
 the top 5 but on the other hand it has 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.960
 a very, very bad speed is very slow 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.580
 but good is not bad either because it can 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.670
 resist the blows thanks to its good 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.430
 defending 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.009
 in position number 3 we have the paras 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.689
 the praza as it goes by jon highlights 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.000
 for health points and for defense 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.070
 special lotus is very balanced 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.259
 also but pull more up goes 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.430
 for him he has a normal balance 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.080
 the balance issue but a 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.860
 balance within the upper zone of 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.720
 pokemon and we reached number 2 and 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.299
 to position number 1 because we have a 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.189
 tie this draw is between mails or tics 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.619
 that like peace has 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.450
 balance in the high zone that stands out 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.819
 with his special defense and his attack 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.970
 special and at the same time is tied with 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.860
 degrees was already 2a is about the same 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.229
 that mailo ticks only to stand out in month 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.360
 of the special attack stand out in attack 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.520
 more or less they are very similar and both 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.220
 they are very good pokemon and that is why they are 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.110
 tied in this position good guys 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.390
 I hope you liked the video 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.979
 it has been like this, like it and not 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.530
 worry that this is not the top 5 of 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.240
 today since this is a summary in some 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.310

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.720
