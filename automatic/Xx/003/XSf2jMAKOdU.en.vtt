okay<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.289> fooled<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.550> rip<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.880> paper

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
okay so fooled you have to rip the paper

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.720 
okay so fooled you have to rip the paper
this<00:00:21.570> square<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.439> half<00:00:23.060> anyway<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.689> not<00:00:25.730> and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
this square in half anyway just not and

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.980 
this square in half anyway just not and
then<00:00:26.910> fold<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.510> half<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:28.080> long<00:00:28.109> way<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.900> it

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
then fold it in half the long way so it

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:41.979 
then fold it in half the long way so it
turns<00:00:31.199> into<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.470> square<00:00:38.420> okay<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.860> now<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.920> fold

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
turns into a square okay so now you fold

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.000 
turns into a square okay so now you fold
this<00:00:43.280> corner<00:00:44.280> into<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.960> opposite<00:00:46.739> side<00:00:46.980> like

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
this corner into the opposite side like

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:59.959 
this corner into the opposite side like
that<00:00:57.770> okay<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.980> got<00:00:59.190> some<00:00:59.399> blame<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.730> looks

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
that okay so I got some blame I looks

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.000 
that okay so I got some blame I looks
like<00:01:00.829> this<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.399> then<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.270> fold<00:01:03.570> this

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
like this and then you fold this

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.109 
like this and then you fold this
backwards<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.060> pulled<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:07.040> edge<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
backwards and I pulled this edge to the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:17.570 
backwards and I pulled this edge to the
middle<00:01:09.420> crease<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.710> that's<00:01:16.979> pretty<00:01:17.250> much<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
middle crease and that's pretty much the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.760 
middle crease and that's pretty much the
wing<00:01:18.409> so<00:01:19.409> that's<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:23.689> and<00:01:24.689> if<00:01:25.650> you're

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
wing so that's like this and if you're

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.740 
wing so that's like this and if you're
making<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.159> opposite<00:01:26.700> side<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.659> it

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
making the opposite side just do it

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.090 
making the opposite side just do it
opposite<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:33.150> then<00:01:33.360> sweep<00:01:33.840> fold<00:01:34.170> into<00:01:34.439> four

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
opposite and then sweep fold into four

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.950 
opposite and then sweep fold into four
sectors<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.360> open<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:37.020> hold<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.479> like<00:01:39.479> this

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.800 

just<00:01:42.960> press<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.470> up<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> middle<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.909> then

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
just press it up to the middle and then

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.889 
just press it up to the middle and then
fold<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.590> other<00:01:47.130> two<00:01:47.610> wide<00:01:47.759> edges<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
fold the other two wide edges to the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:02:07.490 
fold the other two wide edges to the
middle

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.840 

because<00:02:08.500> it's<00:02:08.800> trying<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.190> see<00:02:09.399> if<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.640> pause

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
because it's trying to see if the pause

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.800 
because it's trying to see if the pause
button<00:02:10.149> hurts<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.430> anyways<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.630> that's

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
button hurts so anyways this so that's

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.470 
button hurts so anyways this so that's
the<00:02:17.110> wing<00:02:17.400> that's<00:02:18.400> gonna<00:02:18.700> be<00:02:18.819> like<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.150> clock

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
the wing that's gonna be like the clock

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.990 
the wing that's gonna be like the clock
then<00:02:20.350> pleat-fold<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:24.280> that's<00:02:24.520> finish<00:02:24.850> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
then pleat-fold it and that's finish the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.430 
then pleat-fold it and that's finish the
wing<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:28.330> then<00:02:28.510> you're<00:02:28.660> gonna<00:02:28.750> attach<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.260> to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
wing and then you're gonna attach it to

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.460 
wing and then you're gonna attach it to
this<00:02:29.590> part<00:02:30.330> I'm<00:02:31.330> gonna<00:02:31.540> make<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> tutorial<00:02:31.989> of

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
this part I'm gonna make a tutorial of

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.400 
this part I'm gonna make a tutorial of
this<00:02:32.760> don't<00:02:33.760> might<00:02:34.150> look<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.450> lot<00:02:34.600> cooler<00:02:34.989> when

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
this don't might look a lot cooler when

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.140 
this don't might look a lot cooler when
I<00:02:35.709> finish<00:02:36.069> it<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.340> can<00:02:36.520> just<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.910> length

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
I finish it you can just the length

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.690 
I finish it you can just the length
that's<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.290> folding<00:02:38.739> over<00:02:38.950> here<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:40.060> yeah
