it<00:00:24.429> well<00:00:25.060> we're<00:00:25.179> clearly<00:00:25.269> not<00:00:25.419> building

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
it well we're clearly not building

large number of elements of this crisis
so<00:00:30.550> that<00:00:30.579> we<00:00:31.119> can<00:00:31.390> do<00:00:31.569> better<00:00:31.779> in<00:00:32.140> the<00:00:32.710> future

the building rate fell far too low at

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.240 
the end of the last decade this

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.150 
the end of the last decade this
government<00:00:37.690> has<00:00:37.900> got<00:00:38.500> it<00:00:38.650> moving<00:00:38.860> in<00:00:39.070> the

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
government has got it moving in the

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.010 
government has got it moving in the
right<00:00:39.310> direction<00:00:39.490> but<00:00:40.240> we<00:00:40.300> also<00:00:40.510> need<00:00:40.810> to<00:00:40.840> do

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
right direction but we also need to do

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.380 
right direction but we also need to do
something<00:00:41.410> about<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:42.120> question<00:00:43.120> of<00:00:43.240> how<00:00:43.330> many

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
something about the question of how many

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.360 
something about the question of how many
people<00:00:43.900> are<00:00:44.140> welcomed<00:00:44.560> into<00:00:44.740> the<00:00:44.920> country<00:00:45.340> I

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
people are welcomed into the country I

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.970 
people are welcomed into the country I
think<00:00:45.670> we're<00:00:46.210> inviting<00:00:47.170> too<00:00:47.320> many<00:00:47.500> people<00:00:47.860> in

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
think we're inviting too many people in

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.290 
think we're inviting too many people in
and<00:00:48.190> we<00:00:48.280> need<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.550> do<00:00:48.670> something<00:00:49.030> about<00:00:49.150> that

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
and we need to do something about that

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.150 
and we need to do something about that
so<00:00:49.840> that<00:00:49.990> there<00:00:50.110> isn't<00:00:50.230> quite<00:00:50.530> so<00:00:51.070> much

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
so that there isn't quite so much

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.890 
so that there isn't quite so much
pressure<00:00:51.490> we<00:00:51.760> need<00:00:51.880> to<00:00:52.060> build<00:00:52.210> more<00:00:52.600> but<00:00:52.780> there

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
pressure we need to build more but there

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.540 
pressure we need to build more but there
are<00:00:52.990> limits<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.380> how<00:00:53.500> many<00:00:53.620> we<00:00:53.980> can<00:00:54.160> afford<00:00:54.400> to

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
are limits to how many we can afford to

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.670 
are limits to how many we can afford to
build<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.180> how<00:00:55.570> much<00:00:55.750> countryside<00:00:56.350> we<00:00:56.530> can

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
build and how much countryside we can

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.310 
build and how much countryside we can
take<00:00:56.890> up<00:00:57.130> we<00:00:57.940> need<00:00:58.120> to<00:00:58.240> make<00:00:58.390> sure<00:00:58.420> we've<00:00:58.900> got<00:00:59.140> a

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
take up we need to make sure we've got a

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.870 
take up we need to make sure we've got a
better<00:00:59.620> offer<00:00:59.890> for<00:01:00.280> people<00:01:00.310> who<00:01:00.730> are<00:01:00.820> ready

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880

was that we live in an economy which is
about<00:01:23.590> supply<00:01:24.069> and<00:01:24.100> demand

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
about supply and demand

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.359
