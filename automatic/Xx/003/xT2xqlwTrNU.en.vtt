00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.060
 let's make a small floral center 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.060
 As you can see, this is one of the baskets that 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.610
 the first basket that says recycling 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.870
 of paper 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:33.860
 I put it on and added a sponge 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:36.590
 I dried it then I made some flowers 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.050
 artisans of that crepe paper and now 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.170
 I'm going to add a few branches and 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.120
 I'm going to put some ornaments 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.120
 to make a center that looks nice 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.890
 then we cut 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.890
 the tips branches 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.700
 a little shorter 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.970
 Y 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.970
 and 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.979
 and 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.979
 and 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.320
 ah 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.729
 Hello 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.100
 we put you like this around 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.370
 a few do not still remain a little 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.610
 tall 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.290
 we measure more or less what we 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.480
 let's see how we want to be loved 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.989
 high but very high us yes no no 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.989
 we have the flowers that we have 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.209
 handcrafted and we pretend that we 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.209
 they look for precisely 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.000
 A) Yes 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.819
 or not 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.540
 well we put two more 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:32.870
 and now we are going to add a few 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.569
 branches of these that is daisy and you 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:41.680
 I cut a few tips as I was very 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.680
 my aunt so that it does not leave 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.390
 A) Yes 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.099
 but a little bit lower 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.959
 a little bit lower we need 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.170
 A) Yes 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.300
 another one and it arrives 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.090
 Y 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.670
 and here we put the other 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:46.650
 and so on and we have a nice stretch 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.650
 it seems that we have nice 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.510
 because I think so original 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:57.969
 we take advantage of the party you see that ramÃ³n 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:01.419
 coolest to have in any little table 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:05.429
 same in the kitchen and we decorate a 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.429
 heap with these colors well 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.699
 well that's been doing 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:18.740
 now if we want so that we stay 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.740
 we see that we have left 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:41.770
 this is how we look 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.770
 and I'm already 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.209
 we put the flowers you are 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:48.209
 there 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.479
 and it looks a tad more 

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:14.289
 A) Yes 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:17.499
 once you think it's nice, since 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:19.629
 we have a bouquet made in 5 minutes 

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:23.289
 good the flowers had them done but 

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:25.349
 It takes me more I hope you like it and see 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:28.779
 As the basket can also be done without 

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:33.069
 azsa zinc and is beautiful by 

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:35.430
 to make these centers or place things 

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:35.430
 inside
