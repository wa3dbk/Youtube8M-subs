00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.799
 do the review of the application after 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.930
 life for android as we see how you see 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:10.470
 we are already inside it and we have already 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.620
 chosen a photo to edit 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.220
 these first filters here are more 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.220
 for 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.260
 usually have all versions as 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.640
 clarify you have very well what this is for 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.880
 if it's brain jets that's for 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.779
 it's light before 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.779
 the contrast 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.270
 what is this 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.850
 but this is easy that they tend to 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.480
 use many the sisters and this 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.220
 people that do not look bad 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.220
 not that good that too but 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.730
 with this hot cold temperature 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:01.829
 and warm the grain that is this I like 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.829
 a lot that is not seen 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.450
 for example if you feel like you in the 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.900
 Well, I got you all this 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.540
 blur 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.159
 and we also have the saverin that is like 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.689
 sharpness with the 10 the photo 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.689
 now we have two filters 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.570
 Marin Marin is very well 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.330
 pronounce 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.790
 we leave you marín marín 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:37.130
 it is also 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.130
 with its law the law is the best of 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.280
 as you can see they can be superimposed 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.280
 Overlap several 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.219
 filters these are more chips seen 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.810
 and we also have the here you can give 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.939
 turn well on return for draft 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.360
 here we have not expected they are forgotten 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.000
 signs are you are you shavings 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.760
 which are yellow lights 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.690
 the truth that is pretty good one 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.160
 these and now we're going to put frames on them 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.150
 frames so that the photo is going to be able 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.959
 administer we could put 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.989
 of another red color what we want 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:32.319
 leave blank we could put a 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.319
 this default although it costs money 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.860
 we could put it 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.340
 and this we could put it like this 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.830
 and we have a lot of these things 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.160
 and good here 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.160
