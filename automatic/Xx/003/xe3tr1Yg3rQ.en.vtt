00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.140
 fun and folding knives or a pocket 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.879

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.420
 powerful in the glue line of 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.969

 wrist of the stealth collar starting on 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.090
 sleeve is garnished dassier which creates a 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.070
 very strong sensation of solidity and 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.649
 none of the nylon ines teens only 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.990
 reinforced with fibers the handle has a 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.850
 dotted firm texture and 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.179
 adhesion is enhanced with the 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.220
 side grooves i'm not worried 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.530
 about my hand slipped after 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.229
 a few minutes of work with this 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.110
 knife and finally talk about the 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.030
 old stealth duck blade leaving the blade 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.670
 is formed so that you can 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.280
 cut with a knife to any 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.780
 angle the blade duck old stealth starting 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.910
 is big and impressive 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.280
 I read in other reviews too 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.560
 that some people are cutting themselves 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.110
 while they get used to the knife the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.610
 blade is sharpened so be careful 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.619
 when closing 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.110
 I also read a complaint about the 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.179
 rust or i steel in this knife 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.830
 rust especially when it is 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.380
 exposed to water and sweat 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.360
 I noticed some rust stains on 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.760
 the blade after the door hidden in my 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.280
 front belt after a long day 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.920
 hot summer so I used a little 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.140
 of oil and a little elbow grease and the 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.690
 rust was removed and did not reappear 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.209
