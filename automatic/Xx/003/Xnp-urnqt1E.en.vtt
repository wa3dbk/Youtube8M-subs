00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.029
 I'm fine before I start I want to 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.340
 that this video reaches a goal of 100 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.650

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.740
 good as you can see today I bring you a 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.440
 parkour map for the 0.12 point one 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.440
 guys and forgive me because I'm 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.570
 recording the steel point 11.1 is because 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.350
 my devices that have android not 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.960
 they could record this map I do not know why 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.360
 the catcher could not not mark me 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.360
 error and that's why I decided to grab the 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.699
 ipad on my ipad and that's why I decided to record 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.890
 in this in this device 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.470
 being of the 0.11 point one but then 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.910
 nothing happens, guys, nothing happens and so 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.790
 you have to read the information 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.750
 the map was created by maurix follow me on 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.060
 twitter for more maurix maps and a low 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.340
 gamer so well guys there is your 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.940
 twitter so they go and follow them 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.210
 so then you can not pass the map 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.400
 in creative but not flying please no 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.520
 destroy the map because I worked hard 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.660
 I hope you like the map, have fun 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.040
 postscript all jumps are possible ok 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.440
 ok guys, well, I'm going to start 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.810
 from the most difficult so that then 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.570
 we leave so the easier it 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.810
 you have to continue here continue ok 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.850
 welcome to the hard level luck ok 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.580
 guys do not criticize me seriously I'm a 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.369
 I'm not a punny not good, it's super 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.810
 but then nothing happens let's continue 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.810
 voucher voucher 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.990
 I am very no but then nothing happens ok 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.460
 Well, I would say it would be better for 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.460
 each of the levels is 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.830
 three attempts that are three attempts per 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.840
 each level and then we have already already lost 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.840
 one and then let's try this 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.580
 and we close so that we do not 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.660
 confuse no no no no no no better 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.130
 we leave open so that we do not 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.530
 confuse that that has already been 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.840
 used why good guys well this 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.520
 sense of the third attempt good forgiveness 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.520
 so let's try to see what happens 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.590
 ok guys I'm a I'm not a loop but 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.110
 so there you do to see if they can 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.760
 go through the reason why remember 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.329
 guys that are already approaching the 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.730
 0.12 official point 1 then go while 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.069
 they train us a little what has been 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.250
 the parkour but because I am a loop 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.019
 that can not pass parkour is difficult 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.609
 so how can it not happen in 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.739
 difficult let's try it in the middle of 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:10.489
