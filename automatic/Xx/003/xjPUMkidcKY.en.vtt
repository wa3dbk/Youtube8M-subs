00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hello at the microphone on the video in Leary 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.529
 it will be about assassin's creed namely 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.740
 very soon goes assassin's creed 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.870
 unity assassin's creed 3 ag1 and 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.369
 game unity for us gene and handwriting for 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:23.340
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:26.070
 but it's about why assassin's 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:33.329
 creed what's wrong with pines skritt and 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:35.280
 In general, in all this I pour out 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.960
 most recently actually for the first time 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.149
 passed the first assassin's creed this 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.750
 happened in january 2014 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.239
 and it seemed to me that this game 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.030
 definitely deservedly got high 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.579
 grades even here literally passing her 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.160
 after so many years for the first time i can 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.699
 say that for the dumbest and repetitive 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.739
 tasks to perform 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.160
 pretty straightforward and killing their 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.620
 goals 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.370
 hiding great dialogue good 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.549
 characters 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.970
 interesting plot and close my on the very 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.400
 business location but 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.100
 most importantly the game had a binder 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.460
 a link represented by two characters and an excellent 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.610
 themes with genetic memory that gave 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:26.000
 opportunities for special some kind of things 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.560
 which later became just a bottom with 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.370
 business cards series 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.770
 such as tower points so to speak for 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:39.860
 sync and here are these halls couples 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.360
 which again performed the role 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.780
 sync link and giving us 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.410
 kill civilians or not 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.300
 were dying 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.080
 and the fact that we lost sync with 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.160
 to our ancestors it was continued 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.890
 assassin's creed 2 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.210
 again a new hero story development 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.430
 modern character who is close to 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.350
 us more detail more 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.850
 interesting plot again happy 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.800
 huge update to improve gameplay 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.510
 used for a very long time then 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.810
 there is really an assassin creed 2 became 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.390
 so cool drone whole that all 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.500
 insights used teacher contribution 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.040
 I do not give the thread that is, some 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.390
 brother hood revelations of course all 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.010
 finishing the story 2 parts and 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.880
 binder and of 1 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.310
 then comes the third part about which 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.790
 I want to speak well but I can't 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.560
 the game was not very good but it 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.600
 definitely benefited because 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.390
 watch animation was used for it 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.090
 and yes you know what watchdogs game is 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.830
 let's be about her here in general black flag 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.560
 pirated themes mod liked 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.209
 the game went went and after 3 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.590
 very well outlined now 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.280
 two games at once in one day 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.010
 unity and rock rock is supposed to close 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.680
 the whole story 3 4 parts become a binder 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.690
 link link as revelations for the first 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.110
 second and tear 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.650
 and unity should open a new chapter in 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.560
 stories 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.800
 But the problems are such that in fact 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.770
 rock is more important than unity you know why 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.870
 because of the third and fourth part they 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.230
 still not yet fully told 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.870
 The history of the arches in theory should finish 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.570
 in theory for plot and for and in general 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.220
 The series is more important than the unity form under 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.510
 completely new so hard for me 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.620
 understand the desire of yubisoft to release rock on 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.620
 you money 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:50.070
 unity brand new hint to 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.040
 x-ray because unity this game 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:57.530
 completely new she suggests to 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.470
 efficiency which is not bad but in principle 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:05.760
 again, better not better 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:09.240
 first release the unity and then in 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:13.260
 in the end we have examples of good 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:17.100
 using good sales how would 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.220
 transition from one console to another then 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.170
 have ps3 on ps4 xbox 360 on xbox one 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.680
 such a story was with the good flag but 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.060
 the decision is 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.590
 I think she is not perfect 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.820
 wrong because for me personally 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.940
 rock is an interesting game in fact it can 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.580
 bring us together with the father of the main character 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.390
 assassin's creed 3 with characters 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:45.660
 assassin's creed 3 with characters from 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.610
 assassin's creed 4 black flag and in general 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.360
 here it is all connected then there is the north 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.430
 America will be completed as crazy and 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:57.570
 maybe even tell us what the result 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.100
 happens after the third part of our 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.210
 the world 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.900
 we remember that in the third part 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.330
 the ending was serious enough 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.370
 have gotta talked to us about what does 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.490
 everything is not finished and really worth it 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.290
 wait for something but in the end we have 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.760
 we have no yes tells the syrup which 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.420
 coming out simultaneously with the new part 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.580
 unity 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.340
 which is nothing yet 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.750
 it is said 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.300
 in our world and I certainly understand but the game 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.500
 in fact 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.479
 abandons his heritage from 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.820
 the first two parts that were so 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.699
 cool i really loved the first one 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.290
 the second part of the first but what a cool 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.199
 she was like a breath of fresh air 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.970
 she was at that time I was reading magazines and 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.669
 could not believe i looked take 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.229
 gambling did not think God really 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.240
 really such a cool game and she 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.610
 was she there 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.919
 she still has not played a long time 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.970
 By replay 1 part she is very cool 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:57.130
 in the second even brother kutyreva whether chance 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:00.669
 they feel anyway they still have that 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.889
 so here's the story some kind of connection here 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:05.400
 this whole thing is a genetic memory she 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.500
 it worked really cool 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.650
 But apparently in Yubisoft they considered that now 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.580
 it is getting in the way and better we just go 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.820
 according to the plot 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.250
 that is, the story develops 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.350
 there is a common story without a bunch of 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.570
 true that it has passed this 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.300
 genetic memory and change a little bit 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.760
 grieves I think it's wrong and 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.770
 this is really what is wrong with 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:34.360
 assassin's creed unity not assassin's 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:37.930
 creed the threshold but i hope it will be all 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:42.039
 yet so really because the game 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:46.060
 I have not come out yet. I really hope that the lesson 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:48.940
 completed and the unity will continue and it will be 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.430
 very very good because then I 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.000
 I understand what I was carrying, I played previous games 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.970
 series 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.460
 and like a real fan of the first parts 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:01.120
 I mean, I really, really love 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.710
 these games are free to say that 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.960
 no wonder it passed that story 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.050
 continues and that it is still such 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:12.190
 same cool interesting game 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.629
 more precisely a series of games assassin's creed write 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.479
 Please comment your opinions on 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:18.430
 about two games about the whole series that 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.530
 you think that's right 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:24.610
 a genetic memory about how all this 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:27.539
 next idea dropped or yet 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.979
 better here agree with me disagree 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:31.659
 I will be glad to any opinion actually 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:34.870
 because how many people have so many opinions 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:36.879
 I only horror only thank you 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:39.340

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:41.889
