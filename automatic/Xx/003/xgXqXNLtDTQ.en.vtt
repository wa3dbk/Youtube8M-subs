00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630

on the back of my tongue which is making

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.539 
on the back of my tongue which is making
it<00:01:59.740> quite<00:02:00.740> difficult<00:02:01.009> to<00:02:01.280> communicate<00:02:03.520> so<00:02:04.520> I

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
it quite difficult to communicate so I

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.499 
it quite difficult to communicate so I
just<00:02:04.850> found<00:02:04.969> a<00:02:05.119> shiny<00:02:05.299> didn't<00:02:05.929> II<00:02:06.079> I<00:02:07.420> find<00:02:08.420> that

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.160 
just found a shiny didn't II I find that
very<00:02:08.629> hard<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.229> say<00:02:09.440> by<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.679> way<00:02:10.870> that's<00:02:11.870> why<00:02:12.140> I

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
very hard to say by the way that's why I

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.970 
very hard to say by the way that's why I
came<00:02:12.349> up<00:02:12.620> with<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> nickname<00:02:13.430> board<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.829> call<00:02:15.829> it

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
came up with a nickname board I call it
