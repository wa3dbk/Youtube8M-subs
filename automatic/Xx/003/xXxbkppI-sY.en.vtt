00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:03.710
 it will pass free tests 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.310
 bcp presents 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.840
 and he will pass but will be underneath what you will get humala who won the 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.729
 Denmark has won a year here. 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:14.559
 to make you move it away here 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.679
 and he will leave here by the back of the car 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.070
 the accident is certain 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.239
 then fly 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:21.720
 if you look away 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.740
 he is 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.080
 by the way it showed 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.699
 he came over 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.279
 by the roof of the car 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.460
 he came in here he passed here on the fan cover in that direction 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.570
 if you noticed I do not have a car you will realize that it must have good grades 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.280
 like this 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.320
 already to generate an air flow 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.930
 in this sense here 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.840
 so dead cold air between here and here this is if when it reaches the 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.600
 cylinders 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.450
 He's going to make a curve here. 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.450
 here is going to find exhaust is that a whole thing 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.260
 besides that can 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.350
 like the rita going under 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.880
 and over the car 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.890
 the artist passed under the engine 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.600
 it will end up induced the faster the movement is as you see the jokes 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.540
 a little more 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.380
 to marry is valid yes 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.640
 so it's critical that you do not do any operations 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.140
 in the two notes that are such things and that they are concentrated in the truth 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.880
 because that's going to be 48 years, and the lieutenant came by 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.620
 so running is very simple 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.840
 the athlete doing civic 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.020
 to prevent people from doing this 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.020
 how are the major mistakes of the past that the generation 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.350
 It's normal for everyone to forget that the genes they designed 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.580
 the fusca 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.780
 they thought of everything normally who should speak I will improve the floor I will 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.530
 improve that 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.579
 and usually as it is a different car they did not intend to donate 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.180
 people affected by the disease in general 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.970
 diamanti 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.650
 so the first thing is the most common thing you see 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.250
 sometimes you see next 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.850
 a guy walks the road 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.240
 and he thinks turkey needs more time 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.210
 and that country 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.690
 and keep the lid open so 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.479
 file had open lid like this. 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.699
 but next year 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.699
 he will help the mutual in fact what he will do 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.559
 it will hurt a little 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.559
 let's go back to that buffalo thinking on a hot day 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.220
 the hot air 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.220
 happening here only that his tendency 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.449
 if he climbs and he finds in this zone that theoretically is to be a zone of 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:29.539
 low pressure 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.319
 because the vital fury 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.199
 the adventurer niterÃ³i 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.199
 the fan the air wallet 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.009
 What is going to happen cup hot river bowl here 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.879
 He'll end up coming back. 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.229
 so you have some 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.179
 he almost a closed circuit technician 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.279
 a reflection the actor comes out here 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.829
 For those who want it, I've just come back here. 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.629
 will lose click here 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.539
 with this you get the opposite effect of what you imagine 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.520
 or that the person doing 8 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.039
 Imagine how you see it from here. 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.849
 find 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.649
 in this type of car 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:07.169
 and I 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.639
 This must end up hurting 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.149
 another thing 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.259
 which is very common the staff sometimes takes the room attack 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.909
 in the small room 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.970
 if you take that can out here is so more damaging than you think 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.399
 going to be father would bruno senna with the lid open 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:25.930
 because if you have such a can 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.329
 even with the car stationary 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.189
 All that hot air that's trying to get out of here. 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.489
 let's assume you're in position 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.769
 He's going to file right now. 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.769
 so I think if you want to launch the attack 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.729
 which is very important what is there with what happens the hot air that is there that 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.409
 He's crazy to see. 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.219
 so that a region higher than 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.769
 follows below a space of leisure will impose here will close the circuit that goes 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:50.729
 enter here 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:51.999
 is that you 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.870
 in a short time a platoon tour 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.970
 I usually do not see staff that use a fee that will improve 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.659
 refrigeration I see on every hill 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:00.799
 without the room 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.599
 but the main mistake of those who are fixing here is not well designed 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.329
 no fusca keep the lid open 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.579
 in one form or another 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.379
 Hehehe 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.180
 The main thing would be this and you have to watch out for all the bombs by 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.819
 example one from here coming 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:21.359
 the author is very important all the nonsense that has around here has a 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.809
 another ward thinks it's very important 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:26.589
 She's right back here, I guess it's not all to show well on this side. 

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:28.559
 on here 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:31.240
 She's going to have to stay here. She gets stuck in the engine. 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.979
 she stands tall 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.689
 I'm putting my hand on it. 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:39.629
 if you take it from there you can see the path that happens to you 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:43.629
 if you embarrass him in the attack he ends up being critical because I'm done 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.370
 the purchased abacavir on the way to him returns score 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.009
 so he 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.110
 unfortunately 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.660
 Do you have one with the mainz bike? 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.550
 refrigerated as possible 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.199
 keep a jurisdiction in the non refrigerating part of thani 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.589
 tin cans 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:03.909
 in a minute if the port needs to adapt so much they would have already done 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.430
 something is going to be open to poverty is one thing 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.379
 no use you will get nothing 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.319
 if you increase the 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:15.710
 these holes is that sometimes lets the person make a huge cost here this 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.809
 nothing will happen either the engine will not run 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:20.430
 entering the main road 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.830
 promoter here 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.060
 this input that is taken if you check 10 of the 200th month until the last 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.059
 coupled to the sea 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:30.059
 this is that it was practically unaffected why that entry of the 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:31.360
 which they may have 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.229
 aperture which is a bunch of bullshit that sometimes has a function 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:35.860
 of this 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.569
 which is to keep the bike at the right temperature 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:40.610
 of good quality china 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.569
 motorbike on point 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:45.569
 the package regulated belt full attention 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.120
 mixing correct carburetor and oil change 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.789
 in the legal term around 3 to 5 thousand kilometers 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.539
 good luck because the fuschia 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.919
 Take care of him, I did not let him 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:05:59.779
 overheat
