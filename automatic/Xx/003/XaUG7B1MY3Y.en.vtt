controller boards these are some boards
that<00:00:09.520> have<00:00:09.640> come<00:00:09.790> off<00:00:09.820> of<00:00:10.090> these<00:00:10.210> different

hard drives various hard drives you get

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.730 
hard drives various hard drives you get
anything<00:00:14.050> under<00:00:14.620> 80<00:00:15.400> gigabyte<00:00:16.029> typically<00:00:16.740> 80

anything under 80 gigabyte typically 80
gigabyte<00:00:18.220> or<00:00:18.250> below<00:00:18.640> is<00:00:18.970> something<00:00:19.720> that<00:00:19.840> I

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:19.870 
gigabyte or below is something that I

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.650 
gigabyte or below is something that I
would<00:00:20.140> just<00:00:20.470> go<00:00:20.560> ahead<00:00:20.590> and<00:00:20.830> scrap<00:00:21.539> some<00:00:22.539> of

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
would just go ahead and scrap some of

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.240 
would just go ahead and scrap some of
the<00:00:22.720> other<00:00:22.900> ones<00:00:23.080> we<00:00:23.200> try<00:00:23.380> to<00:00:23.440> sell<00:00:23.770> we<00:00:24.070> see

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
the other ones we try to sell we see

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.040 
the other ones we try to sell we see
what<00:00:24.400> we<00:00:24.490> can<00:00:24.640> make<00:00:24.760> out<00:00:24.940> of<00:00:25.000> them<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.900> these

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
what we can make out of them and these

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.630 
what we can make out of them and these
come<00:00:26.320> off<00:00:26.470> of<00:00:26.820> these<00:00:29.190> hard<00:00:30.190> drives<00:00:30.279> like<00:00:30.580> this

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
come off of these hard drives like this

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.220 
come off of these hard drives like this
so<00:00:32.129> we<00:00:33.129> just<00:00:33.309> we<00:00:33.699> do<00:00:33.850> is<00:00:33.909> we<00:00:34.059> take<00:00:34.239> these<00:00:34.449> the

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
so we just we do is we take these the

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.360 
so we just we do is we take these the
cards<00:00:35.409> we<00:00:35.739> will<00:00:36.670> resell<00:00:37.480> or<00:00:37.780> we<00:00:38.499> can<00:00:38.769> we<00:00:39.190> buy

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
cards we will resell or we can we buy

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.270 
cards we will resell or we can we buy
them<00:00:39.550> here<00:00:39.819> too<00:00:40.089> if<00:00:40.839> you've<00:00:41.710> got<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:41.920> bunch<00:00:42.159> of

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
them here too if you've got a bunch of

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.099 
them here too if you've got a bunch of
these<00:00:42.429> we'll<00:00:42.670> buy<00:00:42.819> them<00:00:42.909> by<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.120> pound<00:00:43.420> and

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
these we'll buy them by the pound and

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.439 
these we'll buy them by the pound and
some<00:00:44.889> other<00:00:45.069> places<00:00:45.609> will<00:00:45.879> do<00:00:45.969> that<00:00:46.120> as<00:00:46.269> well

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
some other places will do that as well

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.029 
some other places will do that as well
so<00:00:47.969> let's<00:00:48.969> take<00:00:49.120> this<00:00:49.239> hard<00:00:49.479> drive<00:00:49.719> and<00:00:49.949> one<00:00:50.949> of

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
so let's take this hard drive and one of

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.229 
so let's take this hard drive and one of
the<00:00:51.100> things<00:00:51.309> we<00:00:51.429> want<00:00:51.579> to<00:00:51.609> make<00:00:51.699> sure<00:00:51.760> we<00:00:52.059> try

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
the things we want to make sure we try

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.799 
the things we want to make sure we try
to<00:00:52.299> do<00:00:52.539> is<00:00:53.049> destroy<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:53.859> data<00:00:54.609> as<00:00:55.329> well<00:00:55.389> as

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
to do is destroy the data as well as

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.239 
to do is destroy the data as well as
just<00:00:56.019> getting<00:00:56.139> rid<00:00:56.350> of<00:00:56.409> the<00:00:56.559> controller<00:00:56.979> so

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
just getting rid of the controller so

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:59.539 
just getting rid of the controller so
make<00:00:57.429> the<00:00:57.549> hard<00:00:57.729> drive<00:00:57.940> totally<00:00:58.600> unusable

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
make the hard drive totally unusable

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.129 
make the hard drive totally unusable
anyway<00:01:00.549> I<00:01:00.699> take<00:01:00.969> a<00:01:00.999> couple<00:01:01.269> of<00:01:01.420> what<00:01:01.839> I<00:01:01.870> call

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:02.139 
anyway I take a couple of what I call

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:05.880 
anyway I take a couple of what I call
small<00:01:02.440> screwdrivers<00:01:03.069> and<00:01:03.329> these<00:01:04.500> nice<00:01:05.500> prying

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
small screwdrivers and these nice prying

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.249 
small screwdrivers and these nice prying
tools<00:01:06.430> I<00:01:06.610> just<00:01:07.270> get<00:01:07.420> in<00:01:07.509> there<00:01:07.600> find<00:01:07.899> the<00:01:07.960> spots

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
tools I just get in there find the spots

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.980 
tools I just get in there find the spots
you<00:01:08.409> can<00:01:08.560> get<00:01:08.680> in<00:01:08.770> under<00:01:09.009> it<00:01:09.159> and<00:01:09.729> then<00:01:09.969> a<00:01:10.360> lot

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
you can get in under it and then a lot

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.600 
you can get in under it and then a lot
of<00:01:11.049> times<00:01:11.229> they'll<00:01:11.439> pop<00:01:11.619> off<00:01:11.829> real<00:01:12.070> fast<00:01:12.100> just

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
of times they'll pop off real fast just

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.010 
of times they'll pop off real fast just
like<00:01:12.789> that<00:01:13.000> one<00:01:13.149> sometimes<00:01:13.329> it's<00:01:13.659> a<00:01:13.750> lot<00:01:13.869> more

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
like that one sometimes it's a lot more

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.289 
like that one sometimes it's a lot more
difficult<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:15.189> just<00:01:15.579> reach<00:01:15.969> in<00:01:16.119> there<00:01:16.270> and

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
difficult but just reach in there and

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.630 
difficult but just reach in there and
just<00:01:16.479> pry<00:01:16.780> that<00:01:16.960> card<00:01:17.289> up<00:01:17.500> and<00:01:17.649> then<00:01:18.369> I<00:01:18.520> usually

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
just pry that card up and then I usually

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.539 
just pry that card up and then I usually
twist<00:01:19.149> as<00:01:19.539> well<00:01:19.570> as<00:01:20.140> I'm<00:01:20.380> going<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:21.340> then<00:01:21.460> the

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
twist as well as I'm going and then the

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.459 
twist as well as I'm going and then the
card<00:01:21.789> just<00:01:21.850> comes<00:01:22.149> right<00:01:22.240> off<00:01:22.359> you<00:01:23.140> throw<00:01:23.350> that

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:23.469 
card just comes right off you throw that

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:25.319 
card just comes right off you throw that
part<00:01:23.740> away<00:01:23.829> and<00:01:24.369> now<00:01:24.520> you<00:01:24.579> add<00:01:24.789> that<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.180> your

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
part away and now you add that to your

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.929 
part away and now you add that to your
file<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:26.170> you're<00:01:27.070> done<00:01:27.250> well<00:01:27.579> how<00:01:27.700> do<00:01:27.759> you

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
file and you're done well how do you

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.240 
file and you're done well how do you
make<00:01:28.509> sure<00:01:28.539> that<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:29.079> hard<00:01:29.649> drive<00:01:29.859> doesn't

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
make sure that the hard drive doesn't

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.370 
make sure that the hard drive doesn't
work<00:01:30.399> well<00:01:31.270> this<00:01:31.390> particular<00:01:31.780> one<00:01:32.079> doesn't

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
work well this particular one doesn't

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.950 
work well this particular one doesn't
have<00:01:32.500> an<00:01:32.619> easy<00:01:32.890> method<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.640> do<00:01:33.909> that<00:01:34.149> but<00:01:34.750> some

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
have an easy method to do that but some

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.410 
have an easy method to do that but some
of<00:01:34.990> them<00:01:35.229> do<00:01:35.409> like<00:01:36.369> here's<00:01:36.609> one<00:01:36.759> right<00:01:36.909> here<00:01:36.969> I

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
of them do like here's one right here I

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.240 
of them do like here's one right here I
was<00:01:38.049> trying<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.289> make<00:01:38.469> sure<00:01:38.679> that<00:01:38.829> I<00:01:38.890> look<00:01:39.070> for

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
was trying to make sure that I look for

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.209 
was trying to make sure that I look for
this<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:40.380> I've<00:01:41.380> taken<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.679> little<00:01:41.890> screwdriver

and<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:53.200> can<00:01:53.850> see<00:01:54.850> down<00:01:55.090> in<00:01:55.299> there<00:01:55.450> you'll<00:01:55.630> see

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
and you can see down in there you'll see

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.809 
and you can see down in there you'll see
the<00:01:55.960> hard<00:01:56.200> drive<00:01:56.439> and<00:01:56.979> I<00:01:57.100> just<00:01:57.310> scratch<00:01:57.640> it

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
the hard drive and I just scratch it

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.270 
the hard drive and I just scratch it
real<00:01:57.999> good<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.569> you<00:01:59.560> know<00:01:59.619> maybe<00:01:59.799> turn<00:02:00.069> it<00:02:00.219> a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
real good and you know maybe turn it a

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.550 
real good and you know maybe turn it a
little<00:02:00.460> bit<00:02:00.609> if<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:00.819> can<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.749> couple<00:02:02.229> of<00:02:02.319> times

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
little bit if you can a couple of times

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.480 
little bit if you can a couple of times
and<00:02:02.859> then<00:02:02.950> just<00:02:03.159> scratch<00:02:03.460> it<00:02:03.640> again

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
and then just scratch it again

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.070 
and then just scratch it again
and<00:02:04.760> you<00:02:05.090> know<00:02:05.180> nobody's<00:02:05.600> gonna<00:02:05.690> be<00:02:05.870> able<00:02:06.020> to

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
and you know nobody's gonna be able to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.230 
and you know nobody's gonna be able to
get<00:02:06.170> any<00:02:06.380> data<00:02:06.590> off<00:02:06.830> of<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:07.159> so<00:02:07.790> this<00:02:08.030> hard

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
get any data off of that so this hard

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.740 
get any data off of that so this hard
drive<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:08.509> is<00:02:09.319> well<00:02:09.649> scratched<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.850> you<00:02:11.660> know

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
drive is is well scratched and you know

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.990 
drive is is well scratched and you know
not<00:02:11.959> recoverable<00:02:12.560> now<00:02:13.190> while<00:02:13.430> you're<00:02:13.610> in<00:02:13.640> here

not recoverable now while you're in here
you<00:02:14.420> want<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.630> make<00:02:14.750> sure<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:15.200> you're

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
you want to make sure that you're

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.170 
you want to make sure that you're
looking<00:02:15.440> for<00:02:15.800> your<00:02:15.920> own<00:02:16.040> gold<00:02:16.400> as<00:02:16.700> well

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
looking for your own gold as well

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.330 
looking for your own gold as well
and<00:02:17.270> in<00:02:17.959> this<00:02:18.110> case<00:02:18.380> there's<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.890> little<00:02:19.130> bit<00:02:19.250> of

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
and in this case there's a little bit of

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.090 
and in this case there's a little bit of
gold<00:02:19.490> right<00:02:20.420> there<00:02:20.450> on<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:21.410> connector<00:02:21.920> and

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
gold right there on this connector and

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.580 
gold right there on this connector and
there's<00:02:22.250> one<00:02:22.370> on<00:02:22.489> this<00:02:22.640> one<00:02:22.819> too<00:02:23.290> some<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.440> them

there's one on this one too some of them

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.760 
there's one on this one too some of them
have<00:02:24.770> it<00:02:24.920> some<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.160> them<00:02:25.340> don't<00:02:25.370> I<00:02:25.850> think<00:02:26.330> this

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
have it some of them don't I think this

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.860 
have it some of them don't I think this
this<00:02:27.770> hard<00:02:27.980> drive<00:02:28.160> all<00:02:28.850> I<00:02:28.910> did<00:02:29.150> was<00:02:29.330> scratch<00:02:29.569> it

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
this hard drive all I did was scratch it

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.050 
this hard drive all I did was scratch it
and<00:02:29.989> destroy<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:30.770> but<00:02:31.310> there<00:02:31.459> was<00:02:31.550> no<00:02:31.700> gold

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
and destroy it but there was no gold

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.910 
and destroy it but there was no gold
connectors<00:02:32.390> on<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.319> you<00:02:33.410> always<00:02:33.650> wanted<00:02:33.860> to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
connectors on it so you always wanted to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.979 
connectors on it so you always wanted to
look<00:02:34.130> for<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:35.239> get<00:02:35.390> this<00:02:35.569> off<00:02:35.810> you

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
look for that and to get this off you

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.780 
look for that and to get this off you
just<00:02:36.170> take<00:02:36.319> your<00:02:36.470> small<00:02:36.980> screwdriver<00:02:37.519> and

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
just take your small screwdriver and

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.160 
just take your small screwdriver and
it's<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.570> real<00:02:39.350> thin<00:02:40.120> layer<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:41.810> want<00:02:42.019> to<00:02:42.080> be

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
it's a real thin layer so you want to be

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.840 
it's a real thin layer so you want to be
kind<00:02:42.530> of<00:02:42.620> careful<00:02:42.769> not<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.190> just<00:02:43.400> tear<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.730> all

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
kind of careful not to just tear it all

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.520 
kind of careful not to just tear it all
up<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.600> takes<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.930> little<00:02:45.080> bit<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.320> work

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
up and it takes a little bit of work

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.350 
up and it takes a little bit of work
probably<00:02:45.920> more<00:02:46.040> than<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.250> want<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.430> do<00:02:46.550> just<00:02:46.850> so

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
probably more than I want to do just so

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.970 
probably more than I want to do just so
any<00:02:47.510> on<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.720> video<00:02:48.019> because<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:48.709> want<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:48.890> be

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
more careful with it than that but

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.420 
more careful with it than that but
there's<00:02:51.019> just<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.380> small<00:02:51.590> little<00:02:52.010> pieces<00:02:52.190> of

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430
