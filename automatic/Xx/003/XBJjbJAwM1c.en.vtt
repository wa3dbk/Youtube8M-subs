when<00:00:00.930> dividing<00:00:01.350> complex<00:00:01.500> numbers<00:00:01.920> or<00:00:02.730> writing

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
when dividing complex numbers or writing

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.660 
when dividing complex numbers or writing
complex<00:00:03.510> numbers<00:00:03.899> in<00:00:04.049> fraction<00:00:04.470> form<00:00:04.670> we're

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
complex numbers in fraction form we're

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.900 
complex numbers in fraction form we're
not<00:00:05.819> allowed<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.180> have<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.049> denominator

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
not allowed to have I in the denominator

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.490 
not allowed to have I in the denominator
remember<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.240> equal<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.139> square<00:00:10.410> root

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
remember I is equal to the square root

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.799 
remember I is equal to the square root
of<00:00:10.530> negative<00:00:10.679> 1<00:00:11.240> so<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.360> rule<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.690> very

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
of negative 1 so this rule is very

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.620 
of negative 1 so this rule is very
similar<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.370> not<00:00:14.370> having<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.849> square<00:00:15.179> root<00:00:15.420> in

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
similar to not having a square root in

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.070 
similar to not having a square root in
the<00:00:16.080> denominator<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.859> radical<00:00:17.220> expression

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
the denominator of a radical expression

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.179 
the denominator of a radical expression
so<00:00:19.080> when<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.289> denominator<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:19.859> an

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
so when the denominator is just an

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.519 
so when the denominator is just an
imaginary<00:00:20.580> number<00:00:20.930> we<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:22.050> eliminate<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
imaginary number we can eliminate the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.380 
imaginary number we can eliminate the
eye<00:00:22.560> from<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> denominator<00:00:23.160> by<00:00:24.029> using<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
eye from the denominator by using the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.420 
eye from the denominator by using the
fact<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.810> squared<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.590> equal<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.920> negative

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
fact that I squared is equal to negative

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.240 
fact that I squared is equal to negative
1<00:00:27.140> notice<00:00:28.140> if<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.380> multiply<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.890> by<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.789> over<00:00:30.240> I

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
1 notice if we multiply this by I over I

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.370 
1 notice if we multiply this by I over I
the<00:00:32.250> denominator<00:00:32.700> would<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:32.910> 3i<00:00:33.420> squared<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the denominator would be 3i squared and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.650 
the denominator would be 3i squared and
then<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:34.980> substitute<00:00:35.250> negative<00:00:36.239> 1<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.630> I

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
then we can substitute negative 1 for I

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.660 
then we can substitute negative 1 for I
squared<00:00:36.829> this<00:00:37.829> would<00:00:38.010> simplify<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.489> negative

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
squared this would simplify to negative

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.180 
squared this would simplify to negative
3<00:00:39.239> but<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.260> prefer<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.559> denominator<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.100> be

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
3 but we do prefer the denominator to be

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.549 
3 but we do prefer the denominator to be
positive<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.000> instead<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.020> multiplying<00:00:43.440> by

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
positive so instead of multiplying by

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.240 
positive so instead of multiplying by
IRI

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
IRI

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.279 
IRI
we're<00:00:45.180> actually<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> multiply<00:00:45.930> by

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
we're actually going to multiply by

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.680 
we're actually going to multiply by
negative<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.070> over<00:00:47.430> negative<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:50.420> now<00:00:51.420> we'll<00:00:51.570> go

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
negative I over negative I now we'll go

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.799 
negative I over negative I now we'll go
ahead<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.960> multiply<00:00:52.430> in<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:54.780> numerator

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
ahead and multiply in the numerator

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.270 
ahead and multiply in the numerator
we'll<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.730> negative<00:00:56.730> 6i<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:58.129> then<00:00:59.129> we'll

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
we'll have negative 6i and then we'll

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.070 
we'll have negative 6i and then we'll
have<00:00:59.460> plus<00:00:59.809> 7i<00:01:00.809> squared<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:03.059> notice<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
have plus 7i squared and notice the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.109 
have plus 7i squared and notice the
denominator<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.619> going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.949> negative<00:01:05.640> 3i

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
denominator is going to be negative 3i

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.200 
denominator is going to be negative 3i
squared<00:01:07.549> and<00:01:08.549> now<00:01:08.939> we're<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.150> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
squared and now we're going to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.200 
squared and now we're going to
substitute<00:01:09.479> negative<00:01:10.170> 1<00:01:10.409> for<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.799> squared<00:01:11.210> both

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
substitute negative 1 for I squared both

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.499 
substitute negative 1 for I squared both
in<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> denominator<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.650> numerator<00:01:13.680> so

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
in the denominator and the numerator so

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.310 
in the denominator and the numerator so
we're<00:01:15.509> going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:15.780> negative<00:01:15.990> 6i<00:01:16.970> plus<00:01:18.320> 7

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
we're going to have negative 6i plus 7

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.670 
we're going to have negative 6i plus 7
times<00:01:19.590> negative<00:01:19.920> 1<00:01:20.479> all<00:01:21.479> over<00:01:21.930> negative<00:01:22.140> 3

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
times negative 1 all over negative 3

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.609 
times negative 1 all over negative 3
times<00:01:23.130> negative<00:01:23.400> 1<00:01:24.020> now<00:01:25.020> let's<00:01:25.170> simplify<00:01:25.320> this

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
times negative 1 now let's simplify this

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.649 
times negative 1 now let's simplify this
again<00:01:25.920> I'm<00:01:26.729> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> go<00:01:27.060> ahead<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.299> put<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
again I'm going to go ahead and put the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.260 
again I'm going to go ahead and put the
real<00:01:28.140> part<00:01:28.470> first<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> imaginary<00:01:29.670> part

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
real part first and the imaginary part

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.810 
real part first and the imaginary part
second<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.409> numerator<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.430> notice<00:01:32.700> how

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
second in the numerator so notice how

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.450 
second in the numerator so notice how
we'd<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.060> negative<00:01:33.659> 7<00:01:33.930> minus<00:01:34.619> 6i<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:38.310> can

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
we'd have negative 7 minus 6i and we can

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.660 
we'd have negative 7 minus 6i and we can
leave<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> quotient<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.360> form<00:01:40.670> but

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
leave the quotient in this form but

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.310 
leave the quotient in this form but
sometimes<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.420> also<00:01:42.720> broken<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:43.140> into

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
sometimes this is also broken up into

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.889 
sometimes this is also broken up into
two<00:01:43.530> terms<00:01:43.829> where<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.329> real<00:01:45.630> number

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
two terms where we have the real number

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.679 
two terms where we have the real number
first<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.950> imaginary<00:01:47.340> number<00:01:47.579> second<00:01:48.030> so

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
first and the imaginary number second so

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.880 
first and the imaginary number second so
if<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:48.899> did<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.110> notice<00:01:49.560> how<00:01:49.680> we'd<00:01:49.860> have

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
if we did that notice how we'd have

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.050 
if we did that notice how we'd have
negative<00:01:50.490> 7/3<00:01:52.970> minus<00:01:54.170> 6<00:01:55.170> thirds<00:01:55.500> i<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.790> 6

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
negative 7/3 minus 6 thirds i but 6

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.030 
negative 7/3 minus 6 thirds i but 6
third<00:01:57.360> simplifies<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.049> 2<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.009> have

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
third simplifies to 2 so we have

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.819 
third simplifies to 2 so we have
negative<00:01:59.610> 7/3<00:02:00.469> minus<00:02:01.469> 2i<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.469> also<00:02:04.590> be

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
negative 7/3 minus 2i it can also be

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.850 
negative 7/3 minus 2i it can also be
expressed<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.460> form<00:02:06.439> now<00:02:07.439> let's<00:02:07.649> look<00:02:07.740> at

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
expressed in this form now let's look at

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.609 
expressed in this form now let's look at
our<00:02:07.950> second<00:02:08.340> example

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.500 

when<00:02:11.129> we<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> complex<00:02:11.879> number<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
when we have a complex number in the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.330 
when we have a complex number in the
denominator<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:12.959> has<00:02:13.200> both<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.709> real<00:02:14.010> part

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
denominator that has both a real part

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.150 
denominator that has both a real part
and<00:02:14.580> an<00:02:15.090> imaginary<00:02:15.180> part<00:02:15.629> we<00:02:16.440> multiply<00:02:16.920> both

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
and an imaginary part we multiply both

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.430 
and an imaginary part we multiply both
the<00:02:17.220> numerator<00:02:17.670> denominator<00:02:18.269> by<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.959> complex

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
the numerator denominator by the complex

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.070 
the numerator denominator by the complex
conjugate<00:02:19.769> of<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.580> denominator<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.810> because

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
conjugate of the denominator so because

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.160 
conjugate of the denominator so because
the<00:02:22.170> denominator<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.620> negative<00:02:23.190> 3<00:02:23.430> plus<00:02:23.760> 4i

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
the denominator is negative 3 plus 4i

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.780 
the denominator is negative 3 plus 4i
we're<00:02:25.170> going<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.349> multiply<00:02:25.709> by<00:02:26.010> negative<00:02:26.069> 3

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
we're going to multiply by negative 3

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.309 
we're going to multiply by negative 3
minus<00:02:27.030> 4i<00:02:27.799> over<00:02:28.799> negative<00:02:29.010> 3<00:02:29.489> minus<00:02:30.150> 4i<00:02:33.319> so

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
minus 4i over negative 3 minus 4i so

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.750 
minus 4i over negative 3 minus 4i so
we'll<00:02:34.470> have<00:02:34.560> 4<00:02:34.890> products<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.489> numerator

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
we'll have 4 products in the numerator

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.360 
we'll have 4 products in the numerator
and<00:02:36.000> 4<00:02:36.660> products<00:02:36.989> in<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.200> denominator<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:40.370> if

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
and 4 products in the denominator so if

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.870 
and 4 products in the denominator so if
negative<00:02:41.700> 2<00:02:41.849> times<00:02:42.239> negative<00:02:42.360> 3<00:02:42.810> that's<00:02:42.959> 6

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
negative 2 times negative 3 that's 6

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.940 
negative 2 times negative 3 that's 6
negative<00:02:44.880> 2<00:02:45.060> times<00:02:45.480> negative<00:02:45.690> 4i<00:02:46.260> that's<00:02:46.620> plus

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
negative 2 times negative 4i that's plus

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.890 
negative 2 times negative 4i that's plus
8i<00:02:48.980> positive<00:02:49.980> 5i<00:02:50.190> times<00:02:50.790> negative<00:02:51.090> 3i<00:02:51.540> that's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
8i positive 5i times negative 3i that's

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.089 
8i positive 5i times negative 3i that's
-15<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.099> and<00:02:53.750> then<00:02:54.750> positive<00:02:55.049> 5i<00:02:55.530> times

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
-15 I and then positive 5i times

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.240 
-15 I and then positive 5i times
negative<00:02:56.610> 4i<00:02:56.849> that's<00:02:57.180> minus<00:02:58.170> 20<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.590> squared

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
negative 4i that's minus 20 I squared

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.180 
negative 4i that's minus 20 I squared
and<00:03:00.079> then<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.170> denominator<00:03:01.319> we'll<00:03:02.010> have

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
and then the denominator we'll have

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.860 
and then the denominator we'll have
negative<00:03:02.519> 3<00:03:02.849> times<00:03:03.180> negative<00:03:03.299> 3<00:03:03.629> that's<00:03:03.930> 9<00:03:04.260> and

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
negative 3 times negative 3 that's 9 and

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.869 
negative 3 times negative 3 that's 9 and
then<00:03:06.870> negative<00:03:07.110> 3<00:03:07.319> times<00:03:07.890> negative<00:03:08.040> 4y<00:03:08.610> that's

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
then negative 3 times negative 4y that's

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.100 
then negative 3 times negative 4y that's
plus<00:03:09.269> 12i<00:03:10.940> then<00:03:11.940> we<00:03:12.060> have<00:03:12.180> positive<00:03:12.420> 4i<00:03:12.930> times

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
plus 12i then we have positive 4i times

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.479 
plus 12i then we have positive 4i times
negative<00:03:13.799> 3i<00:03:14.250> that's<00:03:14.519> minus<00:03:14.970> 12i<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:17.010> the

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
negative 3i that's minus 12i and the

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.430 
negative 3i that's minus 12i and the
last<00:03:17.700> product<00:03:17.970> is<00:03:18.150> going<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.329> be<00:03:18.420> 4i<00:03:18.870> times

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
last product is going to be 4i times

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.009 
last product is going to be 4i times
negative<00:03:19.829> 4i<00:03:20.220> or<00:03:20.489> minus<00:03:21.000> 16<00:03:21.569> I<00:03:22.019> squared<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.930> now

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
negative 4i or minus 16 I squared so now

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.240 
negative 4i or minus 16 I squared so now
we're<00:03:25.109> going<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.319> combine<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.680> imaginary

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
we're going to combine the imaginary

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.059 
we're going to combine the imaginary
numbers<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:26.900> substitute<00:03:27.900> negative<00:03:28.440> 1<00:03:28.620> for<00:03:29.040> I

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
numbers and substitute negative 1 for I

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.860 
numbers and substitute negative 1 for I
squared<00:03:32.269> so<00:03:33.269> when<00:03:33.389> the<00:03:33.480> numerator<00:03:33.630> we're

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
squared so when the numerator we're

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.009 
squared so when the numerator we're
going<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.019> have<00:03:34.109> 6<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:35.519> then<00:03:35.639> we<00:03:35.760> have<00:03:35.910> 8<00:03:36.239> minus

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
going to have 6 and then we have 8 minus

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.270 
going to have 6 and then we have 8 minus
15<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.650> that's<00:03:37.889> negative<00:03:38.459> 7i<00:03:39.090> or<00:03:39.269> minus<00:03:39.660> 7i

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
15 I that's negative 7i or minus 7i

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.520 
15 I that's negative 7i or minus 7i
minus<00:03:41.280> 20<00:03:41.959> times<00:03:42.959> negative<00:03:43.709> 1<00:03:44.190> for<00:03:44.609> I<00:03:44.639> squared

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
minus 20 times negative 1 for I squared

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.420 
minus 20 times negative 1 for I squared
notice<00:03:46.530> in<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.799> denominator<00:03:47.250> we<00:03:47.400> have

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
notice in the denominator we have

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.490 
notice in the denominator we have
opposite<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:48.359> measuring<00:03:48.690> numbers<00:03:48.989> here<00:03:49.349> and

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
opposite and measuring numbers here and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.220 
opposite and measuring numbers here and
here<00:03:49.739> that's<00:03:49.889> 0<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.750> we<00:03:51.900> have<00:03:51.930> 9<00:03:52.760> minus<00:03:53.760> 16<00:03:54.389> then

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
here that's 0 so we have 9 minus 16 then

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
here that's 0 so we have 9 minus 16 then
again<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.650> squared<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.130> equal<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.400> negative<00:03:56.579> 1

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
again I squared is equal to negative 1

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.259 
again I squared is equal to negative 1
so<00:03:59.250> looking<00:03:59.519> at<00:03:59.639> the<00:03:59.760> numerator<00:03:59.849> we're<00:04:00.239> going

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
so looking at the numerator we're going

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.240 
so looking at the numerator we're going
to<00:04:00.450> have<00:04:00.630> 6<00:04:01.560> this<00:04:01.859> will<00:04:02.010> be<00:04:02.130> plus<00:04:02.489> 20<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:03.239> 26

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
to have 6 this will be plus 20 so 26

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.940 
to have 6 this will be plus 20 so 26
minus<00:04:05.250> 7i<00:04:06.109> the<00:04:07.109> denominator<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.590> going<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.799> be

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
minus 7i the denominator is going to be

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.220 
minus 7i the denominator is going to be
9<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.609> this<00:04:08.819> will<00:04:08.940> be<00:04:09.060> plus<00:04:09.239> 16<00:04:09.930> or<00:04:10.290> 25<00:04:12.200> so<00:04:13.200> we

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
9 and this will be plus 16 or 25 so we

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.110 
9 and this will be plus 16 or 25 so we
can<00:04:13.440> express<00:04:13.739> this<00:04:14.010> quotient<00:04:14.489> in<00:04:14.579> this<00:04:14.730> form

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
can express this quotient in this form

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.430 
can express this quotient in this form
or<00:04:16.019> again<00:04:16.320> if<00:04:16.410> we<00:04:16.530> want<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:18.019> we<00:04:19.019> can<00:04:19.169> break<00:04:19.320> this

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
or again if we want to we can break this

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.649 
or again if we want to we can break this
up<00:04:19.590> into<00:04:19.739> two<00:04:20.099> terms<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.969> real<00:04:21.150> part<00:04:21.479> would<00:04:21.630> be

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
up into two terms the real part would be

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.050 
up into two terms the real part would be
twenty<00:04:22.530> six<00:04:22.770> twenty<00:04:23.159> fifths

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
twenty six twenty fifths

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.790 
twenty six twenty fifths
and<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.270> imaginary<00:04:24.660> part<00:04:24.900> would<00:04:25.020> be<00:04:25.050> minus

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
and the imaginary part would be minus

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.629 
and the imaginary part would be minus
seven<00:04:26.960> twenty-fifths<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:31.460> okay<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.490> hope<00:04:32.580> you

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
seven twenty-fifths I okay I hope you

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.060 
seven twenty-fifths I okay I hope you
