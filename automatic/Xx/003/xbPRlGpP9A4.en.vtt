why<00:00:41.010> most<00:00:41.610> people<00:00:41.790> use<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.840> what<00:00:42.989> I

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
why most people use this this is what I

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.350 
why most people use this this is what I
was<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.559> learned<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.950> when<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.219> was<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.399> kid<00:00:44.670> you

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
was I learned on when I was a kid you

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.959 
was I learned on when I was a kid you
can<00:00:45.600> use<00:00:45.780> other<00:00:46.140> size<00:00:46.649> hitting<00:00:47.610> needles

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
can use other size hitting needles

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.880 
can use other size hitting needles
different<00:00:48.690> patterns<00:00:49.050> call<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.590> different

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
different patterns call for different

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.209 
different patterns call for different
widths<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:52.140> you're<00:00:52.530> not<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:53.070> know

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
widths so it's you're not you know

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.590 
widths so it's you're not you know
hooked<00:00:53.789> into<00:00:54.000> just<00:00:54.300> using<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.840> one<00:00:55.050> size<00:00:56.600> now

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.500 
hooked into just using this one size now

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
the single crochet just a little easier

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.590 
the single crochet just a little easier
to<00:01:15.630> work<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:16.830> why<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> use<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.640> I'll

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
to work with so that's why I use it I'll

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
knitting needle like so I have to bring

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.450 
knitting needle like so I have to bring
it<00:01:50.330> all<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.570> way<00:01:50.810> down<00:01:50.840> past<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.800> point<00:01:52.010> okay

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
it all the way down past the point okay

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.190 
it all the way down past the point okay
because<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:53.030> want<00:01:53.060> all<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.540> loops<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.930> be<00:01:54.050> the

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
because you want all the loops to be the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.080 
because you want all the loops to be the
same<00:01:54.440> size<00:01:56.380> now<00:01:58.210> this<00:01:59.210> loop<00:01:59.420> we<00:01:59.570> just<00:01:59.780> put<00:02:00.050> on

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
same size now this loop we just put on

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.450 
same size now this loop we just put on
corresponds<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.630> very<00:02:02.900> first<00:02:03.460> stitch

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.560 
corresponds to the very first stitch
that<00:02:04.910> we<00:02:05.090> did<00:02:05.560> here<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.940> we're<00:02:08.060> going<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.270> skip

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.999 
that we did here so we're going to skip
that<00:02:08.750> one<00:02:08.810> we're<00:02:09.110> going<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.259> go<00:02:09.440> into<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.800> next

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.550 
now we're going to go to the next stitch
again<00:02:41.110> yarn<00:02:41.740> over<00:02:44.520> pull<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.550> through<00:02:46.440> bring<00:02:47.440> it

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
again yarn over pull it through bring it

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.020 
again yarn over pull it through bring it
up<00:02:48.780> slide<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:49.810> over<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.260> needle<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.730> then

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
up slide it over the needle and then

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.640 
up slide it over the needle and then
pull<00:02:52.090> tighten<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.780> up<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.960> little<00:02:53.110> bit<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.720> just

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
pull tighten it up a little bit and just

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:09.830 
pull tighten it up a little bit and just
keep<00:02:56.830> doing<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.190> with<00:02:57.400> each<00:02:57.520> stitch

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.610 

and<00:03:10.140> no<00:03:10.850> this<00:03:11.850> isn't<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.390> fastest<00:03:13.020> technique

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
and no this isn't the fastest technique

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.750 
and no this isn't the fastest technique
to<00:03:14.459> do<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:15.740> normally<00:03:16.740> I<00:03:16.920> would<00:03:17.220> have<00:03:17.250> the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
to do this normally I would have the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.980 
to do this normally I would have the
needle<00:03:18.709> between<00:03:19.709> my<00:03:19.830> legs<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:21.810> would

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
needle between my legs and that would

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.780 
needle between my legs and that would
hold<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.380> needle<00:03:22.620> for<00:03:22.800> me<00:03:22.830> but<00:03:23.069> this<00:03:23.220> way<00:03:23.490> that

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
hold the needle for me but this way that

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.670 
hold the needle for me but this way that
we<00:03:23.880> have<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.060> show<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.840> have<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.350> hold<00:03:25.560> the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
we have to show you I have to hold the

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.130 
we have to show you I have to hold the
needle<00:03:26.040> as<00:03:26.250> well<00:03:26.640> as<00:03:26.850> do<00:03:27.000> everything<00:03:27.300> else<00:03:27.450> so

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
needle as well as do everything else so

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.840 
needle as well as do everything else so
that's<00:03:28.350> why<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.709> just<00:03:29.010> takes<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.459> little<00:03:29.580> bit

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
that's why it just takes a little bit

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.809 
that's why it just takes a little bit
longer<00:03:30.950> eventually<00:03:31.950> you'll<00:03:32.130> get<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.310> rhythm

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
longer eventually you'll get a rhythm

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.729 
longer eventually you'll get a rhythm
when<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.209> start<00:03:33.510> doing<00:03:33.720> this<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.319> it'll<00:03:34.530> be<00:03:34.709> a

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
when you start doing this and it'll be a

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.220 
when you start doing this and it'll be a
lot<00:03:34.950> faster<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:37.940> you<00:03:38.940> won't<00:03:39.150> get<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:40.050> won't

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
lot faster and you won't get you won't

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.680 
lot faster and you won't get you won't
look<00:03:40.350> at<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.800> say<00:03:40.980> geez<00:03:41.459> that's<00:03:42.300> taking

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
look at it and say geez that's taking

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.590 
look at it and say geez that's taking
forever<00:03:43.190> it<00:03:44.190> doesn't<00:03:44.640> usually<00:03:44.820> they<00:03:45.360> call

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
forever it doesn't usually they call

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.960 
forever it doesn't usually they call
this<00:03:45.750> jiffy<00:03:46.200> lace<00:03:46.410> but<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:47.130> have<00:03:47.370> my<00:03:47.489> doubts<00:03:47.550> as

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
this jiffy lace but I have my doubts as

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.570 
this jiffy lace but I have my doubts as
to<00:03:48.000> whether<00:03:48.090> or<00:03:48.300> not<00:03:48.330> it's<00:03:48.570> really<00:03:48.840> jiffy<00:03:49.350> I

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
to whether or not it's really jiffy I

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.620 
to whether or not it's really jiffy I
suppose<00:03:50.580> like<00:03:50.820> I<00:03:50.970> said<00:03:51.150> if<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:51.300> get<00:03:51.450> in<00:03:51.540> a

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
suppose like I said if you get in a

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.259 
suppose like I said if you get in a
rhythm<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:53.070> can<00:03:53.250> do<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.550> that<00:03:53.730> way<00:03:53.760> you

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
rhythm and you can do it that way you

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.150 
rhythm and you can do it that way you
can<00:03:56.900> speed<00:03:57.900> up<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.170> process<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.680> little<00:03:58.980> bit

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
can speed up the process a little bit

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.970 
can speed up the process a little bit
but<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.390> does<00:04:00.810> take<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.170> little<00:04:01.410> while<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.680> get

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
but it does take a little while to get

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.880 
but it does take a little while to get
everything<00:04:02.100> on<00:04:02.780> here<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:03.900> I'm<00:04:04.050> using<00:04:04.319> I'm

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
everything on here and I'm using I'm

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.610 
everything on here and I'm using I'm
only<00:04:05.160> using<00:04:05.610> 15<00:04:06.060> stitches<00:04:06.390> because<00:04:07.019> for<00:04:07.440> my

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.960 
you skip the stitch you don't have
enough<00:05:36.490> loops

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
enough loops

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.230 
enough loops
I<00:05:37.050> have<00:05:38.050> 15<00:05:38.470> stitches<00:05:38.620> I<00:05:39.039> need<00:05:39.190> 15<00:05:39.610> loops<00:05:39.849> so

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
I have 15 stitches I need 15 loops so
