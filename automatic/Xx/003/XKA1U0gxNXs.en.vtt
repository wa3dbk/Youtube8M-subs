that I'm very mobile for the most part

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
but the last several months with all the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.170 
but the last several months with all the
traveling<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.739> addition<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.370> training<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
traveling in addition to training and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.830 
traveling in addition to training and
working<00:00:48.360> at<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> computer<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> lot<00:00:49.289> has<00:00:50.660> made<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
working at a computer a lot has made the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.880 
working at a computer a lot has made the
my<00:00:52.170> life<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.680> little<00:00:52.860> more<00:00:54.289> inflexible<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.530> guess

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
my life a little more inflexible I guess

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.090 
my life a little more inflexible I guess
I'll<00:00:56.070> say<00:00:56.309> even<00:00:57.000> though<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.180> makes<00:00:57.329> no<00:00:57.539> sense

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
I'll say even though that makes no sense

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.799 
I'll say even though that makes no sense
so<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.489> that's<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.120> lift<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.449> normally

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
so that that's a lift that normally

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.360 
so that that's a lift that normally
shouldn't<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.199> hurting<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.590> badly<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.190> it's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
shouldn't be hurting that badly but it's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.329 
shouldn't be hurting that badly but it's
it's<00:01:02.609> killing<00:01:02.850> me<00:01:03.059> Blake<00:01:03.809> here<00:01:04.220> looks<00:01:05.220> like

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
it's killing me Blake here looks like

least favorite exercises but it's

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.810 
least favorite exercises but it's
something<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.799> lot<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.159> myself<00:01:59.369> because

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
something I do a lot with myself because

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.010 
something I do a lot with myself because
my<00:01:59.850> jerk<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:01.399> horrendous<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.719> one<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.780> my<00:02:03.840> big

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.679 
my jerk is horrendous and one of my big
problems<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.130> total<00:02:06.060> lack<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.329> leg

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
problems is just a total lack of leg

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.540 
problems is just a total lack of leg
strength<00:02:07.079> especially<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.829> position<00:02:08.009> so

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
strength especially in that position so

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.420 
strength especially in that position so
I<00:02:08.789> find<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.599> if<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:09.869> those<00:02:10.430> periodically

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
I find that if I do those periodically

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.390 
I find that if I do those periodically
for<00:02:11.819> you

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
for you

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.860 
for you
couple<00:02:12.819> months<00:02:13.090> here<00:02:13.299> and<00:02:13.360> there<00:02:13.510> kind<00:02:13.840> of

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
couple months here and there kind of

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.360 
couple months here and there kind of
towards<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.170> beginning<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.620> training<00:02:14.769> cycles

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
towards the beginning of training cycles

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.640 
towards the beginning of training cycles
that<00:02:15.549> it<00:02:15.670> definitely<00:02:16.480> helps<00:02:16.870> shore<00:02:17.110> up<00:02:17.349> my

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
that it definitely helps shore up my

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.179 
that it definitely helps shore up my
jerk<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.879> don't<00:02:19.510> feel<00:02:20.079> like<00:02:20.140> I'm<00:02:20.439> about<00:02:21.129> to

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
jerk and I don't feel like I'm about to

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.559 
jerk and I don't feel like I'm about to
die<00:02:21.810> as<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.650> initiate<00:02:24.189> the<00:02:24.340> dip<00:02:24.519> of<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:25.150> jerk<00:02:25.420> when

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
die as I initiate the dip of a jerk when

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.229 
die as I initiate the dip of a jerk when
it's<00:02:25.750> over<00:02:25.989> 110<00:02:26.500> kilos<00:02:26.829> which<00:02:27.040> for<00:02:28.000> those<00:02:28.120> of

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
it's over 110 kilos which for those of

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.550 
it's over 110 kilos which for those of
you<00:02:28.299> who've<00:02:28.450> ever<00:02:28.540> tried<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:28.900> it's<00:02:29.349> not<00:02:29.530> a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
you who've ever tried that it's not a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.190 
you who've ever tried that it's not a
super<00:02:30.209> confidence-inspiring<00:02:31.209> position<00:02:32.079> to

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
super confidence-inspiring position to

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.000 
super confidence-inspiring position to
be<00:02:32.319> in<00:02:32.349> so<00:02:33.930> let's<00:02:34.930> see<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:35.170> don't<00:02:35.439> even<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.769> can't

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
be in so let's see I don't even I can't

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.210 
be in so let's see I don't even I can't
see<00:02:36.159> what<00:02:36.280> this<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.519> I<00:02:36.609> think<00:02:36.640> 182<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:39.069> looks

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
see what this is I think 182 it looks

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.309 
see what this is I think 182 it looks
like<00:02:39.370> it's<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.970> red<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.420> blue<00:02:40.659> is<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.840> yellow<00:02:41.170> and

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
like it's a red to blue is a yellow and

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.240 
like it's a red to blue is a yellow and
a<00:02:41.379> and<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.799> one<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.640> outside<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:45.040> that's

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
a and the one on the outside so that's

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.270 
a and the one on the outside so that's
honestly<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> little<00:02:46.329> a<00:02:46.810> little<00:02:47.440> faster<00:02:48.129> than<00:02:48.159> I

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
honestly a little a little faster than I

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.270 
honestly a little a little faster than I
would<00:02:48.459> normally<00:02:48.489> have<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.420> exercise<00:02:49.840> done

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
would normally have that exercise done

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.770 
would normally have that exercise done
if<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.370> recall<00:02:51.549> correctly<00:02:51.909> that<00:02:52.269> day<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.480> was

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
if I recall correctly that day I was

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.869 
if I recall correctly that day I was
that<00:02:53.349> was<00:02:53.530> not<00:02:54.099> feeling<00:02:54.459> great<00:02:54.579> and<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.790> was

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
that was not feeling great and I was

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.550 
that was not feeling great and I was
getting<00:02:55.060> super<00:02:55.299> dizzy<00:02:55.780> on<00:02:55.870> those<00:02:56.139> so<00:02:56.349> I<00:02:56.379> was

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
getting super dizzy on those so I was

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.599 
getting super dizzy on those so I was
probably<00:02:56.680> trying<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.069> rush<00:02:57.250> through<00:02:57.280> them

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
probably trying to rush through them

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.599 
probably trying to rush through them
before<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.939> fell<00:02:58.510> over<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:58.959> died<00:02:59.400> like<00:03:00.400> they're

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
before I fell over and died like they're

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.330 
before I fell over and died like they're
snatch<00:03:00.849> poles<00:03:01.150> 120<00:03:01.840> pretty<00:03:02.560> big<00:03:02.709> big<00:03:02.980> chunk<00:03:03.250> of

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
snatch poles 120 pretty big big chunk of

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.819 
snatch poles 120 pretty big big chunk of
weight<00:03:03.519> that's<00:03:03.989> ten<00:03:04.989> kilos<00:03:05.319> over<00:03:05.530> his<00:03:05.620> best

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
weight that's ten kilos over his best

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.890 
weight that's ten kilos over his best
snatch<00:03:06.129> so<00:03:06.430> we're<00:03:06.609> working<00:03:06.730> up<00:03:07.030> pretty<00:03:07.569> heavy

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
snatch so we're working up pretty heavy

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.440 
snatch so we're working up pretty heavy
poles<00:03:08.230> on<00:03:08.470> those<00:03:09.150> this<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.389> guess<00:03:11.189> 192<00:03:12.450> game

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
poles on those this is a guess 192 game

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.300 
poles on those this is a guess 192 game
a<00:03:13.480> little<00:03:13.810> bit<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:14.049> rush<00:03:14.290> jerk<00:03:14.739> dip<00:03:14.980> squat

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
a little bit of a rush jerk dip squat

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.610 
a little bit of a rush jerk dip squat
should<00:03:15.730> be<00:03:15.879> a<00:03:15.909> little<00:03:16.199> more<00:03:17.199> slow<00:03:17.590> and

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
should be a little more slow and

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.589 
should be a little more slow and
controlled<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:19.060> should<00:03:19.209> really<00:03:19.389> feel

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
controlled you should really feel

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.150 
controlled you should really feel
tension<00:03:19.930> on<00:03:20.139> your<00:03:20.260> legs<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.590> entire<00:03:20.859> time

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
tension on your legs the entire time

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.970 
tension on your legs the entire time
feel<00:03:21.489> that<00:03:21.699> balance<00:03:22.150> there's<00:03:23.079> a<00:03:23.169> couple

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
feel that balance there's a couple

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.800 
feel that balance there's a couple
variations<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.849> that<00:03:24.970> exercise<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.629> are<00:03:25.720> all

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
variations of that exercise that are all

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.189 
variations of that exercise that are all
really<00:03:26.109> similar<00:03:26.379> is<00:03:27.239> what<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.269> call<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.569> jerk<00:03:28.870> dip

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
really similar is what I call a jerk dip

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.680 
really similar is what I call a jerk dip
which<00:03:30.099> essentially<00:03:30.970> looks<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.269> same<00:03:31.449> but

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
which essentially looks the same but

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.360 
which essentially looks the same but
you're<00:03:31.810> trying<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.260> actually<00:03:32.620> dip<00:03:33.099> down

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
you're trying to actually dip down

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.250 
you're trying to actually dip down
really<00:03:33.699> quickly<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.389> make<00:03:34.540> that<00:03:34.720> bar<00:03:34.989> bounce

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
really quickly to make that bar bounce

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.199 
really quickly to make that bar bounce
and<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:36.250> you're<00:03:36.400> having<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.699> absorb<00:03:37.120> that

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
and so you're having to absorb that

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.770 
and so you're having to absorb that
downward<00:03:37.599> force<00:03:38.109> and<00:03:38.909> you're<00:03:39.909> not<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.449> worried

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
downward force and you're not so worried

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.259 
downward force and you're not so worried
about<00:03:40.840> actually<00:03:41.260> standing<00:03:41.680> up<00:03:41.829> all<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.129> way

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
about actually standing up all the way

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.849 
about actually standing up all the way
there's<00:03:43.269> a<00:03:43.449> jerk<00:03:43.690> dip<00:03:43.900> squat<00:03:44.199> which<00:03:44.409> that<00:03:44.620> was

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
there's a jerk dip squat which that was

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.379 
there's a jerk dip squat which that was
although<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.280> little<00:03:45.549> bit<00:03:45.699> slower<00:03:46.000> would<00:03:46.269> be

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
although a little bit slower would be

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:51.839 
although a little bit slower would be
ideal<00:03:46.840> there<00:03:47.530> is<00:03:47.889> a<00:03:48.419> jerk<00:03:49.419> spring<00:03:50.069> which<00:03:51.069> you

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
ideal there is a jerk spring which you

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.539 
ideal there is a jerk spring which you
basically<00:03:52.449> are<00:03:52.680> it's<00:03:53.680> kind<00:03:53.859> of<00:03:53.919> bouncing<00:03:54.430> in

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
basically are it's kind of bouncing in

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.129 
basically are it's kind of bouncing in
the<00:03:54.639> bottom<00:03:54.909> of<00:03:55.000> that<00:03:55.090> dip<00:03:55.329> trying<00:03:55.659> to<00:03:55.720> feel

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
the bottom of that dip trying to feel

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.379 
the bottom of that dip trying to feel
that<00:03:56.349> elasticity<00:03:56.919> and<00:03:57.370> train<00:03:57.639> that<00:03:57.879> timing

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
that elasticity and train that timing

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.659 
that elasticity and train that timing

and that bounciness and the bottom and

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.699 
and that bounciness and the bottom and
there's<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.060> jerk<00:04:01.269> drive<00:04:01.569> or<00:04:01.959> some<00:04:02.470> people<00:04:02.590> call

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
there's a jerk drive or some people call

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.050 
there's a jerk drive or some people call
them<00:04:02.889> half<00:04:03.129> jerks<00:04:03.489> where<00:04:03.699> it's<00:04:03.849> basically

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
them half jerks where it's basically

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.300 
them half jerks where it's basically
half<00:04:04.510> a<00:04:04.690> push<00:04:04.930> press<00:04:05.199> you<00:04:05.500> dip<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:05.919> drive<00:04:06.099> the

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
half a push press you dip and drive the

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.909 
half a push press you dip and drive the
bar<00:04:06.489> up<00:04:06.870> you<00:04:07.870> push<00:04:08.109> it<00:04:08.229> a<00:04:08.319> couple<00:04:08.590> inches<00:04:08.709> off

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
bar up you push it a couple inches off

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.099 
bar up you push it a couple inches off
your<00:04:08.949> shoulder<00:04:09.489> and<00:04:09.669> that's<00:04:09.819> is<00:04:10.060> so<00:04:10.329> you<00:04:10.989> don't

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
your shoulder and that's is so you don't

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.659 
your shoulder and that's is so you don't
actually<00:04:11.319> ever<00:04:11.530> get<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:11.859> overhead<00:04:12.190> but<00:04:12.459> that's

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
actually ever get it overhead but that's

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.789 
actually ever get it overhead but that's
kind<00:04:13.359> of<00:04:13.419> like<00:04:13.540> a<00:04:13.569> jerk<00:04:13.810> dip<00:04:13.989> squat<00:04:14.319> but<00:04:14.590> with

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
kind of like a jerk dip squat but with

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.930 
kind of like a jerk dip squat but with
an<00:04:15.069> actual<00:04:15.519> aggressive<00:04:16.239> drive<00:04:16.510> at<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.810> top

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
an actual aggressive drive at the top

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.580 
an actual aggressive drive at the top
back<00:04:18.940> squat<00:04:19.299> triples<00:04:19.900> here

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
back squat triples here

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.429 
back squat triples here
I<00:04:21.620> am<00:04:22.490> NOT<00:04:22.879> a<00:04:22.909> very<00:04:23.360> strong<00:04:23.689> squatter<00:04:24.169> it's

00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:24.439 
I am NOT a very strong squatter it's

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:27.719 
I am NOT a very strong squatter it's
it's<00:04:25.039> the<00:04:25.340> thing<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.759> am<00:04:25.909> the<00:04:25.939> worst<00:04:26.509> at<00:04:26.810> so

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
it's the thing I am the worst at so

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.450 
it's the thing I am the worst at so
anytime<00:04:28.729> I<00:04:28.939> have<00:04:29.180> to<00:04:29.300> do<00:04:29.449> squats<00:04:30.279> not<00:04:31.279> that<00:04:31.400> I

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
anytime I have to do squats not that I

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.219 
anytime I have to do squats not that I
ever<00:04:31.490> have<00:04:31.849> to<00:04:32.029> do<00:04:32.150> in<00:04:32.270> my<00:04:32.300> program<00:04:32.719> for<00:04:32.870> myself

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
ever have to do in my program for myself

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.640 
ever have to do in my program for myself
so<00:04:33.439> really<00:04:33.650> it's<00:04:33.770> my<00:04:33.919> own<00:04:34.039> damn<00:04:34.159> fault<00:04:34.219> but<00:04:34.909> I

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
so really it's my own damn fault but I

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.149 
so really it's my own damn fault but I
don't<00:04:36.650> particularly<00:04:37.009> enjoy<00:04:37.219> them<00:04:37.759> and<00:04:38.029> I

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159 
don't particularly enjoy them and I

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.790 
don't particularly enjoy them and I
would<00:04:40.159> behoove<00:04:41.029> me<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.449> get<00:04:41.569> my<00:04:41.689> squat<00:04:42.080> up<00:04:42.259> so<00:04:42.770> I

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
would behoove me to get my squat up so I

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.369 
would behoove me to get my squat up so I
wouldn't<00:04:43.069> be<00:04:43.219> so<00:04:43.460> so<00:04:44.330> miserable<00:04:44.900> every<00:04:45.110> time<00:04:45.289> I

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
wouldn't be so so miserable every time I

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.429 
wouldn't be so so miserable every time I
came<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.740> it<00:04:45.979> in<00:04:46.099> particular<00:04:46.639> but<00:04:46.849> I<00:04:47.289> do<00:04:48.289> what<00:04:48.379> I

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:48.439 
came to it in particular but I do what I

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:52.300 
came to it in particular but I do what I
can<00:04:48.680> with<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:49.099> resources<00:04:49.699> I<00:04:49.909> have<00:04:50.889> Steve<00:04:51.889> here

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
can with the resources I have Steve here

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.429 
can with the resources I have Steve here
one-twenty<00:04:53.240> I<00:04:53.449> think<00:04:53.629> he's<00:04:53.719> got<00:04:53.870> three<00:04:54.229> push

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:54.439 
one-twenty I think he's got three push

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:55.929 
one-twenty I think he's got three push
presses<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:55.159> then<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.279> jerk

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:55.939 
presses and then a jerk

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:02.409 
presses and then a jerk
I<00:04:56.800> believe<00:04:57.800> his<00:04:57.919> best<00:04:58.669> single<00:04:59.300> is<00:05:00.460> 141<00:05:01.460> for<00:05:02.389> a

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
I believe his best single is 141 for a

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.080 
I believe his best single is 141 for a
push<00:05:02.659> press<00:05:02.960> so<00:05:03.490> that's<00:05:04.490> a<00:05:04.610> pretty<00:05:04.819> good<00:05:04.939> chunk

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
push press so that's a pretty good chunk

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.140 
push press so that's a pretty good chunk
I<00:05:05.479> believe<00:05:05.659> he<00:05:05.779> goes<00:05:05.960> up<00:05:06.169> from<00:05:06.319> here<00:05:06.560> though

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
I believe he goes up from here though

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.649 
I believe he goes up from here though
he's<00:05:08.199> his<00:05:09.199> jerk<00:05:09.680> dip<00:05:09.979> is<00:05:10.759> a<00:05:10.819> good<00:05:11.120> one<00:05:11.300> to<00:05:11.449> watch

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659 
he's his jerk dip is a good one to watch

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.040 
he's his jerk dip is a good one to watch
because<00:05:11.689> he's<00:05:12.409> he's<00:05:12.979> very<00:05:13.279> springy<00:05:13.879> so<00:05:14.839> he's

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
because he's he's very springy so he's

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.459 
because he's he's very springy so he's
got<00:05:15.229> a<00:05:15.259> nice<00:05:15.919> rhythm<00:05:16.310> he<00:05:16.909> tends<00:05:17.180> to<00:05:17.270> be<00:05:17.469> have

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:18.469 
got a nice rhythm he tends to be have

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:22.149 
got a nice rhythm he tends to be have
that<00:05:18.620> nice<00:05:18.800> smooth<00:05:19.249> but<00:05:19.610> quick<00:05:20.830> bounce<00:05:21.830> in<00:05:22.069> the

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
that nice smooth but quick bounce in the

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.879 
that nice smooth but quick bounce in the
bottom<00:05:22.520> without<00:05:22.699> the<00:05:23.389> bar<00:05:23.650> bouncing<00:05:24.650> on<00:05:24.740> his

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
bottom without the bar bouncing on his

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.860 
bottom without the bar bouncing on his
shoulder<00:05:25.219> so<00:05:25.339> he<00:05:25.400> never<00:05:25.490> loses<00:05:26.210> connection<00:05:26.629> to

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
shoulder so he never loses connection to

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.050 
shoulder so he never loses connection to
the<00:05:26.930> bar<00:05:27.110> even<00:05:27.560> though<00:05:27.740> he's<00:05:28.699> going

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
the bar even though he's going

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.589 
the bar even though he's going
relatively<00:05:29.569> quickly<00:05:30.669> which<00:05:31.669> is<00:05:31.699> kind<00:05:32.449> of<00:05:32.479> the

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
relatively quickly which is kind of the

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:33.939 
relatively quickly which is kind of the
ideal<00:05:32.870> thing<00:05:33.080> to<00:05:33.199> do<00:05:33.319> you<00:05:33.469> want<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:33.680> be<00:05:33.740> able<00:05:33.830> to

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
ideal thing to do you want to be able to

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.550 
ideal thing to do you want to be able to
dip<00:05:34.219> with<00:05:34.430> a<00:05:34.509> pretty<00:05:35.509> good<00:05:35.719> speed<00:05:36.080> so<00:05:36.349> you<00:05:36.379> can

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
dip with a pretty good speed so you can

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.550 
dip with a pretty good speed so you can
get<00:05:36.740> some<00:05:37.009> some<00:05:37.729> whip<00:05:37.939> on<00:05:38.149> the<00:05:38.270> bar<00:05:38.479> and<00:05:38.839> get<00:05:39.529> a

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
get some some whip on the bar and get a

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.469 
get some some whip on the bar and get a
good<00:05:39.740> stretch<00:05:39.949> shortening<00:05:40.460> reflux<00:05:41.210> out<00:05:41.389> of

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
good stretch shortening reflux out of

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.600 
good stretch shortening reflux out of
your<00:05:41.569> legs<00:05:41.779> but<00:05:42.469> if<00:05:42.589> you<00:05:42.680> drop<00:05:43.009> out<00:05:43.250> from<00:05:43.370> under

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
your legs but if you drop out from under

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.879 
your legs but if you drop out from under
the<00:05:43.699> bar<00:05:43.879> too<00:05:44.060> abruptly<00:05:44.569> the<00:05:44.779> bar<00:05:44.960> bounces<00:05:45.770> on

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
the bar too abruptly the bar bounces on

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.889 
the bar too abruptly the bar bounces on
your<00:05:46.039> shoulders<00:05:46.399> it<00:05:46.580> moves<00:05:47.180> out<00:05:47.360> of<00:05:47.389> position

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:47.899 
your shoulders it moves out of position

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:50.320 
your shoulders it moves out of position
it<00:05:48.050> can<00:05:48.139> throw<00:05:48.349> you<00:05:48.409> forward<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:50.180> if<00:05:50.270> the

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
it can throw you forward and if the

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.329 
it can throw you forward and if the
timing<00:05:50.810> is<00:05:50.960> perfectly<00:05:51.439> wrong<00:05:51.710> then<00:05:52.039> you<00:05:52.189> end

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:52.339 
timing is perfectly wrong then you end

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:54.879 
timing is perfectly wrong then you end
up<00:05:52.520> basically<00:05:53.419> trying<00:05:53.689> to<00:05:53.750> drive<00:05:54.050> up<00:05:54.379> through

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
up basically trying to drive up through

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:56.740 
up basically trying to drive up through
the<00:05:55.009> bar<00:05:55.219> when<00:05:55.490> it's<00:05:55.639> falling<00:05:55.969> back<00:05:56.270> down<00:05:56.300> on

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
the bar when it's falling back down on

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:57.650 
the bar when it's falling back down on
it<00:05:56.870> so

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
it so

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.750 
it so
you<00:05:58.500> have<00:05:58.590> to<00:05:58.740> kind<00:05:59.040> of<00:05:59.070> find<00:05:59.340> that<00:05:59.430> perfect

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
you have to kind of find that perfect

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.210 
you have to kind of find that perfect
balance<00:06:00.060> between<00:06:00.560> adequate<00:06:01.560> speed<00:06:01.800> to<00:06:02.040> get<00:06:02.160> a

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
balance between adequate speed to get a

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.700 
balance between adequate speed to get a
good<00:06:02.430> balance<00:06:02.640> and<00:06:03.110> being<00:06:04.110> in<00:06:04.260> total<00:06:04.410> control

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
good balance and being in total control

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.530 
good balance and being in total control
of<00:06:04.920> the<00:06:05.070> barn<00:06:05.280> and<00:06:05.520> being<00:06:05.850> totally<00:06:06.120> connected

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
of the barn and being totally connected

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.920 
of the barn and being totally connected
to<00:06:06.690> it<00:06:07.580> just<00:06:08.580> doing<00:06:08.850> back<00:06:09.000> offsets<00:06:09.510> here<00:06:09.750> so<00:06:09.900> I

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
to it just doing back offsets here so I

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.290 
to it just doing back offsets here so I
think<00:06:10.020> I<00:06:10.260> went<00:06:10.740> up<00:06:10.800> to<00:06:10.860> 200<00:06:11.460> for<00:06:11.580> a<00:06:11.610> triple<00:06:12.000> and

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
think I went up to 200 for a triple and

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.040 
think I went up to 200 for a triple and
then<00:06:12.600> 190<00:06:13.230> for<00:06:13.380> triple<00:06:13.710> and<00:06:13.830> then<00:06:13.890> 180<00:06:15.050> was

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
then 190 for triple and then 180 was

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.920 
then 190 for triple and then 180 was
this<00:06:16.230> one<00:06:16.410> here<00:06:16.910> so<00:06:17.910> that's<00:06:18.420> a<00:06:18.510> pretty<00:06:18.720> good

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
this one here so that's a pretty good

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.470 
this one here so that's a pretty good
day<00:06:19.050> of<00:06:19.200> squatting<00:06:19.530> for<00:06:19.680> me<00:06:19.980> I<00:06:20.010> mean<00:06:20.310> I<00:06:20.580> don't

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
day of squatting for me I mean I don't

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.980 
day of squatting for me I mean I don't
it<00:06:22.110> doesn't<00:06:22.380> get<00:06:22.470> much<00:06:22.620> better<00:06:22.680> than<00:06:22.920> that<00:06:23.070> and

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
it doesn't get much better than that and

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.760 
it doesn't get much better than that and
most<00:06:24.990> of<00:06:25.110> the<00:06:26.060> most<00:06:27.060> of<00:06:27.270> the<00:06:27.390> time<00:06:27.690> the<00:06:28.320> squats

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
most of the most of the time the squats

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.840 
most of the most of the time the squats
I'm<00:06:29.010> doing<00:06:29.370> are<00:06:29.520> nowhere<00:06:30.360> near<00:06:30.540> my<00:06:30.990> best<00:06:31.850> which

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
I'm doing are nowhere near my best which

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.680 
I'm doing are nowhere near my best which
is<00:06:33.060> already<00:06:33.570> low<00:06:33.930> so<00:06:35.360> you<00:06:36.360> know<00:06:36.480> there's

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
is already low so you know there's

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.570 
is already low so you know there's
there's<00:06:37.170> definitely<00:06:37.410> long<00:06:37.830> periods<00:06:38.250> of<00:06:38.340> time

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
there's definitely long periods of time

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.870 
there's definitely long periods of time
where<00:06:39.290> for<00:06:40.290> example<00:06:40.410> I<00:06:40.980> won't<00:06:41.220> front<00:06:41.580> squat

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
where for example I won't front squat

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.970 
where for example I won't front squat
more<00:06:42.750> than<00:06:42.960> I've<00:06:43.050> been<00:06:43.290> clean<00:06:43.530> and<00:06:43.650> jerking

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:43.980 
more than I've been clean and jerking

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.910 
more than I've been clean and jerking
and<00:06:44.100> training<00:06:44.520> for<00:06:45.510> you<00:06:45.840> know<00:06:45.930> months<00:06:46.620> at<00:06:46.890> a

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:46.920 
and training for you know months at a

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.330 
and training for you know months at a
time<00:06:47.040> which<00:06:47.840> again<00:06:48.840> is<00:06:49.050> not<00:06:49.230> great<00:06:49.560> for<00:06:49.590> one's

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
time which again is not great for one's

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.330 
time which again is not great for one's
confidence<00:06:51.060> going<00:06:51.930> into<00:06:52.110> a<00:06:52.320> competition<00:06:52.560> but

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
confidence going into a competition but

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.150 
confidence going into a competition but
I've<00:06:53.610> just<00:06:53.820> kind<00:06:54.060> of<00:06:54.530> just<00:06:55.530> got<00:06:55.710> to<00:06:55.800> learn<00:06:55.980> to

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 
I've just kind of just got to learn to

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.440 
I've just kind of just got to learn to
accept<00:06:56.550> it<00:06:56.730> and<00:06:56.940> I<00:06:57.630> definitely<00:06:58.200> don't<00:06:58.920> use<00:06:59.450> my

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
accept it and I definitely don't use my

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.230 
accept it and I definitely don't use my
squats<00:07:00.900> at<00:07:01.110> any<00:07:01.230> given<00:07:01.470> time<00:07:01.740> as<00:07:02.070> the<00:07:02.670> the<00:07:02.940> true

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
squats at any given time as the the true

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.690 
squats at any given time as the the true
measure<00:07:03.900> of<00:07:04.050> my<00:07:04.740> ability<00:07:05.220> in<00:07:05.280> the<00:07:05.370> snatch<00:07:05.550> and

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:05.700 
measure of my ability in the snatch and

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.090 
measure of my ability in the snatch and
clean<00:07:05.790> jerk<00:07:06.210> I<00:07:06.440> use<00:07:07.440> the<00:07:07.650> snatch<00:07:07.860> and<00:07:08.010> clean

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 
clean jerk I use the snatch and clean

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.120 
clean jerk I use the snatch and clean
and<00:07:08.340> jerk<00:07:08.550> oddly<00:07:08.790> enough<00:07:09.260> so<00:07:10.260> I<00:07:10.680> just<00:07:10.920> have

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.130 
and jerk oddly enough so I just have

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.550 
and jerk oddly enough so I just have
found<00:07:11.310> that<00:07:11.520> that<00:07:11.730> my<00:07:11.910> strength<00:07:12.350> numbers<00:07:13.350> you

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
found that that my strength numbers you

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.470 
found that that my strength numbers you

jerk<00:07:25.350> kind<00:07:25.590> of<00:07:25.650> just<00:07:25.770> depends<00:07:26.130> on<00:07:26.280> the<00:07:27.000> rest<00:07:27.210> of

jerk kind of just depends on the rest of
my<00:07:27.419> training<00:07:27.930> and<00:07:28.140> what's<00:07:28.680> going<00:07:28.950> on<00:07:29.160> in<00:07:29.550> the

Steve<00:07:35.970> here<00:07:36.300> back<00:07:36.900> squat<00:07:37.169> triple<00:07:37.530> I<00:07:37.620> can't

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:37.860 
Steve here back squat triple I can't

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.200 
Steve here back squat triple I can't
even<00:07:37.980> see<00:07:38.280> what's<00:07:38.460> on<00:07:38.550> the<00:07:38.669> bar<00:07:38.880> that<00:07:38.910> my

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.210 
even see what's on the bar that my

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.350 
even see what's on the bar that my
screen<00:07:39.540> is<00:07:39.690> a<00:07:39.720> little<00:07:40.580> too<00:07:41.580> small<00:07:41.820> there<00:07:42.090> I

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 
screen is a little too small there I

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.510 
screen is a little too small there I
think<00:07:42.600> that<00:07:42.900> was<00:07:43.140> probably<00:07:43.290> 215<00:07:44.100> and<00:07:44.310> he<00:07:44.400> was

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 
think that was probably 215 and he was

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.380 
think that was probably 215 and he was
going<00:07:44.730> for<00:07:45.410> not<00:07:46.410> quite<00:07:46.770> I<00:07:47.040> think<00:07:47.520> his<00:07:48.150> best

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:48.390 
going for not quite I think his best

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.409 
going for not quite I think his best
triple<00:07:48.900> is<00:07:49.160> 210<00:07:50.160> if<00:07:50.550> I'm<00:07:50.730> not<00:07:50.850> mistaken<00:07:51.180> or

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:51.419 
triple is 210 if I'm not mistaken or

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:54.320 
triple is 210 if I'm not mistaken or
maybe<00:07:51.540> it's<00:07:51.690> 206<00:07:52.550> so<00:07:53.550> maybe<00:07:53.760> that<00:07:54.090> could<00:07:54.210> have

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:54.330 
maybe it's 206 so maybe that could have
