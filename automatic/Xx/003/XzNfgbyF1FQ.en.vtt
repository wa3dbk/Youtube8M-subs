milliamp<00:02:51.900> hour<00:02:52.080> battery<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.519> not<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
milliamp hour battery so it's not the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.030 
milliamp hour battery so it's not the
biggest<00:02:54.209> one<00:02:54.450> out<00:02:54.690> there<00:02:54.989> but<00:02:55.320> it's<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:56.060> fairly

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
biggest one out there but it's a fairly

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.830 
biggest one out there but it's a fairly
juicy<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.340> hopefully<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.390> will<00:03:00.630> be<00:03:00.840> able<00:03:00.989> to

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
juicy and hopefully it will be able to

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.600 
juicy and hopefully it will be able to
allow<00:03:03.840> us<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.200> have<00:03:04.230> some<00:03:05.010> decent<00:03:05.459> battery

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
allow us to have some decent battery
