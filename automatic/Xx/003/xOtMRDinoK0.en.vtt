pretty<00:01:05.040> easy<00:01:05.220> which<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.270> kind<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.750> this

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
pretty easy which I kind of like in this

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.600 
pretty easy which I kind of like in this
gameplay<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.260> think<00:01:07.500> at<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> end<00:01:07.830> gameplay<00:01:08.369> had

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
gameplay I think at the end gameplay had

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.090 
gameplay I think at the end gameplay had
three<00:01:09.330> captures<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.930> about<00:01:10.080> 20<00:01:10.380> defends<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
three captures in about 20 defends and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.780 
three captures in about 20 defends and
ended<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.580> going<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:11.970> 95<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:12.930> um

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
ended up going like 95 and for um

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.950 
ended up going like 95 and for um
actually<00:01:14.790> another<00:01:15.270> I'm<00:01:15.689> playing<00:01:15.900> with

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
actually another I'm playing with

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.330 
actually another I'm playing with
another<00:01:16.080> youtuber<00:01:16.770> he's<00:01:16.920> not<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.189> best

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
another youtuber he's not the best

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.530 
another youtuber he's not the best
youtuber<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> think<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.180> does<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.509> for

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
youtuber I think it just does it for

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.570 
youtuber I think it just does it for
commentaries<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.140> such<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.280> think<00:01:20.490> he

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
commentaries and such and I think he

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.240 
commentaries and such and I think he
invited<00:01:20.939> his<00:01:21.030> friend<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.630> his<00:01:21.659> friend<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.500> all

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
invited his friend and his friend is all

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.830 
invited his friend and his friend is all

To Your Strengths with this gun um
earlier<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.880> saw<00:03:36.060> me<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.299> gameplay<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.690> was

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
earlier you saw me in the gameplay I was

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.090 
earlier you saw me in the gameplay I was
up<00:03:36.989> in<00:03:37.049> that<00:03:37.200> building<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.650> was<00:03:37.709> getting<00:03:37.980> a

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
up in that building I was getting a

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.500 
up in that building I was getting a
bunch<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.400> hit<00:03:38.579> markers<00:03:38.880> i<00:03:38.970> shot<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.239> guy<00:03:39.329> like

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
bunch of hit markers i shot the guy like

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.120 
bunch of hit markers i shot the guy like
10<00:03:39.690> times<00:03:39.900> i<00:03:40.049> got<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.260> bunch<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.500> markers<00:03:40.980> on

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
10 times i got a bunch of markers on

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.400 
10 times i got a bunch of markers on
maps<00:03:41.970> like<00:03:42.180> meltdown<00:03:42.600> you<00:03:42.959> probably<00:03:43.140> want<00:03:43.380> to

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
maps like meltdown you probably want to

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.830 
maps like meltdown you probably want to
run<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.590> long<00:03:43.680> barrel<00:03:44.239> because<00:03:45.239> there's<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.570> lot

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
run a long barrel because there's a lot

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.319 
run a long barrel because there's a lot
of<00:03:45.870> long<00:03:46.140> long<00:03:46.769> line<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.160> sites<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.790> would<00:03:48.150> do<00:03:48.299> it

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
of long long line of sites I would do it

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.449 
of long long line of sites I would do it
on<00:03:48.510> drone<00:03:48.900> as<00:03:49.079> well<00:03:49.290> like<00:03:49.799> on<00:03:49.920> raid<00:03:50.160> you<00:03:50.340> can

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
on drone as well like on raid you can

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.560 
on drone as well like on raid you can
probably<00:03:50.730> get<00:03:50.820> away<00:03:50.850> with<00:03:51.000> cook<00:03:51.269> draw<00:03:51.480> because

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
probably get away with cook draw because

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.270 
probably get away with cook draw because
you're<00:03:51.780> going<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.930> be<00:03:52.019> up<00:03:52.140> close<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:52.530> up<00:03:53.040> close

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
you're going to be up close and up close

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.370 
you're going to be up close and up close
and<00:03:53.489> personal<00:03:53.519> but<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.239> maps<00:03:54.750> like<00:03:54.930> meltdown

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
and personal but I maps like meltdown

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.170 
and personal but I maps like meltdown
and<00:03:55.650> drone<00:03:55.920> with<00:03:56.100> long<00:03:56.340> line<00:03:56.579> of<00:03:56.610> sites<00:03:56.940> I

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
and drone with long line of sites I

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.060 
and drone with long line of sites I
suggest<00:03:57.750> using<00:03:57.900> long<00:03:58.230> barrel<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.560> not<00:03:58.799> using

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
suggest using long barrel and not using

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.039 
suggest using long barrel and not using
quick<00:03:59.220> draw<00:03:59.400> but<00:04:00.329> like<00:04:00.450> said<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.780> really

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
quick draw but like said you really

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.539 
quick draw but like said you really
don't<00:04:01.230> need<00:04:01.350> you<00:04:01.680> really<00:04:01.860> don't<00:04:02.070> need<00:04:02.220> extreme

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
don't need you really don't need extreme

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.690 
don't need you really don't need extreme

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
another thing you guys could do you can

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.770
