 will focus on showing life 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.770
 in this staff 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.989

 the mystery of where this 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.100
 will it be supernatural sec was bench 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.320
 by the government and just watching 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.810
 discovering the series is based on the book by 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.540
 citibank on fire or 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.250
 huge book has 20,000 pages I 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.290
 I still need to read the first season 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.390
 it's over last year and now it's 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.130
 start the second occurs some time ago 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.600
 to watch the first season and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.820
 beginning with the beginning of the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.860
 second I think this is the take back is 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.110
 one of my favorite series of the year 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.399
 past and I really want the second 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.930
 season because it's so fucking expensive 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.750
 the second series that I indicate for 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.909
 You are the match between history today. 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.740
 of the series will revolve around the dilma she 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.750
 who moved to New York thinking that 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.570
 It's your dream job, the apartment. 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.430
 of dreams and arriving there discovered that 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.079
 company was bankrupt and had no 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.969
 the apartment and hence she did not 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.579
 You can go back to her house and have to 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.920
 and stay in New York and pack with 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.259
 a classmate to share a 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.859
 apartment and that's where she finds the 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.469
 club 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.810
 to clone that the same land is difficult to 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.000
 dealing with and using the dubious means to 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.640
 prove its theories as once it 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.580
 stayed with her boyfriend, she's new to 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.320
 to prove to her that he was an idiot 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.930
 the two do not get along very well at first 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.040
