you

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:01:10.700 

hmm

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.810 

you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.219 

at<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.940> moment<00:01:19.090> I've<00:01:19.360> just<00:01:19.390> got<00:01:19.690> it<00:01:19.720> charging

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
at the moment I've just got it charging

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.080 
at the moment I've just got it charging
up<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.979> there's<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.369> battery<00:01:21.549> in<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.790> back<00:01:21.940> of

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
up and there's a battery in the back of

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.660 
up and there's a battery in the back of
this<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.890> takes<00:01:24.159> three<00:01:24.400> hours<00:01:24.430> to

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
this and that takes three hours to

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.580 
this and that takes three hours to
charge<00:01:24.760> and<00:01:25.240> gives<00:01:25.420> about<00:01:25.630> ten<00:01:25.900> days<00:01:26.110> of<00:01:26.380> use

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
charge and gives about ten days of use

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.870 
charge and gives about ten days of use
and<00:01:28.290> possibly<00:01:29.290> on<00:01:29.530> that<00:01:30.159> is<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.490> main<00:01:30.670> reason

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
and possibly on that is the main reason

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.030 
and possibly on that is the main reason
exactly<00:01:31.509> why<00:01:31.720> I<00:01:31.750> bought<00:01:32.170> this<00:01:32.409> is<00:01:32.650> because<00:01:32.950> you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
exactly why I bought this is because you

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.520 
exactly why I bought this is because you
get<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.190> lot<00:01:33.369> of<00:01:33.430> these<00:01:33.520> these<00:01:34.119> mirrors<00:01:34.540> all

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
get a lot of these these mirrors all

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.920 
get a lot of these these mirrors all
these<00:01:35.950> systems<00:01:36.460> in<00:01:36.640> general<00:01:37.060> but<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.659> trouble

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
these systems in general but the trouble

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.330 
these systems in general but the trouble
is<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.140> need<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:38.409> have<00:01:38.590> fun<00:01:38.740> while<00:01:38.979> all<00:01:39.250> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
is you need to have fun while all the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.190 
is you need to have fun while all the
time<00:01:39.520> once<00:01:40.030> it's<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.360> charged<00:01:40.810> up

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
time once it's a charged up

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.830 
time once it's a charged up
I<00:01:41.229> can<00:01:41.680> disconnect<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.100> wire<00:01:42.310> wire<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:43.720> then

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
I can disconnect the wire wire and then

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.139 
I can disconnect the wire wire and then
is<00:01:43.990> totally<00:01:44.470> wireless<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.880> actual

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
is totally wireless and the actual

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.999 
is totally wireless and the actual
camera<00:01:46.570> comes<00:01:46.869> with<00:01:46.990> his<00:01:47.259> wireless<00:01:47.680> as<00:01:47.830> well

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
camera comes with his wireless as well

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.370 
camera comes with his wireless as well
and<00:01:48.640> that's<00:01:48.850> one<00:01:49.119> of<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.299> big<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:50.140> biggest

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
and that's one of the big the biggest

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.930 
and that's one of the big the biggest
things<00:01:50.740> I<00:01:50.890> needed<00:01:51.160> I<00:01:51.369> want<00:01:51.580> something<00:01:51.820> that

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
things I needed I want something that

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.510 
things I needed I want something that
was<00:01:52.090> totally<00:01:52.300> wireless<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:53.050> can't<00:01:53.410> stand<00:01:53.800> these

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
was totally wireless I can't stand these

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.010 
was totally wireless I can't stand these
systems<00:01:55.119> that<00:01:55.360> might<00:01:55.570> be<00:01:55.690> a<00:01:55.720> little<00:01:55.780> bit

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
systems that might be a little bit

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.570 
systems that might be a little bit
cheaper<00:01:56.200> on<00:01:56.440> eBay<00:01:56.770> but<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.190> trouble<00:01:57.490> is

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
cheaper on eBay but the trouble is

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.120 
cheaper on eBay but the trouble is
you've<00:01:57.820> got<00:01:58.000> million<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:58.539> one<00:01:58.659> ways<00:01:58.830> wires<00:01:59.830> to

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
you've got million and one ways wires to

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.730 
you've got million and one ways wires to
the<00:02:00.220> unit<00:02:00.640> wires<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.570> camera<00:02:02.050> wires<00:02:02.590> from

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
the unit wires to the camera wires from

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.719 
the unit wires to the camera wires from
the<00:02:02.830> camera<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:04.750> your<00:02:04.840> car<00:02:05.110> so<00:02:05.890> this<00:02:06.520> is<00:02:06.700> a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
the camera to your car so this is a

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.580 
the camera to your car so this is a
completely<00:02:07.179> wireless<00:02:07.630> system<00:02:08.019> once<00:02:08.229> has<00:02:08.380> been

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
completely wireless system once has been

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.949 
completely wireless system once has been
charged<00:02:09.039> up<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:10.090> other<00:02:10.269> reason<00:02:10.660> as<00:02:10.780> well

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
charged up and the other reason as well

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.660 
charged up and the other reason as well
is<00:02:11.230> because<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:12.130> is<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:14.069> discrete<00:02:15.069> system

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
is because it is a discrete system

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.030 
is because it is a discrete system
whereby<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.959> know<00:02:17.080> sits<00:02:17.440> at<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.620> top<00:02:17.830> of<00:02:17.980> the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
whereby you know sits at the top of the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.270 
whereby you know sits at the top of the
car<00:02:18.810> outside<00:02:19.810> many<00:02:20.440> one<00:02:20.650> who<00:02:20.739> wants<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.069> sort

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
car outside many one who wants to sort

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.610 
car outside many one who wants to sort
of<00:02:21.370> smash<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.090> into<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.480> grab<00:02:22.690> something<00:02:22.989> you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
of smash you into and grab something you

this<00:02:33.310> it's<00:02:33.579> something<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.060> little<00:02:34.329> bit<00:02:34.510> more

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
this it's something a little bit more

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.009 
this it's something a little bit more
discreet<00:02:35.290> at<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.310> top<00:02:36.519> of<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:37.000> car<00:02:37.480> which<00:02:37.989> is

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
discreet at the top of the car which is

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.590 
discreet at the top of the car which is
that<00:02:38.230> site<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.829> also<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.730> added<00:02:39.940> benefit<00:02:40.450> is

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
that site and also the added benefit is

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.410 
that site and also the added benefit is
its<00:02:41.140> bluetooth<00:02:41.650> for<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.310> hands-free<00:02:42.910> cat<00:02:43.329> the

its bluetooth for the hands-free cat the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.990 
its bluetooth for the hands-free cat the
car<00:02:43.660> for<00:02:44.049> phone<00:02:44.230> calls<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.799> stuff<00:02:44.890> so<00:02:45.820> that's

just for the purpose of this video I've
done<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.300> real<00:02:57.510> crude<00:02:57.840> installation<00:02:58.770> red<00:02:59.610> wire

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
done a real crude installation red wire

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.530 
done a real crude installation red wire

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.190 
to red wire and black wire to black wire
obviously<00:03:03.810> going<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.650> reversal<00:03:05.250> um

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
obviously going to the reversal um
