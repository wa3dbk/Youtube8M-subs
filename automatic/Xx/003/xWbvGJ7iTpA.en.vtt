00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
digital output and aes/ebu so we don't

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.830

there<00:01:55.619> at<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> screen<00:01:57.590> eventually<00:01:58.590> we'll

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
there at the screen eventually we'll

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.050 
there at the screen eventually we'll
have<00:01:58.799> another<00:01:59.159> camera<00:01:59.399> over<00:01:59.729> there<00:01:59.820> in<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
have another camera over there in the

have another camera over there in the
corner<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:01.229> see<00:02:01.469> that's<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.920> camera<00:02:02.700> mount

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
corner and see that's the camera mount

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.609 
corner and see that's the camera mount
here<00:02:03.240> we'll<00:02:03.659> have<00:02:03.750> another<00:02:04.020> one<00:02:04.170> over<00:02:04.320> there

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
here we'll have another one over there

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.930 
here we'll have another one over there
and<00:02:05.630> we're<00:02:06.630> also<00:02:06.750> running<00:02:07.049> an<00:02:07.380> older<00:02:07.940> computer

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
and we're also running an older computer

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.760 
and we're also running an older computer
