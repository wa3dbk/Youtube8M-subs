little<00:02:31.989> bit<00:02:32.290> more<00:02:32.470> greasy<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.670> gets

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
little bit more greasy so that it gets

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.470 
little bit more greasy so that it gets
less<00:02:34.450> damaged<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:36.519> top<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.760> off<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.269> just
