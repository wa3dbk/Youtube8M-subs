00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.020
 now we will prepare the mozzarella is one 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.740
 quite complicated recipe but with a 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.780
 bit of attention 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.030
 we will succeed in having an excellent result 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:39.360
 the ingredients are 4 liters of milk 60 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.510
 g of water 8 grams of citric acid per 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.610
 food use and 2 grams of rennet that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.610
 it can be animal or vegetable 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.850
 I tell you right away that we will need one 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.769
 but the thermometer is enough 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.390
 home thermometer that though 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.989
 measure the temperature if you have 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.989
 the flu 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.329
 first we get a pot 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.330
 which can comfortably hold four 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:13.270
 liters of milk and we start pouring 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.270
 citric acid and 60 g of water 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:22.430
 we mix to dissolve the acid 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:25.960
 citric in the water and then we can 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.960
 add the four liters of milk 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.020
 wait until he sees her reach 33 degrees 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.020
 of temperature 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.530
 when the milk temperature is 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.900
 between 33 and 35 degrees you can 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.090
 remove the milk from the heat and add 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.060
 animal rennet or microbial rennet 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.330
 depending on your preferences 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.760
 in this case the animal rennet goes 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.390
 dosed with a pipette because they are enough 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.390
 two grams 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.150
 mix from top to bottom for 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.150
 about 30 seconds 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.250
 before covering the milk, stop the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.380
 movement that has been created 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:58.510
 cover everything and let it rest 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:03:00.430
 for 5 minutes in the past five minutes 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.250
 you can check if one is formed 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.940
 species of crust on the surface of the 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.430
 milk touching it you will see that not 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.120
 it breaks with a spatula enough 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.240
 long to touch the bottom of the pot 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.160
 get radial cuts to one 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.890
 distance of a couple of centimeters 1 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.920
 from above both horizontally and 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.920
 vertical 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.140
 at this point we put the pot back on 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.170
 fire and wait for it to reach 40 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.170
 degrees 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.040
 once your milk has 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.750
 reached 40 degrees 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.849
 you must remove it from the fire and collect 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.709
 all the part you cut with a 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.890
 then a dense mesh colander 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.669
 to put the part that will then become 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.959
 mozzarella inside a colander 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.250
 contained turn in a salad bowl 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.250
 quite large 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:40.890
 try to eliminate possible thought 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:42.960
 to make it soft and stringy after that 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.820
 when you have drained all the proud 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.190
 we will have to pass it once or twice a 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.910
 microwaves depending on which you prefer 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.250
 use it to eat it fresh or like 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.530
 finances for pizza to get a 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.320
 excellent string for pizza tip 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.750
 to make you squeeze it as much as possible and 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.670
 to remove most of the serum in 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.000
 so that it does not pile up on its own 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.000
 life 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.090
 now try to work with your hands 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.090
 mozzarella 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.300
 trying to get more serum out 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.640
 very possible 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.920
 gentle 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.370
 you will see that it will shrink a lot if 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.650
 you want a mozzarella that is very 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.870
 soft inside only pass it 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.060
 half the time in the microwave again 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.340
 of the time or for 30 seconds to 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.930
 maximum speed 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.340
 in the meantime while the mozzarella is 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.580
 ready for the second pass to 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.200
 microwave prepare a salad bowl with 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.570
 very cold water and ice 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.880
 in fact when the mozzarella is ready 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.280
 it will be necessary to give her the last shock 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.640
 thermal so as to make it beautiful 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.640
 compact 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.360
 when the thermal shock will be over 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:57.830
 your mozzarella will be beautiful compact 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:57.830
 outside and soft inside, that's it
