built-in flash and I'll camera light

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.229 
built-in flash and I'll camera light
let's<00:04:06.930> just<00:04:07.019> figure<00:04:07.349> down<00:04:07.620> there<00:04:11.239> that's

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
let's just figure down there that's

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.449 
let's just figure down there that's
where<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.599> battery<00:04:12.900> goes<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:15.209> strap<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:16.459> down

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
where the battery goes and strap I down
