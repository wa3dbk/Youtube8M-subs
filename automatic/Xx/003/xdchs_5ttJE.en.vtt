00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.520
 back shit you read a with or without eri tico 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.110
 that is to say that it has a single stage of 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.630
 Rash and a single chemical composition 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.849
 of chewing gum with the eight 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.910
 winds that we made with stratigraphy 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.770
 they show that the eruption was 300 years 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.670
 after what was thought then 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.449
 we have a coexistence of at least 250 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.890
 more years of public cv with teotihuacan 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.350
 now the population that publishes 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.600
 Obviously I observed the phenomena 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 volcanic within a mentality 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.290
 religious the lava spills of the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.010
 chewing gum eruptions were gradual 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.780
 followed the courses of the streams and 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.969
 the rivers that come down from the mountains 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.210
 we can observe in several cuts 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.850
 stratigraphic embedded rocks 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.460
 that were part of the body of the pyre 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.470
 the vision that was had of the public was 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.840
 that was a population approximately of 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.390
 22,000 inhabitants but this is only 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.310
 based on the volume of the pyramid and 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.930
 of some remains of the structures of 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.820
 cv public sees but you have to have 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.909
 present that violated is a site that does not 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.380
 we see it is covered by lava what 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.260
 we know it was a place that was 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.110
 on the most elongated furrowed by 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.900
 streams with strong flow there were waterfalls 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.479
 they were dragging large boulders 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.110
 volume and that the people of public 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.380
 they came back to channel and do very 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.659
 probably also chinampas was 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.450
 the best environments of the south of 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.490
 the basin of mexico 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.110
 what happened to the population to comply with 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.450
 the conflict population has a 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.159
 cultural tradition of the West and there's 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.110
 many materials that are shared with 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.860
 teotihuacan the south of the basin of 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.630
 mexico in the Preclassic is divided 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.759
 in two the north is a tradition 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.490
 cultural and the south is another possibly 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.490
 they even had antagonistic relationships by 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.340
 example here as a whole only 5% 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.380
 of the obsidian recovered is green that 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.360
 It was the one that drove Teotihuacán 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.239
 he administered teotihuacán and also the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.849
 ceramic shapes the figurines the 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.010
 constructive system talks about another 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:24.329
 cultural tradition and now teotihuacán 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.840
 for 275 after Christ is already a 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:30.049
 established urban city established and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.220
 powerful in the people of your audience 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.690
 possibly they returned to be the region 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.690
 from toluca or from the west
