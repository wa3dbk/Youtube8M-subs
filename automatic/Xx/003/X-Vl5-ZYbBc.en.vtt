00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.950
 let's talk a little about the ball 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.620
 the end had been treated that we hope will be fondly caressed 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.950
 and because of his fault the great pop star in the previous one have treated him very well 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.680
 that we were not going to all the archers are 38 appears by the paint speed and 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.599
 Sometimes impregnable injuries 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.319
 after taking the ball once the one hit by the players already fly 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:28.619
 and is the man has 11 40 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.020
 that have to do with the 11 stars that inhabit South Africa with the 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.350
 wives in official languages ​​of the country with the eleven players in each team 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.870
 and that is how much you need the jabulani ball 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.480
 it seems that it is a tribute to the number 11 the word jabulani ball that 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.540
 means to celebrate in the language and its fruits 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.110
 is the eleventh version of the ball that is made specifically for 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.080
 the fifa world cup 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.610
 the ponce colors of the 'jabulani' are a symbolic reflection of the conservatives 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.260
 of cavic and point of the 11 official languages ​​of South Africa and the jons 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.580
 of South Africans who will welcome the world in the first cup 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.940
 World Cup that takes place in Africa 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.560
 the design embodies two of the most important facets of the organizing country 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.040
 diversity and harmony principles that make South Africa such a relationship 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.430
 Colorful and hospitable is the perfect host for a 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.430
 event of so much relief 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.080
 Jabulani presents some important advances in the technology of 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.460
 football by passing your hands over the ball the first impression is your 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.000
 extraordinary texture 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.560
 a maximum control a stable flight and a perfect grip in any condition 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.390
 However, the main characters have generated a great 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.820
 controversial because they say the ball 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.290
 it is excessively light then a world 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.290
 com maybe with 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.100
 Germany also criticized the ball with success and Korea-Japan 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.560
 this was announced by the good vice minister 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.850
 while they exist 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.320
 more goals this are valid two changes that are introduced data has 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.030
 given that I think that in any case the technological change is adequate but that the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.599
 players will have to be 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.599
 how they are accommodated put a stop two or three options 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.380
 and that when they die they have some voice of opinion so that there is no discontent 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.069
 what is there but 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.890
 at the end of accounts when playing 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.600
 the ball was armed despite this and even more than three weeks training with the 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.270
 Senate approval for the World Cup 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.359
 while it has met square 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.109
 Marists in some clear occasions but still generates the sale
