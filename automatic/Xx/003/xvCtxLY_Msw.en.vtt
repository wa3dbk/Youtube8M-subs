00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.789 
and on which I'm really really excited
about<00:02:17.629> and<00:02:17.989> I<00:02:18.829> think<00:02:19.340> it's<00:02:19.459> all<00:02:19.700> about

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
about and I think it's all about

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.199 
about and I think it's all about
bringing<00:02:21.799> something<00:02:22.190> new<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.700> fresh<00:02:22.910> not

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
bringing something new and fresh not

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.059 
bringing something new and fresh not
just<00:02:23.420> in<00:02:23.569> music<00:02:24.019> but<00:02:24.049> in<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.380> approach<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.709> I

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
just in music but in the approach that I

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.319 
just in music but in the approach that I
think<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.370> way<00:02:25.489> that<00:02:25.519> people<00:02:25.670> think<00:02:26.180> about

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
think the way that people think about

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.830 
think the way that people think about
music<00:02:26.900> artists<00:02:27.709> think<00:02:28.430> about<00:02:28.639> music<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.750> way

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
music artists think about music the way

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.440 
music artists think about music the way
executives<00:02:30.620> think<00:02:30.799> about<00:02:30.980> music<00:02:31.370> I've<00:02:32.120> always

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
executives think about music I've always

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.319 
executives think about music I've always
aimed<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:33.200> try<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.519> kind<00:02:34.519> of<00:02:34.669> break<00:02:34.849> boundaries

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
aimed to try to kind of break boundaries

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:36.849 
aimed to try to kind of break boundaries
in<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.660> sense<00:02:35.900> which<00:02:36.109> is<00:02:36.230> why<00:02:36.349> when<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.560> listen

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
in a sense which is why when you listen

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.289 
in a sense which is why when you listen
to<00:02:36.919> the<00:02:36.980> albums<00:02:37.370> they<00:02:37.489> don't<00:02:37.730> kind<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.090> sound
