continuation<00:00:10.280> of<00:00:10.870> the<00:00:11.870> blood-brain<00:00:12.320> barrier

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
continuation of the blood-brain barrier

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.029 
continuation of the blood-brain barrier
problem<00:00:13.430> and<00:00:13.670> this<00:00:13.879> is<00:00:14.090> called<00:00:15.039> blood-brain

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
problem and this is called blood-brain

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.529 
problem and this is called blood-brain
barrier

repaired<00:00:17.539> part<00:00:17.990> one<00:00:18.320> now<00:00:19.600> last<00:00:20.600> time<00:00:20.750> we

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:20.870 
repaired part one now last time we

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.160 
repaired part one now last time we
discussed<00:00:21.110> a<00:00:21.470> little<00:00:21.710> bit<00:00:21.830> about<00:00:22.100> if<00:00:22.580> you<00:00:23.170> if

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
discussed a little bit about if you if

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.870 
discussed a little bit about if you if
you<00:00:24.410> have<00:00:24.530> leaky<00:00:24.830> gut<00:00:25.010> syndrome<00:00:25.040> you<00:00:25.580> probably

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
you have leaky gut syndrome you probably

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.250 
you have leaky gut syndrome you probably
also<00:00:26.060> have<00:00:26.590> leaky<00:00:27.590> blood<00:00:28.490> brain<00:00:28.730> barrier<00:00:28.789> a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
also have leaky blood brain barrier a

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.920 
also have leaky blood brain barrier a
problem<00:00:30.260> and<00:00:30.800> if<00:00:31.730> that's<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:32.180> case<00:00:32.360> you<00:00:32.689> will

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
problem and if that's the case you will

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.709 
problem and if that's the case you will
have<00:00:33.200> rain<00:00:33.410> degeneration<00:00:33.949> and<00:00:34.699> this<00:00:35.300> is<00:00:35.510> not<00:00:35.690> a

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
have rain degeneration and this is not a

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.420 
have rain degeneration and this is not a
self<00:00:36.020> correcting<00:00:36.350> problem<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.040> it's<00:00:37.220> very

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
self correcting problem so it's very

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.610 
self correcting problem so it's very
crucial<00:00:37.970> that<00:00:38.150> you<00:00:38.329> learn<00:00:38.570> about<00:00:38.600> this<00:00:39.079> and

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
crucial that you learn about this and

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.240 
crucial that you learn about this and
begin<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:40.190> correct<00:00:40.400> it<00:00:40.640> now<00:00:41.770> a<00:00:42.770> couple<00:00:43.190> of

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
begin to correct it now a couple of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.870 
begin to correct it now a couple of
things<00:00:43.840> first<00:00:44.840> is<00:00:45.560> that<00:00:45.920> if<00:00:46.100> you<00:00:46.310> look<00:00:46.640> into

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
things first is that if you look into

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.270 
things first is that if you look into
medicine<00:00:47.480> for<00:00:47.780> for<00:00:48.440> a<00:00:48.470> cure<00:00:48.739> for<00:00:48.920> this<00:00:49.040> you're

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
medicine for for a cure for this you're

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.740 
medicine for for a cure for this you're
going<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:49.520> find<00:00:49.730> nothing<00:00:49.910> there's<00:00:50.300> absolutely

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
going to find nothing there's absolutely

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.479 
going to find nothing there's absolutely
nothing<00:00:50.899> in<00:00:51.140> PDR<00:00:51.559> that's<00:00:52.130> going<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.430> be

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
nothing in PDR that's going to be

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.220 
nothing in PDR that's going to be
helpful<00:00:52.700> for<00:00:52.850> you<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:53.390> repair<00:00:53.750> blood-brain

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
in a repair your brain is a steady

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.120 
in a repair your brain is a steady
glucose<00:01:29.299> supply<00:01:29.509> now<00:01:30.229> your<00:01:30.709> if<00:01:30.799> your<00:01:30.920> blood

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
glucose supply now your if your blood

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.399 
glucose supply now your if your blood
sugar<00:01:31.179> cycles<00:01:32.179> up<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:32.509> down<00:01:32.630> too<00:01:32.840> much<00:01:32.990> you're

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
sugar cycles up and down too much you're

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.870 
sugar cycles up and down too much you're
going<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.649> have<00:01:33.709> problems<00:01:34.219> and<00:01:34.399> of<00:01:34.520> course<00:01:34.729> if

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
going to have problems and of course if

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.849 
going to have problems and of course if
it's<00:01:35.029> high<00:01:35.389> you're<00:01:35.959> gonna<00:01:36.079> develop<00:01:36.349> insulin

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
it's high you're gonna develop insulin

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.699 
it's high you're gonna develop insulin
does<00:01:37.310> insulin<00:01:38.119> resistance<00:01:38.689> and<00:01:39.229> if<00:01:39.380> it's<00:01:39.560> too

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:39.709 
does insulin resistance and if it's too

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:40.389 
does insulin resistance and if it's too
low<00:01:39.889> you're<00:01:40.039> going<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.219> have<00:01:40.310> these

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
low you're going to have these

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.249 
low you're going to have these
hypoglycemic<00:01:41.179> effects<00:01:41.539> which<00:01:41.779> means<00:01:42.049> that

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
hypoglycemic effects which means that

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.379 
hypoglycemic effects which means that
you<00:01:42.380> don't<00:01:42.590> have<00:01:42.799> enough<00:01:43.099> fuel<00:01:43.459> to<00:01:44.060> run<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:44.389 
you don't have enough fuel to run the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:49.659 
you don't have enough fuel to run the
processes<00:01:45.099> so<00:01:46.179> because<00:01:47.179> of<00:01:47.329> this<00:01:48.549> you<00:01:49.549> know

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:49.669 
processes so because of this you know

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:51.639 
processes so because of this you know
dietary<00:01:50.270> changes<00:01:50.599> might<00:01:50.840> be<00:01:50.869> important<00:01:51.469> and

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
dietary changes might be important and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.949 
dietary changes might be important and

that blood pressure up 120 over 80

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.610 
that blood pressure up 120 over 80
because<00:03:00.819> that<00:03:01.030> over<00:03:01.239> 60<00:03:01.660> is<00:03:01.780> not<00:03:02.019> it's<00:03:02.500> not
