members of Congress who disagree with me

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.699 
members of Congress who disagree with me
right<00:02:48.239> when<00:02:48.450> they<00:02:48.600> say<00:02:48.810> we<00:02:49.380> should<00:02:49.590> have

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
right when they say we should have

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.470 
right when they say we should have
decertified<00:02:50.400> Mexico<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.030> then<00:02:51.120> given<00:02:51.420> a

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
decertified Mexico and then given a

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.819 
decertified Mexico and then given a
national<00:02:51.870> interest<00:02:52.140> waiver<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.590> we<00:02:52.680> could

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
national interest waiver so we could

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.349 
national interest waiver so we could
continue<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.280> cooperate<00:02:53.459> economically<00:02:53.850> and

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
continue to cooperate economically and

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.509 
continue to cooperate economically and
in<00:02:54.480> other<00:02:54.600> ways<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.989> strongly<00:02:55.829> believe<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.370> was

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
in other ways I strongly believe I was

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.000 
in other ways I strongly believe I was
right<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.150> we<00:02:58.079> don't<00:02:58.260> have<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.769> know<00:02:58.859> if<00:02:58.920> you

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
right but we don't have you know if you

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.349 
right but we don't have you know if you
want<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.220> go<00:02:59.280> into<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.519> we<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.940> later<00:03:00.150> but

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
want to go into that we can later but

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.199 
want to go into that we can later but
the<00:03:00.900> issue<00:03:01.079> is<00:03:01.730> we<00:03:02.730> live<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.120> an

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
the issue is we live in an

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.699 
the issue is we live in an
interdependent<00:03:03.569> world<00:03:03.930> we<00:03:04.380> have<00:03:04.530> to

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
interdependent world we have to

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.170 
interdependent world we have to
cooperate<00:03:04.890> with<00:03:05.340> people<00:03:05.609> we're<00:03:05.760> better<00:03:05.970> off

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
cooperate with people we're better off

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.539 
cooperate with people we're better off
when<00:03:06.329> we<00:03:06.359> do<00:03:06.630> we're<00:03:07.410> better<00:03:07.620> off<00:03:07.829> with<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.310> with

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
when we do we're better off with it with

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.280 
when we do we're better off with it with
NATO<00:03:08.880> we're<00:03:09.239> better<00:03:09.419> off<00:03:09.630> with<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.930> United

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
NATO we're better off with the United

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.509 
NATO we're better off with the United
Nations<00:03:10.320> we're<00:03:10.769> better<00:03:10.979> off<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.400> these

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
Nations we're better off in these

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.770 
Nations we're better off in these
countries<00:03:11.699> can<00:03:12.030> work<00:03:12.209> together

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
countries can work together

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.420 
countries can work together
so<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:13.080> just<00:03:13.650> think<00:03:13.830> for<00:03:13.890> folks<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.280> are

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
so I just think for folks that are

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.620 
so I just think for folks that are
worried<00:03:14.610> about<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:14.970> out<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.330> country

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
worried about this out in the country

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.140 
worried about this out in the country
they<00:03:15.750> need<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.990> be<00:03:16.110> thinking<00:03:16.260> about<00:03:16.500> how<00:03:17.370> we're

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
they need to be thinking about how we're

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.370 
they need to be thinking about how we're
not<00:03:18.180> going<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.480> give<00:03:18.600> up<00:03:18.630> our<00:03:18.900> freedom<00:03:19.290> our

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
not going to give up our freedom our

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.110 
not going to give up our freedom our
independence<00:03:20.010> but<00:03:20.520> we're<00:03:20.670> not<00:03:20.790> going<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.000> go

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
independence but we're not going to go

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.880 
independence but we're not going to go
it<00:03:21.270> alone<00:03:21.510> into<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.900> 21st<00:03:22.319> century<00:03:22.410> either

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
it alone into the 21st century either

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.320 
it alone into the 21st century either
we're<00:03:23.010> going<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.220> work<00:03:23.370> together<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:24.000> we<00:03:24.150> have
