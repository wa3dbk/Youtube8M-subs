they are made of aluminum I have a
couple<00:00:35.930> of<00:00:36.020> projects<00:00:36.440> here<00:00:36.710> we<00:00:36.890> have<00:00:37.070> the

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
couple of projects here we have the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.660 
couple of projects here we have the
Gothic<00:00:37.940> Rose<00:00:38.180> ring<00:00:38.649> which<00:00:39.649> is<00:00:39.680> a<00:00:39.949> very<00:00:40.309> simple

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
Gothic Rose ring which is a very simple

Gothic Rose ring which is a very simple
way<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:40.850> utilize<00:00:41.269> these<00:00:41.690> guys<00:00:41.960> as<00:00:42.260> is<00:00:42.680> the

way to utilize these guys as is the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.849 
way to utilize these guys as is the
Frieda<00:00:43.699> hairpin<00:00:44.210> now<00:00:44.960> these<00:00:45.350> are<00:00:45.620> great

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:45.859 
Frieda hairpin now these are great

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.490 
Frieda hairpin now these are great
because<00:00:46.039> you<00:00:46.609> can't<00:00:47.120> see<00:00:47.449> the<00:00:47.629> hole<00:00:47.840> in<00:00:48.140> the

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
because you can't see the hole in the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.069 
because you can't see the hole in the
middle<00:00:48.649> there<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.219> they've<00:00:50.090> just<00:00:50.120> been<00:00:50.390> glued

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
middle there and they've just been glued

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.759 
middle there and they've just been glued
on<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:52.160> hairpin<00:00:52.550> I<00:00:53.140> do<00:00:54.140> want<00:00:54.469> to<00:00:54.500> show<00:00:54.710> you

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
these a couple of times before they

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.789

break off but I do want to warn you to

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.100 
break off but I do want to warn you to
be<00:01:39.829> careful<00:01:40.390> just<00:01:41.390> because<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:41.869> don't<00:01:41.990> want

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
be careful just because you don't want

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.679 
be careful just because you don't want
to<00:01:42.469> sort<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:42.890> bend<00:01:43.520> it<00:01:43.640> back<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.090> forth<00:01:44.360> and

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
to sort of bend it back and forth and

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.899 
to sort of bend it back and forth and
then<00:01:44.869> because<00:01:45.409> eventually<00:01:45.649> it<00:01:45.950> will<00:01:46.100> Bend<00:01:46.610> off

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
then because eventually it will Bend off

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.120 
then because eventually it will Bend off
so<00:01:47.780> just<00:01:47.810> be<00:01:48.110> very<00:01:48.320> careful<00:01:48.680> with<00:01:48.770> these<00:01:48.890> guys
