00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
wind is a little more difficult in the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.959 
wind is a little more difficult in the
center<00:00:40.050> court<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.590> out<00:00:40.920> psycho<00:00:41.219> outside

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
center court and in out psycho outside

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.540 
center court and in out psycho outside
course<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.469> my<00:00:43.559> opinion<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.980> center

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
course and in my opinion the center

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.630 
course and in my opinion the center
court<00:00:44.760> it'll<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.180> faster<00:00:45.539> than<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> ones<00:00:46.110> but

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
things was working very good and I think

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.990 
things was working very good and I think
every<00:04:25.180> every<00:04:25.660> day<00:04:25.810> I<00:04:26.110> played<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.949> better<00:04:27.160> the

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
every every day I played the better the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.510 
every every day I played the better the
conditions<00:04:28.539> some<00:04:28.780> days<00:04:28.990> are<00:04:29.139> not<00:04:29.320> easy<00:04:30.099> like

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
conditions some days are not easy like

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.730 
conditions some days are not easy like
today<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.630> problem<00:04:31.780> is<00:04:32.050> not<00:04:32.349> easy<00:04:32.620> to

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
today and the problem is not easy to

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.570 
today and the problem is not easy to
because<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.940> rhythm<00:04:34.800> against<00:04:35.800> fairies<00:04:36.130> is

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
because the rhythm against fairies is

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.689 
because the rhythm against fairies is
not<00:04:36.789> always<00:04:37.500> that<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.560> right<00:04:38.889> rhythm<00:04:39.130> to<00:04:39.490> play

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
not always that the right rhythm to play

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.640 
not always that the right rhythm to play
would<00:04:39.970> because<00:04:40.419> he<00:04:40.570> plays<00:04:40.750> Liza<00:04:41.110> go<00:04:41.440> to<00:04:41.500> the

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
would because he plays Liza go to the

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.749 
would because he plays Liza go to the
