00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
it was going to be you um less powerful

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.530 
it was going to be you um less powerful

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
than the ps3 they said it's going to be

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.190 
than the ps3 they said it's going to be
more<00:03:34.720> powerful<00:03:34.930> but<00:03:35.380> just<00:03:35.590> not<00:03:35.709> by<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.040> much

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
more powerful but just not by that much

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
favorite system just because the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.330 
favorite system just because the

what<00:04:51.320> anybody<00:04:51.530> says<00:04:51.880> all<00:04:52.880> three<00:04:53.270> systems

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
what anybody says all three systems

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.330 
what anybody says all three systems
power<00:04:54.080> wise<00:04:54.289> are<00:04:54.590> going<00:04:54.770> to<00:04:54.830> be<00:04:54.919> on<00:04:55.039> the<00:04:55.130> same

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
power wise are going to be on the same

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.000 
power wise are going to be on the same
level<00:04:55.370> so<00:04:55.990> we're<00:04:56.990> going<00:04:57.260> to<00:04:57.350> worry<00:04:57.530> less<00:04:57.949> about

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
level so we're going to worry less about

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.129 
level so we're going to worry less about
graphics<00:04:58.820> and<00:04:59.000> more<00:04:59.270> about<00:04:59.389> the<00:04:59.900> gameplay

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
graphics and more about the gameplay

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.189 
graphics and more about the gameplay
more<00:05:00.979> about<00:05:01.250> what<00:05:01.520> separates<00:05:02.060> those<00:05:02.300> games<00:05:02.690> on

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
more about what separates those games on

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.850 
more about what separates those games on
those<00:05:03.860> systems<00:05:04.250> from<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.700> other<00:05:04.820> systems<00:05:05.389> I

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
those systems from the other systems I

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.140 
those systems from the other systems I
mean<00:05:06.860> it's<00:05:06.979> going<00:05:07.130> to<00:05:07.220> be<00:05:07.340> more<00:05:07.580> like<00:05:07.639> last

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
mean it's going to be more like last
