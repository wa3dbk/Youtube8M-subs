00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.080
 signed soon subscribe 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.310
 Today I am showing the second video there too 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.779
 it has water heating only in 3 there is no it 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.510
 very comfortable that is, you can adjust 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.019
 water temperature have water she warmed up 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.369
 and warms the greenhouse of the same in the second greenhouse 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.140
 going later than the first 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.529
 accordingly, everything was gradually done 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.120
 many errors were taken into account such as 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.489
 made a very narrow passage was uncomfortable 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.399
 go to the second greenhouse it's done 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.090
 Immediately convenient Well, if you can be pleasantly 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.079
 to pass the banality with a bucket with a box 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.300
 we look further that is here here 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.059
 filing was looking at the return is done 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.730
 one loop at the end of this loop hour we 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.500
 you will see a crane 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.640
 air further application here 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.920
 I 'll show you right now 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.309
 while the system is empty you can see it 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.010
 there is nothing further look here is worth 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.250
 such an air vent for 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.400
 water outlet tap for air release 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.409
 cap for water release from the greenhouse and 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.260
 flooding need for what 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.159
 it's cold in the winter to stay we know when 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.830
 water freezes 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.369
 it expands and at the same time the pipes 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.470
 bursting that would not want of course 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:27.330
 so for the winter because the greenhouse is 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:30.439
 we release water but trouble has trouble 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.470
 happened we saw a crack in the pipe 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:37.290
 although there was a system without water on the turbo 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.909
 a third cracked as the welder told us 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.579
 which we have agreed that he will do 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.590
 we are not very good quality pipes 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.299
 how we acquired everything in one place in 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.610
 one time respectively decided 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.100
 check all the other pipes because 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.829
 I would not want to lie to you later 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.750
 when there will be a cucumber when there is welding 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.420
 so it was wearing at the time when if 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.810
 at night will remain in the greenhouse without heating 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.820
 very bad now would we look to you 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.250
 just turned on the pump that is to say 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.770
 water in the system is still not enough and that's it 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.190
 here are the lines 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.650
 rather than hurrying on when fully typed 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.780
 typed then you can already close 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.940
 faucet and gradually and to be typed already 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.150
 above the upper tube in the feed to 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.900
 System is fully typed 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.180
 accordingly now we are with you 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.180
 we'll see here a little time has passed 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.299
 15 minutes from the water is already actively flowing 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.330
 air we do not see from the boldly close 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.730
 this crane and go next parent 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.980
 see here we see ourselves 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.140
 the process when the air goes this one 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.620
 nasty air that we don't need but we 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.930
 interferes with if the air in the greenhouse is in 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.959
 heating will 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.950
 then the system will not work absolutely 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:54.760
 It will not work and will pipe cold 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:57.970
 we need a hot pipe to plant 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.829
 weren't cold everyone thanks for watching 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.349
