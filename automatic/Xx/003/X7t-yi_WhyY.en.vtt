00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.220 

first<00:00:34.469> we<00:00:34.920> nutrify<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.710> then<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:37.950> detoxify

ineffective detox program you burn fat

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.190 
ineffective detox program you burn fat
and<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.250> liberate<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.729> toxins<00:01:24.210> now<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and you liberate the toxins now the

toxins are in the blood they go through

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.410 
toxins are in the blood they go through
the<00:01:27.930> liver<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.369> livers<00:01:29.729> job<00:01:30.119> to

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the liver it's the livers job to

the liver it's the livers job to
detoxify<00:01:31.409> stuff<00:01:32.009> among<00:01:32.430> other<00:01:32.610> things<00:01:32.700> and

detoxify stuff among other things and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.660 
detoxify stuff among other things and
the<00:01:33.900> liver<00:01:34.110> has<00:01:34.350> two<00:01:34.650> phases<00:01:35.009> through<00:01:35.520> which

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the liver has two phases through which

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.440 
the liver has two phases through which
it<00:01:35.820> does<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.299> there<00:01:36.930> are<00:01:37.049> two<00:01:37.229> phases<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
it does that there are two phases of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.390 
it does that there are two phases of
biochemical<00:01:39.450> action<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.110> reaction<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:41.220> the

biochemical action and reaction that the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.120 
biochemical action and reaction that the
liver<00:01:41.610> uses<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.329> deconstruct<00:01:43.140> toxic

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
liver uses to deconstruct toxic

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.679 
liver uses to deconstruct toxic
molecules<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.060> make<00:01:45.840> them<00:01:45.899> safe<00:01:46.909> both<00:01:47.909> phases

of liver detoxification are nutrient
heavy<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:54.060> their<00:01:54.960> demands<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.780> burn

an under nutrify liver your liver will

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.839 
an under nutrify liver your liver will
not<00:02:06.329> be<00:02:06.600> able<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.069> activate<00:02:08.069> phase<00:02:08.399> one<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
phase two detoxification it can't do it

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.460 
phase two detoxification it can't do it
so<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.330> toxins<00:02:12.870> passed

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
so the toxins passed

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.560 
so the toxins passed
the<00:02:13.620> liver<00:02:13.830> unharmed<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.000> now<00:02:15.300> they're<00:02:15.540> in

the liver unharmed and now they're in

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.560 
the liver unharmed and now they're in
your<00:02:15.720> circulation<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.830> they<00:02:17.370> will<00:02:17.610> mess<00:02:17.910> you

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
your circulation and they will mess you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
up detoxifying without nutri firing is

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.140 
up detoxifying without nutri firing is
like<00:02:24.300> stirring<00:02:24.750> up<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.990> hornet's<00:02:25.020> nest<00:02:26.150> guy

stirring<00:02:53.550> up<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.910> hornet's<00:02:54.240> nest<00:02:54.390> and

providing your liver with the nutrients

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.670 
providing your liver with the nutrients
it<00:02:57.120> needs<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:57.600> its<00:02:57.780> job<00:02:58.050> didn't<00:02:58.380> know<00:02:58.470> that

they were directly related so you know

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.770 
my grandmother said you'll scrub the pot
so<00:04:19.320> hard<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:19.709> you'll<00:04:19.859> break<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.599> right<00:04:21.599> and
