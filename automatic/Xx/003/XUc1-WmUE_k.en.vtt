 welcome to my red kitchen 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.900
 I'm the sonja and today we go 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.299
 continue with my finger food and that 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.609
 I've thought about it, I 'm building up 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.630
 with fish and smoked 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.390
 trout and especially box 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.599
 and I had to go first 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.289
 puff pastry the paste and then will 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.790
 The whole thing felt and we need it 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.059

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.120
 spices I've worried estragon 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.600
 and dill and then I still need 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.410
 Puff pastry is available in the refrigerated shelf and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.739
 then I have prepared myself yet 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.289
 egg yolk and a spiced cucumber and then 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.350
 I still need mayonnaise on medium 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.260
 spicy mustard and of course salt and 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.979
 First, just pepper my pies 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.770

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.860

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.860

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.770

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.799
 with the yolk I have with one 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:28.450
 stirred tablespoon of water and then set 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:31.600

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.920

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.819

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:44.069
