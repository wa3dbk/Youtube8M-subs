00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.650
 And then, beauty guys, I'm going to make a 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.689
 video here that dream is not a thing 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.850
 I've got a long time that 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:30.929
 I should have shown you 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:33.270
 the first hand whistles me too 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.880
 I caught it a while ago now it does 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.950
 company with my death, that little dump 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.590
 that you will not be able to see 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.260
 But I'm the one who prints it. 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.620
 original gradient also national 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.000
 I opened everything and always put myself 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.719
 this capita 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.670
 she came without cover second game game 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.680
 boy color mario tennis also original 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.809
 also the gradient here is also 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.120
 national 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.610
 one thing I took a while ago is 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.450
 this here nobody can win 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.290
 I'm very much a fan of game boy advance. 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.299
 very much 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.860
 I know I could have gotten in sp 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:22.650
 internal and has a battery that 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.619
 model not to play but to wait 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.600
 What he really wants is because nowadays 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.659
 can not afford to play 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.180
 on this screen because I can not see anything 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.610
 I wonder in the old days how I 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.130
 I could see this screen 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.420
 He's new like that but he did not come 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:46.350

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:52.530

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:54.860

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:25.820
