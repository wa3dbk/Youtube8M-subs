and a half inches I have to take four
and<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.470> half<00:00:53.530> inches<00:00:53.980> away<00:00:54.130> from<00:00:54.580> my<00:00:55.120> studs

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and a half inches away from my studs

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.760 
and a half inches away from my studs
plus<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.890> inch<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:57.250> a<00:00:57.280> half<00:00:57.450> of<00:00:58.450> my<00:00:59.320> capping

boards<00:01:00.130> on<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.610> outside<00:01:01.060> of<00:01:01.150> my<00:01:01.270> my<00:01:01.630> deck<00:01:01.840> so

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
boards on the outside of my my deck so

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.829 
boards on the outside of my my deck so
that<00:01:02.650> comes<00:01:02.860> to<00:01:02.980> a<00:01:03.010> total<00:01:03.040> 7<00:01:03.700> 1/2<00:01:03.940> inches<00:01:04.330> our

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
that comes to a total 7 1/2 inches our

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.139 
that comes to a total 7 1/2 inches our
studs<00:01:05.259> are<00:01:05.409> gonna<00:01:05.560> be<00:01:05.710> 40<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:06.280> a<00:01:06.460> half<00:01:06.640> inches

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
studs are gonna be 40 and a half inches

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.719 
studs are gonna be 40 and a half inches
long<00:01:07.359> and<00:01:08.049> that<00:01:08.740> will<00:01:08.890> give<00:01:09.009> us<00:01:09.039> a<00:01:09.219> 4-foot<00:01:09.579> deck

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
long and that will give us a 4-foot deck

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.639 
long and that will give us a 4-foot deck
and<00:01:09.969> the<00:01:10.420> real<00:01:10.630> reason<00:01:10.990> for<00:01:11.020> this<00:01:11.229> is<00:01:11.469> so<00:01:11.619> that

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
and the real reason for this is so that

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.739 
and the real reason for this is so that
when<00:01:12.399> you<00:01:12.520> put<00:01:12.700> it<00:01:12.820> all<00:01:12.909> together<00:01:13.060> your

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:13.749 
when you put it all together your

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:16.319 
when you put it all together your
plywood<00:01:14.079> touches<00:01:14.740> your<00:01:14.890> coping<00:01:15.249> on<00:01:15.399> that<00:01:16.090> edge

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
plywood touches your coping on that edge

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.450 
plywood touches your coping on that edge
and<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:17.229> edge<00:01:17.259> of<00:01:17.409> your<00:01:17.679> deck<00:01:17.950> you<00:01:18.249> don't<00:01:18.369> have

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
and the edge of your deck you don't have

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.300 
and the edge of your deck you don't have
to<00:01:18.549> go<00:01:18.640> buy<00:01:18.819> more<00:01:18.999> plywood<00:01:20.039> next<00:01:21.039> thing<00:01:21.159> we're

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
to go buy more plywood next thing we're

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.709 
to go buy more plywood next thing we're
gonna<00:01:21.399> do<00:01:21.549> is<00:01:21.579> get<00:01:21.819> a<00:01:21.850> deck<00:01:22.119> built<00:01:22.359> for<00:01:22.659> the

every 12 inches on Center on foot we've

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.770 
every 12 inches on Center on foot we've
got<00:01:29.319> to<00:01:29.409> cut<00:01:29.649> to<00:01:30.189> eight<00:01:30.399> to<00:01:30.880> true<00:01:31.149> eighths<00:01:31.359> mark

there is a trick to cutting studs in

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.899 
there is a trick to cutting studs in
half<00:01:53.140> especially<00:01:53.979> when<00:01:54.429> you're<00:01:54.579> laid<00:01:54.729> down

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
half especially when you're laid down

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.330 
half especially when you're laid down
flat<00:01:55.210> like<00:01:55.240> this<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:56.170> do<00:01:56.409> not<00:01:56.530> stand<00:01:56.950> on<00:01:57.189> the

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
flat like this you do not stand on the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.190 
flat like this you do not stand on the
studs<00:01:57.610> while<00:01:57.850> you're<00:01:58.030> cutting<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:58.960> walk

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
studs while you're cutting you walk

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.969 
studs while you're cutting you walk
behind<00:01:59.649> it

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
behind it

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.160 
behind it
you<00:02:00.310> saw<00:02:00.549> how<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:00.729> one<00:02:01.030> jumped<00:02:01.390> out<00:02:01.539> and<00:02:01.750> that

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
you saw how that one jumped out and that
