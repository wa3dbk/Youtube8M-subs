00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
ammo boost allows you to actually carry

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.230 
ammo boost allows you to actually carry
more<00:01:34.650> magazine<00:01:35.159> more<00:01:35.490> spare<00:01:35.790> mags<00:01:36.030> and

everything for your weapons level 3

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.490 
everything for your weapons level 3
you'll<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> grenade<00:01:39.689> boost<00:01:39.960> allowing<00:01:40.409> you

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
you'll have a grenade boost allowing you

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.920 
you'll have a grenade boost allowing you
to<00:01:40.680> carry<00:01:40.890> an<00:01:41.040> extra<00:01:41.189> grenade<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.000> level<00:01:42.630> for

to carry an extra grenade and level for

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.440 
to carry an extra grenade and level for
suppression<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.790> let<00:01:44.790> suppression

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
suppression is let suppression

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.969 
suppression is let suppression
resistance<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.200> are<00:01:46.320> less<00:01:46.470> affected<00:01:46.950> by

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
resistance you are less affected by

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.819 
resistance you are less affected by
suppression<00:01:47.729> now<00:01:48.329> that's<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.780> offensive<00:01:49.619> one

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
suppression now that's the offensive one

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.149 
suppression now that's the offensive one
if<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.640> go<00:01:50.820> defensive<00:01:51.740> level<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.040> have

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
if you go defensive level one you have

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.039 
if you go defensive level one you have
suppression<00:01:53.700> resistance<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.390> basically<00:01:54.869> you

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
suppression resistance so basically you

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.469 
suppression resistance so basically you
have<00:01:55.259> at<00:01:55.710> level<00:01:56.100> 1<00:01:56.310> while<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> level<00:01:57.240> 4

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
have at level 1 while you have a level 4

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.080 
have at level 1 while you have a level 4
on<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> other<00:01:57.840> one<00:01:58.369> grenade<00:01:59.369> boost<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.820> level

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
on the other one grenade boost the level

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.780 
on the other one grenade boost the level
2<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.990> have<00:02:01.259> explosive<00:02:02.070> resistance<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.759> can

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
2 you have explosive resistance you can

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.789 
2 you have explosive resistance you can
carry<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.240> flak<00:02:03.630> vest<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.259> makes<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.619> less

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
carry a flak vest that makes you less

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.270 
carry a flak vest that makes you less
and<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:06.360> takes<00:02:06.570> less<00:02:06.869> damage<00:02:07.409> from<00:02:07.649> explosions

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
and it takes less damage from explosions

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.279 
and it takes less damage from explosions
and<00:02:08.489> level<00:02:08.940> 4<00:02:09.239> you'd<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> heel<00:02:10.050> boost

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
and level 4 you'd have a heel boost

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.990 
and level 4 you'd have a heel boost
makes<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:11.069> time<00:02:11.250> between<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.640> take<00:02:11.819> damage

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
makes the time between you take damage

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.080 
makes the time between you take damage
and<00:02:12.390> he'll<00:02:12.599> return

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
and he'll return

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.850 
and he'll return
patient<00:02:13.360> faster<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:13.989> you<00:02:14.019> can<00:02:14.200> actually<00:02:14.349> heal

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
patient faster so you can actually heal

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.250 
patient faster so you can actually heal
a<00:02:15.069> lot<00:02:15.730> faster<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:16.599> is<00:02:16.750> kind<00:02:17.019> of<00:02:17.110> what

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
a lot faster so this is kind of what

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.710 
a lot faster so this is kind of what
they're<00:02:17.440> doing<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.849> suppression<00:02:19.209> levels

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
they're doing to the suppression levels

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.960 
they're doing to the suppression levels
you<00:02:20.080> can<00:02:20.260> actually<00:02:20.410> choose<00:02:20.920> how<00:02:21.280> things<00:02:21.640> go

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
you can actually choose how things go

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.390 
you can actually choose how things go
and<00:02:22.269> what<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.319> need<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.650> unlock<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.250> how<00:02:24.340> you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
and what you need to unlock and how you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.339 
and what you need to unlock and how you
need<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.640> upgrade<00:02:25.030> your<00:02:25.480> stuff<00:02:25.720> in<00:02:25.870> which<00:02:26.110> one

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
need to upgrade your stuff in which one

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.290 
need to upgrade your stuff in which one
you<00:02:26.500> go<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:26.680> do<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.099> go<00:02:27.250> for<00:02:27.430> offensive<00:02:28.060> or<00:02:28.209> do

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
you go for do you go for offensive or do

you go for do you go for offensive or do
you<00:02:28.390> go<00:02:28.540> for<00:02:28.690> defenses<00:02:29.290> that's<00:02:29.470> something

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
you go for defenses that's something

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.009 
you go for defenses that's something
that<00:02:29.890> is<00:02:30.220> going<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.150> make<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.360> difference<00:02:31.720> on

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
that is going to make the difference on

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.900 
that is going to make the difference on
the<00:02:32.260> battlefield<00:02:32.709> now<00:02:33.190> there<00:02:33.459> is<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.610> couple

the battlefield now there is a couple
more<00:02:34.180> guns<00:02:34.510> on<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.810> map<00:02:34.959> that<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.170> can<00:02:35.349> find

the<00:04:43.060> bad<00:04:43.210> minute<00:04:43.630> or<00:04:43.720> so<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:44.110> wouldn't<00:04:44.349> really

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
the bad minute or so you wouldn't really

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.279 
the bad minute or so you wouldn't really
get<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:45.099> whatever<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.610> go<00:04:45.849> in<00:04:46.030> just<00:04:46.960> because

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
get to whatever you go in just because

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.950 
get to whatever you go in just because
of<00:04:47.440> that<00:04:47.470> so<00:04:48.009> yeah<00:04:48.400> that's<00:04:48.610> a<00:04:49.030> feature<00:04:49.630> that<00:04:49.780> I

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
of that so yeah that's a feature that I

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.050 
of that so yeah that's a feature that I
hope<00:04:50.229> it's<00:04:50.500> not<00:04:50.740> actually<00:04:51.190> gonna<00:04:51.280> happen<00:04:51.759> in

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
hope it's not actually gonna happen in

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.610 
hope it's not actually gonna happen in
battlefield<00:04:52.569> 4<00:04:52.599> I<00:04:52.810> just<00:04:53.199> hope<00:04:53.319> it<00:04:53.470> was<00:04:53.590> a

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
battlefield 4 I just hope it was a

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.680 
battlefield 4 I just hope it was a
little<00:04:53.770> bug<00:04:54.069> in<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:54.340> Alpha<00:04:54.699> and<00:04:55.270> they<00:04:55.449> haven't

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
little bug in the Alpha and they haven't

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.010 
little bug in the Alpha and they haven't
really<00:04:55.960> tweaked<00:04:56.259> it<00:04:56.470> now<00:04:57.340> this<00:04:57.580> is<00:04:57.729> a<00:04:57.990> only<00:04:58.990> a

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
really tweaked it now this is a only a

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.230 
really tweaked it now this is a only a
couple<00:04:59.199> of<00:04:59.349> months<00:04:59.470> before<00:04:59.800> a<00:05:00.039> battlefield<00:05:00.580> 4

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
couple of months before a battlefield 4

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.820 
couple of months before a battlefield 4
beta<00:05:01.479> is<00:05:01.720> gonna<00:05:01.900> be<00:05:02.050> out<00:05:02.169> usually<00:05:02.440> it's<00:05:02.770> around

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
beta is gonna be out usually it's around

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.649 
beta is gonna be out usually it's around
September<00:05:03.550> because<00:05:03.849> they<00:05:03.970> require<00:05:04.150> about

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
September because they require about

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.230 
September because they require about
another<00:05:04.900> three<00:05:05.199> or<00:05:05.229> four<00:05:05.530> weeks<00:05:05.710> to<00:05:05.979> be

another three or four weeks to be
ironing<00:05:07.240> out<00:05:07.389> some<00:05:07.449> bugs<00:05:07.870> that<00:05:07.990> no<00:05:08.409> doubt

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
ironing out some bugs that no doubt

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.080 
ironing out some bugs that no doubt
we're<00:05:08.830> gonna<00:05:08.889> find<00:05:09.190> in<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.490> beta<00:05:09.699> now<00:05:10.060> a

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
we're gonna find in the beta now a

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.879 
we're gonna find in the beta now a
couple<00:05:10.479> more<00:05:10.599> things<00:05:10.659> i<00:05:11.050> have<00:05:11.169> tested<00:05:11.440> out<00:05:11.740> and

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
couple more things i have tested out and

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.080 
couple more things i have tested out and
i<00:05:11.919> don't<00:05:12.099> want<00:05:12.220> to<00:05:12.280> forget<00:05:12.400> is<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:12.909> actual

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
i don't want to forget is the actual

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.180 
i don't want to forget is the actual
defibrillators<00:05:13.840> you<00:05:14.319> need<00:05:14.530> to<00:05:14.650> rub<00:05:15.039> the

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
defibrillators you need to rub the

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.649 
defibrillators you need to rub the
defibrillators<00:05:15.849> a<00:05:15.880> little<00:05:16.210> bit<00:05:16.330> together

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
defibrillators a little bit together

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.480 
defibrillators a little bit together
before<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:17.050> can<00:05:17.199> actually<00:05:17.380> use<00:05:17.560> them<00:05:17.979> i<00:05:18.130> have

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
before you can actually use them i have

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.309 
before you can actually use them i have
zapped<00:05:18.909> a<00:05:19.090> couple<00:05:19.330> of<00:05:19.419> wookies<00:05:19.569> with<00:05:19.960> him<00:05:20.050> and

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
zapped a couple of wookies with him and

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.589 
zapped a couple of wookies with him and
it<00:05:20.440> does<00:05:20.620> work<00:05:20.889> so<00:05:21.250> you<00:05:21.849> can<00:05:22.060> actually<00:05:22.300> get

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
it does work so you can actually get

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:23.999 
it does work so you can actually get
yourself<00:05:22.960> a<00:05:23.050> couple<00:05:23.470> of<00:05:23.530> kills<00:05:23.740> with

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.009 
yourself a couple of kills with

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:25.950

defibrillators<00:05:24.370> you<00:05:25.030> can<00:05:25.210> do<00:05:25.569> same<00:05:25.930> thing

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
defibrillators you can do same thing

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.990 
defibrillators you can do same thing
with<00:05:26.289> the<00:05:26.319> repair<00:05:26.680> tool<00:05:26.949> and<00:05:27.250> all<00:05:27.669> that<00:05:27.849> sort

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
with the repair tool and all that sort

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.570 
with the repair tool and all that sort
of<00:05:28.120> stuff<00:05:28.180> still<00:05:28.539> works<00:05:28.569> and<00:05:29.169> a<00:05:30.009> cool<00:05:30.400> little

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
of stuff still works and a cool little

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.450 
of stuff still works and a cool little
feature<00:05:30.729> is<00:05:31.150> if<00:05:31.360> you<00:05:31.509> get<00:05:31.630> yourself<00:05:31.750> into

capturing and flagging you inside a

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.870 
capturing and flagging you inside a
building<00:05:34.840> usually<00:05:35.199> there's<00:05:35.440> a<00:05:35.889> button<00:05:36.580> on<00:05:36.759> the

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
building usually there's a button on the

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.339 
building usually there's a button on the

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
close the shutters in that building now

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.969

some<00:05:40.630> of<00:05:40.719> the<00:05:40.810> buildings<00:05:41.199> do<00:05:41.349> have<00:05:41.560> shutters

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
some of the buildings do have shutters

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.620 
some of the buildings do have shutters
and<00:05:42.130> you<00:05:42.190> can<00:05:42.370> restrict<00:05:42.759> the<00:05:42.909> enemy<00:05:43.210> movement

that feature and now a couple more
things<00:06:02.949> that<00:06:03.250> I've<00:06:03.400> tested<00:06:03.789> out<00:06:03.909> and<00:06:04.120> bear<00:06:04.419> in

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
things that I've tested out and bear in

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:06.330 
things that I've tested out and bear in
mind<00:06:04.719> that<00:06:04.840> this<00:06:05.050> was<00:06:05.409> in<00:06:05.680> the<00:06:05.710> Alpha<00:06:06.159> and

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
mind that this was in the Alpha and

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.870 
mind that this was in the Alpha and
things<00:06:07.030> are<00:06:07.469> due<00:06:08.469> to<00:06:08.680> change<00:06:09.039> a<00:06:09.460> lot<00:06:09.639> of<00:06:09.699> them

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
things are due to change a lot of them

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.809 
things are due to change a lot of them
will<00:06:10.090> change<00:06:10.389> because<00:06:10.569> apparently<00:06:11.250> the<00:06:12.250> Alpha

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:12.819 
will change because apparently the Alpha

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:15.149 
will change because apparently the Alpha
that<00:06:13.030> we<00:06:13.240> played<00:06:13.569> it's<00:06:13.960> actually<00:06:14.289> older<00:06:15.130> than

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
that we played it's actually older than

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:19.050 
that we played it's actually older than
the<00:06:15.789> Alpha<00:06:16.210> at<00:06:16.449> people<00:06:16.930> at<00:06:17.050> e3<00:06:17.229> played<00:06:18.060> now

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
the Alpha at people at e3 played now

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.850 
the Alpha at people at e3 played now
that<00:06:19.300> doesn't<00:06:19.479> make<00:06:19.659> any<00:06:19.900> sense<00:06:20.080> to<00:06:20.259> me<00:06:20.380> but<00:06:20.710> oh

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
that doesn't make any sense to me but oh

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.200

well<00:06:21.099> we<00:06:21.250> got<00:06:21.430> to<00:06:21.550> play<00:06:21.669> and<00:06:21.909> he<00:06:21.969> was<00:06:22.060> pretty

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
well we got to play and he was pretty

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.450 
well we got to play and he was pretty
cool<00:06:22.479> now<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:23.110> one<00:06:23.409> thing<00:06:23.560> I<00:06:23.740> want<00:06:24.280> to<00:06:24.340> mention

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 
before we end a video is the counter

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.930 
before we end a video is the counter
knife<00:06:26.469> now<00:06:26.710> you<00:06:26.770> can<00:06:27.039> counter<00:06:27.400> knife<00:06:27.550> people

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
in the Alpha and it was not just from

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:33.719 
in the Alpha and it was not just from
the<00:06:32.319> front<00:06:32.560> I<00:06:32.710> actually<00:06:32.830> got<00:06:33.219> somebody<00:06:33.580> to

early<00:06:41.139> on<00:06:41.289> in<00:06:41.530> the<00:06:41.740> Alpha<00:06:42.129> and<00:06:42.219> then<00:06:42.370> they've

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520
