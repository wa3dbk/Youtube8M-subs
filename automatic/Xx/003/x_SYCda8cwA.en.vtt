00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
slow and strict that way you get Beth a

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.810 
slow and strict that way you get Beth a
better<00:06:00.360> contraction<00:06:01.050> on<00:06:01.169> the<00:06:01.410> back<00:06:01.620> because<00:06:02.610> I

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
better contraction on the back because I

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.250 
better contraction on the back because I
believe<00:06:03.120> it<00:06:03.240> back<00:06:03.360> into<00:06:03.630> it<00:06:03.840> today<00:06:04.020> you<00:06:04.110> need

believe it back into it today you need

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.379 
believe it back into it today you need
to<00:06:04.530> focus<00:06:04.800> on<00:06:05.190> contraction<00:06:06.180> of<00:06:06.270> a<00:06:06.360> muscle

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
focusing on building size for the first

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.300 
focusing on building size for the first
week<00:06:30.479> and<00:06:30.780> you'll<00:06:31.350> notice<00:06:31.560> when<00:06:31.890> I<00:06:31.950> did<00:06:32.190> the

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
week and you'll notice when I did the

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.150 
week and you'll notice when I did the
barbell<00:06:32.789> curls<00:06:33.090> on<00:06:33.300> the<00:06:33.330> table<00:06:33.750> at<00:06:34.740> the<00:06:34.919> quite

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
barbell curls on the table at the quite

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.580 
barbell curls on the table at the quite
close<00:06:35.430> grip<00:06:35.700> and<00:06:35.970> now<00:06:36.960> the<00:06:37.020> reason<00:06:37.260> I<00:06:37.410> do<00:06:37.560> that

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
close grip and now the reason I do that

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.170 
close grip and now the reason I do that
is<00:06:37.800> to<00:06:37.890> hit<00:06:38.130> the<00:06:38.250> out<00:06:38.370> device<00:06:38.760> I've<00:06:38.970> had

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
is to hit the out device I've had

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.969 
is to hit the out device I've had
because<00:06:39.570> too<00:06:39.840> many<00:06:39.930> bicep<00:06:40.380> workouts<00:06:40.740> only

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
because too many bicep workouts only

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.250 
because too many bicep workouts only
work<00:06:41.160> that<00:06:41.400> in<00:06:41.550> a<00:06:41.669> head<00:06:41.850> of<00:06:42.000> the<00:06:42.060> biceps<00:06:42.260> so

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
work that in a head of the biceps so

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.469 
work that in a head of the biceps so
from<00:06:43.830> the<00:06:43.950> side<00:06:44.160> people's<00:06:44.610> arms<00:06:45.090> come<00:06:45.330> little

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
from the side people's arms come little

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:47.450 
from the side people's arms come little
bit<00:06:45.720> weak<00:06:45.930> services<00:06:46.650> something<00:06:46.889> I<00:06:47.039> personally

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
bit weak services something I personally

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.750 
bit weak services something I personally
like<00:06:47.639> to<00:06:47.669> do<00:06:48.260> as<00:06:49.260> a<00:06:49.320> general<00:06:49.830> workout<00:06:50.190> to<00:06:50.370> start

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
like to do as a general workout to start

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.190 
like to do as a general workout to start
the<00:06:50.910> week<00:06:51.090> I<00:06:51.270> find<00:06:51.510> this<00:06:51.630> is<00:06:51.780> excellent

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
the week I find this is excellent

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.540 
the week I find this is excellent
because<00:06:52.410> you've<00:06:52.680> been<00:06:52.710> a<00:06:52.889> lot<00:06:53.220> of<00:06:53.250> calories

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
because you've been a lot of calories

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.120 
because you've been a lot of calories
using<00:06:54.120> a<00:06:54.210> big<00:06:54.419> muscle<00:06:55.260> group<00:06:55.440> like<00:06:55.770> your<00:06:55.950> back

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130 
using a big muscle group like your back

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.040 
using a big muscle group like your back
and<00:06:56.400> then<00:06:57.240> for<00:06:57.479> the<00:06:57.539> rest<00:06:57.750> of<00:06:57.810> the<00:06:57.900> week

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
and then for the rest of the week

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.629 
and then for the rest of the week
obviously<00:06:58.229> metabolism<00:06:59.100> should<00:06:59.310> be<00:06:59.430> a<00:06:59.460> bit

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 
obviously metabolism should be a bit

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:02.090 
obviously metabolism should be a bit
quicker<00:06:59.910> and<00:07:00.240> I<00:07:00.720> like<00:07:00.960> to<00:07:01.139> do<00:07:01.320> that<00:07:01.500> because

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
quicker and I like to do that because

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.830 
quicker and I like to do that because
I've<00:07:02.520> trained<00:07:02.760> legs<00:07:03.000> at<00:07:03.180> the<00:07:03.210> end<00:07:03.450> of<00:07:03.600> the<00:07:03.660> week

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
I've trained legs at the end of the week

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.750 
I've trained legs at the end of the week
so<00:07:04.110> that<00:07:04.139> way<00:07:04.410> or<00:07:04.470> two<00:07:04.830> bigger<00:07:05.130> muscle<00:07:05.550> groups

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:05.760 
so that way or two bigger muscle groups

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.050 
so that way or two bigger muscle groups
are<00:07:06.060> separated
