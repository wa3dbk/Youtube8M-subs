this<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.480> RFR<00:00:06.870> carburetor<00:00:07.380> and<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.710> just

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
this is the RFR carburetor and I just

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.320 
this is the RFR carburetor and I just
want<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.100> talk<00:00:08.250> about<00:00:08.430> the<00:00:08.700> relationship

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
want to talk about the relationship

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.600 
want to talk about the relationship
between<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.260> angles<00:00:10.680> that<00:00:10.740> are<00:00:10.920> specified<00:00:11.100> in

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
between the angles that are specified in

you're looking at there is the primary
threat<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.800> secondary<00:00:20.189> throat<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.640> can

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
threat in the secondary throat you can

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.890 
threat in the secondary throat you can
see<00:00:20.970> both<00:00:21.480> threads<00:00:21.750> are<00:00:22.050> closed<00:00:22.880> over<00:00:23.880> here<00:00:24.240> we

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
see both threads are closed over here we

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.930 
see both threads are closed over here we
have<00:00:25.110> what<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.860> manual<00:00:26.070> refers<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.670> touch

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
have what the manual refers to is touch

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.910 
have what the manual refers to is touch
timing<00:00:27.510> that's<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.140> accelerator<00:00:28.650> pump

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
timing that's the accelerator pump

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.810 
timing that's the accelerator pump
actual<00:00:29.600> actuation<00:00:30.600> tabs<00:00:31.320> over<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.669> the

actual actuation tabs over here is the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.200 
actual actuation tabs over here is the
limiter<00:00:33.210> plate<00:00:34.010> and<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.399> see<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.910> arm

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
limiter plate and you can see this arm

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.910 
limiter plate and you can see this arm
is<00:00:36.390> connected<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.140> secondary<00:00:37.559> throat

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
is connected to the secondary throat

from moving up by this limiter plate
here<00:00:43.559> another<00:00:44.460> view<00:00:44.729> of<00:00:44.819> the<00:00:44.909> limiter<00:00:45.210> plate

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
here another view of the limiter plate

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.000 
here another view of the limiter plate
you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.809> actually<00:00:45.960> see<00:00:46.350> once<00:00:46.589> the<00:00:46.739> limiter

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
you can actually see once the limiter

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.250 
you can actually see once the limiter
plate<00:00:47.190> starts<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.699> move<00:00:47.819> up<00:00:48.059> then<00:00:48.749> that<00:00:48.780> arm

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
plate starts to move up then that arm

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.319 
plate starts to move up then that arm
will<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.499> able<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.979> move<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.699> as<00:00:50.879> well<00:00:51.089> and

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
will be able to move up as well and

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.479 
will be able to move up as well and
allow<00:00:51.659> the<00:00:51.719> secondary<00:00:52.260> throat<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.679> open<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
allow the secondary throat to open the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.149 
allow the secondary throat to open the
vacuum<00:00:53.969> actuator<00:00:54.719> which<00:00:55.289> moves<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
vacuum actuator which moves the

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.459 
vacuum actuator which moves the
secondary<00:00:56.579> throat<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.420> normally<00:00:57.899> attached<00:00:58.260> to

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
secondary throat is normally attached to

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.939 
secondary throat is normally attached to
that<00:00:58.699> penis<00:00:59.699> there<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.499> to<00:01:01.620> start<00:01:01.679> with

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
that penis there so just to start with

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.189 
that penis there so just to start with
anyway<00:01:02.429> what<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.819> can<00:01:02.940> see<00:01:03.179> here<00:01:03.209> is<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
anyway what we can see here is the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.360 
anyway what we can see here is the
primary<00:01:04.559> throat<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.580> its<00:01:06.240> closed<00:01:06.690> and<00:01:07.370> the

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
primary throat is at its closed and the

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.359 
primary throat is at its closed and the
manual<00:01:08.820> says<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:10.079> has<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.259> resting<00:01:10.860> angle

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
manual says that it has a resting angle

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.130 
manual says that it has a resting angle
of<00:01:11.430> 8<00:01:11.549> degrees<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:12.329> as<00:01:12.659> I'll<00:01:12.869> demonstrate

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
of 8 degrees but as I'll demonstrate

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.990 
of 8 degrees but as I'll demonstrate
it's<00:01:13.680> all<00:01:13.799> irrelevant<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.799> setting<00:01:16.799> of

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
it's all irrelevant for the setting of

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.590 
it's all irrelevant for the setting of
various<00:01:18.469> angles<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.789> fully<00:01:21.000> closed<00:01:21.329> I

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
various angles so that is fully closed I

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.209 
various angles so that is fully closed I
can<00:01:21.750> pull<00:01:21.960> down<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.289> this<00:01:22.409> tab<00:01:22.680> here<00:01:22.920> it's

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
can pull down on this tab here it's

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:24.499 
can pull down on this tab here it's
closed<00:01:23.579> and<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.030> come<00:01:24.180> around<00:01:24.299> here

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
closed and if you come around here

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.200 
closed and if you come around here
you'll<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.109> that<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.039> angle<00:01:26.369> gauge<00:01:26.579> is<00:01:26.939> set

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
you'll see that the angle gauge is set

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.459 
you'll see that the angle gauge is set
on<00:01:27.450> zero<00:01:28.049> degrees<00:01:29.329> now<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.719> the<00:01:30.840> touch<00:01:31.020> timing

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
on zero degrees now for the touch timing

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.190 
on zero degrees now for the touch timing
of<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> accelerator<00:01:32.130> pump<00:01:32.570> if<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.750> move<00:01:33.960> this

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
of the accelerator pump if I move this

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.289 
of the accelerator pump if I move this
up<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.649> see<00:01:34.859> those<00:01:35.039> tabs<00:01:35.429> just<00:01:36.090> there

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
up you can see those tabs just there

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.919 
up you can see those tabs just there
that<00:01:36.329> tad<00:01:36.750> touches<00:01:37.229> there<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:38.570> just<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.780> you

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
that tad touches there and just here you

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.010 
that tad touches there and just here you
can<00:01:40.079> actually<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:41.210> when<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> tab<00:01:42.509> touches

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
can actually see when the tab touches

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.959 
can actually see when the tab touches
the<00:01:43.320> accelerator<00:01:43.829> pop<00:01:44.070> arm<00:01:44.280> starts<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.789> move

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
the accelerator pop arm starts to move

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.730 
the accelerator pop arm starts to move
and<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.359> I<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.630> set<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.049> right<00:01:46.259> there<00:01:46.320> just

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and if I just set that right there just

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.139 
and if I just set that right there just
at<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> point<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.460> moves<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:47.999> actually

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
at the point it moves you can actually

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.380 
at the point it moves you can actually
see<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.979> there<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.009> very<00:01:50.310> close<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.789> 28

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
see that there is very close to 28

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.350 
see that there is very close to 28
degrees

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.900 

the<00:01:55.930> other<00:01:56.080> feature<00:01:56.380> is<00:01:56.650> the<00:01:56.920> portal<00:01:57.370> setting

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
the other feature is the portal setting

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.460 
the other feature is the portal setting
which<00:01:58.180> we<00:01:58.390> don't<00:01:58.600> do<00:01:58.750> on<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.930> carburetor<00:01:59.320> but

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
which we don't do on the carburetor but

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.090 
which we don't do on the carburetor but
that<00:01:59.650> is<00:01:59.770> normally<00:02:00.100> at<00:02:00.190> 35<00:02:00.730> degrees<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.920> now

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
that is normally at 35 degrees but now

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.670 
that is normally at 35 degrees but now
the<00:02:03.160> most<00:02:03.400> important<00:02:03.940> one<00:02:04.090> here<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:05.590> to

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
the most important one here just to

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.340 
the most important one here just to
understand<00:02:06.280> how<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:06.610> works<00:02:06.880> is<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.840> book<00:02:08.050> says

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
understand how it works is the book says

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.469 
understand how it works is the book says
that<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.680> primary<00:02:08.950> valve<00:02:09.400> is<00:02:09.640> at<00:02:10.000> an<00:02:10.090> angle<00:02:10.210> of

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
that the primary valve is at an angle of

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.010 
that the primary valve is at an angle of
41<00:02:11.050> degrees<00:02:12.030> when<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.060> limiter<00:02:13.510> plate<00:02:13.750> starts

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
41 degrees when the limiter plate starts

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.350 
41 degrees when the limiter plate starts
to<00:02:14.290> move<00:02:14.470> now<00:02:15.280> i've<00:02:15.400> just<00:02:15.550> moved<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:15.940> up<00:02:16.120> here

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
to move now i've just moved this up here

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.460 
to move now i've just moved this up here
and<00:02:16.540> if<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.750> have<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> look<00:02:17.080> here<00:02:17.320> your

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
and if you have a look here your

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.090 
and if you have a look here your
super-limited<00:02:17.920> plate

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
super-limited plate

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.200 
super-limited plate
then<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.190> middle<00:02:21.310> plate<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.760> starting<00:02:22.090> to

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
then the middle plate is starting to

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.110 
then the middle plate is starting to
move<00:02:22.330> right<00:02:22.870> there<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.640> limiter<00:02:24.910> plate

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
move right there and the limiter plate

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.390 
move right there and the limiter plate
is<00:02:25.270> moving<00:02:25.450> because<00:02:25.780> off<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:27.070> touched

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
is moving because off this touched

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.340 
is moving because off this touched
timing<00:02:27.790> here<00:02:27.970> between<00:02:28.120> these<00:02:28.510> two<00:02:28.570> tabs<00:02:29.020> is

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
timing here between these two tabs is

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.560 
timing here between these two tabs is
factory<00:02:29.800> set<00:02:30.040> see<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.760> two<00:02:30.910> tabs<00:02:31.210> are<00:02:31.390> just

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
factory set see the two tabs are just

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.290 
factory set see the two tabs are just
touching<00:02:31.930> there<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.790> limiter<00:02:34.090> plate

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
touching there so the limiter plate

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.820 
touching there so the limiter plate
actually<00:02:34.480> starts<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:34.990> open<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.440> according<00:02:35.770> to

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
actually starts to open and according to

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.750 
actually starts to open and according to
the<00:02:35.890> book<00:02:36.070> that's<00:02:36.280> 41<00:02:36.760> degrees<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:38.410> if<00:02:39.070> we<00:02:41.760> now

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
the book that's 41 degrees and if we now

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.740 
the book that's 41 degrees and if we now
I<00:02:42.790> have<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.030> look<00:02:43.210> at<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.450> angle<00:02:43.840> gauge<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:46.690> can

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
I have a look at the angle gauge you can

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.890 
I have a look at the angle gauge you can
see<00:02:47.080> it's<00:02:47.530> pretty<00:02:47.710> much<00:02:47.830> 41<00:02:48.520> degrees<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
see it's pretty much 41 degrees the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.990 
see it's pretty much 41 degrees the
point<00:02:53.230> thing<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.710> that<00:02:54.160> when<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.370> manual<00:02:54.760> says

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
point thing is that when the manual says

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.240 
point thing is that when the manual says
45<00:02:55.540> degrees<00:02:55.870> 41<00:02:56.380> degrees<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.800> primary

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
45 degrees 41 degrees of primary

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.430 
45 degrees 41 degrees of primary
movement<00:02:57.700> they<00:02:58.480> knit<00:02:58.780> they're<00:02:59.020> referencing

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
movement they knit they're referencing

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.240 
movement they knit they're referencing
that<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.580> position<00:03:01.120> there<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:02.680> all<00:03:02.950> of

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
that to that position there so all of

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.520 
that to that position there so all of
the<00:03:03.340> angles<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:04.000> 28<00:03:04.390> degrees<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.840> 35<00:03:05.260> degrees

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
the angles the 28 degrees the 35 degrees

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.190 
the angles the 28 degrees the 35 degrees
the<00:03:05.650> 41<00:03:06.040> degrees<00:03:06.340> are<00:03:06.459> all<00:03:06.610> referenced<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.930> a

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
the 41 degrees are all referenced to a

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.470 
the 41 degrees are all referenced to a
closed<00:03:08.800> primary<00:03:09.250> valve<00:03:09.670> but<00:03:09.940> even<00:03:10.239> though<00:03:10.360> the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
closed primary valve but even though the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.600 
closed primary valve but even though the
primary<00:03:10.690> valve<00:03:11.050> is<00:03:11.260> at<00:03:11.560> 8<00:03:11.800> degrees<00:03:11.980> resting

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
primary valve is at 8 degrees resting

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.570 
primary valve is at 8 degrees resting
that's<00:03:12.910> irrelevant<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:14.830> when<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.070> says<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.400> set

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
that's irrelevant so when it says to set

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.660 
that's irrelevant so when it says to set
you<00:03:15.730> up<00:03:15.760> for<00:03:15.880> 12<00:03:16.330> or<00:03:16.480> 35<00:03:16.989> degrees<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.100> 6

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
you up for 12 or 35 degrees that is 6

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.310 
you up for 12 or 35 degrees that is 6
degrees<00:03:19.150> before<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:22.540> secondary<00:03:23.050> throat

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
degrees before the secondary throat

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.340 
degrees before the secondary throat
starts<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.160> move
