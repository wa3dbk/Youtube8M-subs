 hello to all xd but also the american one 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.889
 I have a sleep I moved to America in '98 from Sicily 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.529
 I worked abroad for a few years to give the clinique - very little 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.079
 I'm officially 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:20.810
 no make-up artists 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.720
 awn my passion 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.910
 go back add mentality 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.380
 For my teenage years my passion for makeup I think is a total 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.290
 to see what the trick to do for mac this is my photo 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.640
 without makeup 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.690
 this brave ater still image is so comparable 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.180
 has the one thing the general does for karaoke women is not 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.310
 fundamental but I think it is important to feel good about yourself 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.690
 audi 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.660
 by the time 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.479
 is 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.129
 I really realized that I have to follow this road he crossed when 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.550
 108 job interviews I went 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.780
 made-up combed make-up pretty 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.390
 got the fantastic job 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.550
 he has his turn the next day without make-up and the lady does not have me 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.840
 recognized 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.690
 I understood two things at that moment before 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.210
 and before that she was good with the second makeup 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.730
 never leave home without makeup 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.650
 at least for me 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.750

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.690

 I lost that look at me the trick to skin care because they go 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.500

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.000
