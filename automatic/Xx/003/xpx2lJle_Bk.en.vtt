hundred percent has really no viruses
whatsoever<00:01:31.210> I've<00:01:32.020> had<00:01:32.200> this<00:01:32.350> for<00:01:32.410> like<00:01:32.770> years

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
whatsoever I've had this for like years

whatsoever I've had this for like years
and<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:35.020> there<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.200> chance<00:01:35.410> for<00:01:35.470> these<00:01:35.740> so<00:01:35.980> slow

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
and is there a chance for these so slow

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.460 
and is there a chance for these so slow
down<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.090> process<00:01:37.300> list<00:01:37.720> which<00:01:38.020> is<00:01:38.140> this<00:01:38.320> will

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
down the process list which is this will

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.680 
down the process list which is this will
computer<00:01:38.800> thing<00:01:39.040> and<00:01:39.280> find<00:01:40.240> internet

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
computer thing and find internet

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.070 
computer thing and find internet
explorer<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:45.490> now<00:01:46.060> depending<00:01:46.900> on<00:01:46.960> how

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
explorer and it's now depending on how

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.780 
explorer and it's now depending on how
many<00:01:47.140> evolution<00:01:47.590> point<00:01:47.800> you<00:01:47.890> have<00:01:47.980> give<00:01:48.520> for

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
many evolution point you have give for

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.460 
many evolution point you have give for
right<00:01:48.940> now<00:01:48.970> you're<00:01:49.960> going<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.200> want<00:01:50.380> to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
right now you're going to want to

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.220 
right now you're going to want to
multiply<00:01:50.620> that<00:01:51.070> by<00:01:51.250> 8<00:01:51.700> so<00:01:52.060> 8<00:01:52.510> times<00:01:52.690> 4<00:01:53.170> is

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
multiply that by 8 so 8 times 4 is

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.580 
multiply that by 8 so 8 times 4 is
obviously<00:01:53.770> 32<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.840> I'm<00:01:56.050> gonna<00:01:56.230> bring<00:01:56.320> up<00:01:56.500> a

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
obviously 32 but I'm gonna bring up a

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:08.660 
obviously 32 but I'm gonna bring up a
calculator<00:01:57.010> for<00:01:57.130> your<00:01:57.190> benefit

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670

alright<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:11.989> 8<00:02:12.989> times<00:02:14.750> 4<00:02:16.670> thank<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:19.050> you

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
alright so 8 times 4 thank you so you

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.830 
alright so 8 times 4 thank you so you
can<00:02:19.260> want<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.530> do<00:02:20.750> 32<00:02:21.750> on<00:02:22.050> exact<00:02:22.560> value<00:02:22.920> 4<00:02:23.099> bytes

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
can want to do 32 on exact value 4 bytes

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.460 
can want to do 32 on exact value 4 bytes
scan<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.830> bajillion<00:02:25.980> result<00:02:26.550> just<00:02:26.730> pop<00:02:26.970> up

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
scan like a bajillion result just pop up

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.620 
scan like a bajillion result just pop up
yeah<00:02:28.470> yeah<00:02:28.880> now<00:02:29.880> open<00:02:30.870> up<00:02:31.200> your<00:02:31.260> disease<00:02:31.680> menu

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
yeah yeah now open up your disease menu

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.330 
yeah yeah now open up your disease menu
by<00:02:33.630> some<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.260> sneeze<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:37.160> now<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.220> should

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
by some like sneeze and now you should

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.420 
by some like sneeze and now you should
have<00:02:38.519> one<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.950> obviously<00:02:41.569> 8<00:02:42.569> times<00:02:42.870> 1<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.170> 8<00:02:43.920> so

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
have one so obviously 8 times 1 is 8 so

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:54.190 
have one so obviously 8 times 1 is 8 so
I<00:02:44.760> can<00:02:45.330> have<00:02:45.989> one<00:02:46.140> result<00:02:47.030> or<00:02:48.030> two<00:02:48.390> whichever

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.500 

I'll<00:02:55.200> change<00:02:55.470> this<00:02:55.709> value<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.400> any<00:02:56.760> multiple

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
I'll change this value to any multiple

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.860 
I'll change this value to any multiple
of<00:02:57.569> 8<00:02:57.720> look<00:02:58.049> I<00:02:58.470> already<00:02:59.400> did<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.690> that's

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
of 8 look I already did this so that's

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.850 
of 8 look I already did this so that's
go<00:03:01.170> big<00:03:01.530> multiple<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:01.980> 8<00:03:02.390> now<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.450> should<00:03:03.600> have

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
go big multiple of 8 now you should have

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:11.530 
go big multiple of 8 now you should have
999<00:03:04.860> evolution<00:03:05.549> points<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.709> by

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
999 evolution points so and by

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.380 
999 evolution points so and by
everything<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.870> your<00:03:12.930> heart's<00:03:13.140> content<00:03:13.320> and

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
everything to your heart's content and

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.109 
everything to your heart's content and
yeah<00:03:15.390> it's<00:03:15.630> pretty<00:03:15.750> much<00:03:15.930> it
