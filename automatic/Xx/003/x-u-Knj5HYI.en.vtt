at<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.600> boiling<00:05:12.960> points<00:05:13.380> because<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.740> fish

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
at the boiling points because the fish

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.580 
at the boiling points because the fish
sauce<00:05:14.070> had<00:05:14.280> quite<00:05:14.550> strong<00:05:14.940> smell<00:05:15.390> so<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.050> get
