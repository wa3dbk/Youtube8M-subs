00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.230
 and sometimes people wonder if that 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.480
 inspiration or your own thoughts 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.610
 we have to act then we will know if 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.700
 comes from ourselves or if the 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.680
 power of god for example maybe in 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.090
 some occasion you have not done your 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.820
 prayer in the morning 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.420
 and suddenly he hears his mother's voice 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.850
 I told him when I was little he remembers 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.910
 pray in the morning 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.400
 remember to pray at night 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.480
 because God would send an angel to 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.970
 give him a message 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.770
 when the holy spirit can bring 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.079
 his memory to the angel who is his mother 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.770
 when I reminded him to do his 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.130
 sentence 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.070
 and the effect is the same 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.770
 everything that invites and induces to do what 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.770
 good and doing good comes from god 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.370
 people might ask why not 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.890
 make it easy to recognize at all 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.260
 I think that the simple answer 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.570
 It is that God trusts us not 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.080
 should have to shake us to get 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.080
 our attention 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.450
 those who are baptized members of the 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.700
 Church of Jesus Christ of the Saints of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.190
 the last days receive the gift of 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.140
 holy spirit by imposing 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.210
 hands any person in any 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.550
 part of the world can receive the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.440
 influence of the holy spirit but 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.200
 after the baptism for due 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.060
 authority one receives that ordinance from 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.299
 Holy Spirit 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.479
 that gift to have its effect on us 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.460
 When we search and ask, invite 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.460
 the inspiration of heaven and the revelation
