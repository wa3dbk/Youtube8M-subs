00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.070
 the black shark today is one of 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.740
 the most advanced samples of military 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.619
 aviation technician specialists consider 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.509
 that the ka-50 missile attack cannot 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.000
 endure none even the most modern 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.950
 tanks and anti-tank missiles 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.979
 running a black shark assembly on 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.539
 distance up to eight kilometers target 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.940
 guided by the laser beam inevitably 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.849
 overtake the object so what you maneuver 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.549
 and he took a and if the entire rocket 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.200
 ammunition is already out of costs 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.620
 pilot- ka-50 is still available 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.400
 rapid-fire large-caliber gun 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.530
 auto tracking position 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.940
 goals 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.940
 unguided missiles and bombs 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.820
 despite such high combat power and 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.310
 serious armor 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.990
 black shark can perform in the air 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.540
 such acrobatic numbers 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.120
 which are beyond the power of most 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.800
 Today's screws used device and 50 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.930
 able to accelerate the decline to 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.780
 speeds of 390 kilometers per hour 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.110
 fly tail forward at 90 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.160
 kilometers an hour and sides at a speed of 80 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.530
 kilometers an hour 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.800
 make a flat reversal without change 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.800
