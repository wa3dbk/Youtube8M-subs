00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.270 
don't show up because the only clickable
area<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:46.230> actual<00:00:46.649> button<00:00:46.890> highlight

area is the actual button highlight
itself<00:00:48.860> see<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.600> when<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.780> go<00:00:51.930> ahead<00:00:52.020> and

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
happens

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.810 
happens
because<00:00:56.250> only<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:57.420> area<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:58.140> clickable<00:00:58.820> so

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
because only that area is clickable so

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.000 
because only that area is clickable so
what<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.090> want<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.960> change<00:01:01.559> the

these on you can see where that button
highlight<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.720> there<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:30.100> black<00:02:30.790> inner

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
button highlight and a white outer one

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.510 
button highlight and a white outer one
now<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.750> color<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.380> this<00:02:35.560> does<00:02:35.830> not<00:02:35.950> matter<00:02:36.220> as

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
now the color of this does not matter as

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.750 
now the color of this does not matter as
the<00:02:37.360> color<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.140> determined<00:02:38.740> in<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.160> Encore

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
the color is determined in the Encore

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.070 
the color is determined in the Encore
color<00:02:40.300> set<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:42.010> way<00:02:42.190> encore<00:02:43.080> determines

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
color set so the way encore determines

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.130 
color set so the way encore determines
where<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:45.160> clickable<00:02:45.790> area<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.630> button<00:02:46.840> is

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
where the clickable area of a button is

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.520 
where the clickable area of a button is
is<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:48.190> takes<00:02:48.430> all<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.180> layers<00:02:49.450> for<00:02:50.320> that

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
is it takes all the layers for that

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.430 
is it takes all the layers for that
button<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:51.880> draws<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.480> rectangle<00:02:53.350> around

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
button and it draws a rectangle around

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.820 
button and it draws a rectangle around
them<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.880> let's<00:02:55.090> say<00:02:55.270> you<00:02:55.330> have<00:02:55.720> an<00:02:56.020> underline

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
them so let's say you have an underline

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.360 
them so let's say you have an underline
for<00:02:57.370> your<00:02:57.780> button<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.020> maybe<00:02:59.710> you<00:02:59.890> have<00:03:00.100> a

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
for your button and maybe you have a

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.330 
for your button and maybe you have a
little<00:03:00.610> box<00:03:01.120> up<00:03:01.480> here<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.500> clickable<00:03:02.860> area

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
little box up here the clickable area

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.210 
little box up here the clickable area
would<00:03:03.730> be<00:03:03.760> everywhere<00:03:04.570> inside<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.830> big

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
would be everywhere inside a big

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.300 
would be everywhere inside a big
rectangle<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.210> encompasses<00:03:07.480> all<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:09.100> the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
rectangle that encompasses all of the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.570 
rectangle that encompasses all of the
highlight<00:03:09.790> layers<00:03:10.200> but<00:03:11.200> since<00:03:11.590> our<00:03:11.860> highlight

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
highlight layers but since our highlight

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.870 
highlight layers but since our highlight
for<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.120> button<00:03:13.480> is<00:03:13.660> just<00:03:13.720> this<00:03:14.470> box<00:03:15.370> over

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
for this button is just this box over

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.479 
for this button is just this box over
here<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:17.110> is<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.440> only<00:03:17.590> clickable<00:03:18.130> area

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
here that is the only clickable area

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.170 
here that is the only clickable area
another<00:03:19.330> thing<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.720> keep<00:03:19.870> in<00:03:19.989> mind<00:03:20.050> is<00:03:20.620> that

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
another thing to keep in mind is that

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.840 
another thing to keep in mind is that
button<00:03:22.180> highlights<00:03:22.660> for<00:03:23.080> DVDs<00:03:23.530> are<00:03:23.950> 2<00:03:24.610> bit

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
button highlights for DVDs are 2 bit

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.140 
button highlights for DVDs are 2 bit
which<00:03:25.780> means<00:03:26.110> that<00:03:26.470> pixel<00:03:27.040> is<00:03:27.250> either<00:03:27.280> on<00:03:27.820> or

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
which means that pixel is either on or

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.220 
which means that pixel is either on or
it's<00:03:28.239> off<00:03:28.810> so<00:03:29.620> any<00:03:30.070> pixel<00:03:30.670> that<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.270> above<00:03:31.720> 50%

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
it's off so any pixel that is above 50%

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.210 
it's off so any pixel that is above 50%
opacity<00:03:32.739> is<00:03:33.459> on<00:03:34.270> any<00:03:35.080> pixel<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.709> is<00:03:35.769> below

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
opacity is on any pixel that is below

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.410 
opacity is on any pixel that is below
50%<00:03:36.940> opacity<00:03:37.030> is<00:03:38.190> not<00:03:39.190> there<00:03:39.459> it's<00:03:39.700> completely

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
50% opacity is not there it's completely

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.979 
50% opacity is not there it's completely
gone<00:03:40.630> which<00:03:41.170> is<00:03:41.380> why<00:03:41.739> you<00:03:41.800> cannot<00:03:42.370> have

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
gone which is why you cannot have

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.860 
gone which is why you cannot have
anti-alias<00:03:43.989> buttons<00:03:44.620> for<00:03:45.100> DVDs<00:03:45.790> now<00:03:46.600> in

anti-alias buttons for DVDs now in
encore<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:47.709> can<00:03:47.890> change<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.489> opacity<00:03:48.580> of<00:03:49.120> an

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
encore you can change the opacity of an

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.400 
encore you can change the opacity of an
entire<00:03:50.200> button<00:03:51.010> highlight<00:03:51.480> but<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.900> cannot
