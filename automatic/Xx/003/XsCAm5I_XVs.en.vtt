 Easy connection and configuration 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 First connect the network cable to the LAN port in the recorder. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Then connect the network cables to the IP cameras. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Connect the other ends of all network cables to the switch / hub. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 The recorder automatically searches for the IP addresses of the connected cameras. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 The connection was established and the recorder starts displaying individual images. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Basic configuration made. The whole took 1 min. Even inexperienced people in the field of Internet networks will manage the configuration. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Supports high definition Full HD 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 A clear image from the AVH306 recorder exceeds that obtained on classic recorders. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 The video output has a resolution of 1920x1080p, i.e. the image is about 6 times clearer than the classic recorders. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 The AVH306 recorder supports recording with a resolution of 1.3 or 2 megapixels. Classic recorders write with a low D1 resolution (about 0.4 megapixels). 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 For example, the 1.3 megapixel record: Picture quality is much better than the recording with the D1 resolution in the classic recorder. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Hybrid systems 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Thanks to the hybrid structure, the user can connect the optimal devices in a given situation. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 EOC (Ethernet over Coaxial) technology and AVX912 modules enable the transmission of IP signals via coaxial cable over a distance of 400 m to the AVH306 recorder 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 As a result, the classic analog CCTV system can be converted into a digital system with IP cameras without the exchange of cabling. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 In addition, the AVX913 modules with HDMIoC technology transmit the HDMI signal via a 100m coaxial cable to the monitor. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Thanks to this, the user can install the AVH306 recorder anywhere. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 AVX931 server video is designed for conversion from analog to digital 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 and additionally has audio input / output, alarm input / output and RS485 port. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Therefore, the user can still use his classic analog cameras. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 For simultaneous viewing of up to 16 cameras, the EagleEyes HD-plus app is dedicated to devices with the iPad system. 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 NAS memory 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Regardless of IP cameras connected to the LAN port 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:52.000
