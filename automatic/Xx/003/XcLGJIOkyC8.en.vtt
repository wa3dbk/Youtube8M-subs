is an oval shaped and that's because the

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.500 
is an oval shaped and that's because the

the<00:02:15.180> more<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.599> easy<00:02:16.290> for<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.890> cool<00:02:17.040> down

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
the more it is easy for it to cool down

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.210 
the more it is easy for it to cool down
the<00:02:18.300> master<00:02:18.720> cylinder<00:02:18.959> body<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.530> much<00:02:19.739> larger

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
the master cylinder body is much larger

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.270 
the master cylinder body is much larger
to<00:02:20.520> accommodate<00:02:20.970> all<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.209> extra<00:02:21.569> fluid<00:02:21.780> and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
to accommodate all the extra fluid and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.160 
to accommodate all the extra fluid and
on<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.400> inside<00:02:23.819> formula<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> actually<00:02:24.900> went

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
on the inside formula I actually went

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.130 
on the inside formula I actually went
with<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.290> six<00:02:25.590> port<00:02:25.860> design<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.780> master

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
with a six port design and the master

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.650 
with a six port design and the master
cylinder<00:02:28.380> body<00:02:28.739> as<00:02:29.040> well<00:02:29.580> as<00:02:29.849> an<00:02:30.150> aluminum

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
cylinder body as well as an aluminum

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.839 
cylinder body as well as an aluminum
master<00:02:31.080> cylinder<00:02:31.470> piston<00:02:31.650> what<00:02:32.550> they're<00:02:32.730> able

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
master cylinder piston what they're able

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.020 
master cylinder piston what they're able
to<00:02:32.970> do<00:02:33.180> there<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:34.519> increase<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.550> fluid

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
to do there is increase the fluid

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.240 
to do there is increase the fluid
exchange<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.319> more<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.920> just<00:02:38.099> means

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
exchange so the more that just means

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.860 
exchange so the more that just means
there's<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.459> lot<00:02:38.580> more<00:02:38.730> fluid<00:02:39.030> running<00:02:39.540> through

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
there's a lot more fluid running through

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.530 
there's a lot more fluid running through
the<00:02:40.500> brake<00:02:40.769> which<00:02:41.340> also<00:02:42.030> helps<00:02:42.300> with<00:02:42.420> that

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
the brake which also helps with that

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.750 
the brake which also helps with that
heat<00:02:42.750> dissipation<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:44.190> more<00:02:44.340> fluid<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.700> can

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
heat dissipation the more fluid you can

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.120 
heat dissipation the more fluid you can
move<00:02:45.000> back<00:02:45.180> up<00:02:45.420> into<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.840> reservoir<00:02:46.319> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
move back up into the reservoir the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.430 
move back up into the reservoir the
quicker<00:02:47.640> it's<00:02:47.850> going<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.030> cool<00:02:48.209> off<00:02:48.450> formulas

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
quicker it's going to cool off formulas

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.370 
quicker it's going to cool off formulas
previous<00:02:49.860> designs<00:02:50.250> used<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:51.060> radial<00:02:51.989> master

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
previous designs used a radial master

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.740 
previous designs used a radial master
cylinder<00:02:52.799> but<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.310> RO<00:02:53.489> actually<00:02:53.910> uses<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.269> semi

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
cylinder but the RO actually uses a semi

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.930 
cylinder but the RO actually uses a semi
radial<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.319> can<00:02:55.470> see<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:56.220> master<00:02:56.549> cylinder

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
radial you can see the master cylinder

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.789 
radial you can see the master cylinder
piston<00:02:57.239> is<00:02:57.540> coming<00:02:57.840> in<00:02:57.989> quite<00:02:58.200> actually<00:02:58.530> that

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
piston is coming in quite actually that

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.930 
piston is coming in quite actually that
like<00:02:58.890> an<00:02:59.010> angle<00:02:59.400> this<00:03:00.150> way<00:03:00.799> and<00:03:01.799> they<00:03:02.610> did<00:03:02.790> that

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
like an angle this way and they did that

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.550 
like an angle this way and they did that
also<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.360> help<00:03:03.599> increase<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.110> modulation

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
also to help increase the modulation

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.470 
also to help increase the modulation
they<00:03:04.830> found<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.370> actually<00:03:05.849> allowed<00:03:06.450> a

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
they found that that actually allowed a

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.960 
they found that that actually allowed a
little<00:03:06.840> bit<00:03:06.959> more<00:03:07.230> lever<00:03:08.190> control<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.730> little

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
little bit more lever control a little

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.970 
little bit more lever control a little
bit<00:03:09.090> better<00:03:09.239> brake<00:03:09.540> feel<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:12.840> another<00:03:13.319> feature

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
bit better brake feel so another feature

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.630 
bit better brake feel so another feature
that's<00:03:14.340> actually<00:03:14.849> really<00:03:15.000> cool<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:16.640> along

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
that's actually really cool and along

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.250 
that's actually really cool and along
the<00:03:17.760> same<00:03:17.940> lines<00:03:18.150> with<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.630> heat<00:03:18.780> dissipation

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
the same lines with the heat dissipation

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.520 
the same lines with the heat dissipation
on<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:20.130> inside<00:03:20.549> here<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.510> can<00:03:21.690> see<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
on the inside here you can see that the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.740 
on the inside here you can see that the
Pistons<00:03:22.980> are<00:03:23.160> finned<00:03:23.519> what<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.329> allows<00:03:24.720> is

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
Pistons are finned what that allows is

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.330 
Pistons are finned what that allows is
air<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.920> move<00:03:26.209> behind<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.720> brake<00:03:27.989> pads<00:03:28.340> you

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
air to move behind the brake pads you

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.650 
air to move behind the brake pads you
couple<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.670> with<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.000> top<00:03:30.209> loading<00:03:30.450> design

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
couple that with the top loading design

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.949 
couple that with the top loading design
so<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.440> have<00:03:31.590> air<00:03:31.799> able<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.609> move<00:03:32.760> in<00:03:33.120> front<00:03:33.630> of

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
so you have air able to move in front of

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.229 
so you have air able to move in front of
the<00:03:34.109> brake<00:03:34.319> move<00:03:34.980> behind<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.459> Pistons<00:03:35.880> thanks

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
the brake move behind the Pistons thanks

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.640 
the brake move behind the Pistons thanks
to<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.450> fin<00:03:36.660> design<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.170> then<00:03:37.260> move<00:03:37.440> right

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
to the fin design and then move right

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.830 
to the fin design and then move right
out<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.920> back<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.730> just<00:03:39.000> cools<00:03:39.209> off<00:03:39.600> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
out the back it just cools off the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.770 
out the back it just cools off the
brakes<00:03:40.109> a<00:03:40.380> lot<00:03:41.160> which<00:03:41.850> is<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.030> little<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.600> how

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
brakes a lot which is a little is how

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.170 
brakes a lot which is a little is how
they're<00:03:43.019> able<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.639> keep<00:03:44.639> the<00:03:44.760> brakes<00:03:44.970> from

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
they're able to keep the brakes from

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.879 
they're able to keep the brakes from
fading<00:03:45.420> especially<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.440> brake<00:03:46.680> that's

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
fading especially a brake that's

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.220 
fading especially a brake that's
powerful<00:03:47.389> heat<00:03:48.389> buildup<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.840> going<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.049> be<00:03:49.200> a

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
powerful heat buildup is going to be a

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.629 
powerful heat buildup is going to be a
real<00:03:49.440> issue<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:49.859> that's<00:03:50.010> how<00:03:50.130> they<00:03:50.280> keep<00:03:50.459> the

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
real issue so that's how they keep the

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.640 
real issue so that's how they keep the
heat<00:03:50.819> down<00:03:51.030> another<00:03:51.780> aspect<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:52.290> what<00:03:52.470> makes

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
heat down another aspect of what makes

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.400 
heat down another aspect of what makes
the<00:03:52.829> RO<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.190> all<00:03:53.549> formula<00:03:54.030> brakes<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:54.930> good<00:03:55.200> is

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
the RO and all formula brakes so good is

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.910 
the RO and all formula brakes so good is
the<00:03:55.769> formula<00:03:56.430> specific<00:03:56.910> lines<00:03:57.150> now<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.810> lot<00:03:58.769> of

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
the formula specific lines now a lot of

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.500 
the formula specific lines now a lot of
people<00:03:59.459> don't<00:03:59.609> pay<00:03:59.700> much<00:03:59.850> attention<00:03:59.880> to<00:04:00.299> the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
people don't pay much attention to the

people don't pay much attention to the
brake<00:04:00.690> lines<00:04:00.930> but<00:04:01.590> formula<00:04:02.100> has<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.760> through

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
their own testing they've found that

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.280 
their own testing they've found that

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
they're almost as good as Goodrich lines

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.539 
they're almost as good as Goodrich lines
which<00:04:07.500> are<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.709> standard<00:04:08.010> in<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> auto

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.300 
which are a standard in the auto
industry<00:04:09.620> so<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.709> just<00:04:10.859> means<00:04:11.040> they're<00:04:11.220> able

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
industry so it just means they're able
