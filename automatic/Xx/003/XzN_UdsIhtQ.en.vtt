00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
what we have to do is kind of open the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.149 
what we have to do is kind of open the
surface<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:17.390> let<00:02:17.719> it<00:02:18.400> let<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.519> moisture<00:02:19.640> out

surface and let it let the moisture out

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.750 
surface and let it let the moisture out
sometimes<00:02:22.159> that<00:02:22.700> will<00:02:22.909> do<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.439> and<00:02:24.609> it<00:02:25.609> may

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
sometimes that will do it and it may

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.990 
sometimes that will do it and it may
take<00:02:25.939> several<00:02:26.209> applications<00:02:30.639> but<00:02:31.639> a<00:02:31.670> lot<00:02:31.879> of

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
take several applications but a lot of

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:45.670 
take several applications but a lot of
times<00:02:32.209> when<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.540> do<00:02:32.719> that<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.079> comes<00:02:33.319> back<00:02:44.680> in

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.229 
this case you ain't doing it can we see
that<00:02:48.549> it's<00:02:49.549> still<00:02:49.790> there

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
that it's still there

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.289 
that it's still there
you<00:02:50.750> can<00:02:50.930> see<00:02:51.079> it<00:02:51.200> under<00:02:51.409> the<00:02:51.530> wipe<00:02:52.120> here's<00:02:53.120> the

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
you can see it under the wipe here's the

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.659 
you can see it under the wipe here's the
way<00:02:53.419> you<00:02:53.480> handle<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.340> take<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.370> little

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:55.669 
way you handle it take a little

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:59.920 
way you handle it take a little
denatured<00:02:56.180> alcohol<00:02:56.620> don't<00:02:57.620> flood<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.930> just

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
denatured alcohol don't flood it just

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:09.770 
denatured alcohol don't flood it just
put<00:03:00.139> a<00:03:00.189> thin<00:03:01.189> wet<00:03:01.819> coat<00:03:03.939> then

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.429 

and<00:03:10.780> white<00:03:10.989> it<00:03:12.420> again<00:03:13.420> you<00:03:13.810> see<00:03:13.989> how<00:03:14.019> quick<00:03:14.319> it

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
and white it again you see how quick it

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:27.030 
and white it again you see how quick it
burns<00:03:14.620> off<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:16.230> guess<00:03:17.230> what<00:03:18.000> go<00:03:22.079> that's<00:03:23.079> it<00:03:26.040> so

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
burns off I guess what go that's it so

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.410 
burns off I guess what go that's it so
what<00:03:27.189> happens<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:29.319> alcohol<00:03:29.829> lightly<00:03:30.790> kind<00:03:31.269> of

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
what happens the alcohol lightly kind of

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.750 
what happens the alcohol lightly kind of
softens<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:31.989> surface<00:03:32.439> just<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:33.310> little<00:03:33.609> bit

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
softens the surface just a little bit

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.059 
softens the surface just a little bit
and<00:03:34.000> then<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.239> heat<00:03:34.500> softens<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:35.920> little

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
and then the heat softens it a little

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.710 
and then the heat softens it a little
more<00:03:36.310> but<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.579> heat<00:03:36.790> also<00:03:36.970> drives<00:03:37.389> it<00:03:37.569> out

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
more but the heat also drives it out

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:50.449 
more but the heat also drives it out
when<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.079> comes<00:03:38.319> when<00:03:38.439> it<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:44.069> I<00:03:48.150> had<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.180> guy

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
when it comes when it just I had a guy

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.309 
when it comes when it just I had a guy
he<00:03:51.459> was<00:03:51.639> telling<00:03:51.970> me<00:03:52.000> he<00:03:52.810> had<00:03:52.959> these<00:03:53.079> white

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
so well that's debatable that's the

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.610 
so well that's debatable that's the
