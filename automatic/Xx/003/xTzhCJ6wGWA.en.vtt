Batman<00:01:55.649> Joker<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.850> his<00:01:57.119> henchmen<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.850> think<00:01:59.850> it

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
Batman Joker and his henchmen I think it

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.410 
Batman Joker and his henchmen I think it
was<00:02:00.540> kind<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.110> hard<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.469> build<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:03.149> really

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
was kind of hard to build but it really

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.810 
was kind of hard to build but it really
pays<00:02:03.780> off<00:02:04.049> once<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.649> finish<00:02:05.009> building<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.579> I

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
pays off once you finish building this I

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.809 
pays off once you finish building this I
think<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> really<00:02:07.469> good<00:02:07.770> set

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
think this is a really good set

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.800 
think this is a really good set
and<00:02:08.939> I<00:02:09.269> really<00:02:09.659> think<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.049> should<00:02:10.170> probably

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
and I really think you should probably

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.479 
and I really think you should probably
buy<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.840> because<00:02:13.349> it's<00:02:14.069> just<00:02:14.280> amazing<00:02:16.219> it<00:02:17.219> took

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
buy it because it's just amazing it took

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.789 
buy it because it's just amazing it took
me<00:02:17.670> quite<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:18.090> while<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.359> build<00:02:18.689> this<00:02:20.150> so

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
me quite a while to build this so

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.910 
me quite a while to build this so
overall<00:02:22.799> I<00:02:23.129> think<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.489> is<00:02:23.700> really<00:02:23.939> good<00:02:24.920> they

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
overall I think this is really good they

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.509 
overall I think this is really good they
totally<00:02:26.189> like<00:02:26.730> we<00:02:27.090> made<00:02:27.329> Joker<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.290> his<00:02:28.950> bangun

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
totally like we made Joker on his bangun

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
it's a green bang and like his face has

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.089 
it's a green bang and like his face has
green<00:02:33.659> eyebrows<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.500> don't<00:02:34.650> know<00:02:34.739> if<00:02:34.829> you<00:02:34.919> can
