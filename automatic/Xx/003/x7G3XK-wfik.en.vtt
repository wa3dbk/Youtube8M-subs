00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.949 

alright<00:00:01.199> so<00:00:01.469> we're<00:00:01.680> doing<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:02.159> tier<00:00:02.550> 2

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:02.959 
alright so we're doing the tier 2

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:05.920 
alright so we're doing the tier 2
fractals<00:00:03.959> right<00:00:04.170> now<00:00:04.290> which<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:04.440> 10<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.920> 19

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
fractals right now which is 10 to 19

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.400 
fractals right now which is 10 to 19
this<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.440> swamp<00:00:07.799> fractal<00:00:08.340> which<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
this is the swamp fractal which is the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.140 
this is the swamp fractal which is the
easiest<00:00:10.769> fractal<00:00:12.200> it's<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.349> quickest<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:14.150> the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
easiest fractal it's the quickest in the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.029 
easiest fractal it's the quickest in the
beginning<00:00:15.540> people<00:00:15.900> kind<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.320> had<00:00:16.619> trouble

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
beginning people kind of had trouble

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.769 
beginning people kind of had trouble
figuring<00:00:17.910> out<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.449> get<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> wisps<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
figuring out how to get the wisps to the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.900 
figuring out how to get the wisps to the
spawn<00:00:21.779> point<00:00:22.020> basically<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.560> time<00:00:22.910> but

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
spawn point basically in time but

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.460 
spawn point basically in time but
basically<00:00:24.180> once<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.630> figure<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.990> out<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.380> goes

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
basically once you figure it out it goes

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.089 
basically once you figure it out it goes
by<00:00:25.680> really<00:00:25.830> quickly<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:27.050> then<00:00:28.050> after<00:00:28.920> this

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
by really quickly and then after this

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.710 
by really quickly and then after this
event<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.609> basically<00:00:30.029> just<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.330> boss<00:00:30.480> and

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
event is basically just the boss and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.260 
event is basically just the boss and
you're<00:00:30.869> done<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.260> fractal<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:32.270> most

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
you're done with the fractal so most

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.479 
you're done with the fractal so most
people<00:00:33.450> love<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.840> one<00:00:34.050> now<00:00:37.160> so<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.399> can

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
people love this one now so as you can

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.220 
people love this one now so as you can
see<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.879> mini-map<00:00:39.149> there<00:00:39.660> are<00:00:39.870> basically

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
see on the mini-map there are basically

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.690 
see on the mini-map there are basically
three<00:00:40.350> icons<00:00:42.800> those<00:00:43.800> are<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> three<00:00:44.370> wisps

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
three icons those are the three wisps

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.740 
three icons those are the three wisps
that<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.940> need<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> bring<00:00:45.239> back<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.629> those

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
that you need to bring back to those

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.470 
that you need to bring back to those
tree<00:00:45.989> stumps<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.809> you're<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:51.960> going<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.199> wait

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
tree stumps so you're just going to wait

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.380 
tree stumps so you're just going to wait
each<00:00:54.480> location<00:00:55.379> has<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> different<00:00:56.699> trap

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
each location has like a different trap

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.779 
each location has like a different trap
or<00:00:57.780> enemy<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:59.039> these<00:00:59.160> spider<00:00:59.520> eggs

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
or enemy so this one these spider eggs

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.689 
or enemy so this one these spider eggs
are<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> way<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.980> one<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> top<00:01:02.460> left

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
are in the way the one on the top left

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.800 
are in the way the one on the top left
he<00:01:02.850> was<00:01:02.940> clearing<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.300> scouts<00:01:04.220> ready<00:01:08.810> I'm

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
he was clearing out scouts ready I'm

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.440 
he was clearing out scouts ready I'm
just<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.170> run<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.549> pick<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.729> up<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.150> then

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
just going to run in pick it up and then

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.270 
just going to run in pick it up and then
basically<00:01:12.960> run<00:01:13.320> out<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.680> one's<00:01:13.860> pretty<00:01:14.040> easy

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
basically run out this one's pretty easy

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.710 
basically run out this one's pretty easy
as<00:01:14.460> close<00:01:15.170> sometimes<00:01:16.170> these<00:01:16.380> walls<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:17.040> that

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
as close sometimes these walls like that

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.660 
as close sometimes these walls like that
will<00:01:18.720> block<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:20.159> middle<00:01:20.670> location<00:01:22.670> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
will block you this middle location you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.789 
will block you this middle location you
can<00:01:23.790> jump<00:01:24.060> over<00:01:24.240> it

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.350 

so<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.829> always<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.369> go<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.969> middle<00:01:33.210> one

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
so I always just go to the middle one

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.499 
so I always just go to the middle one
basically<00:01:35.060> especially<00:01:36.060> if<00:01:36.149> you're<00:01:36.240> close<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
basically especially if you're close and

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.330 
basically especially if you're close and
then<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.110> jump<00:01:37.320> over<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.950> put

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
then you can just jump over it and put

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.039 
then you can just jump over it and put
in<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> wisps<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.360> there<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.570> go<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.810> got<00:01:39.960> all

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
in the wisps so there we go we got all

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.480 
in the wisps so there we go we got all
three<00:01:40.259> within<00:01:40.680> they<00:01:41.460> be<00:01:41.640> 32<00:01:42.090> seconds

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.230 

basically<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:47.610> need<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.909> watch<00:01:48.000> out<00:01:48.210> for

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
basically you just need to watch out for

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.800 
basically you just need to watch out for
traps<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.929> ground<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:51.149> enemies<00:01:51.569> by<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
traps on the ground the enemies by the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.740 
traps on the ground the enemies by the
wisp<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:53.189> then<00:01:53.789> there's<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.210> dude<00:01:54.450> called

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
wisp and then there's this dude called

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.529 
wisp and then there's this dude called
moss<00:01:54.960> man<00:01:55.259> who<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.619> fight<00:01:56.030> as<00:01:57.030> one<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.420> end

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
moss man who you fight as one of the end

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.499 
moss man who you fight as one of the end
bosses<00:01:57.899> who<00:01:58.110> will<00:01:58.259> like<00:01:58.500> try<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.299> attack<00:02:00.299> you

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
bosses who will like try and attack you

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.929 
bosses who will like try and attack you
as<00:02:00.600> well<00:02:00.979> we're<00:02:01.979> not<00:02:02.099> fighting<00:02:02.310> moss<00:02:02.520> man<00:02:02.729> this

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
as well we're not fighting moss man this

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.609 
as well we're not fighting moss man this
one<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.299> fight<00:02:03.599> one<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.899> two<00:02:03.990> bosses<00:02:04.200> this

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
one you can fight one of two bosses this

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.260 
one you can fight one of two bosses this
is<00:02:04.860> bloom<00:02:05.159> longer<00:02:05.490> he's<00:02:05.670> basically<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.090> big

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
is bloom longer he's basically a big

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.279 
is bloom longer he's basically a big
tree<00:02:06.479> he<00:02:07.470> is<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:08.069> my<00:02:08.190> opinion<00:02:08.280> easier

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
tree he is in my opinion easier

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.789 
tree he is in my opinion easier
especially<00:02:10.289> for<00:02:10.739> melee<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:13.470> I'm<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:13.680> going

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
especially for melee so I'm just going

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.460 
especially for melee so I'm just going
to<00:02:13.890> run<00:02:14.069> in<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.489> basically<00:02:15.480> just<00:02:15.720> stay<00:02:16.080> may<00:02:16.290> lay

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
to run in I basically just stay may lay

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.050 
to run in I basically just stay may lay
on<00:02:16.590> him<00:02:16.769> there's<00:02:16.980> only<00:02:17.130> one<00:02:17.430> attack<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.910> can

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
use your heavier dodge ready once you

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.220 
use your heavier dodge ready once you
start<00:03:20.910> shaking<00:03:21.359> and<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.630> see<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.900> poison

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.929 

so<00:03:28.750> right<00:03:28.900> here<00:03:29.080> is<00:03:29.200> doing<00:03:29.769> it<00:03:29.950> just<00:03:30.760> want<00:03:30.879> to

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
so right here is doing it just want to

so right here is doing it just want to
be<00:03:31.030> ready<00:03:32.340> even<00:03:33.340> if<00:03:34.349> like<00:03:35.349> just<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:35.950> be<00:03:36.069> safe

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
be ready even if like just to be safe

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.860 
be ready even if like just to be safe
you<00:03:36.310> can<00:03:36.519> always<00:03:36.879> use<00:03:37.000> your<00:03:37.150> dodges<00:03:37.569> just

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
you can always use your dodges just

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.390 
you can always use your dodges just
because<00:03:38.230> you'll<00:03:38.470> probably<00:03:38.769> have<00:03:39.159> enough

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
because you'll probably have enough

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.009 
because you'll probably have enough
endurance<00:03:39.670> come<00:03:40.060> back<00:03:40.239> by<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.510> time<00:03:40.720> he<00:03:40.840> does

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
endurance come back by the time he does

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.369 
endurance come back by the time he does
his<00:03:41.140> next<00:03:41.530> poison<00:03:41.980> bolt<00:03:42.159> phase<00:03:42.340> and

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
his next poison bolt phase and

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.250 
his next poison bolt phase and
everything<00:03:44.379> else<00:03:44.560> is<00:03:44.769> basically<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.810> their

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
everything else is basically so their

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.100 
everything else is basically so their
side<00:03:47.950> dodge<00:03:48.159> but<00:03:48.489> it<00:03:48.670> hit<00:03:48.790> me<00:03:48.940> still<00:03:49.239> gives<00:03:50.019> you

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
side dodge but it hit me still gives you

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.350 
side dodge but it hit me still gives you
like<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.409> fumble<00:03:50.890> sometimes<00:03:51.579> when<00:03:51.879> you<00:03:51.970> time

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360
