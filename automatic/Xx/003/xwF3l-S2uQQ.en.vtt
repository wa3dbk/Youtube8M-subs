00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.050
 hello and welcome to this new video a 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:27.189
 boxing on this occasion from the base of 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.470
 loading the nintendo 3ds xl this base 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.970
 load I always wanted to have it more 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.230
 well on a whim but if there was something 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.309
 that I backed out but 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.500
 precisely its price about 25 euros per 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.629
 what I tried to convince myself that yes 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.120
 in one way or another and here you have it in 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.710
 this video we will see what this 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.059
 box although I imagine that the 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.949
 content and little else 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.440
 let's look around here to see where it is 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.030
 in Spanish 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.980
 down here is let's take a look 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.960
 to see what your console always puts 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.420
 charged this to carry treated late 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.399
 current does not appear to put anything 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.960
 interesting as you will have heard between 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.489
 very proud not only the base of 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.500
 charge but an adapter comes for 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.270
 the adapter console that comes costing 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.270
 about seven euros so the plastic 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.009
 another load base would cost about 17 and 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.200
 I can understand that it will seem to many 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.509
 expensive to spend 25 euros an adapter 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.039
 current that if it's not cheap so 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.470
 let's open this box to see 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.060
 really what it contains although this is 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.890
 the official price is not the price anymore 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.780
 cheap to which you can find it 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.509
 this week unfortunately I've seen him 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.770
 about 16 17 euros in amazon so from 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.470
 have known before I could have 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.420
 saved enough money already removed the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.179
 seals we're totally going to open 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.890
 the box and we're going to take out all your 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.220
 content outward though ya 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.960
 advance that will not be much 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.030
 in early to what is the charger 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.980
 the console that is the same as the charger 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.280
 that you can buy separately 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.020
 compatible with the nintendo 3ds and 3ds and 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.460
 as the charger is the typical one we are going to 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.950
 set it aside and let's see what else 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.210
 comes inside this box this 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.280
 it seems to be a typical manual 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.780
 instructions that nobody pays any attention so 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.370
 let's remove it from this plastic and 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.510
 let's see if he really puts something 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.460
 interesting or special 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.050
 so we get rid of it and go 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.750
 with the protagonist of the package that is 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.050
 the load base and the box that now does not 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.870
 we only send it to fly 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.150
 and here you have the base load base of 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.240
 load that as you will see is totally 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.450
 plastic underneath it does not put anything of 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.490
 special and if it's totally plastic 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.560
 check here you have the connector of the 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.300
 charger that you will simply catch the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.110
 charger comes to us that you already have in 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.820
 home you connect here and just a 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.780
 second would have to take a nintendo 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.740
 3ds leave it on top and start loading 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.080
 automatically 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.880
 This charging base works thanks to 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.030
 this little spring that you can see 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.830
 here by supporting the console on top of this 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.930
 spring will make these protrude 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.730
 small metal connectors that will make 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.770
 contact with the console in the part that 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.530
 They teach me right now as you see 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.060
 it really does not have much mystery and now 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.580
 the million dollar question 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.560
 it's worth it in principle, not what 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.210
 I would recommend it unless you knew well 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.030
 but well certain that you are going to take out 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.010
 pretty use to realize you're going to pay 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.840
 about 17 euros for a little plastic and 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.420
 with a community that surely does not 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.310
 you will need this money in between 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.530
 invest it in an expensive charger you can 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.090
 invest better in anything else 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.740
 thanks for watching this video and see you 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.740
 coming soon in a new video 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.580
 no no
