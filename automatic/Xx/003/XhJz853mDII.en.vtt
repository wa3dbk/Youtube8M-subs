00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.340
- [Narrator] The Gascony
region of southern France

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.320
is rich in history.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.070
It's also the birthplace of Armagnac,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.920
the little known brandy
that has been much loved

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.080
by all who've sampled
it over the centuries.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.560
Even the musketeers of
legend once embraced it.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.300
Now, it will be featured
in Torshavn Lounge

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.970
on the Viking Star.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.810
- Our chairman Torstein Hagen asked us to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.850
go out and find 30 years
of vintage spirits,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.610
so that the guests could
be able to have their drink

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.380
with their birth year when
they wanted to celebrate.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.413
We went out and looked for Armagnac.

00:00:36.413 --> 00:00:39.260
It's a little bit more
special in our eyes,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.160
it has more fruit content,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.970
it ages differently,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.020
it's a lovely spirit.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.800
We found from 1935 to 1965,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.020
all the vintages,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.220
which was very exciting.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.285
- [Narrator] Nestled between
the Pyrenees and the Atlantic,

00:00:55.285 --> 00:00:58.680
Armagnac's microclimate
delivers a remarkable brandy,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.683
long admired by connoisseurs.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.590
Armagnac is unique.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.830
Unlike distant cousin cognac,
it's distilled just once,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.040
allowing more of the essence of the fruit

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.623
and fragrance to remain.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.250
- This is the very 1st step
of the Armagnac production,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.230
which is continuous distillation.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.660
To do the distillation we need

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.870
a traditional Armagnac Alambic.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.050
This is what we have just in front of us.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.060
It's made of two parts,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.690
we have one big tank over there

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.270
and we have the boiler and
the column just over there.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.540
- [Narrator] Inside, pressure, temperature

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.760
and copper coils combine
to move the wine through

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.970
the Alambic, transforming
it into the clear

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.313
eau de vie that will be come Armagnac.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.950
- The very first record we found

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.620
dated back to the year 1311.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.240
So we can say that Armagnac is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.433
the oldest French brandy available.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.450
- [Narrator] New French oak barrels are

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.280
the next stop for the eau de vie,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.410
where it can spend years incorporating

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.707
the colors and flavors of the oak.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.600
Older French oak barrels
follow, to keep the young oak

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.130
from overwhelming the
fruit while more years pass

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.280
under the watchful eye
of the cellarmaster.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.913
(speaking French)

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.070
- [Translator] It is time that
is the greatest participant

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.070
in Armagnac's evolution.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.070
I control the climate
and keep the Armagnac

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.000
in the optimum cask.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.230
But it is nature that decides when

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.780
the vintage is fully developed.

00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:46.380
- [Narrator] With the
cellarmaster's nod of approval,

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.463
the Armagnac is ready
and stored in demijohns.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.950
Once under glass the
Armagnac ages very slowly,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.530
and flavors such as nut,
dried fruit, flowers

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.233
and vanilla become apparent.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.280
Known as the paradise cellar, it's where

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.703
the oldest and rarest vintages
are kept and monitored.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.410
- [Translator] Of course it
is difficult to say goodbye

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.610
to these old friends that
we've watched over for decades,

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.070
but I think those sampling
our rare Armagnac vintages

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.680
in Torshaven will enjoy
the rich earthy flavors

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.420
and extremely long finish
as they sample their way

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.260
through the seasons to
find the Armagnac that

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.083
gives them the most pleasure.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.087
- [Narrator] The Armagnac vintages for

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:42.040
Vikings's Torshaven Lounge,

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.603
span some of civilization's
most interesting times.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.590
Moments when the world celebrated peace,

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.340
and the tallest mountain was summited.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.110
Times when man stepped into space,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.220
a great leader was lost,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.803
and a new vision was born.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.980
- It is important to remember of course

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.910
that each vintage is unique.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.870
So, if you have yours
one day for your birthday

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.410
you might wanna try your
wife's the next week

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.890
when she has her birthday.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.460
They all have a personality

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.010
and they should all be experienced.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.380
We think that this is
a great spirit to have.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.940
It's more feminine than cognac.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.640
Armagnac you just have to get the nose,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.330
look at the color, take a little sip,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.253
and you can just enjoy all that fruit.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.290
- [Narrator] Bottle by bottle,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.360
the heart and history of
Gascony is being captured

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.420
to be later revealed in the delightful

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.820
character and aromatic intensity

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.410
of these rare Armagnac vintages

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.510
as they're sampled in Torshaven,

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.293
on board the Viking Star.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.500
- [Torbjorn] It's for sure
the largest vintage spirits

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.003
collection on any vessel sailing.

00:04:54.297 --> 00:04:55.730
- [Narrator] Torshaven is a haven

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.170
for our guests and the spirits,

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.530
an ideal place to close the day

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.263
when sailing on board the Viking Star.
