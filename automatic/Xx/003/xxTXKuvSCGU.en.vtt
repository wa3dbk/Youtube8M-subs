people today who wanted George and I'm

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.810 
people today who wanted George and I'm
inviting<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> couple<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:50.670> I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
inviting a couple of it in but I

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.940 
inviting a couple of it in but I
couldn't<00:01:51.119> invite<00:01:51.240> them<00:01:51.450> all<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:52.470> down<00:01:52.710> to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
couldn't invite them all just down to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.679 
couldn't invite them all just down to
the<00:01:53.040> fact<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:54.090> know<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.390> only<00:01:54.450> invite

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
the fact that you know I can only invite

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.050 
the fact that you know I can only invite
seven<00:01:55.229> people<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.770> time<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.610> I've<00:01:56.729> tried

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
seven people in a time and I've tried

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.060 
seven people in a time and I've tried
out<00:01:57.119> them<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.780> think<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.140> about<00:01:58.229> time<00:01:58.829> for

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
out them and I think it's about time for

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.999 
out them and I think it's about time for
these<00:01:59.399> people<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.880> save<00:02:00.119> now<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.960> let's<00:02:01.590> see<00:02:01.829> if

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
these people to save now so let's see if

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.550 
these people to save now so let's see if
they<00:02:02.130> actually<00:02:02.369> save<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.869> 30<00:02:04.140> seconds

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
they actually save it in the 30 seconds

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.380 
they actually save it in the 30 seconds
so<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.740> always<00:02:05.040> give<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.460> warning<00:02:05.880> message<00:02:05.939> if

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
so I always give this warning message if

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.859 
so I always give this warning message if
I<00:02:06.479> do<00:02:06.689> host<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.200> put<00:02:07.680> save<00:02:07.979> extra<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.789> 30<00:02:09.000> seconds

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
I do host I put save extra in 30 seconds

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.729 
I do host I put save extra in 30 seconds
and<00:02:09.989> then<00:02:10.709> once<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.819> put<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:13.080> normally

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
and then once I have put that I normally

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.479 
and then once I have put that I normally
send<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.780> everybody<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:17.040> let's<00:02:17.220> go<00:02:17.400> ahead

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
send it to everybody so let's go ahead

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.570 
send it to everybody so let's go ahead
and<00:02:17.610> put<00:02:17.879> that<00:02:17.909> a<00:02:18.420> save<00:02:18.720> Exton<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.260> 30<00:02:19.580> seconds

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
and put that a save Exton in 30 seconds

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.149 
and put that a save Exton in 30 seconds
so<00:02:20.879> that's<00:02:21.599> pretty<00:02:22.019> clear<00:02:22.260> message<00:02:22.290> they've

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
so that's pretty clear message they've

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.559 
so that's pretty clear message they've
been<00:02:23.459> in<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.640> world<00:02:23.790> for<00:02:23.909> 10<00:02:24.090> minutes<00:02:24.360> as<00:02:24.510> you
