MC<00:00:03.330> converter<00:00:03.750> this<00:00:04.410> will<00:00:04.770> ask<00:00:04.950> us<00:00:05.250> also<00:00:05.580> do

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
MC converter this will ask us also do

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.520 
MC converter this will ask us also do
general<00:00:07.470> particles<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:09.110> yeah<00:00:10.110> so<00:00:10.380> basically

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
general particles and yeah so basically

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.870 
general particles and yeah so basically
general<00:00:11.219> particles<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:12.349> could<00:00:13.349> do<00:00:13.440> on

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
general particles is I could do on

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.220 
general particles is I could do on
investment<00:00:14.880> meters<00:00:15.150> disabled<00:00:15.750> for<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.960> bins

you that have done this multiple times
but<00:01:08.970> didn't<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.390> pattern<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.710> this

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
but didn't see the pattern and in this

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.800 
but didn't see the pattern and in this
because<00:01:11.490> there<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> pattern<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
because there is a pattern there is a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.800 
because there is a pattern there is a
pattern<00:01:13.140> 0<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.619> piss<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.220> why<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.600> like

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
pattern 0 to piss to why this is like

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.450 
pattern 0 to piss to why this is like
this<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.130> figure<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.400> that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
this and then if you can figure out that

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.660 
this and then if you can figure out that
pattern<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.840> automate<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.409> data<00:01:20.340> for

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
pattern you can automate it data for

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.969 
pattern you can automate it data for
those<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.939> haven't<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.320> godsend<00:01:22.830> I

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
those that haven't this is a godsend I

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.210 
those that haven't this is a godsend I
guess<00:01:23.189> because<00:01:24.080> this<00:01:26.330> this<00:01:27.330> updated<00:01:28.220> setting

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
guess because this this updated setting

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.880 
guess because this this updated setting
converter<00:01:29.970> will<00:01:30.270> fix<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.170> alright

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
converter will fix that for you alright

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.240 
converter will fix that for you alright

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
and drop it over to where every year in

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.730 
and drop it over to where every year in
2000<00:01:41.220> or<00:01:41.570> put<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.899> somewhere<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.560> then

alright so we first extracted you'll
have<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:55.049> Bachelet<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.130> running<00:01:56.520> once

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
have this Bachelet this is running once

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.230 
have this Bachelet this is running once
alright<00:01:58.409> run<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.920> once<00:01:59.219> it'll<00:01:59.549> null<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.060> out

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
alright run that once it'll null it out

and then you'll and then it'll generate
another<00:02:03.310> empty<00:02:03.550> file<00:02:03.940> all<00:02:04.600> right<00:02:04.750> if<00:02:04.870> anybody

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
another empty file all right if anybody

keeps track with my previous releases I
always<00:02:07.960> say<00:02:08.140> get<00:02:08.650> this<00:02:09.010> in<00:02:09.130> Drive<00:02:09.369> see

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
always say get this in Drive see

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.850 
always say get this in Drive see
this<00:02:10.270> one<00:02:10.570> is<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.840> little<00:02:11.050> different<00:02:11.560> this<00:02:11.650> one

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
this one is a little different this one

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.470 
this one is a little different this one
allows<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.670> put<00:02:12.850> it<00:02:12.970> somewhere<00:02:13.210> else

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
allows you to put it somewhere else

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.270 
allows you to put it somewhere else

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
because when you run the first one it'll

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.710 
because when you run the first one it'll
make<00:02:15.370> another<00:02:15.640> batch<00:02:15.910> file<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.360> set<00:02:16.600> up

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
make another batch file and set up

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.830 
make another batch file and set up
exactly<00:02:16.930> where<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:19.120> alright

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840

old name whatever I don't care
and<00:02:40.320> then<00:02:41.320> if<00:02:41.800> I<00:02:41.980> open<00:02:42.250> this<00:02:42.370> up<00:02:42.580> now<00:02:42.850> I'll<00:02:43.390> run

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
and then if I open this up now I'll run

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.640 
and then if I open this up now I'll run
the<00:02:43.660> empty<00:02:43.900> template<00:02:44.260> on<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:46.350> all<00:02:47.350> right

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
the empty template on it all right

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.030 
the empty template on it all right
you'll<00:02:48.280> see<00:02:48.490> that<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.850> particles<00:02:49.180> now<00:02:50.040> have

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
you'll see that the particles now have

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.130 
you'll see that the particles now have
the<00:02:51.370> correct<00:02:51.700> texture<00:02:52.270> on<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:52.810> this<00:02:52.990> is

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
the correct texture on it so this is

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.550 
the correct texture on it so this is
texture<00:02:53.560> -<00:02:53.800> now<00:02:54.209> this<00:02:55.209> one<00:02:55.450> is<00:02:55.570> also<00:02:55.780> texture<00:02:56.350> -

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
texture - now this one is also texture -

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.810 
texture - now this one is also texture -
all<00:02:57.430> right<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:59.350> I<00:02:59.410> can<00:02:59.620> put<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.040> into<00:03:00.250> into

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
all right so I can put this into into

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.720 
all right so I can put this into into
the<00:03:01.030> game<00:03:01.270> I'm<00:03:01.840> doing<00:03:02.560> replaces<00:03:03.130> just<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.580> make

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
can sit here I turn into Archimonde

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.600 
can sit here I turn into Archimonde
so<00:04:04.440> yeah<00:04:05.440> as<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.769> can<00:04:05.890> see<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.310> particles
