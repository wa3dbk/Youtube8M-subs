00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
it right off and do the bolt this one

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.750 
it right off and do the bolt this one
and<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.540> there<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.680> red<00:01:14.070> part<00:01:14.400> is

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and it's on there this red part is

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.370 
and it's on there this red part is
clipped<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:15.810> push<00:01:16.170> that

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
clipped up here so you just push that

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
clipped up here so you just push that
back<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.340> could<00:01:18.200> push<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.409> back<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
back then you could push that back and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.130 
back then you could push that back and
you<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.700> squeeze<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.750> pull<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.990> right

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
you can squeeze this and pull it right

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.530 
you can squeeze this and pull it right
off<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.549> pretty<00:01:23.640> simple<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.299> then

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
off so it's pretty simple and then

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.190

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.460 
breaker bar a kid so I'm like 15 bucks
and<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.259> stuck<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:09.090> Box<00:02:09.360> end<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:10.229> give<00:02:10.440> a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and I just stuck the Box end just give a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.320 
and I just stuck the Box end just give a
little<00:02:10.530> more<00:02:10.800> tension

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
little more tension

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.850 
little more tension
and<00:02:12.420> pulled<00:02:12.900> on<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.530> relieved<00:02:13.770> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and pulled on it and it relieved the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.820 
and pulled on it and it relieved the
tension<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.580> was<00:02:14.670> no<00:02:14.820> problem<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:16.050> on<00:02:16.470> the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
tension so it was no problem so on the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.060 
tension so it was no problem so on the
next<00:02:17.270> video<00:02:18.270> I'll<00:02:18.570> show<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.560> replaced

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
next video I'll show you the replaced

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.520 
next video I'll show you the replaced
alternator<00:02:20.850> it's<00:02:21.540> really<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> novice<00:02:22.230> job

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
alternator it's really a novice job

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.790 
alternator it's really a novice job
really<00:02:23.280> simple<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:23.910> far<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:25.080> hopefully<00:02:25.620> that

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
really simple so far and hopefully that

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.660 
really simple so far and hopefully that
will<00:02:25.920> solve<00:02:26.220> my<00:02:26.580> problem<00:02:27.030> okay<00:02:28.190> so<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.430> do

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
will solve my problem okay so you do

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.350 
will solve my problem okay so you do
have<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.910> remove<00:02:30.330> this<00:02:30.690> bracket<00:02:31.200> as<00:02:31.590> well

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
have to remove this bracket as well

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.480 
have to remove this bracket as well
otherwise<00:02:33.360> it's<00:02:33.660> not<00:02:33.780> going<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.290> come<00:02:34.440> off

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
otherwise it's not going to come off

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.680 
otherwise it's not going to come off
that<00:02:35.490> first<00:02:35.790> one<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:35.970> was<00:02:36.090> messing<00:02:36.480> around<00:02:36.540> with

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
that first one I was messing around with

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.840 
that first one I was messing around with
this<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.110> didn't<00:02:37.320> seem<00:02:37.440> like<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.850> alternator

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
this it didn't seem like the alternator

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.970 
this it didn't seem like the alternator
was<00:02:39.060> moving<00:02:39.960> anywhere<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.650> do<00:02:40.800> have<00:02:40.830> to

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
was moving anywhere so you do have to

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.020 
was moving anywhere so you do have to
just<00:02:41.040> kind<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.400> wiggle<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.760> up

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
just kind of wiggle it up

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.510 
just kind of wiggle it up
wiggle<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.420> keep<00:02:43.260> pulling<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.830> it'll<00:02:44.160> pop

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
wiggle it keep pulling it and it'll pop

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.150 
wiggle it keep pulling it and it'll pop
right<00:02:44.580> up<00:02:45.380> okay<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:46.650> see<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:46.860> got<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
right up okay you can see I got the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.310 
right up okay you can see I got the
brackets<00:02:47.580> back<00:02:47.790> on<00:02:48.500> connections<00:02:49.500> back<00:02:49.740> on<00:02:51.320> cut

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
brackets back on connections back on cut

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.180 
brackets back on connections back on cut
my<00:02:52.470> case<00:02:52.770> back<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.270> ten<00:02:54.540> millimeter

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
my case back in this is ten millimeter

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.420 
my case back in this is ten millimeter
so<00:02:56.190> I'm<00:02:56.790> pretty<00:02:57.420> much<00:02:57.540> set<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.320> just<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.860> air

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
so I'm pretty much set to just the air

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.470 
so I'm pretty much set to just the air
filter<00:02:59.970> back<00:03:00.150> in<00:03:01.190> tighten<00:03:02.190> this<00:03:02.340> up<00:03:02.580> hook<00:03:03.330> up

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
filter back in tighten this up hook up

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.780 
filter back in tighten this up hook up
the<00:03:03.630> hose<00:03:03.810> put<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.530> cup<00:03:04.770> engine<00:03:05.190> cover<00:03:05.370> back<00:03:05.580> on

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
the hose put a cup engine cover back on

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.230 
the hose put a cup engine cover back on
and<00:03:06.710> give<00:03:07.710> it<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.890> try<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.430> tension<00:03:08.820> bar<00:03:08.970> was

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
and give it a try the tension bar was

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.380 
and give it a try the tension bar was
really<00:03:09.420> simple<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:09.990> work<00:03:10.110> with<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:11.030> hope<00:03:12.030> that

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
really simple to work with I hope that

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.040 
really simple to work with I hope that
everything<00:03:13.020> will<00:03:13.110> just<00:03:13.320> rely<00:03:13.890> on<00:03:13.950> its<00:03:14.310> own<00:03:14.550> if

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
everything will just rely on its own if

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.199 
everything will just rely on its own if
anything<00:03:16.050> is<00:03:16.170> often<00:03:16.530> much<00:03:16.650> but<00:03:17.250> everything

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
anything is often much but everything

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.370 
anything is often much but everything
