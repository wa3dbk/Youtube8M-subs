 smartphone motorola moto x 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.700
 differs the most capacious battery among 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.670
 similar devices and screen high 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.100
 quality besides in the design of the case 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.410
 unusual materials are used 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.840
 the front side of the smartphone is covered 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.880

 ballistic nylon this fabric has 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.219
 hardening weave structure 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.140
 however grip with palm 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.180
 ballistic nylon is no better 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.180
 than the now popular anodized 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.770
 aluminum is the main advantage 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.230
 ballistic nylon is 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.510
 scratch resistance inset of 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.239
 nylon is soldered into the frame of soft-touch 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.070
 plastic due to well- chosen 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.710
 body thickness is securely smartphone 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.530
 fixed in the palm on the bottom 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.549
 there is a micro usb connector on the top 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.200
 minijack connector for connection 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.060
 wired headset 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.180
 on the right side is a button

 power and volume key 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.009
 under the volume keys 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.380
 is the nano-sim card slot 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.600
 although not all design solutions are successful 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.420
 oh there max stands out for practicality and 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.560
 original appearance 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.740

 technology amoled equal to 5.2 inches 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.750
 and the resolution is 2560 by one 1440 pixels 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.000
 The advantages of the screen should be attributed 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.979
 good oleophobic coating close 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.810

 brightness of the image when viewed under 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.729
 angle to screen flicker flaws 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.429
 manifesting at very low brightness in 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.110
 Overall screen quality is high primary 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.689

 front panel large stock 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.939
 speaker volume is no different when 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:10.129
 This can be heard wheezing when listening to 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.140
 There are no significant distortions in the headphones but 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.660
 reproducible range is narrowed to 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.519
 mid-frequency and front camera 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.060
 the smartphone has a resolution of 2 megapixels

 works quite carefully despite 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.019
 on a weak sensor the camera is not perfect but 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.140
 copes well with many 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:45.500
 situations video recording is done with 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.840

 android 4 4 4 main screen and 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.019
 operating systems have kept 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.579
 standard look to the traditional set 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.530
 google added only a few 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.530
 applications with the ability in particular 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.480
 track the user's location 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.790
 main software feature of moto x 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.069
 is the functionality implemented and 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.959
 using a pair of processors one 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.849
 coprocessor works with sensors a 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.489
 the second is responsible for voice control 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.049
 to control the smartphone talking 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.510
 with moto needed on one of 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.859
 supported languages ​​in which 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.260
 Russians do not enter 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.599
 dictate search queries through google 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.040

 moto display is optional 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.459
 functional screen which 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.680
 activated when the smartphone goes into 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.870
 Standby mode to turn it on 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.630
 either change the position of the smartphone or 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.970
 bring your arm in corners 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.840
 sensors are located intersecting hand over 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.930
 smartphone 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.660
 the smartphone is equipped with a single - chip system 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.640
 qualcomm snapdragon 805 s 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.410
 quad-core processor with a frequency of 2 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.569
 and 7 tenths gigahertz 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.910
 two extra with processors 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.239
 three gigabytes of ram and 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.410
 64 gigabytes of flash memory support 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.019
 no memory cards 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.790
 according to the results of performance tests mod 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.340
 he max demonstrate decent 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.530
 results but before the record breakers popular 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.299
 brands do not reach performance 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.600
 there is enough device for performance of any 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.820
 tasks and demanding games non-removable 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.700
 battery capacity of 3 thousand 900 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.860
 milliampere hour provides up to 15 hours 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.860
 20 minutes of battery life in mode 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.010
 watching videos and up to 5 hours in 3d mode 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.610
 games in these scenarios moto x surpasses 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.950
 competitors 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.139
 However, in read mode, the smartphone is held 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.900
 almost as much as similar 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.370
 smartphone device supports 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.289
 fast charging technology qualcomm 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.900
 to take advantage of her need 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.000
 complete power adapter with charge 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.389
 legs legs fully restored for 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.550
 two hours impression of moto mix 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.950
 spoiled by low quality dynamics 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.020
 and the fact that the capacious battery in everyday 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.270
 low-cost modes do not demonstrate 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.520
 significant competitive advantage 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.169
 but such advantages as practical 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.360
 quality display design 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.220
 high performance and useful 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.440
 branded features outweigh 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.030
 disadvantages officially smartphone on 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.030
