00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.780

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.360
 very good people here go mind 10 and in 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.710
 this time I bring you the trick of how 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.840
 get infinite help packages 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.730
 and good the only thing that we have to have 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.340
 it's a streak of casualties with two 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.190
 different packages 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.460
 this time he took part of help and 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.590
 card packages and well here state 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.750
 with my friend of 9 who was going to help me 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.390
 make the fruit 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.300
 and good we get ourselves streak like now 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.280
 I said and the only thing we have to do is 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.530
 launch one of the two packages when 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.510
 we have them near some stairs 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.420
 I for example launched an extra for kilos 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.430
 to show you light and good once 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.320
 drop the package has to fall very 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.540
 near the stair 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.220
 we put the other package in the hand 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.620
 We went up the stairs a little and we 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.500
 will let you take the package in this case the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.960
 turret and good press square 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.240
 nothing as you see we have others 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.520
 another very important package do not press 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.310
 here triangle or nothing simply 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.830
 return to throw the package near the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.680
 stairs and repeat again the 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.590
 procedure and good nothing more kids 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.500
 I hope everyone has liked it is always 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.570
 the same pull packages 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.340

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.800

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.270
