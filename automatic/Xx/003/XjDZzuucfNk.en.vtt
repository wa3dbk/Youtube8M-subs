00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 new york kids if we are today 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.970
 here with dance g 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.969
 today we are here and I do the techno file of 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.679
 booking that can be events but 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.540
 from the crow file having these 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.410
 disgusting that these mazzini 6 left 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.770
 20 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.970
 I wear stupid maxi and porto burgin 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.070
 obviously nothing is free the six 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.890
 body carries a frog type deck 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.130
 monk or go then obviously hate 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.280
 of three yamato because of the powder 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:39.719
 because otherwise we do not need only 200 turns 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.540
 unfortunately for him I always kazuki crisis 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.000
 re-enters when split a goal 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.390
 let's say double room and this paper a lot 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.020
 crisis because in 2000 often maybe you know 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.030
 already 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.199
 the shimano case instead fell into loved ones 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.030
 in Rome 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.860
 to me of game maybe you make new susa 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.500
 instead of playing, however, tenchi have 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.449
 called let's say it allows you to do 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.449
 of plays other than the classic 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.150
 played by linate in 100 loved ones e 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.790
 skulls go right for me here 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.880
 discs in the deck and he too will be up by 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:17.009
 exchilo type but it often happens to have 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.930
 mica tucci and ai rhum is in hand if for 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.530
 written down he doesn't make more paintings 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.220
 on the ground that the crisis and then there is 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.369
 these were the seen werner badges 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.229
 Exactly the fat people we talk about 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:37.770
 double hare educated other oil and mono 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:42.420
 here there are the motorbikes together 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.580
 to the other igloo and honest that even if the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.350
 mica list made second place 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.160
 not playing the game because football 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.200
 it's strong witch progression 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.890
 yes because if by chance something is turned 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.160
 that goes above the 36 maione back than not 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.500
 I see a kaka then spurs triple tanky 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:07.410
 obvious why all the scalpels are there and 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.730
 w999 sense best card of the back after the 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:14.370
 kaiser really too strong ie since 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.890
 you fear today then with the typhoons that 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.200
 disappear from the main now correct from 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.610
 too nagging is a pro negro then 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.370
 they come out of the strongest card ever 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.790
 of this incarnation deck really al 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.300
 top 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.050
 this one makes you overturn the games 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.840
 because cazzola makes susa new if 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.130
 then enters to start slaughtering at 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.440
 groove 48 exact double lance to make 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.140
 enter the beloved obviously launches that 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.360
 but the only card I would change 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:51.450
 bunch because now I see you maion I see 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.209
 always 2d first and I must say that almost me 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.220
 they are always yellow because they are good or 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.050
 bad he called me always and I have to 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.600
 say that it is the only card that will change by 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.070
 this way however in some situations I do 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.360
 I realize that really big ie 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.280
 when you say the stuff at the cemetery 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.390
 then throws big mind then huge until yes 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.780
 also play the four is really 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.550
 big and dark as well as being a bunch 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.530
 than to the many who do not leave 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.990
 prove on the ground always blame 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.400
 like trap if where I would crew 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.250
 a huge because bhaskar those that no 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.830
 however the scale can deny denies almost 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.760
 all wired cup always for the speech 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:37.320
 to let loved ones come in because they must enter 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.090
 if he could n't play double prison 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.920
 mainly for the hands because the 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.460
 let's say hands make you finish the targets 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.870
 namely that if the typical hand breaks you 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.870
 splits you loved enters that of 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.360
 ice and risk of finishing all the 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.460
 target that cemeteries denoted hares 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:01.120
 then presone better still persists 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:04.360
 what he wants the same is right but we are 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.910
 it also happens that the tacit type is fine 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.510
 mutters another braked not nameplate 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.570
 morava tip and finally their three non 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.250
 shell tournaments because as mentioned the deck 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.230
 let's say point to having own monsters on 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.330
 land usually one maximum two 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.010
 if you ca n't utic it appears of 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.930
 consequence that will drain you of the ground 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.760
 It's suicide because you always have to have it 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.090
 all muscles to paraculate otherwise 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:33.780
 in one day they pass from the former rec e 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:36.760
 precious new because they are three at 3 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.760
 now I'm playing 2 and I have to say that 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.250
 I don't do more than 2 per game though 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.590
 much I wrote that I do not often however a 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.240
 sometimes it happens I don't do it maybe 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.450
 third, however, having had the third 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.220
 in the extra it could have helped me 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.550
 young sense maybe even bond 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.530
 via do you make all of the revenues 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.040
 of tea bold tricks to succeed in 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.760
 maybe close with using cagnucci 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.350
 never done that you rarely on which I 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:11.620
 you do me when the four cases have 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:14.290
 so you lose from shovel dynamo omega per 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:19.420
 those who light an action for you 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:20.539
 big he because bank imola tenchi one 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.410
 o one 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:28.800
 that sucks spider to 0 racing against type 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:32.639
 mirror match and then we see policy of 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.990
 we have and we toned cowboys to close 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.190
 the games 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:42.900
 duella the amazing miur match but it is 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.280
 The diamond air strokes are work silionos 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.410
 maybe I don't know 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.060
 you will never do it, however, local grandfather 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.449
 never however acting one of them the two 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:54.979
 I would take away for the third day 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:06:01.229
 I decided to get well but know it 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:03.180
 from the bush wing to file and that as I have 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:06.680
 said then 36 but so much the video the minutes 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.810
 after the said then attached to the office 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.970
 having said that it is used by avena bella j 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.340
 and we see in the stage that the bcb is not 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.340
 there is etc. 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.340
 Hello
