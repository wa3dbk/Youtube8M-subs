00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:07.530
 It's really good evening , Grace 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.400
 In Goi live a long time 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.650
 I 'm putting on a fire for a long time 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.950
 Ne 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.310
 I think that I want to do without p 4 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:23.279
 No 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.370
 Here in yesterday's video I used to talk about what an ideal secret tool is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.289
 Ne various comments were made 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:33.540
 First there are many white boxes 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.720
 Well, for example, I am worried about it at the letter box people and their bidder is I had kind of a ne 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.329
 but 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:43.579
 Certainly sound and letter box may be good, but even if it is ぇ 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.450
 Cherry blossoms that will eventually create a fantasy world 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:52.700
 It is good if it is really good 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.110
 Really a character, for example, Do the will of the Tteyuu the Usohonto When was Toka want to girlfriend 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.100
 Maybe is better to use the 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:04.199
 Because it will be a lie if you use that 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:09.200
 For example, I'm to become that dated it to say Tatte not going out with plump Mr. 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.140
 After all, Mr. Marumaru likes him if he hates me and likes it 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.180
 It can even clogging Ariatsuito that I was 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.060
 Hmmm Indic's 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.320
 There like a do 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:24.170
 All things that become real 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.170
 That kind of ability like that guy is about a series of electric 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.790
 That's really a cheat, then ankipan 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.490
 Hey There was also Ankipan 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.790
 Certainly Anne period is wonderful 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.000
 I can not afford the bell of the chest 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.170
 But there is of sound weakness is not 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.430
 that 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.710
 I'm sorry 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.659
 Well Nde forget save memorize to 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.969
 So 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.840
 It's nice to eat too much for a long time and have no sense at all 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.289
 Say 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.289
 It is a tool 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.490
 Along 4 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.470
 Because there was something 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.780
 Jack Robinson is 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.600
 4 free pottery nuts so yes 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:18.240
 It is a Takecopter 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:21.990
 Certainly Takecopter is good, but if it is fast phobia it is that 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.010
 Very I guess flying how do I there or say horrible things 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.010
 Put on the head-chan 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.060
 How are you going to change direction or not? 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.410
 I do not know 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.380
 I do not yet know what the principle is 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.600
 Is there such people always 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.710
 The flowers will not wither 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.710
 What is it? 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.480
 Hey, it would be what what 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.409
 I wonder if there was something in the way 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.780
 That's it 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.780
 Something 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.230
 How many 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.709

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.280
 Rail tool and what Nari, for example, the other party if they feel about the fact of their own 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.970

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.480

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.710
 To that party 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:22.060
 This to say in fact that I think anything I said 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.569
 There is such a tool if it can be said that the machine is not the other party 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.750
 But I'm say 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.430

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.120
 The other party 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.970
 The most favorite thing you can do is answer it 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.860
 You can also do a post 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:43.530
