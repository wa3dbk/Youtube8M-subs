00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
fact it's actually kind of clunky and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.040 
fact it's actually kind of clunky and
can<00:00:59.160> be<00:00:59.280> very<00:00:59.430> frustrating<00:00:59.699> at<00:01:00.180> times<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.930> this

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
can be very frustrating at times so this

now I didn't use it on this playthrough
but<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.360> my<00:02:34.900> first<00:02:35.140> playthrough<00:02:35.410> there's<00:02:36.160> like

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
but on my first playthrough there's like

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.170 
but on my first playthrough there's like
a<00:02:36.370> fire<00:02:36.730> pit<00:02:37.090> down<00:02:37.270> below<00:02:37.690> or<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:39.180> the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
a fire pit down below or and the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.000 
a fire pit down below or and the
developer<00:02:40.600> told<00:02:40.840> me<00:02:41.020> that<00:02:41.230> if<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.530> shoot<00:02:41.769> that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
developer told me that if you shoot that

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.650 
developer told me that if you shoot that
with<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.280> hose<00:02:42.580> if<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.000> shoot<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.269> fire<00:02:43.420> pit

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
with the hose if you shoot the fire pit

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.940 
with the hose if you shoot the fire pit
I<00:02:43.780> should<00:02:43.959> have<00:02:44.050> shot<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.320> fire<00:02:44.620> pit<00:02:44.830> with<00:02:44.860> a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
I should have shot the fire pit with a

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.670 
I should have shot the fire pit with a
hallucinogenic<00:02:45.400> dart<00:02:45.850> not<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.810> guy<00:02:46.959> itself

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
hallucinogenic dart not the guy itself

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.400 
hallucinogenic dart not the guy itself
because<00:02:48.489> one<00:02:49.209> who's<00:02:49.510> into<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.930> dart<00:02:50.170> in<00:02:50.350> the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
because one who's into that dart in the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.250 
because one who's into that dart in the
fire<00:02:50.860> explodes<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.060> infects<00:02:52.600> everybody

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
fire explodes and infects everybody

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.550 
fire explodes and infects everybody
around<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.860> so<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.750> hallucinogenic<00:02:56.230> dart

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
around it so the hallucinogenic dart

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.610 
around it so the hallucinogenic dart
you've<00:02:56.769> used<00:02:57.550> that<00:02:57.670> before<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:58.390> think<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.440> used

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
you've used that before I think you used

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.410 
you've used that before I think you used
that<00:02:59.739> before<00:02:59.920> an<00:03:00.280> assassin's<00:03:00.730> creed<00:03:01.000> maybe

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
that before an assassin's creed maybe

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.759 
that before an assassin's creed maybe
I'm<00:03:01.569> confusing<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.140> with<00:03:02.170> far<00:03:02.410> cry<00:03:02.620> or

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
I'm confusing it with far cry or

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.090 
I'm confusing it with far cry or
something<00:03:03.040> like<00:03:03.130> that<00:03:03.190> anyway<00:03:04.180> um<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:06.010> know

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
something like that anyway um you know

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.920 
something like that anyway um you know
what<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.280> does<00:03:06.400> like<00:03:06.610> it<00:03:06.760> confuses<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.780> guys

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
what it does like it confuses the guys

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.479 
what it does like it confuses the guys
into<00:03:08.230> attacking<00:03:08.560> each<00:03:08.800> other<00:03:08.950> instead<00:03:09.310> of

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
into attacking each other instead of

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.470 
into attacking each other instead of
protecting<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.450> they're<00:03:10.900> true<00:03:11.110> enemy<00:03:11.410> and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
protecting you they're true enemy and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.539 
protecting you they're true enemy and
you<00:03:13.480> know<00:03:13.570> despite<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.650> clunkiness<00:03:15.100> of<00:03:15.459> the

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
you know despite the clunkiness of the

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.410 
you know despite the clunkiness of the
Rope<00:03:15.760> launcher<00:03:16.829> it's<00:03:17.829> really<00:03:18.400> freaking<00:03:18.880> fun<00:03:19.180> I

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
Rope launcher it's really freaking fun I

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.850 
Rope launcher it's really freaking fun I
hope<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.930> they<00:03:20.049> tweaked<00:03:20.380> out<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.560> little<00:03:20.709> bit

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
hope that they tweaked out a little bit

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.259 
hope that they tweaked out a little bit
so<00:03:21.040> it's<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.220> little<00:03:21.340> bit<00:03:21.430> oh<00:03:21.640> my<00:03:21.850> god<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.180> guy

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
so it's a little bit oh my god that guy

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.729 
so it's a little bit oh my god that guy
just<00:03:22.299> want<00:03:22.600> a<00:03:22.660> rag<00:03:22.840> doll<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.320> punched<00:03:23.650> him

just want a rag doll and I punched him
to<00:03:23.829> death<00:03:23.980> I<00:03:24.190> hope<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.120> they<00:03:25.239> tweaked<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.720> a

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
to death I hope that they tweaked it a

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.600 
to death I hope that they tweaked it a
little<00:03:25.810> bit<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:26.680> it's<00:03:26.890> easier<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.340> aim

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
little bit so that it's easier to aim

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.960 
little bit so that it's easier to aim
because<00:03:28.209> in<00:03:28.680> situations<00:03:29.680> where<00:03:30.040> there<00:03:30.790> are

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
because in situations where there are

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.610
