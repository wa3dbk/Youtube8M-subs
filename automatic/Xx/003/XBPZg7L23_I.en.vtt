 of kms peak the most 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:35.390
 because the president is one and that 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:40.060
 we can decide how to install windows 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.310

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.070
 system of appeared a thing here must 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.490
 say bullying not from 1600 windows but 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.880
 good is to say web once you already 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.320
 download 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.300

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.510
 unzip it 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.930
 but a little bit that is loading 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.410
 voucher worth voucher there is what they have 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:18.060
 what to do is go is when you downloaded 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.060
 towards me it will be downloads 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.830
 extract here with extract here 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:34.470
 good once it is 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.470
 they put this run as administrator 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.130
 one that run it with itself no longer 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.550
 a car appears 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.550
 put nets 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.290
 I agree 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.470
 nets 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.410
 next 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.410
 and it's going to start installing kms and pico 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.660
 of windows 8.1 pro 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.660
 well let's wait for him to load 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.350
 the installation is being finalized 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:22.280
 next media and I will teach 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.430
 how to download and install windows from 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:30.200
 zero plus the trigger in this video 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:34.340
 recent today starting with that good a 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.390
 once the installation is finished and that 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.940
 I hope it ends I see you finished 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:46.370
 installation places 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:48.090
 well this what they have to do is 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.300
 here 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.680
 they have to look for the peak kms they have to 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.400
 look for it 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:02.790
 every living being with that peak peak 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:09.439
 here this is here that peak this is 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.439
 good what they put what they put him 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.750
 but in what is beginning 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.880
 I have in mind 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.910
 come back 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.200
 like every tube that carries here here this 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.720
 button 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.940
 the good hitch you what they have 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.820
 what to do is press the button he is going 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.470
 order inside of the ojito as well and a 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.710
 Once finished, they will leave here 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.700
 of month and good peak once they are made 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.940
 that's already activated windows 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:52.030
 Good closure in the program is not 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.300
 and also obviously because if not if not 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.990
 windows is going to that city 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:03.060
 total the file is not heavy, it weighs nothing 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.060
 it weighs a worst-case means close 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:07.279
 the best known to verify that 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:10.479
 windows is activated what you have to 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:10.479
 right click system 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.830
 and here is going to say to windows is 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.680
 activated 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.850
 since it is already activated it is activated and 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.660
 You can use it with all 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:26.260
 characteristics and good that was all 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.030
