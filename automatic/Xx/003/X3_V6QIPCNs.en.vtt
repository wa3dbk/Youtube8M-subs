iPod icon in the tree and you'll also
see<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.939> up<00:00:30.060> top<00:00:30.269> here<00:00:31.189> so<00:00:32.189> what<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.489> want<00:00:32.640> to

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
see it up top here so what you want to

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.030 
see it up top here so what you want to
do<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.090> going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> click<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:34.050> node

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
do is I'm going to click on that node

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.370 
do is I'm going to click on that node
there<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.700> tree<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.110> tracks

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
there in the tree so that the tracks

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.670 
there in the tree so that the tracks
come<00:00:37.649> up<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.870> depending<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:39.960> how<00:00:40.200> large<00:00:40.530> your

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
come up and depending on how large your

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.860 
come up and depending on how large your
device<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.309> it's<00:00:41.550> going<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.760> take<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.210> while<00:00:42.840> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
device is it's going to take a while to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.830 
device is it's going to take a while to
load<00:00:43.079> you'll<00:00:44.070> see<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.610> little<00:00:45.120> reading<00:00:45.420> tracks

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
load you'll see a little reading tracks

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.959 
load you'll see a little reading tracks
down<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> bottom<00:00:46.559> there<00:00:46.770> mine<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.700> loading

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
down the bottom there mine is loading

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.639 
down the bottom there mine is loading
relatively<00:00:48.450> fast<00:00:48.719> because<00:00:49.079> I've<00:00:49.200> only<00:00:49.350> got<00:00:49.620> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
relatively fast because I've only got a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.270 
relatively fast because I've only got a
16<00:00:50.370> gigabyte<00:00:50.610> iPhone<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:51.890> but<00:00:52.890> obviously

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
16 gigabyte iPhone here but obviously

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.299 
16 gigabyte iPhone here but obviously
something<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.239> 160<00:00:54.750> gigabyte<00:00:55.559> iPhone<00:00:56.039> or

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
something like 160 gigabyte iPhone or

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.689 
something like 160 gigabyte iPhone or
iPod<00:00:56.809> will<00:00:57.809> take<00:00:57.989> much<00:00:58.199> longer<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.739> load<00:00:58.949> in

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
iPod will take much longer to load in

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.910 
iPod will take much longer to load in
that<00:00:59.820> case<00:01:00.090> if<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.329> only<00:01:00.510> want<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.780> track<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
that case if you only want to track do a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.650 
that case if you only want to track do a
certain<00:01:02.309> subset<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.730> tracks<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.300> find

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
certain subset of tracks you can find

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.590 
certain subset of tracks you can find
them<00:01:03.840> using<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> playlists<00:01:05.600> denominations

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
them using the playlists denominations

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.750 
them using the playlists denominations
or<00:01:06.869> certain<00:01:07.229> by<00:01:07.320> certain<00:01:07.680> artists<00:01:07.979> by

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
or certain by certain artists by

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.160 
or certain by certain artists by
navigating<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.390> tray<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.930> course

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
navigating the tray and of course

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.870 
navigating the tray and of course
there's<00:01:10.650> less<00:01:10.890> tracks<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.580> they<00:01:11.670> load

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
there's less tracks there so they load

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.870 
there's less tracks there so they load
up<00:01:12.000> much<00:01:12.150> quicker<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:15.229> what<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.350> want<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> do

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
up much quicker so what you want to do

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.370 
up much quicker so what you want to do
is<00:01:17.880> find<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> tracks<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.020> want<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> copy

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
is find the tracks that you want to copy

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.499 
is find the tracks that you want to copy
back<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.549> imagine<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> lot<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.240> cases

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
back and I imagine in a lot of cases

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.990 
back and I imagine in a lot of cases
people<00:01:22.049> are<00:01:22.560> using<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.100> as<00:01:23.220> some<00:01:23.729> sort<00:01:23.880> of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
people are using it as some sort of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.520 
people are using it as some sort of
backup<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.570> go<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.960> want<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.290> all<00:01:25.500> of
