 the internet that's what i do with everything 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.690
 With this, throw out something or seal the camera

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.820
 like using a condom 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.369
 against aids it might work 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.440
 for a short while but you won't get to the disease 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.780
 and the disease is snooping approved and 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.149
 US government systems exist 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.370
 able to turn on the microphone and camera 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.470
 that is, shoot and listen to even an interview 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.850
 according to edward snowden only in 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.110
 March of this year, the agency for 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.110
 national security usa 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.420
 intercepted 97 billion messages in 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.299
 computer networks around the world and 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.290

 13 and a half billion in pakistan 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.459
 a list of endless play at the United 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.769
 states there are tremendous opportunities when 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.810
 it comes to intelligence as well as ours 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.209
 military potential is significantly greater than 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.519
 in many other countries and although we have 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.860
 perhaps we have similar goals 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.900
 I have a lot of money here 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.850

 For my family, this information is available. 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.700
 nb now this minute of him i suppose 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.769
 what yes we don't know what exactly corporation 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.290
 sends vnb but they have your 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.060
 contacts in the mail text messages 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.400
 maybe they don't have this 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.269
 information now but get it as 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.000
 only want 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.430
 every time you buy a smartphone and 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.890
 enter there your personal address data 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.650
 they are already associated with this device 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.690
 there are emergency schemes with you 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.579
 which saury and a and b can track 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.769
