00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hi girls, how are you? 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.400
 Here to make a makeup for you. 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.070
 To school, college is a good makeup. 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.950
 I feel like I'm using the box and that's it. 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.509
 here comes with me then girls the first 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.960
 Which I'm using in the morning. 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.240
 I do not know and that's what it's called but the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.010
 l'orÃ©al is to diminish solved lira 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.570
 sector for a week so I do not know if 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.119
 It is very good but it has given some result already 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.099
 I can see a little difference and I 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.250
 I really liked it 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:44.160
 so it is very easy to apply on the face in the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:47.070
 the threshold know just so I step before 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.980
 in the morning and I'll do it 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.180
 circular movements 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.399
 so all over the face 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.760
 then I hope to get a little bit so 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.170
 my protector who is super important 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.960
 so I let it dry a little 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:12.920
 product here and I'm spending more homes 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.920
 across the face passing 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.329
 so you pass the protector that is super 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.030
 important 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.509
 I'm going to pass this palm clip to 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.509
 lips 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.720
 after passing the lip balm I go 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.060
 to go to the corrective is I'm not 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.789
 using micro in base can not use to 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.280
 school because I think the bar is well 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.500
 weigh quite heavy but if you like 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.569
 you feel more comfortable can 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.179
 I would highly recommend ibccrim which is a 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.819
 coverage and does not show as much 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:05.009
 but I'm passing the corrective even in the 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:13.220
 my spots on the solemn appeal with 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:13.220
 brush and I'm spreading it by beating 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.890
 normal can think a little bit if in the 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.890
 area 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.069
 good in this collective is that it sticks 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:31.790
 enough he did not know that one it lasts 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.790
 very 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.120
 so you can not beat it in the morning 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:46.220
 is corrective in the dark circles are exaggerated 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:53.420
 people do here on the faces here giving 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:58.350
 collective tapping passes spotting 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.829
 Yes, from the nose, a little, well. 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.829
 Light 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.130
 and ready the collective part is great 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.520
 You just take a look and it's now 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.290
 to stay with him and to hold more and 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.500
 I'm going to spend a little time at the Kremlin 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.900
 supernatural so easy with brush 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:26.160
 which is easier to pass in the area 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:29.310
 under the eye and now I'm going to 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.400
 blush I think in the morning it's super cute 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.110
 pass a little witch just to give an air of 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.110
 healthy so I'll spend it here given 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.610
 in totti blush color 1 07 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.980
 He is not strong. He is the same color. 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:55.920
 healthy so I adore then do so was 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:04:02.870
 spreading also spreading in neutral 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:05.850
 in beautiful some people like to spend 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:12.440
 contour around the face is I not 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:12.440
 I really like it, but I'm going to do it today just to 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.590
 a difference 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:26.650
 control here 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:30.310
 And oh my, get that lipstick here from dailus to 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:34.810
 color does not have the color is a beautiful color and I 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:37.140
 apply with your finger to stay very soft 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.140
 yea 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.380
 so that's right now I'll spend one 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.060
 mascara 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.240
 So I'll spend a little bit just to 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:59.240
 show that I exaggerated a lot then only 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:01.130
 learn more the look is a step well on the way 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.570
 nor pass down to show that it is 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:09.010
 more natural 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:09.010
 only that up groom comes back to facilitate that 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.540
 I had so I'm going to put a shadow on the 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.960
 concave is a very neutral brown shade 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.330
 even so this is f your taste you 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.000
 I do not like it, I do not do it everyday. 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:31.160
 Let's make it very simple, even I'm 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.500
 doing only just a few things 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.500
 very neutral that does not make much difference 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:48.880
 then it is quiet then I do well sensuous 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:48.880
 with brown shadow fingers 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:56.540
 so if you want to also put a 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.210
 shade that does not sing in each 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.550
 look also 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.460
 so girls I loved that it stayed like this on 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.950
 neutral 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.020
 I use makeup like this and have a day. 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.620
 I did not even hear so much that it was 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.710
 shadow and the singer I do in a house 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.770
 very fast and also when I'm past 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:21.710

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.740
