00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.270 
biggest thing that I hate on this game
it<00:03:21.599> is<00:03:21.690> something<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.590> think<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.980> gay

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
breaking like it really is a broken

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.940 
breaking like it really is a broken
mechanic<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.730> they<00:03:26.910> put<00:03:27.120> in<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:27.329> game<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.720> I

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
mechanic that they put in this game it I

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.259 
mechanic that they put in this game it I
don't<00:03:28.950> like<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.099> whatsoever<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:29.880> basically

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
don't like it whatsoever so basically

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.879 
don't like it whatsoever so basically
I've<00:03:30.510> talked<00:03:30.810> about<00:03:31.019> suppression<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.530> lot<00:03:31.739> of

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
I've talked about suppression a lot of

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.129 
I've talked about suppression a lot of
competition<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.400> really<00:03:32.639> never<00:03:32.730> got<00:03:33.000> really<00:03:33.989> in

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
competition I really never got really in

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.009 
competition I really never got really in
depth<00:03:34.440> or<00:03:34.620> how<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:35.280> works<00:03:35.489> but<00:03:35.730> basically<00:03:36.150> what

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
depth or how it works but basically what

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.539 
depth or how it works but basically what
suppression<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:37.829> where<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.069> shoot<00:03:38.310> that's

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
suppression is is where you shoot that's

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.990 
suppression is is where you shoot that's
the<00:03:38.639> work<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:40.049> know<00:03:40.829> if<00:03:41.190> you're<00:03:41.340> if<00:03:41.639> you<00:03:41.819> shoot

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
the work and know if you're if you shoot

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.729 
the work and know if you're if you shoot
that<00:03:42.060> somewhere<00:03:42.480> what<00:03:42.660> happens<00:03:42.989> is<00:03:43.169> when

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
that somewhere what happens is when

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.680 
that somewhere what happens is when
they're<00:03:43.859> getting<00:03:43.950> shot<00:03:44.310> at<00:03:44.489> your<00:03:45.239> bullets

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
they're getting shot at your bullets

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.839 
they're getting shot at your bullets
make<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.349> makes<00:03:46.709> their<00:03:46.919> screen<00:03:47.220> at<00:03:47.400> all<00:03:47.459> blurry

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
make it makes their screen at all blurry

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.490 
make it makes their screen at all blurry
and<00:03:48.000> stuff<00:03:48.239> like<00:03:48.389> that<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.959> causes<00:03:49.200> their

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
and stuff like that and it causes their

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.379 
and stuff like that and it causes their
bullets<00:03:49.829> to<00:03:49.950> miss<00:03:50.099> maybe<00:03:50.310> even<00:03:50.579> aim<00:03:50.910> right<00:03:51.120> on

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
bullets to miss maybe even aim right on

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.210 
bullets to miss maybe even aim right on
you<00:03:51.569> hit<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.870> was<00:03:51.989> still<00:03:52.200> big<00:03:52.440> thing<00:03:52.709> your

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
you hit it was still big thing your

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.680 
you hit it was still big thing your
bullets<00:03:53.549> go<00:03:53.730> all<00:03:53.970> over<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.209> place<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.630> that

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
bullets go all over the place and that

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.670 
bullets go all over the place and that
is<00:03:54.989> something<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.379> I<00:03:55.530> don't<00:03:55.859> like<00:03:56.040> because<00:03:56.280> I

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
is something that I don't like because I

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.960 
is something that I don't like because I
lose<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.709> lot<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:58.980> gunfights<00:03:59.489> that<00:03:59.639> I<00:03:59.700> should

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.490 
lose a lot of gunfights that I should
lose<00:04:00.180> this<00:04:00.450> times<00:04:00.750> what<00:04:00.930> I've<00:04:01.019> actually<00:04:01.200> aimed

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
right out of like I have a name but I

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.940 
right out of like I have a name but I
don't<00:04:06.569> know<00:04:06.660> why<00:04:06.750> would<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:06.989> hit<00:04:07.169> them<00:04:07.349> and<00:04:07.500> he

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
don't know why would I hit them and he

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.039 
don't know why would I hit them and he
just<00:04:08.220> likes<00:04:08.430> me<00:04:08.519> up<00:04:08.699> and<00:04:08.849> kills<00:04:09.030> me<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.389> it's

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
just likes me up and kills me and it's

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.960 
just likes me up and kills me and it's
all<00:04:10.230> because<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.560> suppression<00:04:10.980> now<00:04:11.790> the

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
all because of suppression now the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.000 
all because of suppression now the
reason<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.389> think<00:04:12.660> it<00:04:12.750> needs<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.959> be<00:04:13.079> removed<00:04:13.470> is

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
reason I think it needs to be removed is

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.830 
reason I think it needs to be removed is
because

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
because

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.979 
because
you're<00:04:16.530> basically<00:04:16.799> making<00:04:17.430> me<00:04:18.389> lose<00:04:18.660> gun

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
you're basically making me lose gun

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.500 
you're basically making me lose gun
fights<00:04:19.290> not<00:04:20.250> because<00:04:20.280> of<00:04:20.609> my<00:04:20.820> skill<00:04:21.209> or<00:04:21.389> not

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
fights not because of my skill or not

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.390 
fights not because of my skill or not
because<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.810> bad<00:04:22.049> ain't<00:04:22.350> but<00:04:22.650> because<00:04:22.980> of<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.160> bad

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
because a bad ain't but because of a bad

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.420 
because a bad ain't but because of a bad
mechanic<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.360> it's<00:04:25.350> frustrating<00:04:25.919> like<00:04:26.190> I

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
mechanic and it's frustrating like I

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.430 
mechanic and it's frustrating like I
could<00:04:26.880> have<00:04:27.000> set<00:04:27.240> diet<00:04:27.690> from<00:04:27.900> me<00:04:28.080> have<00:04:28.410> a

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
could have set diet from me have a

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.409 
could have set diet from me have a
