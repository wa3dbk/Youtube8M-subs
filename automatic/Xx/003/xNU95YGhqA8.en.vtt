and uses a clincher to bend the rest of

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.080 
and uses a clincher to bend the rest of
the<00:02:11.050> nail<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.010> almost<00:02:12.280> flush<00:02:12.580> with<00:02:13.000> the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
the nail so it is almost flush with the

finally<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.540> farrier<00:02:25.870> uses<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> rasp<00:02:26.590> which<00:02:27.100> is

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
finally the farrier uses a rasp which is

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.640 
finally the farrier uses a rasp which is
a<00:02:27.280> large<00:02:27.520> file<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:28.540> smooth<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.990> edge<00:02:29.110> where<00:02:29.560> it

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
a large file to smooth the edge where it

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.770 
a large file to smooth the edge where it
meets<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.010> shoe<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.400> eliminate<00:02:31.180> any<00:02:31.390> sharp

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
meets the shoe and eliminate any sharp

00:02:31.780 --> 00:03:23.460 
meets the shoe and eliminate any sharp
edges

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.290 

the<00:03:24.220> hooves<00:03:24.430> are<00:03:24.610> then<00:03:24.700> given<00:03:24.850> a<00:03:25.030> final

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
the hooves are then given a final

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.340 
the hooves are then given a final
rubdown<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.020> it's<00:03:26.740> job<00:03:27.070> done
