00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:19.300
 go and wit me and around the talk about 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:21.370
 3dprinting and digital got the point 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.350
 at home the presentation is about us 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.850
 you and me here i would be myself 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.890
 to introduce 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.330
 then i will tell about me in 3d 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:34.390
 printing and nice yes then I would tell 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.890
 about 3d printing and digital creation and 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.699
 finally I say what you can do 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.179
 with digital creation we before we 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:53.019
 to start 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:58.030
 knows someone where 3D printing is 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:01:00.339
 you make something on the computer and the 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.289
 chase the printer rita layer by layer 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.839
 up and then get it 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.740
 yes the model where you are on the computer 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.890
 have made who am i i was born 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.570
 in 2000 and computers the digital things 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.450
 existed before I visited 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.340
 so i'm a digital motive in with that 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.340
 of nature is familiar with digital things 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.890
 I participated in t rex kitten brussels 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.630
 the first time I have the Brussels shoot 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.689
 I participated and the theme was there 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.250
 meekers a bath 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.920
 jordy Speel came to do a workshop 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.140
 about 3d printing leon interesting 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.320
 machines that make something on your computer 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.820
 intake go print the most important thing 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.009
 there was that you should not be afraid of 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.130
 to fail and that you had to learn from you 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.929
 errors and thirds 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.909
 after work shooting the Brussels I 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.649
 actively help with derek you at 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.539
 flanders 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.439
 not only me but also my sister and my 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:03.130
 father now i will tell about me and 3d 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:05.560
 print in terms don't think this brussel 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.630
 the new york play a workshop 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.330
 done about 3d printing when the mouse became 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.980
 He had to hit a whole team in 3D 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.830
 simple website block by block 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.380
 nothing to build 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.390
 I had it again there is nothing with my 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.840
 name on it so I thought warm no glasses 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.840
 with your name 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.090
 the glasses became so famous that is like in 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.090
 lucca was delayed 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.650
 after i had the glasses design was free 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.570
 making it easy for the things and 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.000
 better apps come and go 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.870
 websites that allow you to do it 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.180
 like old men did in cat 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.040
 bitten by 4 so that my dad soon 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.690
 purchased a 3d printer 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.030
 it makes you a lot of noise and printed 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.310
 only 10 centimeters to ten centimeters 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.050
 ten centimeters but ten out of ten 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.170
 ten is enough room for a lot 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.580
 nice things after ten out of ten out of ten 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.980
 was not enough anymore 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.630
 have bought a larger 25 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.790
 twenty-five or thirty would be great 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.610
 enough and two printhead one 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.970
 do more complex things 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.980
 Huntley 3d prints this on rain for 3d 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.930
 printer to wash the world was whole 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.390
 different if you designed something on the 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.980
 computer then the computer remained as 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.780
 I wanted to bring this to the real world 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.310
 true that machines that make a lot of money 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.170
 cost 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.750
 3d printer was for a small group 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.760
 people who can do light with 3d printing 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:43.380
 you design something on the computer and in 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:46.270
 any size print 3d printing 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.770
 compared to music 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.140
 There are three types of people in this 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.100
 90% of the world 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.560
 consumers 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.720
 people who won't listen to that 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.300
 youtube or on itunes 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.520
 Then there are mash-ups people who have two 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.610
 make existing songs about and and elly 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.790
 grab and make a new song then there are 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.260
 also creators who make and do 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.260
 the trouble to make their own music 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.520
 3d printing compared to three 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.370
 digital creation compared to 3d 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.220
 Note there are people who are going to 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.980
 10 you take care of it and not something like it 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.230
 printing what the feeling are there 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:30.020
 mash-ups too yes 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.120
 you want par2 files things again 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.830
 hired and sticks them together 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.180
 this is a good example of my robot 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.520
 9 out of three 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.770
 3d systems that allows you to create your own 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.180
 to make a robot 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.000
 well there is one then there are also creators 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:54.580
 touching his things 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:54.580
 but if you look closely, even further 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.780
 much more 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.750
 yes if you look closely at this smell and 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.840
 the size of these boxes are the 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:12.260
 creators and the mashups much larger 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.780
 why because 3d printing and very cheap 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.880
 is and is easy 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.880
 he is not alone you can make something 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.990
 take the man on the example as an example 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.960
 previous slide that played music in his 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.540
 francisco on his ipad no guitar no 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:40.970
 trips no music lessons just an app 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:42.170
 from 15 euros and creativity digitally 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.940
 creation in you 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.720
 july 3 3d printing something easy and 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.990
 cheap 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.290
 There are very many 3D models online you 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.910
 can share money from this with others and 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.240
 they can let their ideas go 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.240
 to go 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.840
 there are very easy mash-up tools and 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.660
 also very easy 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.560
 you dress and you don't have a printer 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.970
 required 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.970
 all you need is an idea 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.000
 so my conclusion is start with 3d 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.900
 now print that your teacher doesn't 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.510
 says how to do it 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.770
 now that there are no rules break with 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:27.050
 conventions are not impossible ideas 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.000
 you can share a week with others and them 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.910
 can unleash their ideas 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.390
 we can make a tweet elspeet 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.160
 with 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:38.980
 pressed knife not only for 3d 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.980
 but we print for all photos, music 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.010
 special thanks to joris bio and then time 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.190
 to open the doors then to new world 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:52.780
 that matter journey around my glasses 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.780
 digitally into reality 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.290
 jason loops to show me that 3d 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.150
 printing and digital creation in the 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.150
 film industry very often the report 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.440
 shot something like that to show that 3d 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:09.290
 people can live a better life 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.170
 and the 3d design is very important 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:14.210
 that we autodesk gallery for a whole 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:17.240
 Wide image for 3D printing can 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:20.660
 be used of luxury watches or 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.550
 electric racing cars and then as a chau 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.220
 to show that you like your creations 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:28.250
 preferably as long as long as possible 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.990
 digital wood and because there the cool one 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.760
 things happen 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.900
 think here for your attention and start 

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.900
 with digital creation now
