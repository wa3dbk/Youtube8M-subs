said<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.520> numerous<00:00:41.730> times<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.420> my<00:00:42.629> channel

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.200 
said this numerous times on my channel
but<00:00:43.110> I'll<00:00:43.200> say<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.469> again<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.340> extremely

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
but I'll say it again it is extremely

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.240

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
for a number of different reasons

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.840 
for a number of different reasons
primarily<00:00:49.230> because<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.370> game<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.700> just

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
primarily because the game is just

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.700 
primarily because the game is just
easier<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.270> more<00:00:51.570> fun<00:00:51.629> when<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.559> a

swarms<00:01:48.930> got<00:01:49.170> me<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> combined<00:01:49.979> 19<00:01:50.369> kills<00:01:50.610> and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
swarms got me a combined 19 kills and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.030 
swarms got me a combined 19 kills and
then<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.210> had<00:01:51.509> four<00:01:51.810> escort<00:01:52.259> drones<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.799> only

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
then I had four escort drones that only

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.670 
then I had four escort drones that only
got<00:01:53.340> me<00:01:53.520> three<00:01:54.119> kills<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.810> thought<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.530> was

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
got me three kills I thought that was

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.130 
got me three kills I thought that was
pretty<00:01:55.950> crazy<00:01:56.340> normally<00:01:56.880> escort<00:01:57.270> drones<00:01:57.479> are

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
pretty crazy normally escort drones are

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.480 
pretty crazy normally escort drones are
good<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.860> normally<00:01:59.280> they're<00:01:59.460> a

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
good you know you normally they're a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.459 
good you know you normally they're a
really<00:02:00.210> good<00:02:00.390> score<00:02:00.630> straight<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.079> since<00:02:01.320> we

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
really good score straight but since we

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.170 
really good score straight but since we
had<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.770> much<00:02:01.920> other<00:02:02.159> score<00:02:02.579> streaks<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.030> V

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
had so much other score streaks and V

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.300 
had so much other score streaks and V

me<00:02:23.780> lots<00:02:24.470> of<00:02:24.620> easy<00:02:24.799> kills<00:02:25.129> here<00:02:25.370> especially<00:02:25.640> in

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
me lots of easy kills here especially in

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.360 
me lots of easy kills here especially in
the<00:02:26.060> second<00:02:26.330> round<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:27.200> 22<00:02:27.739> kills<00:02:27.980> with<00:02:28.220> these

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
the second round so 22 kills with these

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.699 
the second round so 22 kills with these
scores<00:02:28.610> streets<00:02:28.849> and<00:02:29.030> then<00:02:29.120> an<00:02:29.420> additional<00:02:29.720> 97

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.589 
kills with my gun for a total of 119
kills<00:02:33.860> in<00:02:34.099> this<00:02:34.370> game<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.849> thought<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.480> was

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
kills in this game I thought that was

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.360 
kills in this game I thought that was
kind<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.870> interesting<00:02:36.349> normally<00:02:36.739> when<00:02:37.250> you

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
kind of interesting normally when you

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.250 
kind of interesting normally when you
watch<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.879> 100-plus<00:02:38.510> game<00:02:38.780> played<00:02:39.079> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
watch a 100-plus game played the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.020 
watch a 100-plus game played the
majority<00:02:39.379> of<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.860> kills<00:02:40.069> come<00:02:40.340> from<00:02:40.610> the

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
majority of the kills come from the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.759 
majority of the kills come from the
scores<00:02:41.390> race<00:02:41.629> or<00:02:41.780> kill<00:02:42.019> streaks<00:02:42.260> but<00:02:42.500> I

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
scores race or kill streaks but I

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.199 
scores race or kill streaks but I
managed<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.250> pull<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:43.489> off<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.909> other<00:02:44.060> way

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
managed to pull it off the other way

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.670 
managed to pull it off the other way
around<00:02:44.329> so<00:02:44.599> I<00:02:44.690> thought<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.049> was<00:02:45.170> pretty<00:02:45.349> cool

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
around so I thought that was pretty cool

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.410 
around so I thought that was pretty cool
speaking<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.519> score<00:02:46.730> streaks<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.090> went<00:02:47.299> with

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
speaking of score streaks I went with

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.210 
speaking of score streaks I went with
the<00:02:47.510> VSAT<00:02:47.900> escort<00:02:48.319> drone<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:48.620> swarm<00:02:48.920> like<00:02:49.099> I

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
the VSAT escort drone and swarm like I

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.039 
the VSAT escort drone and swarm like I
mentioned<00:02:49.640> because<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.239> wanted<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.629> get<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.810> lot

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
mentioned because I wanted to get a lot

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.900 
mentioned because I wanted to get a lot
of<00:02:51.200> kills<00:02:51.410> obviously<00:02:51.950> but<00:02:52.340> at<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.489> same<00:02:52.700> time

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
of kills obviously but at the same time

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.640 
of kills obviously but at the same time
I<00:02:53.030> did<00:02:53.180> not<00:02:53.329> want<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.569> die<00:02:53.780> either<00:02:54.109> so<00:02:54.410> I<00:02:54.470> could

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
I did not want to die either so I could

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.770 
I did not want to die either so I could
drop<00:02:54.859> a<00:02:55.040> nuclear<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:55.940> wanted<00:02:56.299> score<00:02:56.540> streaks

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
drop a nuclear so I wanted score streaks

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.780 
drop a nuclear so I wanted score streaks
that<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:56.989> did<00:02:57.170> not<00:02:57.290> have<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.590> operate<00:02:57.980> aka<00:02:58.400> the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
that I did not have to operate aka the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.599 
that I did not have to operate aka the
lodestar<00:02:59.299> or<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.629> VTOL<00:03:00.019> warship<00:03:00.319> because<00:03:01.310> I

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
lodestar or the VTOL warship because I

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.759 
lodestar or the VTOL warship because I
wouldn't<00:03:02.060> want<00:03:02.329> my<00:03:02.480> body<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:03.049> be<00:03:03.170> vulnerable

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
wouldn't want my body to be vulnerable

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.500 
wouldn't want my body to be vulnerable
while<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.099> was<00:03:04.340> controlling<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.150> this<00:03:05.299> setup

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
while I was controlling it so this setup

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.150 
while I was controlling it so this setup
seemed<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.900> make<00:03:06.739> sense

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
seemed to make sense

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.130 
seemed to make sense
switching<00:03:07.849> out<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.000> escort<00:03:08.690> drone<00:03:08.810> with<00:03:09.049> the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
switching out the escort drone with the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.720 
switching out the escort drone with the
dogs<00:03:09.349> would<00:03:09.560> probably<00:03:09.859> be<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.010> good<00:03:10.250> idea<00:03:10.430> as

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
dogs would probably be a good idea as

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.449 
dogs would probably be a good idea as
well<00:03:11.140> especially<00:03:12.140> for<00:03:12.680> this<00:03:12.799> game<00:03:12.980> but<00:03:13.190> since

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
well especially for this game but since

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.940 
well especially for this game but since
I<00:03:13.579> only<00:03:13.730> got<00:03:13.849> three<00:03:14.269> kills<00:03:14.540> this<00:03:15.349> is<00:03:15.530> actually

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
I only got three kills this is actually

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.920 
I only got three kills this is actually
the<00:03:16.160> same<00:03:16.400> class<00:03:16.670> I<00:03:16.910> used<00:03:17.209> in<00:03:17.419> my<00:03:17.450> going

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
the same class I used in my going

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.360 
the same class I used in my going

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.740 
everything that I want to cover in this
gameplay<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:43.970> we<00:04:44.060> still<00:04:44.240> have<00:04:44.360> a<00:04:44.390> little<00:04:44.570> bit

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
gameplay and we still have a little bit

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.420 
gameplay and we still have a little bit
of<00:04:44.840> time<00:04:45.050> left<00:04:45.260> fortunately<00:04:45.830> so<00:04:45.980> I<00:04:46.010> want<00:04:46.280> to

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
of time left fortunately so I want to

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.280 
of time left fortunately so I want to
discuss<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:46.970> connection<00:04:47.300> in<00:04:47.630> black<00:04:47.870> ops<00:04:48.080> 2

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
discuss the connection in black ops 2

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.230 
discuss the connection in black ops 2
and<00:04:48.620> just<00:04:48.950> kind<00:04:49.130> of<00:04:49.190> try<00:04:49.460> to<00:04:49.490> explain<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.150> a

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
and just kind of try to explain it a

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.340 
and just kind of try to explain it a
little<00:04:50.270> bit<00:04:50.600> better<00:04:50.780> for<00:04:51.020> you<00:04:51.170> guys<00:04:51.200> I

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
little bit better for you guys I

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.930 
little bit better for you guys I
definitely<00:04:51.590> don't<00:04:52.070> know<00:04:52.280> everything<00:04:52.580> that

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
definitely don't know everything that

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.520 
definitely don't know everything that
has<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.480> do<00:04:53.600> with<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.930> connection<00:04:54.320> in<00:04:54.410> this

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
has to do with the connection in this

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.380 
has to do with the connection in this
game<00:04:54.770> I<00:04:55.010> don't<00:04:55.430> think<00:04:55.580> anybody<00:04:55.970> you<00:04:56.120> really

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
game I don't think anybody you really

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.970 
game I don't think anybody you really
fully<00:04:56.660> understands<00:04:57.260> it<00:04:57.470> in<00:04:57.560> fact<00:04:57.770> I<00:04:57.920> don't

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
fully understands it in fact I don't

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.700 
fully understands it in fact I don't
even<00:04:58.250> think<00:04:58.490> that<00:04:59.210> it<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.780> developers<00:05:00.440> fully

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
even think that it the developers fully

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.590 
even think that it the developers fully
understand<00:05:01.220> or<00:05:01.370> at<00:05:01.640> least<00:05:01.820> it<00:05:01.940> seems<00:05:02.420> like

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
understand or at least it seems like

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.330 
understand or at least it seems like
they<00:05:02.720> don't<00:05:02.750> fully<00:05:03.140> understand<00:05:03.620> it<00:05:03.770> or<00:05:04.190> you'd

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
they don't fully understand it or you'd

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.250 
they don't fully understand it or you'd
think<00:05:04.550> it'd<00:05:04.730> be<00:05:04.760> a<00:05:04.910> little<00:05:05.150> bit<00:05:05.390> better<00:05:05.540> but

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
think it'd be a little bit better but

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.540 
think it'd be a little bit better but
here<00:05:06.440> goes<00:05:06.560> nothing<00:05:06.920> having<00:05:07.190> a<00:05:07.400> good

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
here goes nothing having a good

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.340 
here goes nothing having a good
connection<00:05:07.850> can<00:05:08.150> help<00:05:08.420> and<00:05:08.630> hurt<00:05:08.900> you<00:05:09.020> in<00:05:09.200> this

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
connection can help and hurt you in this

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.780 
connection can help and hurt you in this
game<00:05:09.560> just<00:05:09.830> like<00:05:09.860> having<00:05:10.130> a<00:05:10.280> bad<00:05:10.460> connection

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
game just like having a bad connection

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.430 
game just like having a bad connection
is<00:05:11.090> going<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.450> help<00:05:11.630> and<00:05:11.810> hurt<00:05:11.960> you<00:05:12.170> in<00:05:12.290> this

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
game primarily having a bad connection

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.930 
game primarily having a bad connection
is<00:05:14.810> going<00:05:15.110> to<00:05:15.200> hurt<00:05:15.350> you<00:05:15.590> but<00:05:16.100> it<00:05:16.250> can<00:05:16.490> help<00:05:16.730> you

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
as well first off I want to talk about

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.830 
as well first off I want to talk about
when<00:05:19.220> you<00:05:19.340> are<00:05:19.370> post<00:05:19.760> so<00:05:19.970> when<00:05:20.120> you<00:05:20.240> are<00:05:20.510> host

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
when you are post so when you are host

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.350 
when you are post so when you are host
nobody<00:05:21.470> will<00:05:21.950> be<00:05:22.070> ahead<00:05:22.460> of<00:05:22.580> you<00:05:22.730> in<00:05:22.940> the<00:05:23.120> game

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
nobody will be ahead of you in the game

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.420 
nobody will be ahead of you in the game
everyone<00:05:23.780> is<00:05:23.900> connected<00:05:24.170> off<00:05:24.500> of<00:05:24.680> you<00:05:24.860> so<00:05:25.280> they

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
everyone is connected off of you so they

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.700 
everyone is connected off of you so they
will<00:05:25.460> potentially<00:05:26.270> be<00:05:26.690> behind<00:05:27.260> you<00:05:27.470> in<00:05:27.620> the

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
will potentially be behind you in the

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.290 
will potentially be behind you in the
game<00:05:27.860> I<00:05:28.160> mean<00:05:28.790> we<00:05:28.940> are<00:05:29.030> just<00:05:29.210> talking

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
game I mean we are just talking

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.270 
game I mean we are just talking
milliseconds<00:05:30.080> here<00:05:30.320> and<00:05:30.740> it<00:05:30.860> doesn't<00:05:31.040> sound

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
milliseconds here and it doesn't sound

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.740 
milliseconds here and it doesn't sound
like<00:05:31.430> much<00:05:31.550> but<00:05:31.730> it<00:05:32.000> does<00:05:32.030> make<00:05:32.360> a<00:05:32.420> big

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
like much but it does make a big

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.450 
like much but it does make a big
difference<00:05:32.780> so<00:05:33.320> when<00:05:33.500> you<00:05:33.620> are<00:05:33.740> host<00:05:34.010> or<00:05:34.280> have

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
difference so when you are host or have

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.100 
difference so when you are host or have
a<00:05:34.490> compatible<00:05:35.240> connection<00:05:35.720> to<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:35.930> host

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
a compatible connection to the host

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.500 
a compatible connection to the host
meaning<00:05:36.950> you<00:05:37.130> are<00:05:37.160> you<00:05:37.640> have<00:05:37.760> a<00:05:37.790> four<00:05:38.060> bar<00:05:38.240> and

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
meaning you are you have a four bar and

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.490 
meaning you are you have a four bar and
you're<00:05:38.660> not<00:05:38.840> going<00:05:38.990> to<00:05:39.050> be<00:05:39.140> that<00:05:39.230> far<00:05:39.440> behind

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
you're not going to be that far behind

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.320 
you're not going to be that far behind
as<00:05:39.860> a<00:05:39.980> host<00:05:40.160> in<00:05:40.340> fact<00:05:40.520> they're<00:05:40.640> gonna<00:05:40.700> be<00:05:40.940> ahead

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
as a host in fact they're gonna be ahead

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.030 
as a host in fact they're gonna be ahead
of<00:05:41.540> most<00:05:41.930> of<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.140> other<00:05:42.290> players<00:05:42.590> that<00:05:42.710> might

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
of most of the other players that might

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.110 
of most of the other players that might
have<00:05:43.190> a<00:05:43.220> bad<00:05:43.460> connection

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
have a bad connection

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.900 
have a bad connection
but<00:05:44.510> basically<00:05:45.070> sometimes<00:05:46.070> you<00:05:46.460> will<00:05:46.610> be<00:05:46.640> able

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
but basically sometimes you will be able

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.580 
but basically sometimes you will be able
to<00:05:47.060> run<00:05:47.330> around<00:05:47.450> a<00:05:47.630> corner<00:05:47.960> and<00:05:48.110> kill<00:05:48.350> somebody

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
to run around a corner and kill somebody

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.590 
to run around a corner and kill somebody
before<00:05:48.890> you<00:05:49.250> even<00:05:49.460> appear<00:05:49.880> on<00:05:50.030> their<00:05:50.210> screen

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
before you even appear on their screen

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.660 
before you even appear on their screen
because<00:05:51.200> they<00:05:51.410> are<00:05:51.620> behind<00:05:52.010> you<00:05:52.250> in<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.520> game

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
because they are behind you in the game

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.820 
because they are behind you in the game
on<00:05:52.970> the<00:05:53.540> flipside<00:05:53.900> if<00:05:54.200> there<00:05:54.470> is<00:05:54.560> an<00:05:54.680> enemy

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
on the flipside if there is an enemy

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.160 
on the flipside if there is an enemy
behind<00:05:55.730> you<00:05:55.970> and<00:05:56.210> you<00:05:56.330> run<00:05:56.510> around<00:05:56.600> a<00:05:56.780> corner

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
behind you and you run around a corner

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.930 
behind you and you run around a corner
to<00:05:57.350> get<00:05:57.500> out<00:05:57.650> of<00:05:57.800> their<00:05:57.920> line<00:05:58.100> of<00:05:58.130> sight<00:05:58.250> you

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
to get out of their line of sight you

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.700 
to get out of their line of sight you
can<00:05:58.970> be<00:05:59.270> killed<00:05:59.480> by<00:05:59.600> wanted<00:06:00.170> bullets<00:06:00.530> what<00:06:00.680> I

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
can be killed by wanted bullets what I

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.430 
can be killed by wanted bullets what I
mean<00:06:00.920> by<00:06:01.010> this<00:06:01.070> is<00:06:01.430> in<00:06:02.000> the<00:06:02.120> movie<00:06:02.210> wanted<00:06:03.020> they

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
mean by this is in the movie wanted they

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.080 
mean by this is in the movie wanted they
were<00:06:03.500> able<00:06:03.740> to<00:06:03.860> curve<00:06:04.160> bullets<00:06:04.580> around<00:06:04.850> walls

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
were able to curve bullets around walls
