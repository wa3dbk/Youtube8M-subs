00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.410
 let's go in to see how this is going 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.900
 it's worth looking at what is contention gta 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.000
 containment and assault to see in assault and 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.410
 packages in the enemy base and endorsements 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.690
 Criticisms and different types of capture 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.490
 then let's put gta to see the gta in 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.440
 There are no objective vehicles located 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.700
 the whole map to this white the way because 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.140
 it's about stealing vehicles that has 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.940
 to fly so let's give this 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.470
 very good to see what we have here 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.760
 As I said I have not tried anything worth 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.710
 fast pulling just I come by 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.120
 first time I have not entered the capture and 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.830
 none of that I do not know 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.650
 the little things that bring here a lot of 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.270
 sites here I have perfect and very boy 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.710
 pretty pretty good word that 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.420
 put little things in the creator the truth 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.530
 that I'm cool we see what they put things 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.240
 to be able to create what we 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.650
 we want and well let's see how 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.120
 this works as it goes there the little things 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.070
 what do you have if you have enough details 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.480
 what not and when this the details of 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.920
 obviously we will not capture anything 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.380
 because it happens here of wasting time to 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.640
 see create the activator we put it here 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.140

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.580
 I put it there perfect now that we have 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.620
 it's worth the passage room camera 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.750
 output of the equipment is worth putting the 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.160
 series is worth perfect capture zone worth 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.950
 It's worth worth, these are the zones of 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.420
 catch which looks that we can guagua 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.240

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.950

 this what the hell is in the area 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.590
 capture is that this is kind of like 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.640
 domain does not mean Call of Duty 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.280
