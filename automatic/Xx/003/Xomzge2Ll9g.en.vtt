still linger coming up so short last
time<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.380> guess<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.130> final<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
time I guess in that in that final I

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.150 
time I guess in that in that final I
guess<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.840> cover<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> last<00:00:34.380> hurdle<00:00:34.649> kind<00:00:35.040> of

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
guess so cover the last hurdle kind of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.490 
guess so cover the last hurdle kind of
was<00:00:35.370> uh<00:00:35.399> no<00:00:36.329> very<00:00:36.480> disappointing<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:37.320> been

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
was uh no very disappointing it's been

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.260 
was uh no very disappointing it's been
four<00:00:37.739> years<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.280> guess<00:00:38.399> you've<00:00:38.550> been<00:00:38.730> been

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
four years and I guess you've been been

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.549 
four years and I guess you've been been
thinking<00:00:39.600> about<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.110> last<00:00:40.230> four

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
thinking about that for the last four

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.950 
thinking about that for the last four
years<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.070> guess<00:00:41.309> coming<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.480> con<00:00:42.750> game

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
years so I guess coming to this con game

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.270 
years so I guess coming to this con game
with<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.440> know<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.800> only<00:00:43.920> do<00:00:44.100> one

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
with it you know you can only do one

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.860 
with it you know you can only do one
better<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.670> that's<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.059> come<00:00:45.510> away<00:00:45.600> with<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
better and that's to come away with the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.720 
better and that's to come away with the
gold<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.620> time<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.219> side<00:00:47.520> has<00:00:47.700> been

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
gold this this time the side has been

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.970 
gold this this time the side has been
boosted<00:00:48.360> by<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.570> inclusion<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.230> two<00:00:49.559> super

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
boosted by the inclusion of two super

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.790 
boosted by the inclusion of two super
rugby<00:00:50.280> players<00:00:50.579> both<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.809> previous<00:00:52.410> Simmons

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
rugby players both with previous Simmons

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.950

experience<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:54.059> come<00:00:54.300> back<00:00:54.539> I've<00:00:54.809> actually

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
experience to come back I've actually

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.170 
experience to come back I've actually
founded<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.469> pretty<00:00:55.680> smooth<00:00:55.920> transition<00:00:56.460> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
founded a pretty smooth transition to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.639 
founded a pretty smooth transition to
get<00:00:57.300> my<00:00:57.449> head<00:00:57.629> around<00:00:57.750> what's<00:00:58.079> going<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.500> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
get my head around what's going on is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.619 
get my head around what's going on is
one<00:00:58.829> thing<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.340> then<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.699> run<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.270> out<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
one thing but then to run it out on the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.779 
one thing but then to run it out on the
park<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.079> certainly<00:01:01.410> another<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.640> what

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
park is certainly another so that's what

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:03.950 
park is certainly another so that's what
we're<00:01:02.969> working<00:01:03.090> through<00:01:03.420> at<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.539> moment<00:01:03.570> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
we're working through at the moment I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.359 
we're working through at the moment I
find<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.379> actually<00:01:04.619> come<00:01:04.799> back<00:01:04.949> pretty<00:01:05.159> well

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
find it's actually come back pretty well

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.460 
find it's actually come back pretty well
so<00:01:05.549> I've<00:01:05.640> enjoyed<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.750> kind<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.049> jump<00:01:07.290> back

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
and forth from 1570 sometimes I feel

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.960 
and forth from 1570 sometimes I feel
like<00:01:10.020> I'm<00:01:10.170> still<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> dream<00:01:10.820> every<00:01:11.820> day
