to<00:04:20.350> us<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:21.040> we<00:04:21.760> wanted<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.090> reserve<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.810> right

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
situation on the organic farm we can't

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.080 
situation on the organic farm we can't
have<00:04:28.419> an<00:04:28.570> antibiotic<00:04:29.230> on<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.650> farm<00:04:29.919> where<00:04:30.790> our

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
have an antibiotic on the farm where our

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.180 
have an antibiotic on the farm where our
philosophy<00:04:31.750> was<00:04:31.930> we'll<00:04:32.740> just<00:04:32.890> take<00:04:33.040> her<00:04:33.160> out

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
philosophy was we'll just take her out

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.920 
philosophy was we'll just take her out
of<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.460> herd<00:04:33.700> if<00:04:33.850> we<00:04:33.970> ever<00:04:34.090> have<00:04:34.330> to<00:04:34.360> treat<00:04:34.630> him

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
of the herd if we ever have to treat him

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.440 
of the herd if we ever have to treat him
we're<00:04:35.410> natural<00:04:35.950> we<00:04:36.250> cannot<00:04:36.610> ship<00:04:36.910> any<00:04:37.180> milk

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
we're natural we cannot ship any milk

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.900 
we're natural we cannot ship any milk
with<00:04:37.600> antibiotics<00:04:38.290> we<00:04:39.100> have<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.310> drug<00:04:39.700> lab

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
with antibiotics we have a drug lab

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.300 
with antibiotics we have a drug lab
because<00:04:40.450> we<00:04:40.870> have<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.110> test<00:04:41.320> every<00:04:41.860> batch<00:04:42.070> of

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
because we have to test every batch of

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.360 
because we have to test every batch of
milk<00:04:42.550> for<00:04:43.030> antibiotics<00:04:43.810> so<00:04:44.620> if<00:04:44.979> we<00:04:45.130> have<00:04:45.250> to

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
milk for antibiotics so if we have to

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.890 
milk for antibiotics so if we have to
treat<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.610> couch<00:04:45.850> she<00:04:46.090> comes<00:04:46.300> out<00:04:46.479> of<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.690> milk

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
treat a couch she comes out of the milk

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.469 
treat a couch she comes out of the milk
tank<00:04:47.140> we<00:04:47.440> milk<00:04:47.650> her<00:04:47.770> separately<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.790> she<00:04:49.300> gets

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
tank we milk her separately and she gets

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.630 
tank we milk her separately and she gets
tested<00:04:50.080> until<00:04:50.320> she<00:04:50.800> tests<00:04:51.100> negative<00:04:51.280> for

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
she can go back into the herd come on

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.550 
she can go back into the herd come on
mama<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.539> milk<00:04:55.780> components<00:04:56.200> are<00:04:56.289> kept<00:04:56.470> very

mama the milk components are kept very

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.260 
mama the milk components are kept very
very<00:04:56.800> natural<00:04:57.130> we<00:04:57.550> did<00:04:57.700> the<00:04:57.760> best<00:04:57.850> we<00:04:57.970> can<00:04:58.120> to

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
very natural we did the best we can to

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.969 
very natural we did the best we can to
keep<00:04:58.450> it<00:04:58.600> as<00:04:58.780> preserved<00:04:59.229> as<00:04:59.410> we<00:04:59.530> can<00:04:59.710> just<00:04:59.890> as

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
keep it as preserved as we can just as

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.560 
keep it as preserved as we can just as
it<00:05:00.100> came<00:05:00.220> from<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:00.430> cow<00:05:00.550> it<00:05:01.060> is<00:05:01.120> pasteurized

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
it came from the cow it is pasteurized

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.480 
it came from the cow it is pasteurized
only<00:05:01.900> for<00:05:02.050> safety<00:05:02.229> very<00:05:02.530> lightweight<00:05:02.710> 145

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
only for safety very lightweight 145

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.190 
only for safety very lightweight 145
degrees<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:04.180> then<00:05:04.330> we<00:05:04.419> do<00:05:04.539> not<00:05:04.660> homogenized

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
degrees and then we do not homogenized

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.480 
degrees and then we do not homogenized
so<00:05:05.350> we<00:05:05.440> skip<00:05:05.650> that<00:05:05.680> whole<00:05:05.800> step<00:05:06.100> all<00:05:06.250> together

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
so we skip that whole step all together

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.219 
so we skip that whole step all together
so<00:05:06.970> you<00:05:07.030> get<00:05:07.210> that<00:05:07.390> wonderful<00:05:07.570> cream<00:05:07.930> on<00:05:08.050> top
