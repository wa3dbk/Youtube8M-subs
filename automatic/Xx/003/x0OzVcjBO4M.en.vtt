my video that kind of shows the
treatment<00:00:09.750> method<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.230> will<00:00:10.290> however<00:00:10.650> be<00:00:11.040> doing

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
treatment method I will however be doing

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.980 
treatment method I will however be doing
a<00:00:11.690> follow<00:00:12.690> up<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:13.049> show<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.530> kind<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.990> the

things<00:00:18.420> have<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:19.230> know<00:00:19.380> developed<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
things have you know developed with the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.429 
things have you know developed with the
green<00:00:20.910> hair<00:00:20.939> algae<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.689> how<00:00:21.840> effective<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
green hair algae and how effective the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.460 
green hair algae and how effective the
treatment<00:00:22.470> method<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.990> you<00:00:24.990> know<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> couple

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
treatment method is you know a couple

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.170 
treatment method is you know a couple
days<00:00:25.590> from<00:00:25.920> now<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.310> whatnot<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.730> kind<00:00:27.090> of

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
days from now and whatnot to kind of

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.390 
days from now and whatnot to kind of
show<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.390> how<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.750> died<00:00:28.050> off<00:00:28.260> I'm<00:00:29.130> gonna<00:00:29.340> go

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
show you how it's died off I'm gonna go

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.429 
show you how it's died off I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.580> zoom<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.849> here<00:00:30.359> if<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:31.140> saw<00:00:31.289> my

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
ahead and zoom in here if you saw my

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.580 
ahead and zoom in here if you saw my
previous<00:00:31.619> video<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.600> basically<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:34.290> sprayed

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
previous video I basically just sprayed

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.040 
previous video I basically just sprayed
this<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:35.340> area<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.180> green<00:00:36.420> hair<00:00:36.630> algae

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
this this area this is green hair algae

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.040 
this this area this is green hair algae
right<00:00:37.260> here<00:00:37.649> next<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.579> Anubis<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.510> I

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
right here next to this Anubis and I

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.459 
right here next to this Anubis and I
basically<00:00:40.290> showed<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.040> kind<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:42.140> how<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.170> just

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
basically showed you kind of how I just

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.709 
basically showed you kind of how I just
dropped<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.070> little<00:00:44.309> spray<00:00:44.610> bottle<00:00:44.640> into<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
dropped the little spray bottle into the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.840 
dropped the little spray bottle into the
tank<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.110> sprayed<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> affected<00:00:46.980> area<00:00:47.280> it's

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
tank and sprayed the affected area it's

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.650 
tank and sprayed the affected area it's
been<00:00:48.000> about<00:00:48.300> two<00:00:48.899> two<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.559> three<00:00:49.800> minutes<00:00:50.660> and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
been about two two to three minutes and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.770 
been about two two to three minutes and
now<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.949> hydrogen<00:00:53.340> peroxide<00:00:53.789> has<00:00:54.360> begun

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
now the hydrogen peroxide has begun

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.970 
now the hydrogen peroxide has begun
breaking<00:00:55.320> down<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.270> hydrogen<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.199> oxygen

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
breaking down and to hydrogen and oxygen

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.689 
breaking down and to hydrogen and oxygen
and<00:00:59.719> that<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.230> pearling<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.010> wish<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.550> was

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
and that is not pearling I wish that was

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.000 
and that is not pearling I wish that was
purling<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.780> breakdown<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
purling that is the breakdown of the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.359 
purling that is the breakdown of the
hydrogen<00:01:06.000> peroxide<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.930> that's<00:01:07.830> how<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.159> can

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
hydrogen peroxide and that's how you can

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.920 
hydrogen peroxide and that's how you can
tell<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:08.760> working<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.840> be

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
tell if it's working is it's going to be

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.620 
tell if it's working is it's going to be
it's<00:01:10.439> gonna<00:01:10.530> bubble<00:01:10.890> quite<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> bit<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.880> like

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it's gonna bubble quite a bit just like

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.240 
it's gonna bubble quite a bit just like
that<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:14.070> green<00:01:14.369> hair<00:01:14.640> algae<00:01:15.920> it's<00:01:16.920> kind

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
that and this green hair algae it's kind

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.980 
that and this green hair algae it's kind
of<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.520> crazy<00:01:17.850> how<00:01:18.119> quick<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.509> stuff<00:01:18.810> can

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
of it's crazy how quick this stuff can

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.020 
of it's crazy how quick this stuff can
work<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.470> already<00:01:19.830> kind<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.100> faded<00:01:20.640> from<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
work it's already kind of faded from a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.899 
work it's already kind of faded from a
dark<00:01:21.299> green<00:01:21.570> color<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> light<00:01:23.610> green

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
dark green color to like a light green

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.980 
dark green color to like a light green
almost<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.509> brownish<00:01:24.960> color<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:26.720> go<00:01:27.720> ahead<00:01:27.869> and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
almost a brownish color and go ahead and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.969 
almost a brownish color and go ahead and
get<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.799> bit<00:01:29.009> better<00:01:29.189> angle<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.979> so

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
get you a little bit better angle and so

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.380 
get you a little bit better angle and so
slowly<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:32.460> surely<00:01:32.610> that's<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.240> gonna

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
slowly but surely that's just gonna

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.789 
slowly but surely that's just gonna
break<00:01:33.600> down<00:01:33.659> over<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> next<00:01:34.170> twenty<00:01:34.710> to

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
break down over the next twenty to

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.880 
break down over the next twenty to
thirty<00:01:35.040> minutes<00:01:35.570> I<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> canister<00:01:37.500> filter

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
thirty minutes I have a canister filter

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.380 
thirty minutes I have a canister filter
so<00:01:38.130> there's<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> lot<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.729> flow<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.270> this

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
so there's not a lot of flow in this

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.260 
so there's not a lot of flow in this
tank<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:41.009> recommend<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.060> haven't

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
tank but I do recommend if you haven't

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.840 
tank but I do recommend if you haven't
hang<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> back<00:01:42.960> filter<00:01:43.530> or<00:01:44.040> any<00:01:44.579> kind<00:01:44.790> of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
hang on the back filter or any kind of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.550 
hang on the back filter or any kind of
power<00:01:45.090> heads<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.750> anything<00:01:45.960> any<00:01:46.200> kind<00:01:46.470> of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
power heads or anything any kind of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.819 
power heads or anything any kind of
current<00:01:46.920> generating<00:01:47.490> item<00:01:48.409> that<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.560> turn

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
current generating item that you turn

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.590 
current generating item that you turn
that<00:01:50.009> off<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.640> don't<00:01:50.909> want<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> disturb<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
that off you don't want to disturb the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.399 
that off you don't want to disturb the
hydrogen<00:01:52.020> peroxide<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:54.110> it<00:01:55.110> can

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
hydrogen peroxide because it it it can

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.380 
hydrogen peroxide because it it it can
get<00:01:55.590> dissolved<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> water<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:56.969> kind

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
get dissolved in the water and just kind

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.940 
get dissolved in the water and just kind
of<00:01:57.570> move<00:01:57.750> around<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.259> want<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.560> kind<00:01:58.770> of

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
of move around but we want it to kind of

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.240 
of move around but we want it to kind of
