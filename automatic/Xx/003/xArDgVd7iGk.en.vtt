00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.660 
belt when I turn it on the belt will
start<00:00:14.009> going<00:00:14.340> down<00:00:14.580> very<00:00:15.269> loud<00:00:15.980> so<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.580> I'm

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
start going down very loud so what I'm

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:31.659 
start going down very loud so what I'm
going<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.970> do<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.449> round<00:00:18.750> these<00:00:18.960> corners

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.729 

this<00:00:32.669> side<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.450> rounded<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.379> one<00:00:34.620> you

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
can see is still squared off and going

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:46.319 
can see is still squared off and going
around<00:00:36.840> it
