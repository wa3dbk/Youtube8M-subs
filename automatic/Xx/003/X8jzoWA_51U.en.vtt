00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.560
 Hello and welcome my name is the back I am the author of 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:10.200
 website 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.400
 www prompt 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.629
 so far come on the market 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.640
 gg where it is mainly about the digital 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.300
 Panoramic photography is on 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.920
 and I want to show you today 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.920
 how to set the only Dahl point 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.260
 Nadal scores well 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.519
 optical center node and then called op RTL explosive 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.989
 These are the right expression, however, to be the center of entry 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.730
 we turn and in the panorama jumps exactly around this point so we get between 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.650
 Foreground and background no parallax shift and this 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.650
 Basic requirement for a flawless panorama 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.280
 In this video I show you the one who lives the location of the entrance fee 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.810
 speaks the under point 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.980
 determined experimentally 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.269
 now the size 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.970
 The entry pressure device is found relatively quickly 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.210
 it is more or less direct 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.600
 on the lens 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.759
 I have here for example a 50 millimeter connoisseur objective light intensity 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.110
 one comma 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.820
 and me the 50 millimeters 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.770
 by the light intensity 1 Comag the the animals 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.810
 then mostly as a result 28 millimeters 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.880
 and that's direct diameter say the size of the entry fees 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.500
 the complaint of the andritz group empty say that Nadal scores 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.400
 yes, unfortunately, is not directly on the objective but 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.560
 yes that must be determined experimentally that is no longer that 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.840
 I'll show them right away 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.310
 before it starts, though, through this very short 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.450
 with the basics 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.450
 Familiarize Dr Digital panoramic photography 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.080
 In digital panoramic photography you take several single pictures 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.440
 behind each other 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.660
 and between these frames you can distribute the camera around one 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.220
 certain Minka 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.670
 This is also called sales in Kehl or step on 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.439
 this one objected to the objective used 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.930
 and the camera used 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.900
 The whole thing will be later with a software with a so-called Stelzer 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.069
 often who would call deep means 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.449
 composite 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.659
 Well, from there presenting panorama 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.550
 can cover a particularly large picture angle 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.329
 in this case, for example, 120 degrees 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.430
 63 degrees will also be 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.840
 easily possible if you would take pictures for me 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:28.809
 then this panorama has a very high resolution 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.290
 that's because 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.559
 that the once resolutions of the pictures has their minus 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:36.899
 Dr overlap of course 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:37.989
 then you can still 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:38.769
 especially 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.600
 Continue to represent long time and world better 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.600
 you just give away from the classic 2 to 3 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:49.459
 4 to 3 and can represent virtually any aspect ratio 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.699
 the beautiful thing about digital panoramic photography is 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:57.209
 There begins to photograph where the subject captives and stops where that 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.209
 Motif stops 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.539
 that later 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:03.960
 also note 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.730
 should 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.769
 or can do 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.869
 is that one decides for a certain projection 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:14.339
 which is classical projections in digital panoramic photography 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:16.260
 certainly that relieves projection 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.290
 that's because this was just very large field of view up to 63 degrees 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.519
 can easily represent 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.420
 one imagines one stands in the middle of one besides that and contemplates 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.029
 this panorama is easy 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.069
 yes from the inside 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.189
 but this cylinder then rolls off again and like here 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.369
 yes represents a plane surface 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:42.019
 then Fortmann the effect that I just 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.800
 horizontal lines with the exception of the horizon 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.599
 next to Schierke bent pose 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:48.809
 that means you have one 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:53.369
 Catering for lines and this is the stronger the more you go up 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:55.240
 or goes down 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.240
 that is, the further one moves away from the horizon 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.269
 and if you do not want that 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.389
 the last band maybe to the area projection 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.389
 in the area projection I always have straight lines 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.639
 "That's very nice, however, the surfaces projection came at a disadvantage 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.540
 that can not represent arbitrarily large operations on an area can 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.130
 Not only what's in front of the surface is not what your life is 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:24.210
 or what is behind that means I'm theoretically limited to 180 degrees and 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.009
 in practice, and maybe even May will stop 100 degrees 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.000
 that's because 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.480
 that here also serve so called even have largely effect 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.379
 that means 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.379
 Objects on the edge pretty easy apart 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:41.279
 Photographers maybe a Zuber wide-angle lens 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:44.279
 We are sure we will know this effect 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.080
 what do I need now? 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.189
 Panoramic head 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:52.370
 the panorama head 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.610
 the Dortmund could be called adapter 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.310
 good photography me without panorama head 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.000
 usually the problem is done 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.600
 the palace and shift that is foreground and background are moving 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.580
 to each other when panning 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.330
 and that is relatively counterproductive 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.069
 here in this example, for example, I have the 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.110
 Covered in the door frame with the floor lamp 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.789
 Ban that right if done 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.210
 and then I noticed there was the floor lamp from the door frame 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.620
 Has gone away 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.440
 Of course this is not so nice because the seats on the white of course not 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.669
 where is the floor lamp now she stands in line with the door frame or in 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.439
 Cover with the pictures on the wall 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:31.800
 that would be for example 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.220
 Ghosts create images and would not be nice in the finished panorama 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.309
 I have against it 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:40.580
 well adjusted panorama head 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.920
 Nadal comes the dapd dapd 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.340
 then i can do this effect 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.330
 avoid 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.100
 that means foreground and background 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.930
 stay in the swivel cover and that's exactly what I want 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.849
 so and how to adjust now to a panoramic head I show him that 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:57.520
 Can follow 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.629
 I would like to demonstrate in the following 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:03.889
 Nuuk 6 for now, Amy bru is second use 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:08.460
 It is the best of Aram Ockert of the German manufacturer Knuth 6 he is 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.680
 built extremely stable 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.910
 high precision and universal 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.350
 Usable that means no one virtually with every camera and every lens 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.719
 use 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:21.710
 it's a so called Mutti ROG Panorama head 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.279
 that means I can work who works in time, for example 

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:27.129
 such a line 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:29.080
 then annoyingly down 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.559
 make the next line 

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:31.710
 maybe there will do 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.810
 but one line 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.810
 above 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.300
 which is very nice on this panoramic head 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.050
 he has to rest that means you take certain rest steps in the recording 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.430
 just off 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.660
 which continues the sales IT I can at this blue button beforehand 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.270
 to adjust
