dump<00:00:13.270> is<00:00:13.480> too<00:00:13.900> short<00:00:14.110> but<00:00:14.889> you<00:00:15.459> know<00:00:15.580> the<00:00:15.789> thing

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
dump is too short but you know the thing

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.420 
dump is too short but you know the thing
is<00:00:15.969> I<00:00:16.779> think<00:00:17.380> this<00:00:17.710> place<00:00:17.920> didn't<00:00:18.220> start

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
is I think this place didn't start

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.890 
is I think this place didn't start
quickly<00:00:18.670> though<00:00:19.090> I<00:00:19.119> told<00:00:19.510> me<00:00:19.630> to<00:00:19.780> be<00:00:19.870> ready

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
quickly though I told me to be ready

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.140 
quickly though I told me to be ready
because<00:00:20.290> my<00:00:21.040> kids<00:00:21.190> put<00:00:21.430> a<00:00:21.460> lot<00:00:21.580> of<00:00:21.610> muscle<00:00:22.000> on

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
because my kids put a lot of muscle on

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.380 
because my kids put a lot of muscle on
and<00:00:22.420> why<00:00:22.900> else<00:00:23.080> you<00:00:23.230> put<00:00:23.380> muscle<00:00:23.620> on<00:00:23.800> me<00:00:24.390> except

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
and why else you put muscle on me except

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.580 
and why else you put muscle on me except
the<00:00:25.480> strings<00:00:25.780> that<00:00:25.960> I<00:00:26.020> mean<00:00:26.170> that<00:00:26.380> it<00:00:26.470> doesn't

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
the strings that I mean that it doesn't

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.830 
the strings that I mean that it doesn't
help<00:00:26.830> counter<00:00:27.190> punching<00:00:27.580> or<00:00:28.090> a<00:00:28.180> speed<00:00:28.480> at<00:00:28.660> all

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
help counter punching or a speed at all

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.359 
help counter punching or a speed at all
so<00:00:29.500> I<00:00:29.530> think<00:00:29.680> he's<00:00:29.980> going<00:00:30.130> to<00:00:30.220> come<00:00:30.310> out

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
so I think he's going to come out

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.950 
so I think he's going to come out
aggressive<00:00:30.880> and<00:00:31.030> try<00:00:31.119> to<00:00:31.210> get<00:00:31.390> Manny<00:00:31.600> out<00:00:31.780> of

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
aggressive and try to get Manny out of

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.660 
aggressive and try to get Manny out of
there<00:00:32.079> so<00:00:32.289> I<00:00:32.320> think<00:00:32.410> those<00:00:32.680> big<00:00:33.100> changes<00:00:33.579> of

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
there so I think those big changes of

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.180 
there so I think those big changes of
the<00:00:33.699> cider<00:00:34.030> house<00:00:34.840> of<00:00:35.020> course<00:00:35.260> we<00:00:35.469> support

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
the cider house of course we support

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.450 
the cider house of course we support
cases<00:00:36.400> babysitter's<00:00:37.180> seems<00:00:37.930> like<00:00:38.170> it's<00:00:38.460> not

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
cases babysitter's seems like it's not

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.520 
cases babysitter's seems like it's not
the<00:00:39.640> smartest<00:00:40.060> thing<00:00:40.270> for<00:00:40.300> him<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.630> do<00:00:40.989> he

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
the smartest thing for him to do he

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.940 
the smartest thing for him to do he
wants<00:00:41.950> to<00:00:42.040> fight<00:00:42.310> this<00:00:43.060> kind<00:00:43.450> of<00:00:43.540> like<00:00:43.950> maybe

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
not this morning in the robot I give him

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.680 
not this morning in the robot I give him
credit<00:00:46.690> for<00:00:47.170> it<00:00:47.260> because<00:00:47.440> he<00:00:48.180> he's<00:00:49.180> got<00:00:49.360> a<00:00:49.420> plan

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
credit for it because he he's got a plan

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.770 
credit for it because he he's got a plan
and<00:00:49.930> he's<00:00:50.110> going<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.380> go<00:00:50.500> with<00:00:50.649> it<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:51.780> you

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
and he's going to go with it and you

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.229 
and he's going to go with it and you
know<00:00:52.930> he's<00:00:53.170> he<00:00:54.070> feels<00:00:54.309> that<00:00:54.460> he<00:00:54.520> wants<00:00:55.210> to

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
know he's he feels that he wants to

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.420 
know he's he feels that he wants to
exchange<00:00:55.510> with<00:00:55.809> Manny<00:00:56.020> and<00:00:56.290> you<00:00:56.680> know<00:00:56.800> he<00:00:56.950> had

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
exchange with Manny and you know he had

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.190 
exchange with Manny and you know he had
mini<00:00:57.640> heard<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.090> less<00:00:58.270> amplifies<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.809> couple

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
mini heard and less amplifies a couple

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.500 
mini heard and less amplifies a couple
times<00:00:59.350> so<00:01:00.219> you<00:01:00.280> know<00:01:00.579> it's<00:01:01.090> not<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.360> worst

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
times so you know it's not the worst

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.109 
times so you know it's not the worst
idea<00:01:01.719> in<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.050> world<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:03.340> if<00:01:03.670> you<00:01:03.969> were

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
idea in the world but if you were

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.690 
idea in the world but if you were
trading<00:01:04.540> more<00:01:04.750> heads<00:01:05.430> would<00:01:06.430> you<00:01:06.579> have

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
trading more heads would you have

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.669 
trading more heads would you have
advised<00:01:07.030> him<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.360> get<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.630> small<00:01:08.079> much<00:01:08.499> as

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:08.679 
advised him to get a small much as

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:10.899 
advised him to get a small much as
possible<00:01:09.189> this<00:01:09.819> like<00:01:10.090> where

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
possible this like where

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.169 
possible this like where
i<00:01:10.969> would<00:01:11.719> i<00:01:12.439> would<00:01:12.710> went<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:13.310> other<00:01:13.429> way<00:01:13.579> and

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
i would i would went the other way and

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:16.959 
i would i would went the other way and
went<00:01:14.689> back<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:14.869> my<00:01:15.079> counter<00:01:15.409> punches<00:01:15.740> out<00:01:15.979> that

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
went back to my counter punches out that

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:20.289 
went back to my counter punches out that
gave<00:01:17.179> me<00:01:17.359> any<00:01:17.539> trouble<00:01:17.659> yes<00:01:18.189> but<00:01:19.189> I'm<00:01:19.850> not<00:01:19.909> not

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
gave me any trouble yes but I'm not not

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.059 
gave me any trouble yes but I'm not not
sure<00:01:22.179> Tommy<00:01:23.179> for<00:01:23.450> now<00:01:23.569> I<00:01:23.840> think<00:01:24.200> is<00:01:24.619> that<00:01:24.649> in

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
sure Tommy for now I think is that in

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:26.559 
sure Tommy for now I think is that in
the<00:01:25.159> technically<00:01:25.609> he's<00:01:25.939> always<00:01:26.179> been<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.359> very

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
the technically he's always been a very

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.779 
the technically he's always been a very
technical<00:01:27.229> fighter<00:01:27.920> but<00:01:28.399> I<00:01:28.459> think<00:01:28.700> he's

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
technical fighter but I think he's

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.609 
technical fighter but I think he's
perfect<00:01:28.939> perfect<00:01:29.750> as<00:01:29.869> some<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.109> his<00:01:30.229> punches

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
perfect perfect as some of his punches

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.440 
perfect perfect as some of his punches
it<00:01:30.890> does<00:01:31.099> a<00:01:31.130> lot<00:01:31.310> better<00:01:31.459> things<00:01:31.849> and<00:01:32.119> he<00:01:32.209> used

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
it does a lot better things and he used

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.089 
it does a lot better things and he used
to<00:01:32.479> do<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:33.140> I<00:01:33.500> he's<00:01:33.740> learned<00:01:33.979> her

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:34.099 
to do and I he's learned her

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:35.949 
to do and I he's learned her
left-handers<00:01:34.909> better<00:01:35.030> I<00:01:35.329> thought<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:35.750> was<00:01:35.929> a

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:35.959 
left-handers better I thought it was a

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.020 
left-handers better I thought it was a
problem<00:01:36.289> but<00:01:36.740> not<00:01:36.920> it's<00:01:37.159> much<00:01:37.609> better<00:01:37.789> with

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
problem but not it's much better with

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.520 
problem but not it's much better with
them<00:01:38.179> he's<00:01:38.689> learning<00:01:38.959> how<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.079> control<00:01:39.289> that

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530
