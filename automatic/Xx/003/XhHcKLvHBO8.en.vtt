00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello again in that lesson we 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.910
 did 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.030
 wings in which the first row was out of 10 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:23.180
 pieces 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:27.529
 the next row will be from 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.529
 so to 1 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:43.980
 so that's the same and on the other hand it 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.980
 final moment 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.520
 yes have mercy on the covered now we just 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.730
 We can align as you wish though 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.370
 arch the other side 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:09.060
 at least bend it all as you wish 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:14.490
 you also like the tail of the hour there 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:18.690
 concave can be made to bend it here 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:25.610
 everybody has his own taste 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:29.119
 like for the neck we left the place yes 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:34.590
 if they were going here at the same time 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:40.490
 wings and tail and faded away then 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:46.850
 there is less and less every kind 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.850
 then the neck is going like this 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.210
 into each other 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.450
 you are not so 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:11.730
 the number can depend on everything just like you 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:18.000
 like you can make 30 pieces you can 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:22.170
 make 20 pieces beauty depends on 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.450
 how many pieces in the clinic with something to someone 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.110
 someone likes a long neck 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.600
 short someone wants a strong bend 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:36.989
 to make it means you need to invest more 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.700
 the only one and the reddish piece 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.860
 to make and one blank 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.930
 little white to make eye I already 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:50.100
 noted in advance where I will have eye 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:59.390
 little move to the edge so when 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:59.390
 we put on the beak did not close the classic 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.130
 and on the other hand to make it evenly 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:19.350
 I open a little and look 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.540
 match you or not if not 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:30.620
 match then it would be a moment you can 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:33.620
 just a little fix except owl 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.620
 beak 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.260
 Here's a helluva lot of us 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.740
 I was a mouse on the dishes 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.199
 we correct 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:37.880
 somewhere may not not converge detail in 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.140
 the plan that some not giving stuck 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:45.130
 stronger somewhere relaxed it all 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.130
 you can correct 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.430
 such a sprue can still be made 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.000
 coaster 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:10.300
 she is also going to look like a neck 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.729
 I already prepared a friend of a friend 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:21.070
 Here is such a each other dress and cross 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:24.760
 such at the end connects into a ring here 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:30.669
 so here it is revealed and then just by 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.960
 agree a bit, but such a circle 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.830
 there is 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.260
 stand can be done why 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.479
 initially said that to 400 in any 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.580
 case is needed because even if 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:46.449
 something you have left that I he will fall on 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.990
 stand can be done we did 7 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:50.919
 rows 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:56.050
 and then began to do the wings can 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:06:01.410
 make 8 rows 9 rows ie how many 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.410
 you have enough patience to do the module 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.090
 here 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:22.230
 you can also do more rows here 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.620
 pieces in one row that is if we did 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:28.830
 30 you can do 40 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:34.550
 it all depends on how much module you are 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.550
 make some patience enough for you 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:46.280
 on this lesson we end wish 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:46.280
 good luck and patience goodbye
