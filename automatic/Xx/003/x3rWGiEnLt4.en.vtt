00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:24.710
 here is alexandra from the brush scherf and 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.809
 choir from Hamburg and I have you today 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.430
 I brought a small album 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:30.050
 just want to show you the album is 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.170
 I already finished it before a few 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.120
 tinkered on the occasion of the birth 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.850
 a little boy my girlfriend and 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.719
 her husband has become parents already end 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.270
 last year 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.859
 but sometimes it is something in time 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.690
 difficult and then it almost has one 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.910
 It took us a month to get there 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.019
 can actually see 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.350
 the little one is actually already 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.670
 a month old time flies 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.710
 before I wanted the gift 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.710
 I just show it again as 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.210
 little inspiration 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.379
 Yes, that's a little album which I think 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:08.900
 thought for the first year of life 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:11.600
 julius henry in which the parents each 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.370
 month one picture of him can stick one 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.840
 and then you just look at the end of the 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.820
 year how did it develop? 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.590
 maybe they'll give it away too 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.090
 eighteenth birthday to him 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.969
 then had a memory for his 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.860
 first year of life 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:29.119
 yes I have the first only my interest 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.229
 use a spiral binding and then 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.479
 proud of it the first time 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.369
 I actually worked here 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.590
 a few turns still attached 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.520
 small sportpart what I with this 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.520
 Paper has been referred to as design paper 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.329
 I have a little 66 in the blog 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.630
 used from the house studio kaliko 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.979
 the story time collection is 36 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.539
 sheet of paper in it 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.390
 I thought the paper was nice than not 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.799
 so cheesy is colorful and so on 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.299
 light blue tones but are from the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.420
 you will also see fans soon 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.119
 muted colors and I believe that is coming 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.950
 the parents in particular very accommodating 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.450
 and the little one will probably 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.160
 I will like it, too 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:18.360
 itself not so colorful in this 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.709
 blog are 36 sheets of paper in it or 236 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.860
 sheet of paper in it 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.190
 now it is only 1 I have the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.040
 complete block but so on 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.780
 it too 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.130
 the design papers in detail you see 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.680
 if I go through leaves again 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.769
 I have a little friends here 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.170
 lettering album the name of the 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.560
 little with a dress frame 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.970
 deposited and then the book begins with 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:51.180
 a sturdy cardboard lid and on the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.239
 first page I have a general 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.430
 sheet with a small day can there 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.560
 then the parents the date of birth 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.480
 time weight and size on it 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.890
 maybe here for the very first place 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.930
 Photo by julius and so are in 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.880
 principle, the whole album is designed that way 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.730
 with in the einsteck album and one 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.859
 card glued to the first picture on it 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.569
 Can be on the back 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.359
 the first notes are still to be made 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.700
 tooth or when he was particularly restless 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:24.209
 if he has grown a lot the first one 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.670
 porridge such things stop and then is and 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.010
 Every page up here is one more 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.359
 small bag in it is where completely private 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.389
 things can be hidden completely 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.680
 private photos not all the same 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.049
 should see if he has the album 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.239
 leaf through and then it starts in 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:43.250
 principle already with that for the 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.900
 individual months of life of the first year 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.120
 one page each is available 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.450
 keep pushing with them 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.410
 scroll for the bags the first one 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.850
 month 2 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.230
 and so it goes in principle by always 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.230
 with these one piece bags 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.280
 I have the album very much 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.200
 simply held by the ornament 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.990
 First, because it's too thick for me otherwise 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.150
 that would be the strongest bond 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:16.230
 that I can do with the sense 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.780
 It is a quarter in I will too 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.590
 if I did something again 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.570
 maybe it will be one more time 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.740
 girl I was born, it'll be on but 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.300
 all cases again for a boy 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.300
 nachbasteln and in my dawandler 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.980
 I'll set a leaf shop 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.300
 less I have seven now 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.400
 leaves I will be one less leaf 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.260
 make the quasi the cover sheet and the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.450
 last sheet omitted and then it 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.290
 equal to the first second third 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.550
 It will be easy to start the fourth month 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.680
 not so wide is still room for 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.280
 decorations without it after that 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.840
 album jumps as I said the papers 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.460
 are very nice in muted colors though 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.520
 but also suitable for a small one 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.520
 boys 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.310
 and he's leafing through and at the end 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.380
 Maybe there is a photo of mum 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.970
 Dad and little Julius for the first 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.970
 birthday with the birthday cake 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.450
 maybe there would be somewhere in the 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.030
 album still the ultrasound photos of the 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.220
 hiding pregnancy and then is 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.340
 perhaps also the eighteenth 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.960
 birthday of julius a nice idea 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.100
 she just has to give it then 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.120
 A reminder of his first 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.160
 age 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.070
 i am superior i have the album 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.419
 maybe even bastler with thinner ones 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:35.010
 then also for 18 years of life then can 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.150
 always a photo for the birthday 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.530
 be plugged in 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.940
 A friend brought me that 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.140
 the album was really great and the 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.300
 idea was also great 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.940
 and let's see maybe I'll be in 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.590
 Making things up again 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.160
 Yes 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.060
 that's the back of a little named 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.200
 here below 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.150
 so you also know who did it 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.840
 and match the album I have 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.250
 of course, a greeting card 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.390
 made and the paper has the design 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.050
 taken over paper 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.280
 also from andy the dotted paper 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.760
 stayed in petrol 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:16.610
 from here a few buttons glued on and 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.750
 it's a boy yes it's a boy me 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.220
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.500
 Girl card to tinker 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.710
 that was what i wanted to show you 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.750
 I hope you enjoyed it and join 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:30.070
 she will show you next time 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.070
 I wish a game day
