00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.240
 the output of this third and final 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.800
 eliminator manga colima grade 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.780
 distinctive red on the right of their 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.330
 screens 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.740
 andreani on the left with directive 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.380
 therefore the Italian monastery of the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.760
 circuit inside the British 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.970
 has a little over a minute and we're going to 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.970
 watch 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.630
 because it is the definitive sleeve is the 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.430
 tiebreaker after that with mom and 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.280
 the winner while with the test 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.079
 of lancia competition was andre 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.300
 Agassi therefore this is the tie 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.770
 in the sleeve of the last one that is going to 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.600
 dispute today here in this circuit and in 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.019
 the Canary Islands between the Italian and the 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.400
 British after taking the 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.080
 conversation at this point 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.080
 they will address the lack and we will see in 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.370
 the first step by goal the partial 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.740
 let's see who goes forward if calling 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.020
 no bigger gloves or andrea with one 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.110
 to follow 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.990
 a quini 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.390
 with a pretty enough difference 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.520
 bulged well it seems that there neither 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.110
 can be the new champion of champions 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.660
 and that which has never been champion of 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.450
 world which is very curious let's see 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.740
 what gives this last round of the 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.300
 fifth edition of the race of 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.530
 champions the third held in 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.850
 Spain 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.470
 one of the brightest that is 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.240
 remember about a very fast circuit 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.240
 very spectacular and very safe 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.960
 there has nothing, do not anticipate 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.040
 event what still feels a 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.670
 a little bit more complicated maybe 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.670
 of the circuit 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.680
 let's see why the pilots are 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.140
 point of taking the conversation that in 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.440
 these moments are directed 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.440
 inward will enter collimated King 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.039
 and so two victories for the Italian 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.539
 jim and about the British colin man ray 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:05.750
 nagin and he has done it in 146 72 147 06 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.929
 for the British driver well so 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.480
 both the Italian pilot of lancia this 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.130
 season and the next has been the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.530
 winner of this fifth edition of the 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.550
 career of champions its pilot of 29 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.250
 years that 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.740
 lives the livorno in italy is single 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.750
 has won a test of the championship of 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.970
 world the sanremo rally this season 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.160
 has disputed 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.180
 fundamentally on the roads of 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.180
 asphalt and earth 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.470
 from that transalpine country 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.410
 has been third in the championship of 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.490
 Italy of group n in the years 87 and 88 and 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.530
 third in the championship of italy 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:50.680
 absolute in the year 89 is a pilot with 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.680
 great future one of those that is 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.650
 but more future in the championship of 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.650
 world 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.930
 in the return of honor 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.760
 the audience that continues to cheer 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.890
 appreciating the great show that we 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.680
 they have given that they have given us the 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.230
 pilots along text of these three 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.750
 days of competition thus therefore 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.959
 have been three days of motoring the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.510
 good in a really beautiful frame 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.890
 with a really spectacular circuit and 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.000
 with an organization that has been 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.140
 always at the height of 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.120
 circumstances 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.980
 We appreciate the collaboration of Luis Moya 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.629
 I wanted to make a little rib 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.340
 Well, yes, I think that Andrea was going to 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.280
 to be able to have a good seafood today if 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.720
 wants to go black leg because it's going to 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.730
 bring a prize with that victory of 4 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.560
 million and a half pesetas that is not 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.299
 bad that is not bad not 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.299
