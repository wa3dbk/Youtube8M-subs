00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
would be very energetic because if they

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.190 
would be very energetic because if they
it'd<00:02:30.640> be<00:02:30.790> interesting<00:02:31.060> if<00:02:31.450> they<00:02:31.540> can<00:02:31.690> keep<00:02:32.050> up

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.900 
thoughts I think you know obviously they
all<00:02:38.890> they'll<00:02:39.070> get<00:02:39.250> better<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:39.610> better<00:02:39.670> each

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.760 
all they'll get better and better each
week<00:02:39.940> so<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.420> think<00:02:40.480> okay<00:02:40.810> it'd<00:02:41.230> be<00:02:41.380> a<00:02:41.410> good<00:02:41.560> test

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
week so I think okay it'd be a good test

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.590 
week so I think okay it'd be a good test
how<00:02:42.100> competence<00:02:42.580> does<00:02:42.790> seem<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.210> be<00:02:43.330> growing

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
how competence does seem to be growing

how competence does seem to be growing
Christmas<00:02:44.200> isn't<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.560> mean<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.740> second<00:02:45.220> latin

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490

Christmas isn't it I mean a second latin
last<00:02:45.700> week<00:02:46.000> I<00:02:46.090> think<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.300> cha-cha-cha<00:02:46.660> was

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
last week I think the cha-cha-cha was

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.660 
last week I think the cha-cha-cha was
much<00:02:47.110> better<00:02:47.380> than<00:02:47.530> ourselves<00:02:47.680> yes<00:02:48.160> I<00:02:48.370> think

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
much better than ourselves yes I think

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.010 
much better than ourselves yes I think
she's<00:02:48.850> better<00:02:49.090> when<00:02:49.390> she's<00:02:49.600> being<00:02:49.750> taken

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
she's better when she's being taken

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.710 
she's better when she's being taken
around<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.590> room<00:02:50.770> mm-hmm<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.880> her<00:02:52.239> partner<00:02:52.690> I

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
around the room mm-hmm I her partner I

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.960 
around the room mm-hmm I her partner I
think<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:53.170> helps<00:02:53.530> her<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.680> lot<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.700> helps

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
think that helps her a lot that helps

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.340 
think that helps her a lot that helps

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
yes we can do this even this week I

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.570 
yes we can do this even this week I
found<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.320> quite<00:03:05.590> difficult<00:03:05.920> because<00:03:06.340> we're

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
found it quite difficult because we're

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.790 
found it quite difficult because we're
doing<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.790> quick<00:03:06.970> step<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:07.930> that's<00:03:08.020> about<00:03:08.140> at

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
doing the quick step so that's about at

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.890 
doing the quick step so that's about at
least<00:03:08.980> three<00:03:09.220> times<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:10.150> amount<00:03:10.270> of<00:03:10.480> steps<00:03:10.660> to

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
least three times the amount of steps to

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.390 
least three times the amount of steps to
remember<00:03:11.050> and<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:11.410> do<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.860> normally<00:03:12.220> I've

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
remember and to do that normally I've

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.480 
remember and to do that normally I've
woken<00:03:12.730> up<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.090> few<00:03:13.239> times<00:03:13.450> and

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
woken up a few times and

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.860 
woken up a few times and
think<00:03:14.700> it's<00:03:14.820> morning<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.300> I'm<00:03:15.420> used<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.690> just

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
think it's morning and I'm used to just

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.420 
think it's morning and I'm used to just
being<00:03:16.020> tired<00:03:16.320> now<00:03:16.650> because<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.010> wake<00:03:17.160> up<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.340> by

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
being tired now because I wake up and by

was help us too and I was kind of

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.860 
was help us too and I was kind of
dreaming<00:03:23.670> though<00:03:23.940> I<00:03:23.970> was<00:03:24.180> having<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.450> do<00:03:24.570> steps

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
dreaming though I was having to do steps

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.110 
dreaming though I was having to do steps
in<00:03:25.110> my<00:03:25.230> sleep<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.770> I<00:03:25.860> was<00:03:26.040> thinking<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:27.090> myself

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
in my sleep and I was thinking to myself

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.720 
in my sleep and I was thinking to myself
but<00:03:27.540> these<00:03:27.690> are<00:03:27.840> really<00:03:27.990> hard<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.430> my<00:03:29.550> head

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
but these are really hard and in my head

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.490 
but these are really hard and in my head
I<00:03:29.970> had<00:03:30.120> passion<00:03:30.390> sake<00:03:30.690> but<00:03:30.840> they're<00:03:31.020> all<00:03:31.170> hard

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
I had passion sake but they're all hard

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
I had passion sake but they're all hard
carrier<00:03:33.740> it's<00:03:34.740> really<00:03:35.010> rare<00:03:35.130> but<00:03:35.160> it's<00:03:35.370> really

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
carrier it's really rare but it's really

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.350 
carrier it's really rare but it's really
taken<00:03:35.880> over<00:03:36.950> time<00:03:37.950> even<00:03:38.220> yet<00:03:38.400> I'm<00:03:38.700> dancing<00:03:39.270> in

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360
