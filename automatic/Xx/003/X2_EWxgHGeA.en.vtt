millimeter nuts you get your waters here
and<00:01:19.420> I<00:01:19.479> figured<00:01:19.810> Wilde<00:01:20.050> was<00:01:20.170> up<00:01:20.350> I<00:01:20.500> might<00:01:20.650> as

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
and I figured Wilde was up I might as

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.010 
and I figured Wilde was up I might as
well<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:22.090> spray<00:01:22.330> painting<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.780> chain

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
well just spray painting the chain

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.900 
well just spray painting the chain
really<00:01:24.009> couldn't<00:01:24.280> think<00:01:24.340> of<00:01:24.460> an<00:01:24.550> easier<00:01:24.640> way

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
really couldn't think of an easier way

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.620 
really couldn't think of an easier way
to<00:01:24.970> do<00:01:25.210> it<00:01:25.360> so<00:01:26.369> got<00:01:27.369> that<00:01:27.400> and<00:01:27.790> pins<00:01:28.270> hold<00:01:28.509> the

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
to do it so got that and pins hold the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.590 
to do it so got that and pins hold the
gate<00:01:28.780> shot<00:01:29.080> I<00:01:30.990> got<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.170> light<00:01:32.710> kit<00:01:32.950> here<00:01:33.600> it's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
gate shot I got the light kit here it's

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.499 
gate shot I got the light kit here it's
actually<00:01:34.750> fairly<00:01:35.320> easy

where<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:35.920> run<00:02:36.099> my<00:02:36.510> tractor<00:02:37.510> up<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:39.450> mean<00:02:40.450> this

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
where I run my tractor up I mean this

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.530 
where I run my tractor up I mean this
stuff<00:02:40.780> here<00:02:41.050> it's<00:02:41.760> it's<00:02:42.760> too<00:02:42.910> expensive<00:02:43.270> the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
stuff here it's it's too expensive the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.370 
stuff here it's it's too expensive the
replace<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:44.140> can't<00:02:45.130> afford<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.349> just

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
replace I can't afford it so I just

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.270 
replace I can't afford it so I just
welded<00:02:47.800> some<00:02:49.709> brackets<00:02:50.709> in<00:02:50.860> there<00:02:51.069> hopefully

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
welded some brackets in there hopefully

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.250 
welded some brackets in there hopefully
that'll<00:02:51.580> take<00:02:52.240> some<00:02:52.270> of<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.599> abuse<00:02:52.900> running

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
that'll take some of the abuse running

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.860 
that'll take some of the abuse running
up<00:02:53.349> and<00:02:53.470> down<00:02:53.530> on<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.360> throwing<00:02:55.360> firewood

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870

up and down on it and throwing firewood
in<00:02:55.989> there<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:57.060> but<00:02:58.060> this<00:02:58.180> is<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.450> stuff<00:02:58.659> I'm

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
in there and but this is the stuff I'm

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.620 
in there and but this is the stuff I'm
using

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630

bigger<00:03:10.730> while<00:03:10.940> I<00:03:10.970> was<00:03:11.150> doing<00:03:11.270> I<00:03:11.390> made<00:03:11.540> myself<00:03:11.720> a

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
bigger while I was doing I made myself a

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.310 
bigger while I was doing I made myself a
bracket<00:03:12.610> for<00:03:13.610> my<00:03:13.700> license<00:03:14.060> plate<00:03:14.330> welded<00:03:15.050> dad

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.290 
on there and I've got that ready to go I
just<00:03:20.450> didn't<00:03:20.600> went<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.780> license<00:03:21.110> plate

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
just didn't went the license plate

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.370 
just didn't went the license plate
hanging<00:03:23.300> off<00:03:23.390> with<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.660> backlight<00:03:24.020> because

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
hanging off with the backlight because

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.360 
hanging off with the backlight because
every<00:03:24.500> time<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.710> back<00:03:24.890> up

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
every time you back up

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.640 
every time you back up
you'd<00:03:26.360> smash<00:03:26.690> it<00:03:26.840> into<00:03:26.960> something<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.440> your

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
you'd smash it into something and your

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.750 
you'd smash it into something and your
license<00:03:28.160> plates<00:03:28.340> will<00:03:28.430> be<00:03:28.490> underneath<00:03:28.640> the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
license plates will be underneath the

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.390 
license plates will be underneath the
trailer<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:29.300> it's<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.230> little<00:03:30.440> update<00:03:30.710> I'm

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
trailer so it's a little update I'm

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.820 
trailer so it's a little update I'm
gonna<00:03:31.580> keep<00:03:31.760> going<00:03:32.060> here<00:03:35.440> alright<00:03:36.440> I<00:03:36.500> had<00:03:36.680> this

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
gonna keep going here alright I had this

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.050 
gonna keep going here alright I had this
all<00:03:37.040> wired<00:03:37.390> and<00:03:38.390> I<00:03:39.380> didn't<00:03:39.650> like<00:03:39.800> it<00:03:40.010> it's<00:03:40.940> like

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.810 
all wired and I didn't like it it's like
toward<00:03:41.330> a<00:03:41.390> port<00:03:41.600> I<00:03:42.100> think<00:03:43.100> it's<00:03:43.190> really<00:03:43.400> stupid

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
toward a port I think it's really stupid

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.870 
toward a port I think it's really stupid
the<00:03:44.390> way<00:03:44.510> they<00:03:44.690> have<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:45.250> in<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.430> directions

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
the way they have it in the directions

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.910 
the way they have it in the directions
so<00:03:47.270> what<00:03:47.450> I'm<00:03:47.540> gonna<00:03:47.750> do<00:03:47.960> is<00:03:48.140> what<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.530> started

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.230 
cheesy metal clips that come with it and
I<00:04:39.410> would<00:04:39.560> replace<00:04:40.010> in<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.340> wires<00:04:40.970> or

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
I would replace in the wires or

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.290 
I would replace in the wires or
something<00:04:41.630> in<00:04:41.720> a<00:04:41.780> couple<00:04:41.900> months<00:04:42.200> so<00:04:43.300> it's

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
something in a couple months so it's

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.670 
something in a couple months so it's
like<00:04:44.450> he<00:04:44.570> always<00:04:44.690> said<00:04:44.990> if<00:04:45.290> you're<00:04:45.380> gonna<00:04:45.530> do

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
like he always said if you're gonna do

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.430 
like he always said if you're gonna do
it<00:04:45.800> right<00:04:45.950> do<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.550> right<00:04:46.670> the<00:04:46.880> first<00:04:47.060> time<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:48.410> I

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
it right do it right the first time so I

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.470 
it right do it right the first time so I
learned

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.600 

got<00:04:53.480> the<00:04:53.720> little<00:04:54.230> brackets<00:04:54.650> welded<00:04:55.160> and

and<00:04:57.430> how<00:04:58.180> this<00:04:58.420> will<00:04:58.690> work<00:04:58.750> is<00:04:59.320> I<00:04:59.620> will<00:04:59.980> just

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
and how this will work is I will just

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.690 
and how this will work is I will just
hide

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700
