00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.619 

we're<00:00:04.300> using<00:00:05.040> brand-new<00:00:06.040> technology<00:00:06.850> to

00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:07.629 
we're using brand-new technology to

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:10.709 
we're using brand-new technology to
approach<00:00:08.170> the<00:00:08.410> spine<00:00:08.710> and<00:00:09.010> and<00:00:09.820> when<00:00:10.389> I<00:00:10.420> say

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 
approach the spine and and when I say

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.320 
approach the spine and and when I say
brand-new<00:00:11.260> we're<00:00:11.740> talking<00:00:12.160> about<00:00:12.280> as<00:00:12.700> far<00:00:12.969> as

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
brand-new we're talking about as far as

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.859 
brand-new we're talking about as far as
we<00:00:13.480> can<00:00:13.630> tell<00:00:13.870> it's<00:00:14.200> not<00:00:14.290> been<00:00:14.650> done<00:00:14.679> anywhere

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:15.869 
we can tell it's not been done anywhere

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.380 
we can tell it's not been done anywhere
we<00:00:16.869> did<00:00:17.050> an<00:00:17.170> anterior<00:00:17.710> fusion<00:00:18.580> on<00:00:18.759> the<00:00:19.029> lumbar

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
we did an anterior fusion on the lumbar

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.630 
we did an anterior fusion on the lumbar
spine<00:00:19.419> the<00:00:19.960> lower<00:00:20.169> spine<00:00:20.829> what's<00:00:21.489> so

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
spine the lower spine what's so

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.130 
spine the lower spine what's so
different<00:00:21.880> is<00:00:22.180> the<00:00:22.300> use<00:00:22.480> of<00:00:22.509> the<00:00:22.720> DaVinci

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
different is the use of the DaVinci

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.290 
different is the use of the DaVinci
robot<00:00:23.320> instead<00:00:24.099> of<00:00:24.399> approaching<00:00:24.939> the<00:00:25.029> spine

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
robot instead of approaching the spine

through a relatively big open incision

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:30.269 
through a relatively big open incision
we're<00:00:27.579> able<00:00:27.759> to<00:00:28.119> now<00:00:28.509> use<00:00:28.750> a<00:00:28.779> robot<00:00:29.290> to<00:00:29.890> work

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
we're able to now use a robot to work

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.670 
we're able to now use a robot to work
our<00:00:30.489> way<00:00:30.640> down<00:00:30.880> to<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.239> spine<00:00:31.509> expose<00:00:32.439> the

of trials

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.849 
of trials
this<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.109> the<00:01:25.170> first<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.530> that's<00:01:25.649> done

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
this is the first one that's done

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.620 
this is the first one that's done
worldwide<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.579> a<00:01:26.700> big<00:01:27.000> deal<00:01:27.149> because<00:01:27.359> this

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
worldwide it is a big deal because this

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.840 
worldwide it is a big deal because this
could<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.929> the<00:01:28.049> very<00:01:28.079> beginning<00:01:28.679> of

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
could be the very beginning of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.819 
could be the very beginning of
modernizing<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.600> standard<00:01:31.289> technique<00:01:31.500> that

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
modernizing a standard technique that

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.099 
modernizing a standard technique that
we've<00:01:31.950> used<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.340> past<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.909> make<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.899> more

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
we've used in the past to make it more

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.529 
we've used in the past to make it more
accessible<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.130> patients<00:01:35.609> and<00:01:35.729> also<00:01:36.299> to

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
accessible to the patients and also to

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.510 
accessible to the patients and also to
allow<00:01:36.899> them<00:01:37.109> to<00:01:37.229> heal<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.469> lot<00:01:37.710> faster<00:01:37.770> right<00:01:38.340> in

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
allow them to heal a lot faster right in

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.969 
allow them to heal a lot faster right in
the<00:01:39.030> past<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.289> a<00:01:40.530> relatively

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
the past we do this with a relatively

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.980 
the past we do this with a relatively
large<00:01:41.250> incision<00:01:41.909> what<00:01:42.390> we're<00:01:42.539> trying<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.780> do

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
large incision what we're trying to do

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.169 
large incision what we're trying to do
is<00:01:43.200> use<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.619> robot<00:01:44.069> in<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.579> laparoscopic

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
is use the robot in a laparoscopic

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.029 
is use the robot in a laparoscopic
fashion<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.110> able<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.439> do<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.770> same

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
fashion to be able to do this same

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.330 
fashion to be able to do this same
procedure<00:01:47.420> through<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> minimally<00:01:49.020> invasive

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340

one-and-a-half inch incision all through

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.380 
one-and-a-half inch incision all through
surgery<00:01:52.380> you've<00:01:52.829> seen<00:01:53.100> steps<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.090> know<00:01:54.209> going

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
surgery you've seen steps you know going

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.779 
surgery you've seen steps you know going
from<00:01:54.569> open<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.229> laparoscopic<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.280> now<00:01:56.489> went

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
from open to laparoscopic we now went

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.819 
from open to laparoscopic we now went
