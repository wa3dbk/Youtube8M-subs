with ps3 with this I guess they used to
Sony<00:02:05.130> updated<00:02:05.850> their<00:02:06.030> firmware<00:02:06.659> or<00:02:06.899> whatever

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
Sony updated their firmware or whatever

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.650 
Sony updated their firmware or whatever
and<00:02:07.590> now<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:08.129> doesn't<00:02:08.580> work<00:02:08.789> directly<00:02:09.209> anymore

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
and now it doesn't work directly anymore

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.190 
and now it doesn't work directly anymore
so<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.470> get<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.890> console

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
so you have to get the console

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.390 
so you have to get the console
adapters<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:15.790> one<00:02:16.790> for<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.120> ps3<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:19.250> some

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
adapters the one for the ps3 for some

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.089 
adapters the one for the ps3 for some
reason<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:20.030> has<00:02:20.720> coming<00:02:21.319> out<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.739> I<00:02:21.769> have<00:02:22.069> it

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.190 
boy right here and I can actually show
you<00:03:09.799> how<00:03:10.099> that<00:03:10.310> works<00:03:10.420> so<00:03:11.420> just<00:03:11.660> like<00:03:11.870> on<00:03:12.049> an

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
you how that works so just like on an

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.430 
you how that works so just like on an
xbox<00:03:12.790> controller<00:03:13.790> where<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:14.840> lights<00:03:15.049> up<00:03:15.290> to

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
xbox controller where it lights up to

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.759 
xbox controller where it lights up to
tell<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:15.769> which<00:03:15.950> one<00:03:16.190> you're<00:03:16.400> on<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:18.560> hook

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
tell you which one you're on you hook

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.800 
tell you which one you're on you hook
this<00:03:18.920> up<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:19.579> lights<00:03:19.850> up<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.450> tell<00:03:20.660> you

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
this up and it lights up to tell you

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.930 
this up and it lights up to tell you
you're<00:03:21.109> in<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.799> know<00:03:21.920> controller<00:03:22.370> port<00:03:22.730> one

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
you're in you know controller port one

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.620 
you're in you know controller port one
two<00:03:23.500> three<00:03:24.500> or<00:03:24.620> four<00:03:24.859> so<00:03:25.069> you<00:03:25.130> can<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:26.480> can

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
two three or four so you can you can

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.099 
two three or four so you can you can
conceivably<00:03:26.959> get<00:03:27.380> up<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.769> four<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.160> these<00:03:28.250> and

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
conceivably get up to four of these and

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:36.090 
conceivably get up to four of these and
you<00:03:30.109> know<00:03:30.200> hook<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.560> up<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.709> your<00:03:30.829> xbox<00:03:31.340> 360<00:03:34.660> so

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
you know hook it up to your xbox 360 so

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.180 
you know hook it up to your xbox 360 so
yeah<00:03:37.100> on<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:37.430> one<00:03:37.639> I<00:03:37.670> went<00:03:38.000> with<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:39.799> reverse

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
yeah on this one I went with the reverse

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.770 
yeah on this one I went with the reverse
so<00:03:40.489> I<00:03:40.519> got<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:40.790> white<00:03:41.030> stick<00:03:41.359> with<00:03:41.600> white

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
so I got a white stick with white

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.069 
so I got a white stick with white
buttons<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.440> then<00:03:42.530> I<00:03:42.650> did<00:03:42.829> these<00:03:42.980> black<00:03:44.049> but<00:03:45.049> I

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
buttons and then I did these black but I

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.780 
buttons and then I did these black but I
did<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.410> same<00:03:45.440> thing<00:03:45.620> here<00:03:46.069> on<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.190> side<00:03:46.459> with

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
did the same thing here on the side with

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
did the same thing here on the side with
the<00:03:46.819> red<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:48.620> red<00:03:48.799> buttons<00:03:49.359> and<00:03:50.359> what<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.569> did

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
the red the red buttons and what I did

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.400 
the red the red buttons and what I did
why<00:03:51.410> did<00:03:51.680> them<00:03:51.829> clear<00:03:52.160> red<00:03:52.400> was<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.880> kind<00:03:53.090> of

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
why did them clear red was to kind of

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.920 
why did them clear red was to kind of
mock<00:03:54.579> arcade<00:03:55.579> cabinets<00:03:56.090> because<00:03:56.239> when<00:03:56.840> you

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
mock arcade cabinets because when you

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.129 
mock arcade cabinets because when you
use<00:03:57.079> this<00:03:57.230> with<00:03:57.470> name<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.910> side<00:03:59.180> buttons<00:03:59.630> are

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
use this with name the side buttons are

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.039 
use this with name the side buttons are
typically<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:01.459> coin<00:04:01.849> button<00:04:02.359> so<00:04:02.720> when<00:04:02.959> you

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
typically the coin button so when you

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.140 
typically the coin button so when you
adding<00:04:03.380> a<00:04:03.500> quarter<00:04:03.889> to<00:04:04.130> our<00:04:04.310> cade<00:04:04.579> machine<00:04:04.940> so

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
adding a quarter to our cade machine so

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.640 
adding a quarter to our cade machine so
I<00:04:05.180> kind<00:04:05.420> of<00:04:05.450> wanted<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:05.959> emulate<00:04:06.410> that

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
I kind of wanted that to emulate that

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.650 
I kind of wanted that to emulate that
and<00:04:06.950> I<00:04:07.099> thought<00:04:07.880> it<00:04:08.030> kind<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.269> looked<00:04:08.450> cool

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
and I thought it kind of looked cool

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.259 
and I thought it kind of looked cool
with<00:04:08.930> kind<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.319> tied<00:04:09.530> in<00:04:09.709> with<00:04:09.739> that<00:04:10.120> and<00:04:11.120> the

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
with kind of tied in with that and the

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.819 
with kind of tied in with that and the
reason<00:04:11.389> why<00:04:11.630> I<00:04:11.690> did<00:04:11.870> this<00:04:12.019> one<00:04:12.230> clear<00:04:12.560> in<00:04:12.739> the

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
reason why I did this one clear in the

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.710 
reason why I did this one clear in the
back<00:04:13.010> here<00:04:13.400> was<00:04:14.030> because<00:04:14.120> this<00:04:14.329> button<00:04:14.599> really

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
back here was because this button really

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.190 
back here was because this button really
doesn't<00:04:15.079> do<00:04:15.230> anything<00:04:15.650> it<00:04:16.340> just<00:04:16.579> kind<00:04:16.789> of<00:04:16.849> like

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
doesn't do anything it just kind of like

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.120 
doesn't do anything it just kind of like
initiates<00:04:18.200> it<00:04:18.349> when<00:04:18.590> you<00:04:18.709> go<00:04:18.859> onto<00:04:19.039> the

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
initiates it when you go onto the

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.200 
initiates it when you go onto the
computer<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:20.079> also<00:04:21.079> when<00:04:21.229> I<00:04:21.260> was<00:04:21.440> programming

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
computer and also when I was programming

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.390 
computer and also when I was programming
this<00:04:23.210> controller<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:24.020> be<00:04:24.140> number<00:04:24.380> two

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
this controller to be number two

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.530 
this controller to be number two
you<00:04:26.400> have<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.670> use<00:04:26.850> that<00:04:27.060> so<00:04:27.240> it's<00:04:27.360> kind<00:04:27.480> of

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
you have to use that so it's kind of

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.690 
you have to use that so it's kind of
just<00:04:27.630> like<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.810> mode<00:04:28.080> button<00:04:28.500> so<00:04:29.280> when<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.460> want

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
just like a mode button so when I want

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
just like a mode button so when I want
to<00:04:29.790> use<00:04:29.910> this<00:04:30.180> one<00:04:30.420> as<00:04:30.480> as<00:04:31.020> player<00:04:31.500> too<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:32.720> can

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
to use this one as as player too I can

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.040 
to use this one as as player too I can
just<00:04:34.460> flick<00:04:35.460> this<00:04:35.640> lever<00:04:35.910> right<00:04:36.120> here<00:04:36.180> but

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
just flick this lever right here but

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.020 
just flick this lever right here but
that<00:04:37.170> that's<00:04:37.500> only<00:04:37.770> for<00:04:38.040> me<00:04:38.190> whenever<00:04:38.730> you're

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
that that's only for me whenever you're

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.060 
that that's only for me whenever you're
using<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.360> with<00:04:39.480> a<00:04:39.510> game<00:04:39.720> console<00:04:40.350> it<00:04:40.710> already

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
using it with a game console it already

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.470 
using it with a game console it already
knows<00:04:41.220> what<00:04:41.430> to<00:04:41.550> do<00:04:41.700> and<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.030> would<00:04:42.150> never

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
knows what to do and you would never

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.900 
knows what to do and you would never
have<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.960> mess<00:04:43.110> with<00:04:43.320> that<00:04:43.410> thing<00:04:43.610> at<00:04:44.610> all<00:04:44.790> so<00:04:45.330> I

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
have to mess with that thing at all so I

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.890 
have to mess with that thing at all so I
also<00:04:47.910> in<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.300> last<00:04:49.200> video<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:51.000> told<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.780> guys

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
also in the last video I told you guys

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.600 
also in the last video I told you guys
how<00:04:52.170> I<00:04:52.200> had<00:04:52.470> switched<00:04:52.710> out<00:04:52.920> the<00:04:52.950> buttons<00:04:53.430> and

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
how I had switched out the buttons and

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.060 
how I had switched out the buttons and
stuff<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.540> I<00:04:55.020> kind<00:04:55.410> of<00:04:55.470> just<00:04:55.620> wanted<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:55.920> show

between<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:59.010> microswitch<00:04:59.670> that<00:05:00.030> comes<00:05:00.240> with

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
between the microswitch that comes with

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.810 
between the microswitch that comes with
it<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.710> ones<00:05:01.890> that<00:05:01.980> I<00:05:02.100> put<00:05:02.370> on<00:05:02.490> this<00:05:02.520> is

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820

it and the ones that I put on this is
just<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.120> standard<00:05:03.540> button<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:04.020> came<00:05:04.260> with

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
just the standard button that came with

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.490 
just the standard button that came with
it<00:05:05.240> in<00:05:06.240> these<00:05:06.390> micro<00:05:06.750> switches<00:05:06.990> they<00:05:07.290> just

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
it in these micro switches they just

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.740 
it in these micro switches they just
click<00:05:07.740> into<00:05:08.100> into<00:05:08.730> there<00:05:09.560> but<00:05:10.560> this<00:05:10.740> is<00:05:10.980> a<00:05:11.750> if

original cherry micro switch and this is

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.860 
original cherry micro switch and this is
what<00:05:28.100> was<00:05:29.100> in<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.340> arcade<00:05:29.760> cabinets<00:05:30.390> that<00:05:30.720> we

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
to the cliq difference between this one

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.170 
to the cliq difference between this one
and<00:05:44.480> this<00:05:45.480> one<00:05:46.160> you<00:05:47.160> can<00:05:47.190> just<00:05:47.490> you<00:05:47.880> can<00:05:47.910> just

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
hear and feel how much cheaper this one

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.900 
hear and feel how much cheaper this one
sounds<00:05:51.920> compared<00:05:52.920> to<00:05:52.950> it<00:05:53.130> this<00:05:53.400> has<00:05:53.550> got<00:05:53.730> like

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
sounds compared to it this has got like

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.720 
sounds compared to it this has got like
a<00:05:53.940> hollow<00:05:54.270> tinny<00:05:54.690> sound<00:05:55.160> and<00:05:56.160> this<00:05:56.370> is<00:05:56.550> like<00:05:56.700> a

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
a hollow tinny sound and this is like a

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.510 
a hollow tinny sound and this is like a
real<00:05:57.000> distinguish<00:05:57.630> click<00:05:57.960> so<00:05:58.320> I<00:05:58.350> mean<00:05:58.620> the

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
real distinguish click so I mean the

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.900 
real distinguish click so I mean the
difference<00:05:59.960> when<00:06:00.960> you're<00:06:01.080> playing<00:06:01.350> I<00:06:01.910> mean

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
difference when you're playing I mean

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.750 
difference when you're playing I mean
it's<00:06:03.440> and<00:06:04.440> when<00:06:04.710> it<00:06:04.830> has<00:06:04.950> these<00:06:05.160> micro

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
it's and when it has these micro

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.640 
it's and when it has these micro
switches<00:06:05.940> in<00:06:06.210> here<00:06:06.510> it<00:06:06.780> feels<00:06:07.020> really<00:06:07.320> mushy

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
switches in here it feels really mushy

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.880 
switches in here it feels really mushy
when<00:06:08.490> when<00:06:08.940> it's<00:06:09.180> got<00:06:09.330> the<00:06:09.620> cherries<00:06:10.620> in<00:06:10.770> there

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
when when it's got the cherries in there

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.480 
when when it's got the cherries in there

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
man it's just I mean it's just solid so

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.540 
man it's just I mean it's just solid so
and<00:06:15.360> then<00:06:15.810> in<00:06:15.990> the<00:06:16.320> last<00:06:16.470> video<00:06:16.710> I<00:06:16.920> had<00:06:17.220> also
