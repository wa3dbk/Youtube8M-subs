bolt actually leads to a rod which runs
the<00:01:33.060> entire<00:01:33.119> length<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> guitar<00:01:34.170> neck

the<00:01:52.619> neck<00:01:52.770> will<00:01:52.920> actually<00:01:53.189> turn<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> little<00:01:53.790> bit

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
the neck will actually turn a little bit

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.389 
the neck will actually turn a little bit
convex<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.680> other<00:01:55.860> direction<00:01:56.070> will

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
convex and the other direction will

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.969 
convex and the other direction will
it'll<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.790> concave<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.899> what<00:01:58.799> you're<00:01:58.950> really

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it'll be concave so what you're really

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.609 
it'll be concave so what you're really
trying<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.460> do<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.939> sort<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.750> assess<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
trying to do is sort of assess the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.310 
trying to do is sort of assess the
distance<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.579> how<00:02:02.729> far<00:02:02.759> your<00:02:03.689> strings<00:02:04.020> are<00:02:04.140> off

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
distance of how far your strings are off

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.780 
distance of how far your strings are off
your<00:02:04.500> fretboard<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:05.009> they're<00:02:05.159> very<00:02:05.369> far<00:02:05.670> off

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
your fretboard if they're very far off

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.190 
your fretboard if they're very far off
your<00:02:05.939> fretboard<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.540> see<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.840> shot<00:02:07.049> up

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
your fretboard you can see the shot up

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.050 
your fretboard you can see the shot up
on<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> screen<00:02:07.710> right<00:02:07.740> now<00:02:08.099> where<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
on the screen right now where the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.699 
on the screen right now where the
strings<00:02:09.330> are<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.629> too<00:02:09.840> far<00:02:10.110> above<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
strings are just too far above the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.530 
strings are just too far above the
fretboard<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.760> could<00:02:11.879> lead<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.060> intonation

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
fretboard that could lead to intonation

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.520 
fretboard that could lead to intonation
problems<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.170> it's<00:02:13.260> just

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
problems and it's just

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.890 
problems and it's just
generally<00:02:13.890> difficult<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.459> play<00:02:14.760> if<00:02:15.750> your

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
generally difficult to play if your

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.150 
generally difficult to play if your
strings<00:02:16.140> are<00:02:16.260> too<00:02:16.380> close<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.950> fretboard

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
strings are too close to the fretboard

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.370 
strings are too close to the fretboard
your<00:02:17.760> notes<00:02:17.970> will<00:02:18.150> buzz<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:19.050> just<00:02:19.260> won't

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
your notes will buzz and it just won't

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.510 
your notes will buzz and it just won't
sound<00:02:19.709> good<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.010> get<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> lot<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.310> buzzing

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
sound good you get a lot of buzzing

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.920 
sound good you get a lot of buzzing
notes<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:20.940> if<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.090> try<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.270> bend<00:02:21.540> strings

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
notes and if you try to bend strings

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.570 
notes and if you try to bend strings
they'll<00:02:22.200> definitely<00:02:22.350> fret<00:02:22.800> out<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.490> you<00:02:23.550> just

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
they'll definitely fret out so you just

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.070 
they'll definitely fret out so you just
want<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.850> get<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.120> happy<00:02:24.420> medium<00:02:24.810> where<00:02:24.930> it's

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
want to get that happy medium where it's

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.720 
want to get that happy medium where it's
the<00:02:25.290> strings<00:02:25.680> are<00:02:25.800> just<00:02:25.830> exactly<00:02:26.490> where<00:02:26.610> they

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
the strings are just exactly where they

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.809 
the strings are just exactly where they
need<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:26.910> be<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:28.490> adjusting<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.550> truss<00:02:29.730> rod

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
need to be and adjusting the truss rod

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.970 
need to be and adjusting the truss rod
again<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.300> kind<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.720> first<00:02:30.989> step<00:02:31.350> when

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
again is kind of the first step when

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.260 
again is kind of the first step when
you're<00:02:32.100> when<00:02:32.340> you're<00:02:32.370> really<00:02:32.910> trying<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.150> get

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
you're when you're really trying to get

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.390 
you're when you're really trying to get
the<00:02:33.420> guitar<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.810> play<00:02:34.020> right<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:35.010> if<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.220> were<00:02:35.310> to

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
the guitar to play right so if I were to

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.220 
the guitar to play right so if I were to
turn<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.790> like<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.780> can<00:02:36.900> see<00:02:36.989> I'm<00:02:37.080> just

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
turn it like this you can see I'm just

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.900 
turn it like this you can see I'm just
using<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.500> couple<00:02:37.830> fingers<00:02:38.010> for<00:02:38.370> pressure<00:02:38.610> just

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
using a couple fingers for pressure just

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.760 
using a couple fingers for pressure just
kind<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.330> quarter<00:02:39.720> turn<00:02:39.900> that's<00:02:40.500> actually

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
kind of a quarter turn that's actually

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.260 
kind of a quarter turn that's actually
going<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.920> make<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.100> pretty<00:02:41.370> dramatic<00:02:41.610> change

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
going to make a pretty dramatic change

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.900 
going to make a pretty dramatic change
in<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.440> neck<00:02:43.620> believe<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.100> or<00:02:44.160> not<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.489> then

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
in the neck believe it or not and then

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.820 
in the neck believe it or not and then
if<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.090> were<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.209> take<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.420> back<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.050> move<00:02:46.709> it

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
if I were to take it back and move it

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.740 
if I were to take it back and move it
the<00:02:46.920> other<00:02:47.070> direction<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.550> same<00:02:47.760> idea<00:02:48.030> what

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
the other direction the same idea what

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.970 
the other direction the same idea what
I'm<00:02:48.840> really<00:02:49.019> trying<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.350> get<00:02:49.440> across<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.950> that

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
I'm really trying to get across is that

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.860 
I'm really trying to get across is that
you<00:02:50.190> never<00:02:50.459> ever<00:02:50.640> want<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.360> really<00:02:51.630> get<00:02:51.780> in

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
you never ever want to really get in

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.660 
you never ever want to really get in
there<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:52.260> pull<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:52.950> truss<00:02:53.400> rod<00:02:53.580> as

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
there and just pull that truss rod as

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.860 
there and just pull that truss rod as
hard<00:02:53.910> as<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.120> can<00:02:54.269> with<00:02:54.420> all<00:02:54.570> your<00:02:54.720> might

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
hard as you can with all your might

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.680 
hard as you can with all your might
that'll<00:02:55.140> definitely<00:02:55.380> break<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.070> rod<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:57.510> if

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
that'll definitely break the rod so if

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.090 
that'll definitely break the rod so if
you<00:02:57.780> kind<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.019> have<00:02:58.200> more<00:02:58.410> than<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.739> couple

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
you kind of have more than that couple

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.890 
you kind of have more than that couple
fingers<00:02:59.310> pressure<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.510> know<00:03:00.600> if<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.720> have<00:03:00.810> to

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
fingers pressure you know if you have to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.590 
fingers pressure you know if you have to
do<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.050> little<00:03:01.170> more<00:03:01.410> than<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.739> then<00:03:02.640> if<00:03:03.420> it's

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
do a little more than that then if it's

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.790 
do a little more than that then if it's
still<00:03:03.810> not<00:03:03.930> helping<00:03:04.140> your<00:03:04.380> guitar<00:03:04.680> you

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
pressure the other thing about it too is

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.479 
pressure the other thing about it too is
as<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.360> move<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.900> truss<00:03:19.110> rod<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.680> little<00:03:20.130> bit

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
as you move the truss rod a little bit

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.850 
as you move the truss rod a little bit
like<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.670> maybe<00:03:20.940> just<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.239> quarter<00:03:21.600> turn<00:03:21.860> you

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
like that maybe just a quarter turn you

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.740 
like that maybe just a quarter turn you
want<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.070> let<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.280> guitar<00:03:23.549> sit<00:03:23.880> maybe<00:03:24.239> even<00:03:24.510> an

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
want to let the guitar sit maybe even an

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.440 
want to let the guitar sit maybe even an
hour<00:03:24.989> or<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.500> before<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.190> come<00:03:26.370> back<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:26.760> you

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
hour or so before you come back and you

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.880 
hour or so before you come back and you
know<00:03:27.540> generally<00:03:28.110> you'll<00:03:28.230> see<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.440> difference

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
know generally you'll see a difference

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.060 
know generally you'll see a difference
immediately<00:03:29.340> but<00:03:29.489> it'll<00:03:29.700> really<00:03:30.829> set<00:03:31.829> the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
immediately but it'll really set the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.640 
immediately but it'll really set the
neck<00:03:32.280> will<00:03:32.700> kind<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:32.970> adjust<00:03:33.420> its<00:03:34.230> wood<00:03:34.470> after

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
neck will kind of adjust its wood after

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.710 
neck will kind of adjust its wood after
all<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.310> it'll<00:03:36.000> kind<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.269> just<00:03:36.480> come<00:03:36.630> back

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
all so it'll kind of a just come back

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.569 
all so it'll kind of a just come back
after<00:03:36.930> like<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.200> half<00:03:37.440> hour<00:03:37.650> an<00:03:37.890> hour<00:03:38.010> play<00:03:38.430> it

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
after like a half hour an hour play it

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.250 
after like a half hour an hour play it
check<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:38.880> out<00:03:39.000> if<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.480> needs<00:03:39.690> more<00:03:39.930> or<00:03:39.959> less

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
check it out if it needs more or less

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.890 
check it out if it needs more or less
truss<00:03:40.530> rod<00:03:40.709> adjustment<00:03:41.329> give<00:03:42.329> it<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.480> shot<00:03:42.720> but

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
truss rod adjustment give it a shot but

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.270 
truss rod adjustment give it a shot but
again<00:03:43.260> if<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.650> use<00:03:43.739> too<00:03:43.920> much<00:03:43.950> pressure

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
again if you use too much pressure

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.430 
again if you use too much pressure
that's<00:03:45.150> that's<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.660> bad<00:03:45.900> idea

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
that's that's a bad idea

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.640 
that's that's a bad idea
and<00:03:47.310> generally<00:03:48.120> speaking<00:03:48.329> if<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:49.079> guitar<00:03:49.380> needs

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
and generally speaking if a guitar needs

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.069 
and generally speaking if a guitar needs
a<00:03:49.890> truss<00:03:50.160> rod<00:03:50.310> adjustment<00:03:50.340> where<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.630> really

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
a truss rod adjustment where you really

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.569 
a truss rod adjustment where you really
have<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.440> go<00:03:52.560> in<00:03:52.709> there<00:03:52.829> and<00:03:52.920> kind<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.160> use<00:03:53.340> all

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
have to go in there and kind of use all

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.940 
have to go in there and kind of use all
your<00:03:53.820> might<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.299> turn<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.870> truss<00:03:55.049> rod<00:03:55.140> then

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
your might to turn the truss rod then

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.920 
your might to turn the truss rod then
the<00:03:56.160> truss<00:03:56.640> rod<00:03:56.730> itself<00:03:57.090> really<00:03:57.540> isn't<00:03:57.720> the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
the truss rod itself really isn't the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.259 
the truss rod itself really isn't the
problem<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.680> neck<00:03:58.890> might<00:03:59.130> be<00:03:59.310> warped<00:03:59.670> it

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
problem the neck might be warped it

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.849 
problem the neck might be warped it
might<00:04:00.480> need<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.690> whole<00:04:00.900> fret<00:04:01.170> job<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.650> frets

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
might need a whole fret job the frets

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.610 
might need a whole fret job the frets
might<00:04:02.040> need<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.280> be<00:04:02.400> adjusted<00:04:02.489> or<00:04:03.620> something

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
might need to be adjusted or something

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.170 
might need to be adjusted or something
as<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.799> bridge<00:04:05.400> height<00:04:05.609> might<00:04:05.850> need<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.090> be

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
as the bridge height might need to be

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.660 
as the bridge height might need to be
adjusted<00:04:06.660> as<00:04:06.780> well<00:04:07.130> so<00:04:08.130> there's<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.370> few<00:04:08.519> other

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
adjusted as well so there's a few other

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.310 
adjusted as well so there's a few other
things<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.970> can<00:04:09.150> do<00:04:09.329> and<00:04:09.570> that's<00:04:10.140> a<00:04:10.230> little

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
things you can do and that's a little

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:19.720 
things you can do and that's a little
bit<00:04:10.440> about<00:04:10.709> understanding<00:04:11.340> your<00:04:11.400> truss<00:04:11.760> rod

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.660 

[Music]

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.770 

that<00:04:24.670> starts<00:04:24.910> with<00:04:24.940> a<00:04:25.060> hammer<00:04:25.270> on<00:04:25.390> from<00:04:25.510> the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
that starts with a hammer on from the

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.180 
that starts with a hammer on from the
seventh<00:04:26.140> to<00:04:26.200> the<00:04:26.380> ninth<00:04:26.650> fret<00:04:26.920> on<00:04:27.100> the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
seventh to the ninth fret on the

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.090 
seventh to the ninth fret on the
third-string

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
third-string

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.450 
third-string
and<00:04:29.690> then<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.990> eighth<00:04:31.500> fret<00:04:31.740> on<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.070> second

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
and then the eighth fret on the second

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.190 
and then the eighth fret on the second
string<00:04:35.240> so<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.300> really<00:04:36.480> think<00:04:36.600> of<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:37.020> has

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
string so I really think of that it has

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.470 
string so I really think of that it has
three<00:04:37.560> different<00:04:37.680> little<00:04:38.520> sections<00:04:38.730> that

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
three different little sections that

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.970 
three different little sections that
make<00:04:39.630> that<00:04:39.810> whole<00:04:39.960> starting<00:04:40.680> at<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:40.860> first

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
make that whole starting at the first

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:52.160 
make that whole starting at the first
section<00:04:46.820> meld<00:04:47.990> everyone<00:04:49.160> Houston
