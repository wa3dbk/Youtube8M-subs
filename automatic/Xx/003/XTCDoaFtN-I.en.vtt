00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.129
 om 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.519
 this is the dutroux file and today we find ourselves as the second of 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.990
 stoner why do you fall on hard lane laugh 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.990
 so it takes a very big final 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.470
 so I will not go up like that 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.960
 jumping 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.810
 and that's it for me more and it's chic 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.039
 but the% stamps 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.499
 a Swiss team united develop 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.499
 and percent he continued below 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.540
 make 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.600
 put a little beating and at least in a couloir couloir 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.260
 prevent 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
 moreover each passage 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.559
 I will show you 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.559
 the sic circuit yesterday I already set up 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.460
 the button and works 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.820
 so for now nothing any circuit alone 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.550
 to do this 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.480
 you will need a button 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.740
 if trap 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.720
 and money from the soneb a disc does not squeeze a delirium 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.620
 excuse me 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.020
 a material 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.020
 that you want me I mythical such as 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.990
 of the earth 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.370
 I dug % 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.930
 Tunisian justice 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.930
 I'll show you what it's used for later 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.770
 so we'll start on this side it's easier 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.750
 put me here 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.950
 we kill 6 th 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.950
 the good rhythm 4 external source 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.240
 must put the art and his little forgiveness this blog because the seven-island sono 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.860
 current pastor and al distributes current in this block 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.640
 and in this block the liana 1 4 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.640
 that's why it takes 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 for it to be mutated 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.740
 it's a statistics and transfer 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.650
 regularly anticipates that these will confess to you that a policy 5 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.149
 so that's wrong 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:34.549
 this type of structure 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.549
 I thank for all because I had broken 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.599
 we must not forget to put 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.009
 more like that 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.949
 because otherwise the ideas 3% and the three arrivals to restore 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.019
 e they do not carry right in the goal is to go block her death actually 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:54.840
 example 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.689
 there we see that it suggests that these people love this club 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.439
 suarez 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.859
 this departure rather actually calls the pseudo relic 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.389
 we must not forget the multihull 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.919
 so I have stoll knuckle connected 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.919
 at the button 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.629
 enormously the koffi side is really 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.499
 perfect 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:23.499
 then it's a bit the same on the right side 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.429
 we'll have to 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:30.079
 besides a small peculiarity 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.449
 sykes 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.449
 Lafleur pass below or it can happen again 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:38.679
 which are connected to the same buttons 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.459
 continue 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:54.469
 sign 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.479
 ap 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.919
 so 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.919
 may be able to do 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.259
 in this sense she who is criticized 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:11.029
 especially not to forget that it is easier it will not work 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:14.939
 you do a little like that 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.939
 but if you pass here 2 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:20.939
 what is perhaps the desire 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:23.059
 because if not why 

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:26.089
 the legitimacy 15 the safest to rush 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.129
 I activate my circuit to be able to 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.129
 at which level I will leave the premises 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.150
 classic we heard screaming so it should be good 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.509
 and a small ferry 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:57.259
 l 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.099
 not only 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.870
 this 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.889
 according to fitch 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.499
 in fact I am disappointed 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:10.259
 of paula ended up happening early m 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.259
 we find ourselves on the ground a so the video project 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:16.650
 I hello to the days 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.650
 who are these servers 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.680
 hoping he answers 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.680
 subscribe put green shoots commented 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.289
 Kurds 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.770
 I could not say no do not worry 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.759
 and so 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.759
 turning 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.129
 make love and almost a third 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.870
 even if you are already coming he would be typing subscribe 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.039
 invited friends you see 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.490
 a + 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.729
 it's a theme 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.699
 do not even look at both according to m 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.839
 Alas 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:05.089
 map
