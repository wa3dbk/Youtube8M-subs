00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
reason why you'll get you know the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.370 
reason why you'll get you know the
occasional<00:01:11.670> hit<00:01:12.150> marker<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.110> far<00:01:13.230> as<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
occasional hit marker now as far as the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.750 
occasional hit marker now as far as the
magazine<00:01:13.710> size<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.070> weapon<00:01:14.400> goes<00:01:14.520> it's

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
magazine size on this weapon goes it's

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.580 
magazine size on this weapon goes it's
10<00:01:15.000> rounds<00:01:15.330> which<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.570> pretty<00:01:15.720> great<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.410> only

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
10 rounds which is pretty great the only

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.100 
10 rounds which is pretty great the only
better<00:01:16.920> weapon<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.670> think<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> RS<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.540> SS<00:01:18.960> at

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
better weapon I think is the RS a SS at

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.050 
better weapon I think is the RS a SS at
about<00:01:19.290> 20<00:01:19.590> rounds<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.400> reload<00:01:20.760> time<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
about 20 rounds now the reload time of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.180 
about 20 rounds now the reload time of
the<00:01:21.120> swept<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.540> something<00:01:21.900> that's<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.350> guess

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
the swept in is something that's I guess

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.890 
the swept in is something that's I guess
it's<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.520> only<00:01:23.700> roll<00:01:24.030> con<00:01:24.300> with<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.600> weapon

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it's the only roll con with the weapon

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.540 
it's the only roll con with the weapon
and<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.350> at<00:01:25.470> three<00:01:25.650> point<00:01:25.890> nine<00:01:25.950> seconds<00:01:26.490> so

the rate of fire guys is 1200 which is
absolutely<00:02:32.050> crazy<00:02:32.320> it's<00:02:32.890> actually<00:02:33.190> faster

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
absolutely crazy it's actually faster

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.250

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
data out of all the sniper rifles and it

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.470 
data out of all the sniper rifles and it
also<00:03:32.800> has<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.190> fastest<00:03:33.670> reloading<00:03:34.030> time<00:03:34.270> out

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
also has the fastest reloading time out

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.610 
also has the fastest reloading time out
of<00:03:34.600> all<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.840> side<00:03:35.020> profiles<00:03:35.350> or<00:03:35.470> it's

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
of all the side profiles or it's

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.230 
of all the side profiles or it's
actually<00:03:35.680> one<00:03:35.950> of<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.100> fastest<00:03:36.550> so<00:03:36.730> once

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
actually one of the fastest so once

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.180 
actually one of the fastest so once
again<00:03:37.330> big<00:03:37.720> thumbs<00:03:37.960> up<00:03:38.050> on<00:03:38.200> that<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.560> also<00:03:38.920> the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
again big thumbs up on that and also the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.920 
again big thumbs up on that and also the
rate<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.520> fire<00:03:39.670> is<00:03:39.850> 1,200<00:03:40.420> rounds<00:03:40.570> per<00:03:40.810> minute

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
rate of fire is 1,200 rounds per minute

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.900 
rate of fire is 1,200 rounds per minute
so<00:03:41.440> basically<00:03:41.860> you<00:03:42.100> can<00:03:42.220> end<00:03:42.460> up<00:03:42.580> using<00:03:42.700> this

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
so basically you can end up using this

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.390 
so basically you can end up using this
weapon<00:03:43.090> as<00:03:43.330> almost<00:03:43.690> like<00:03:43.780> an<00:03:43.990> assault<00:03:44.290> rifle

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
weapon as almost like an assault rifle

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.470 
weapon as almost like an assault rifle

these<00:03:59.140> weapons<00:03:59.530> in<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.710> comments<00:04:00.100> section

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
these weapons in the comments section

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.720 
these weapons in the comments section
below

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
below

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.040 
below
but<00:04:01.090> first<00:04:01.270> off<00:04:01.390> you<00:04:01.540> will<00:04:01.660> unlock<00:04:01.840> this

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
but first off you will unlock this

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.200 
but first off you will unlock this
weapon<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.410> level<00:04:02.620> 66<00:04:03.160> so<00:04:03.550> it<00:04:03.700> is<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.910> last

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
weapon to level 66 so it is the last

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.670 
weapon to level 66 so it is the last
weapon<00:04:04.570> that<00:04:04.660> you'll<00:04:04.810> lock<00:04:04.990> in<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.470> sniper

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
weapon that you'll lock in the sniper

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.070 
weapon that you'll lock in the sniper
rifle<00:04:05.950> category<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.730> base<00:04:06.910> damage<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.330> 98<00:04:07.690> the

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
rifle category the base damage is 98 the

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.290 
rifle category the base damage is 98 the
magazine<00:04:08.470> size<00:04:08.650> is<00:04:08.830> 5<00:04:09.010> rounds<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:10.000> reload

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
magazine size is 5 rounds and the reload

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.090 
magazine size is 5 rounds and the reload
time<00:04:10.510> is<00:04:10.540> 2.2<00:04:11.140> seconds<00:04:11.650> now<00:04:11.770> the<00:04:11.830> only

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
time is 2.2 seconds now the only

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.800 
time is 2.2 seconds now the only
difference<00:04:12.400> between<00:04:12.490> this<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.210> L<00:04:13.330> 11<00:04:13.690> is

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
difference between this and the L 11 is

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.630 
difference between this and the L 11 is
first<00:04:14.260> off<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.500> reload<00:04:14.830> time<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.460> rate

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
first off the reload time and the rate

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.700 
first off the reload time and the rate
of<00:04:15.670> fire<00:04:15.970> both<00:04:16.600> are<00:04:16.900> a<00:04:16.960> little<00:04:17.290> bit<00:04:17.380> better<00:04:17.590> on

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:17.710 
of fire both are a little bit better on

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.229 
of fire both are a little bit better on
the<00:04:17.830> MSR<00:04:18.430> you're<00:04:18.549> going<00:04:18.670> to<00:04:18.730> get<00:04:18.820> a<00:04:18.850> faster

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
the MSR you're going to get a faster

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.660 
the MSR you're going to get a faster
reload<00:04:19.420> and<00:04:19.750> also<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.440> rate<00:04:20.560> of<00:04:20.680> fire<00:04:20.799> is<00:04:21.040> 66

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
reload and also the rate of fire is 66

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.970 
reload and also the rate of fire is 66
compared<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.120> 50<00:04:22.420> which<00:04:22.840> is<00:04:22.870> on<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.260> 11

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
compared to 50 which is on the 11

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.890 
compared to 50 which is on the 11
now<00:04:24.700> with<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:24.970> information<00:04:25.540> being<00:04:25.720> put<00:04:25.870> out

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
now with that information being put out

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.120 
now with that information being put out
there<00:04:25.990> guys<00:04:26.290> I'm<00:04:26.470> going<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.680> talk<00:04:26.770> about<00:04:26.920> my

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
there guys I'm going to talk about my

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.440 
there guys I'm going to talk about my
basic<00:04:27.490> breakdown<00:04:27.670> of<00:04:27.880> what<00:04:28.060> I<00:04:28.120> think<00:04:28.180> is<00:04:28.360> the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
basic breakdown of what I think is the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.640 
basic breakdown of what I think is the
best<00:04:28.630> bolt<00:04:28.900> action<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.620> best

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
best bolt action and the best

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.469 
best bolt action and the best
semi-automatic<00:04:30.580> sniper<00:04:30.669> rifles<00:04:31.120> within<00:04:31.360> the

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
semi-automatic sniper rifles within the

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.360 
semi-automatic sniper rifles within the
game<00:04:31.630> so<00:04:32.169> first<00:04:32.350> off<00:04:32.590> as<00:04:32.710> far<00:04:32.979> as<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.220> best

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
game so first off as far as the best

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.110 
game so first off as far as the best
bolt-action<00:04:33.910> goes<00:04:34.090> I<00:04:34.210> chose<00:04:34.600> EMS

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
bolt-action goes I chose EMS

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.790 
bolt-action goes I chose EMS
the<00:04:35.389> reason<00:04:35.630> why<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:35.750> chose<00:04:35.930> this<00:04:36.110> over<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.560> l11

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
the reason why I chose this over the l11

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.800 
the reason why I chose this over the l11
was<00:04:37.160> first<00:04:37.340> off<00:04:37.490> it<00:04:37.820> has<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:38.060> better<00:04:38.300> reload

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
was first off it has a better reload

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.080 
was first off it has a better reload
time<00:04:39.020> any<00:04:39.260> faster<00:04:39.860> race<00:04:40.070> time<00:04:40.310> those<00:04:40.850> are<00:04:40.880> two

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
time any faster race time those are two

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.250 
time any faster race time those are two
things<00:04:41.330> that<00:04:41.449> are<00:04:41.479> pretty<00:04:41.780> key<00:04:41.990> wasn't

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
things that are pretty key wasn't

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.870 
things that are pretty key wasn't
killing<00:04:42.560> people<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:42.919> it<00:04:43.010> also<00:04:43.250> has<00:04:43.550> a<00:04:43.580> better

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
killing people and it also has a better

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.340 
killing people and it also has a better
rate<00:04:44.060> of<00:04:44.090> fire<00:04:44.330> so<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.600> more<00:04:44.780> bullets<00:04:45.260> that

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
rate of fire so the more bullets that

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.810 
rate of fire so the more bullets that
you<00:04:45.440> can<00:04:45.530> put<00:04:45.650> out<00:04:45.770> you<00:04:46.190> know<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.460> less<00:04:46.610> chance

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
you can put out you know the less chance

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.550 
you can put out you know the less chance
of<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.030> dying<00:04:47.060> now<00:04:47.840> as<00:04:47.960> far<00:04:48.080> as<00:04:48.139> a<00:04:48.290> best

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
of you dying now as far as a best

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.290 
of you dying now as far as a best
semi-auto<00:04:49.160> goes<00:04:49.370> I<00:04:49.490> chose<00:04:49.669> to<00:04:49.760> bury<00:04:49.880> 50<00:04:50.150> Cal

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
semi-auto goes I chose to bury 50 Cal

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.850 
semi-auto goes I chose to bury 50 Cal
for<00:04:50.449> two<00:04:50.570> reasons<00:04:50.930> first<00:04:51.169> off<00:04:51.290> it's<00:04:51.590> the

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
for two reasons first off it's the

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.710 
for two reasons first off it's the
highest<00:04:52.280> damage<00:04:52.430> semi-auto<00:04:53.090> sniper<00:04:53.180> rifle

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
highest damage semi-auto sniper rifle

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.870 
highest damage semi-auto sniper rifle
and<00:04:53.900> of<00:04:54.440> course<00:04:54.710> it's<00:04:54.889> also<00:04:55.190> up<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:55.699> up<00:04:55.790> with

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
and of course it's also up and up with

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.590 
and of course it's also up and up with
the<00:04:56.000> as50

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
the as50

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.240 
the as50
but<00:04:57.050> it<00:04:57.169> actually<00:04:57.590> has<00:04:57.680> a<00:04:57.710> very<00:04:57.800> consistent

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
but it actually has a very consistent

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.370 
but it actually has a very consistent
recoil<00:04:58.820> and<00:04:59.000> it<00:04:59.120> also<00:04:59.300> has<00:04:59.510> a<00:04:59.540> very<00:04:59.870> faster

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
recoil and it also has a very faster

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.290 
recoil and it also has a very faster
reload<00:05:01.010> time<00:05:01.190> compared<00:05:01.520> to<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.669> as50<00:05:02.060> so

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
reload time compared to the as50 so

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.670 
reload time compared to the as50 so
those<00:05:02.449> are<00:05:02.600> three<00:05:02.900> things<00:05:03.139> or<00:05:03.290> four<00:05:03.530> things

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
those are three things or four things

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.530 
those are three things or four things
that<00:05:03.919> kind<00:05:04.430> of<00:05:04.460> make<00:05:04.639> the<00:05:04.880> bear<00:05:05.030> 50<00:05:05.240> Cal<00:05:05.419> a

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
that kind of make the bear 50 Cal a

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.900 
that kind of make the bear 50 Cal a
little<00:05:05.810> bit<00:05:05.900> better<00:05:06.050> than<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:06.380> as50<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:07.699> with

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
little bit better than the as50 and with

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.370 
little bit better than the as50 and with
that<00:05:08.030> being<00:05:08.150> said<00:05:08.210> guys<00:05:08.510> I<00:05:08.539> hope<00:05:08.900> you<00:05:09.050> enjoyed
