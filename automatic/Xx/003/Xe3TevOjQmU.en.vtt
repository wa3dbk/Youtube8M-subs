00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.559 

let's<00:00:04.560> take<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.800> look<00:00:05.010> at<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.279> frame<00:00:05.670> on<00:00:06.330> this

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
let's take a look at the frame on this

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.600 
let's take a look at the frame on this
machine<00:00:07.640> notice<00:00:08.640> we've<00:00:08.880> got<00:00:09.090> massive<00:00:09.570> tubing

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
machine notice we've got massive tubing

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.150 
machine notice we've got massive tubing
this<00:00:11.610> tubing<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.210> one<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.720> half<00:00:12.960> by<00:00:13.710> one<00:00:13.980> and

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
this tubing is one and a half by one and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.259 
this tubing is one and a half by one and
a<00:00:14.190> half<00:00:14.430> and<00:00:14.760> it's<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.810> three<00:00:16.139> sixteenths<00:00:16.680> wall

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:17.269 
a half and it's a three sixteenths wall

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.090 
a half and it's a three sixteenths wall
which<00:00:18.269> means<00:00:18.539> it's<00:00:18.750> very<00:00:18.990> thick<00:00:19.349> compared<00:00:19.920> to

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
which means it's very thick compared to

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.290 
which means it's very thick compared to
standard<00:00:20.580> tubing<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.980> that<00:00:22.980> same<00:00:23.820> type<00:00:24.090> of

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
standard tubing and that same type of

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.990 
standard tubing and that same type of
frame<00:00:25.010> extends<00:00:26.010> all<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.310> way<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.610> the<00:00:26.789> back

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
frame extends all the way to the back

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.420 
frame extends all the way to the back
and<00:00:28.039> down<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.100> sides<00:00:29.520> and<00:00:29.960> up<00:00:30.980> along<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and down the sides and up along the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.809 
and down the sides and up along the
bottom<00:00:32.820> side<00:00:33.210> there<00:00:33.239> as<00:00:33.780> well<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.430> similar

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:35.819 
bottom side there as well as a similar

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:38.239 
bottom side there as well as a similar
type<00:00:36.089> of<00:00:36.120> frame<00:00:36.569> exists<00:00:37.260> underneath<00:00:37.859> the

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:38.249 
type of frame exists underneath the

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:43.549 
type of frame exists underneath the
frame<00:00:39.499> goes<00:00:40.499> all<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.739> way<00:00:40.890> around<00:00:42.379> now<00:00:43.379> let's

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
frame goes all the way around now let's

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.959 
frame goes all the way around now let's
take<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.769> look<00:00:44.010> at<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> frame<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:45.089> the<00:00:45.479> Walker

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.680 

now<00:00:50.969> we'll<00:00:51.359> notice<00:00:51.749> that<00:00:53.059> we<00:00:54.059> basically<00:00:54.329> have

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
now we'll notice that we basically have

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.169 
now we'll notice that we basically have
flat<00:00:55.260> steel<00:00:58.399> everywhere<00:00:59.399> except<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.059> these

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
flat steel everywhere except for these

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:01.009 
flat steel everywhere except for these
uprights

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
uprights

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.079 
uprights
now<00:01:01.409> these<00:01:01.559> uprights<00:01:02.129> are<00:01:02.399> some<00:01:02.699> sort<00:01:02.969> of

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
now these uprights are some sort of

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.210 
now these uprights are some sort of
tubing<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.530> they're<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.040> main

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
tubing but they're not the main

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.030 
tubing but they're not the main
structure<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.690> frame<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.409> fact<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.860> we

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
structure of the frame in fact if we

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.850 
structure of the frame in fact if we
look<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:08.550> again<00:01:09.300> we'll<00:01:09.480> see<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.320> flat

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
look in here again we'll see that flat

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.530 
look in here again we'll see that flat
steel<00:01:13.160> now<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.220> tubing<00:01:14.730> that<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.000> navigator

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
steel now the tubing that the navigator

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.190 
steel now the tubing that the navigator
frame<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.140> made<00:01:16.350> out<00:01:16.620> of<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.510> over<00:01:18.510> 300<00:01:19.020> percent

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
frame is made out of is over 300 percent

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.090 
frame is made out of is over 300 percent
stronger<00:01:20.070> than<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> flat<00:01:21.390> stock<00:01:21.750> or<00:01:22.110> piece<00:01:22.950> of

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
stronger than a flat stock or piece of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.910 
stronger than a flat stock or piece of
angle<00:01:23.280> iron<00:01:23.630> and<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.900> think<00:01:25.140> here's<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
angle iron and I think here's the the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
angle iron and I think here's the the
best<00:01:26.100> way<00:01:26.370> to<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.900> difference<00:01:31.940> notice

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
best way to to see the difference notice

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.649 
best way to to see the difference notice
how

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
how

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.249 
how
things<00:01:35.320> tend<00:01:35.650> to<00:01:35.909> give<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.240> wiggle<00:01:37.659> because

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
things tend to give and wiggle because

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.870 
things tend to give and wiggle because
there's<00:01:38.500> not<00:01:38.890> really<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.310> frame<00:01:39.759> here<00:01:40.270> and<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
there's not really a frame here and the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.820 
there's not really a frame here and the
machine<00:01:43.210> tends<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:43.840> have<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.409> lot<00:01:44.650> of

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
machine tends to have a lot of

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.730 
machine tends to have a lot of
give-and-take<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.640> it<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:47.320> is<00:01:47.440> that<00:01:47.590> going

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
give-and-take to it what is that going

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.469 
give-and-take to it what is that going
to<00:01:47.860> mean<00:01:48.009> over<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.670> life<00:01:48.850> of<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.090> machines

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
to mean over the life of the machines

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.700 
to mean over the life of the machines
well<00:01:50.320> not<00:01:51.040> too<00:01:51.310> long<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.759> period<00:01:52.000> of<00:01:52.180> time

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
well not too long of a period of time

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.440 
well not too long of a period of time
you're<00:01:53.710> going<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.890> see<00:01:54.130> failure<00:01:54.700> in<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.149> frame

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
you're going to see failure in the frame

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.350 
you're going to see failure in the frame
in<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.840> form<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.229> breakage<00:01:57.090> we've<00:01:58.090> seen

this quality when we get into the tubing
this<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.650> design<00:02:27.100> that's<00:02:27.370> used<00:02:27.700> in<00:02:28.560> race

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
this is a design that's used in race

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.600 
this is a design that's used in race
cars<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.190> it's<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.860> very<00:02:32.860> strong<00:02:33.190> design

another thing I'll draw your attention
to<00:02:47.769> is<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.250> exhaust<00:02:48.610> system<00:02:48.940> our<00:02:49.870> exhaust<00:02:50.290> is

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
to is the exhaust system our exhaust is

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.750 
to is the exhaust system our exhaust is
to<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.340> back<00:02:52.440> it's<00:02:53.440> completely<00:02:54.160> enclosed

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
to the back it's completely enclosed

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.410 
to the back it's completely enclosed
from<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.870> standpoint<00:02:56.410> that<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:57.010> is<00:02:57.180> inside<00:02:58.180> of

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
from the standpoint that it is inside of

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.509 
from the standpoint that it is inside of
the<00:02:58.510> frame<00:02:58.810> perimeter<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:01.180> can<00:03:01.420> turn<00:03:01.780> and

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
the frame perimeter so you can turn and

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.830 
the frame perimeter so you can turn and
maybe<00:03:03.519> you'll<00:03:03.760> bump<00:03:03.940> into<00:03:04.120> something<00:03:04.510> but

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
maybe you'll bump into something but

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.970 
maybe you'll bump into something but
you're<00:03:04.989> not<00:03:05.019> going<00:03:05.320> to<00:03:05.350> bump<00:03:05.560> into<00:03:05.739> your

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
you're not going to bump into your

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.640 
you're not going to bump into your
muffler<00:03:06.190> as<00:03:06.720> compared<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.840> here<00:03:08.380> we're

completely exposed and it's pretty

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.400 
completely exposed and it's pretty
common<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.700> get<00:03:12.850> a<00:03:12.910> smashed<00:03:13.359> muffler<00:03:13.900> with

maintenance differences on the X mark
our<00:03:34.180> fuel<00:03:34.540> tank<00:03:34.870> which<00:03:35.680> I<00:03:35.920> took<00:03:36.069> the<00:03:36.370> bullets

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
our fuel tank which I took the bullets

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.699 
our fuel tank which I took the bullets
out<00:03:36.970> of<00:03:37.030> ahead<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.510> time<00:03:37.750> for<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:37.989> nuts<00:03:38.200> took

out of ahead of time for the nuts took

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:39.850 
out of ahead of time for the nuts took
out<00:03:38.859> ahead<00:03:39.069> of<00:03:39.130> time<00:03:39.280> so

the<00:05:20.030> case<00:05:20.270> of<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.949> water<00:05:22.270> their<00:05:23.270> door<00:05:23.780> here

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
the case of the water their door here

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.119 
the case of the water their door here
actually<00:05:25.310> allows<00:05:25.610> for<00:05:25.639> exhaust<00:05:26.620> to<00:05:27.620> come<00:05:27.949> out

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
actually allows for exhaust to come out

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.920 
actually allows for exhaust to come out
somewhat<00:05:28.759> in<00:05:28.940> this<00:05:29.090> direction<00:05:29.409> but<00:05:30.460> it<00:05:31.460> also

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
somewhat in this direction but it also

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.170 
somewhat in this direction but it also
comes<00:05:32.930> this<00:05:33.259> direction<00:05:33.770> which<00:05:34.669> is<00:05:34.819> toward<00:05:35.120> the

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
comes this direction which is toward the

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.760 
comes this direction which is toward the
back<00:05:35.449> of<00:05:35.659> your<00:05:35.750> head<00:05:36.099> so<00:05:38.169> it's<00:05:39.169> not<00:05:39.319> uncommon

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
back of your head so it's not uncommon

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.110 
back of your head so it's not uncommon
to<00:05:40.539> on<00:05:41.539> a<00:05:41.599> dry<00:05:41.960> day<00:05:42.580> needs<00:05:43.580> some<00:05:43.819> sort<00:05:44.000> of

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
to on a dry day needs some sort of

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.879 
to on a dry day needs some sort of
respirator<00:05:44.960> to<00:05:45.110> be<00:05:45.229> able<00:05:45.409> to<00:05:45.469> mull<00:05:45.650> with

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
respirator to be able to mull with

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.709 
respirator to be able to mull with
because<00:05:46.400> you're<00:05:46.639> you're<00:05:47.270> basically<00:05:47.659> just

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:47.719 
because you're you're basically just

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:51.269 
because you're you're basically just
going<00:05:47.930> to<00:05:48.050> get<00:05:48.199> covered<00:05:48.590> with<00:05:49.569> some<00:05:50.569> grass<00:05:50.870> and

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
going to get covered with some grass and

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:56.559 
going to get covered with some grass and
dust<00:05:52.279> in<00:05:52.849> those<00:05:53.120> situations<00:05:53.810> oh<00:05:55.449> we're<00:05:56.449> going

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:56.569 
dust in those situations oh we're going

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.200 
dust in those situations oh we're going
to<00:05:56.599> zoom<00:05:56.870> in<00:05:57.050> here<00:05:57.259> next<00:05:57.529> on<00:05:57.830> the<00:05:58.210> discharge

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
to zoom in here next on the discharge

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.180 
to zoom in here next on the discharge
area<00:06:00.080> where<00:06:00.440> the<00:06:00.560> grass<00:06:00.710> actually<00:06:01.159> comes<00:06:02.050> into

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
area where the grass actually comes into

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.700 
area where the grass actually comes into
the<00:06:04.190> bag<00:06:04.520> on<00:06:04.940> the<00:06:05.150> x<00:06:05.300> mark<00:06:05.630> you<00:06:06.229> notice<00:06:06.500> this<00:06:06.650> is

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
the bag on the x mark you notice this is

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:16.990 
the bag on the x mark you notice this is
a<00:06:07.039> massive<00:06:07.789> just<00:06:08.719> parachute

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.740 

nine<00:06:18.000> and<00:06:18.030> a<00:06:18.210> half<00:06:18.240> inches<00:06:18.780> wide

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.469 

almost<00:06:24.750> six<00:06:25.050> inches<00:06:25.410> tall

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
almost six inches tall

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:32.210 
almost six inches tall
and<00:06:27.479> it<00:06:28.169> is<00:06:28.290> a<00:06:29.030> non<00:06:30.260> oscillating<00:06:31.260> discharge

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
and it is a non oscillating discharge

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.920 
and it is a non oscillating discharge
and<00:06:32.550> what<00:06:32.699> I<00:06:32.729> mean<00:06:32.970> by<00:06:33.180> that<00:06:33.210> is<00:06:33.810> on<00:06:34.800> the<00:06:35.160> Walker

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
and what I mean by that is on the Walker

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.350 
and what I mean by that is on the Walker
their<00:06:36.930> discharge<00:06:37.169> area<00:06:37.800> actually<00:06:38.360> oscillates

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
their discharge area actually oscillates

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.390 
their discharge area actually oscillates
back<00:06:39.660> and<00:06:39.690> forth<00:06:39.960> to<00:06:40.560> try<00:06:40.770> to<00:06:40.830> get<00:06:41.070> an<00:06:41.190> even

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
back and forth to try to get an even

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.860 
back and forth to try to get an even
filling<00:06:41.850> of<00:06:42.090> the<00:06:42.240> bag<00:06:43.729> with<00:06:44.729> the<00:06:44.940> navigator<00:06:45.600> we

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
filling of the bag with the navigator we

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.650 
filling of the bag with the navigator we
don't<00:06:46.050> need<00:06:46.500> to<00:06:46.650> oscillate<00:06:47.250> that<00:06:47.280> because<00:06:47.940> we

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 
don't need to oscillate that because we

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.680 
don't need to oscillate that because we
have<00:06:48.810> such<00:06:49.050> a<00:06:49.229> massive<00:06:50.060> impeller<00:06:51.060> fan<00:06:51.419> that's

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
have such a massive impeller fan that's

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.010 
have such a massive impeller fan that's
actually<00:06:52.110> blowing<00:06:52.530> the<00:06:52.620> grass<00:06:52.889> into<00:06:53.280> the<00:06:53.520> bag

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
actually blowing the grass into the bag

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.629 
actually blowing the grass into the bag
that<00:06:55.020> there<00:06:55.560> is<00:06:55.710> more<00:06:55.919> than<00:06:56.100> enough<00:06:56.340> power

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
that there is more than enough power

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.060 
that there is more than enough power
coming<00:06:57.180> in<00:06:57.330> there<00:06:57.510> to<00:06:57.750> fill<00:06:58.260> the<00:06:58.410> bag<00:06:58.560> evenly

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
coming in there to fill the bag evenly

in fact our bag gets so full you can

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.930 
in fact our bag gets so full you can
