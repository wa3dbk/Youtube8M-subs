00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 there you are watching me at 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.160
 youtube and facebook 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.220
 I am guima and in this video we will 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.660
 talking about good techniques is not for nothing 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.360
 that I 'm here with the john's t-shirt 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.950
 bonham who was drummer of the led zep case 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.080
 you do not know 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.359
 and he had a very pedal technique 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.630
 interesting to do more 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:26.510
 fast so I'll tell you what the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.510
 secret of the touches of boom of the ball joÃ£o 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.980
 So how do you play it? 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.620
 Bass drum make that ring faster 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:59.830
 the secret is all in the movement you 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:01.480
 do not move the leg it's hard that the ba 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.780
 do to get those two 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.850
 Ringtones faster is to make a ringtone 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.420
 before the leg falls it is basically 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.420
 this here 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.310
 see this slow-motion movement 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.280
 So what happens to us has two 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.130
 types of river touch in which people 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:39.409
 keep the heel up high and you 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.319
 only with the batter in a year in the skin and the river 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.170
 down that would be heel on the floor and the 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.569
 touch a little looser than the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.000
 butt to do the quick touch to 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:53.899
 people will combine these two you will 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.179
 make a tap wap and then go 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.219
 cushion the batsman 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.379
 then after a second you hold him 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.719
 so the ass has this support 

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:05.929
 it 's not everyone everyone who has 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.939
 this sound is more supportive because 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.000
 it's too stuffy if you're going to 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.890
 Studio is full of pillow inside I 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.349
 I left just a little more open 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.110
 purpose for you, it 's cool that it's 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.739
 characteristic of a good was not 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.599
 really a sound, so I do not like me 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.720
 cheating he had no pillow 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.489
 in the bass drum and the sound was very well open 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.069
 so I'm going to go through some exercises now 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.720
 for you to improve your donkey technique 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.840
 the first exercise will start from one 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.450
 an easy way we'll go 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.030
 use this figure here where it is a 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.540
 quilt punctuated at 15 full which wants 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.880
 saying is the first the first note and the 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.290
 last of the bass drum 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.900
 so he will do it he is here that 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.900
 had tea bum-kun pa 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.140
 to train this exercise and with the 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:11.530
 metronome playing more or less than 80 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.209
 pms then start there if you can 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.220
 75 80 is depending on the degree of 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.010
 devil of skill since you have with 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.470
 But it's always important to you when 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.060
 to train the exercise if you put the 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.299
 metronomy stay playing 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.489
 less 10 15 20 minutes for you to train 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.930
 enjoy and train the constancy of the 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.190
 time that is very important for the 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.079
 drummer is obvious 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.120
 second exercise we will do 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:41.230
 we will use this figure in which 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.430
 we play the first three touches of 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.879
 group of 4 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:04:05.680
 Let's make a whole past a tone for 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:04:08.440
 tom paddon dunton pa the next exercise 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.079
 What am I going to do? 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.709
 immigrant song that is this figure that is 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:17.789
 so everything stops 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:23.039
 everything is already with the football will become a 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.039
 Bum-kun tea tea 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.650
 can also invent their levadas 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.020
 obviously you can do four 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.980
 touches with the bass drum you're going to have 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.980
 that control more 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.060
 it's all in the touch you go to a 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.070
 important secret is one thing is one 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.070
 detail that sometimes nobody talks about 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:20.070
 this one for you to make these four touches 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:26.100
 and I'm sometimes holding my leg in the air. 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:28.110
 A little bit to do then you have a 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.240
 kind of a leg support in the 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.330
 air you can with the ankle do 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.220
 the four touches 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.900
