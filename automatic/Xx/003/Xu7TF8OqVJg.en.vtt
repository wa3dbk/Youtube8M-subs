to nowadays but still I can tell that
the<00:00:45.059> pixel<00:00:45.480> density<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.170> pretty<00:00:46.770> decent<00:00:47.129> with

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the pixel density is pretty decent with

the pixel density is pretty decent with
this<00:00:48.500> device<00:00:49.879> very<00:00:50.879> pleasant<00:00:51.809> appearance<00:00:52.590> we

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
this device very pleasant appearance we

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.380 
this device very pleasant appearance we
find<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:54.059> made<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.770> glossy<00:00:55.770> plastic<00:00:56.390> no

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
find here it's made of glossy plastic no

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.860 
find here it's made of glossy plastic no
it's<00:00:58.309> normal<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.640> fingerprint<00:01:00.629> magnet

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
it's normal it's a fingerprint magnet

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.740 
it's normal it's a fingerprint magnet
but<00:01:01.370> it<00:01:02.370> actually<00:01:02.579> feels<00:01:02.850> pretty<00:01:03.030> well<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
but it actually feels pretty well to the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.100 
but it actually feels pretty well to the
touch<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.700> that's<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.850> compromise<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.990> were

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
touch so that's a compromise you were
