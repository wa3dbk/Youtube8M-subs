00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.839
 unsightly doorway hide for 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.269
 wooden platbands install them 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.010
 need on a wooden base, consider it 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.750
 must be perfectly level 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.690
 we are perfect old door 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.510
 box if it is not there he condemned that 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.680
 we make new do height measurements 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.380
 and opening width 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.840
 as well as the thickness of the walls and cut out 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.939
 side parts must be 34 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.590
 centimeter less than the height of the opening this 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.590
 we need clearance for the top bar 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.280
 ready go to the slave first 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.320
 fasten the side to the cattle and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.200
 at the same time and leveling 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.480
 attention if the slopes in the opening curves then 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.579
 between the wall and the board will appear like this 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.120
 we insert a gap into it wooden 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.039
 pegs 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.969
 with them the board will not shift and 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.920
 screw and get more accurate now 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.230
 top bar she will just lie 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.449
 on the side so align it with 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.930
 level and adjust to it the second side 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.840
 the board is celebrating the stack on the wall 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.489
 horizontal and vertical plan 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.619
 Now, by this markup, we attach the second 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.659
 side board and set the top 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.520
 we fix it with wooden pegs 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.729
 fooling the gaps a little trick 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.680
 40 places 30 minutes to be the first 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.860
 quickly sold without losing 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.740
 design and tightly connected and elements 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.900
 while the foam dries let's do the typesetting 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.180
 boards customize them in width and height 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.650
 doorframe saw off excess 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.869
 to fix the trim we will be with 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.850
 using micro studs with them we set up 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.000
 will look neater about going 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.619
 it is much faster and more practical than on 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.369
 ordinary finish studs now 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.380
 platbands 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.450
 we saw them at a 45 degree angle 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.770
 and put all on the same micro studs 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.909
 it is necessary to lubricate the seams with sealant to 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.250
 they did not diverge 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.110
 and the opening looked neater Alexander 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.110
 Karchevsky Irina nodded and the first channel
