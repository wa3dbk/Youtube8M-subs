most<00:00:38.950> cases<00:00:39.280> it's<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:39.670> simple<00:00:40.090> ones<00:00:40.270> that

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
most cases it's the simple ones that

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.080

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
simple to work through well if you start

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.860 
simple to work through well if you start
off<00:01:12.340> with<00:01:12.400> that<00:01:12.640> attitude<00:01:12.790> already<00:01:13.299> then

everybody that I've met both in business
and<00:01:21.820> in<00:01:22.630> trading<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.260> know<00:01:23.290> they<00:01:23.650> had<00:01:23.920> some

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
and in trading you know they had some

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.800 
and in trading you know they had some
sort<00:01:24.369> of<00:01:24.460> confidence<00:01:24.820> they<00:01:25.090> did<00:01:25.270> believe<00:01:25.479> it

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
sort of confidence they did believe it

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.630 
sort of confidence they did believe it
would<00:01:25.930> work<00:01:26.170> even<00:01:26.500> through<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.190> hard<00:01:27.369> times

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
would work even through the hard times

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.300 
would work even through the hard times
when<00:01:27.880> things<00:01:28.150> weren't<00:01:28.360> working<00:01:29.159> you've<00:01:30.159> also

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
when things weren't working you've also

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.730 
when things weren't working you've also
got<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.549> learn<00:01:30.790> to<00:01:30.850> admit<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.390> you're<00:01:31.570> wrong

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
okay in many cases our trades will even

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.730 
okay in many cases our trades will even
make<00:01:35.740> no<00:01:36.070> money<00:01:36.310> break<00:01:36.729> even<00:01:37.180> or<00:01:38.170> make<00:01:38.439> a<00:01:38.470> loss

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740
