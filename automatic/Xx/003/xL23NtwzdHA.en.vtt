tricks in the future people have learned
these<00:01:22.120> tricks<00:01:22.450> in<00:01:22.600> different<00:01:22.930> orders<00:01:23.260> but

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
these tricks in different orders but

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.560 
these tricks in different orders but
this<00:01:23.950> is<00:01:24.100> again<00:01:24.430> just<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.820> guideline<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.360> make

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
this is again just a guideline to make

the<00:01:32.270> tricks<00:01:32.570> themselves<00:01:33.140> are<00:01:33.260> broken<00:01:33.590> down

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
the tricks themselves are broken down

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.800 
the tricks themselves are broken down
into<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.220> exact<00:01:34.640> gradient<00:01:35.180> step<00:01:35.420> in<00:01:35.630> learning

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
into the exact gradient step in learning

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.320 
into the exact gradient step in learning
so<00:01:36.800> our<00:01:36.950> each<00:01:37.130> step<00:01:37.430> of<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.700> enjoy<00:01:38.030> throwing

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
so our each step of the enjoy throwing

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.590 
so our each step of the enjoy throwing
them<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.870> communities<00:01:39.320> as<00:01:39.500> possible<00:01:40.010> granny

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
them to communities as possible granny

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.150 
them to communities as possible granny
this<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.810> an<00:01:41.900> example<00:01:42.260> of<00:01:42.410> each<00:01:42.650> step<00:01:42.980> of

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
this is an example of each step of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.520 
this is an example of each step of
learning<00:01:43.370> count<00:01:43.700> equality<00:01:43.930> you<00:01:44.930> can<00:01:45.110> practice

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
learning count equality you can practice

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.410 
learning count equality you can practice
each<00:01:45.740> step<00:01:46.070> on<00:01:46.250> its<00:01:46.430> own<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:47.060> if<00:01:47.180> you<00:01:47.300> ever

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
each step on its own and if you ever

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.240 
each step on its own and if you ever
have<00:01:47.630> problem<00:01:48.050> on<00:01:48.110> one<00:01:48.320> step<00:01:48.650> you<00:01:48.680> can<00:01:48.980> just<00:01:49.130> go

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
have problem on one step you can just go

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.980 
have problem on one step you can just go
back<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.760> previous<00:01:50.000> step<00:01:50.360> until<00:01:50.660> you<00:01:50.780> get

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
back to the previous step until you get

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.870 
back to the previous step until you get
that<00:01:51.170> one<00:01:51.380> eventually<00:01:52.190> putting<00:01:52.550> it<00:01:52.730> all

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
that one eventually putting it all

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.490 
that one eventually putting it all
together<00:01:53.030> until<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.600> get<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.960> fold<00:01:54.200> trick

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
together until you get the fold trick

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.310 
together until you get the fold trick
it's<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:55.700> way<00:01:55.850> I<00:01:55.880> made<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.240> video<00:01:56.540> is<00:01:57.050> to

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
it's the way I made the video is to

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.470 
it's the way I made the video is to
break<00:01:57.530> down<00:01:57.560> every<00:01:58.250> step<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:59.000> trick

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
break down every step of the trick

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.470 
break down every step of the trick
starting<00:02:00.410> from<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.710> foot<00:02:00.920> position<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:02.360> the

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
starting from the foot position to the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.450 
starting from the foot position to the
very<00:02:02.690> basics<00:02:03.290> of<00:02:03.410> just<00:02:03.650> popping<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.190> board

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
very basics of just popping the board

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.570 
very basics of just popping the board
and<00:02:05.000> sliding<00:02:05.480> your<00:02:05.630> foot<00:02:05.810> up<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.080> board<00:02:06.580> so

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
and sliding your foot up the board so

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.330 
and sliding your foot up the board so
you<00:02:07.640> know<00:02:07.850> every<00:02:08.330> part<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.929> trick<00:02:09.340> knowing

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
you know every part of the trick knowing

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.550 
you know every part of the trick knowing
every<00:02:10.670> part<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.060> Trekker<00:02:11.390> gives<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.410> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
every part of the Trekker gives you the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.190 
every part of the Trekker gives you the
ability<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:13.310> take<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.550> step<00:02:13.910> back<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.720> see<00:02:15.170> what

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
ability to take a step back and see what

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.140 
ability to take a step back and see what
part<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.010> trick<00:02:16.250> you're<00:02:16.400> really<00:02:16.730> missing

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
part of the trick you're really missing

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.180 
part of the trick you're really missing
when<00:02:17.330> you<00:02:17.390> try<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.660> whole<00:02:17.960> thing<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.980> then<00:02:19.100> you

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
when you try the whole thing so then you

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.150 
when you try the whole thing so then you
can<00:02:19.370> practice<00:02:19.760> just<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.270> step<00:02:20.540> on<00:02:20.720> its<00:02:20.900> own

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
can practice just that step on its own

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.620 
can practice just that step on its own
so<00:02:22.160> when<00:02:22.310> you're<00:02:22.430> using<00:02:22.460> this<00:02:22.880> video<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.330> want

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
so when you're using this video I want

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.690 
so when you're using this video I want
you<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.870> practice<00:02:24.050> each<00:02:24.470> step<00:02:24.890> as<00:02:25.100> I<00:02:25.220> go<00:02:25.430> over

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
you to practice each step as I go over

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.430 
you to practice each step as I go over
it<00:02:25.820> and<00:02:25.970> don't<00:02:26.480> go<00:02:26.660> on<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.050> next<00:02:27.200> step

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
it and don't go on to the next step

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.160 
it and don't go on to the next step
until<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.860> really<00:02:28.190> have<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:28.610> one<00:02:28.960> it's<00:02:29.960> in

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
until you really have that one it's in

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.600 
until you really have that one it's in
this<00:02:30.410> way<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.800> you're<00:02:30.890> going<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.160> be<00:02:31.370> able<00:02:31.460> to

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
this way that you're going to be able to

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.550 
this way that you're going to be able to
learn<00:02:31.730> all<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:32.270> these<00:02:32.450> tricks<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.140> get<00:02:33.410> them

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
learn all of these tricks and get them

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.400 
learn all of these tricks and get them
all<00:02:33.740> down<00:02:33.920> really<00:02:34.400> well<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:35.660> reason<00:02:36.020> I<00:02:36.110> chose

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
all down really well the reason I chose

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.229 
all down really well the reason I chose
the<00:02:36.650> tricks<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.100> be<00:02:37.250> learned<00:02:37.459> in<00:02:37.610> these<00:02:37.820> steps

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
the tricks to be learned in these steps

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.479 
the tricks to be learned in these steps
is<00:02:38.570> because<00:02:39.260> they<00:02:39.470> introduce<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.220> least

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
is because they introduce the least

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.310 
is because they introduce the least
amount<00:02:40.820> of<00:02:40.970> change<00:02:41.300> in<00:02:41.570> between<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:42.050> tricks

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
amount of change in between the tricks

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.470 
amount of change in between the tricks
for<00:02:43.070> example<00:02:43.489> once<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.820> learn<00:02:43.970> how<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.209> ollie

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
for example once you learn how to ollie

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.570 
for example once you learn how to ollie
all<00:02:45.050> you<00:02:45.320> have<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.560> change<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:46.040> swinging<00:02:46.340> their

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
all you have to change is swinging their

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.449 
all you have to change is swinging their
shoulders<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.060> do<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.600> frontside<00:02:47.900> 180<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.400> you

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
shoulders to do the frontside 180 so you

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.740 
shoulders to do the frontside 180 so you
should<00:02:49.700> be<00:02:49.820> able<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:49.970> get<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.300> next<00:02:50.630> step

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
should be able to get that next step

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.320 
should be able to get that next step
down<00:02:50.930> very<00:02:51.290> easy<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.920> want<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.640> make<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:52.940> an<00:02:53.060> easy

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
down very easy I want to make it an easy

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
generally use wider boards because they

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.530
