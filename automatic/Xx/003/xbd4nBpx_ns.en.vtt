and<00:01:21.659> played<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> bit<00:01:22.470> more<00:01:22.650> cautious<00:01:23.460> towards

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and played a bit more cautious towards

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.280 
and played a bit more cautious towards
the<00:01:23.880> end<00:01:24.000> there<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.659> there's<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
the end there but it was on there's a

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.840 
the end there but it was on there's a
nice<00:01:25.439> gameplay<00:01:25.890> nonetheless<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.640> think

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
nice gameplay nonetheless and I think
