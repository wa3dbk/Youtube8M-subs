 You can fly in the trees and other 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:58.870
 here are clouds I also think that just not 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:03.730
 There is a sun, there is not only nobody here. 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:07.989

 there there is very angry partner to go 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.889
 The more you have here on the map, I can 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.460
 I'll try to pitch at least 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.070
 some videos there today to compensate for 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.940
 other days because my notebook is 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.910
 bad 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:38.080
 more gold plus gold found out 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:41.380
 caves and difficult to find gold without using 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:46.930
 No mouse, I 'm not going to hit this block. 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:50.440
 gold not a luxury I found a cave there 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:55.060
 an underground cave that is a 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:58.479
 false cave and up in unique craft 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.349
 thing that I complained about so 1.3 is the 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:06.190
 map generator that is much slower 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:10.860
 It's a lot better to try to make a clean one today. 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:14.199
 of terrarium do not know some games in flash 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.710

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:20.490
 there is snow biome that does not have here 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:22.889
 biome of the sand biome and the new biome 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:27.210

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:53.950
 glass does not make noise has already been added 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:57.100

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:59.260

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.290
