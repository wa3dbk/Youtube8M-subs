it<00:00:35.929> to<00:00:36.929> locate<00:00:37.350> them<00:00:37.589> you'll<00:00:38.370> see<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.699> they

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:38.819 
it to locate them you'll see that they

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:41.779 
it to locate them you'll see that they
are<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.899> frame<00:00:40.159> they're<00:00:41.159> placed<00:00:41.399> I

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
are here on the frame they're placed I

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.500 
are here on the frame they're placed I
decided<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.809> curvature<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.859> next<00:00:44.159> frame

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
decided the curvature of the next frame

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.469 
decided the curvature of the next frame
two<00:00:45.510> dots<00:00:45.719> either<00:00:45.989> side<00:00:46.289> right<00:00:47.190> or<00:00:47.219> left<00:00:47.609> so

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:48.479 
two dots either side right or left so

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:50.569 
two dots either side right or left so
that<00:00:48.659> when<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.260> worn<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.309> one<00:00:50.489> in

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
that when it is worn that it's one in

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.469 
that when it is worn that it's one in
this<00:00:50.760> position

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
this position

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.539 
this position
so<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.870> over<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.499> deltoid<00:00:52.920> muscle<00:00:53.339> at<00:00:53.519> the

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:53.549 
so it's over the deltoid muscle at the

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.969 
so it's over the deltoid muscle at the
shoulder<00:00:53.999> you'll<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.929> the<00:00:55.109> grips<00:00:55.379> will

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
shoulder you'll see that the grips will

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.819 
shoulder you'll see that the grips will
grip<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.399> clothes<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.299> stop<00:00:57.659> the<00:00:58.260> frame<00:00:58.499> from

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
grip the clothes and stop the frame from

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.849 
grip the clothes and stop the frame from
moving<00:00:59.129> too<00:00:59.309> much<00:01:00.409> but<00:01:01.409> let's<00:01:01.530> show<00:01:01.679> you<00:01:01.769> how

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
moving too much but let's show you how

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.329 
moving too much but let's show you how
to<00:01:01.920> assemble<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.369> frame<00:01:03.500> you'll<00:01:04.500> notice<00:01:04.830> that

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
to assemble the frame you'll notice that

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.450 
to assemble the frame you'll notice that
we've<00:01:05.519> color-coded<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.630> dots<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.310> we<00:01:08.310> have

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
we've color-coded the dots so we have

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.430 
we've color-coded the dots so we have
the<00:01:08.580> blue<00:01:08.760> connectors<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:10.050> some<00:01:10.260> white

you'll see the buttons here on the
intersection<00:02:11.180> but<00:02:11.780> it's<00:02:11.930> brought<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.260> frame

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
intersection but it's brought the frame

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.820 
intersection but it's brought the frame
in<00:02:12.650> on<00:02:12.950> right<00:02:13.340> or<00:02:13.520> left<00:02:14.290> we<00:02:15.290> can<00:02:15.410> also<00:02:15.530> do<00:02:15.740> the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
in on right or left we can also do the

but either meet or very section on this
side<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:09.080> I<00:03:09.440> would<00:03:09.560> also<00:03:09.680> have<00:03:10.519> this<00:03:10.730> section

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
side and I would also have this section

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.210 
side and I would also have this section
set<00:03:11.420> in<00:03:11.600> either<00:03:12.170> as<00:03:12.440> far<00:03:12.680> as<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.370> could<00:03:13.720> or<00:03:14.720> maybe

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
set in either as far as I could or maybe

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.699 
set in either as far as I could or maybe
halfway<00:03:16.330> but<00:03:17.330> normally<00:03:17.780> this<00:03:17.930> far<00:03:18.170> only<00:03:18.290> ten

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
halfway but normally this far only ten

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.800 
halfway but normally this far only ten
