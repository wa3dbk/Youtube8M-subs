00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.900
 ah 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.630
 welcome to legends and video games in 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.460
 his weekly that has already reached 25 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.960
 thousand subscribers but that on good 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.180
 figure to make a small special and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.710
 take a look back originally 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.239
 this video was going to upload during the week 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.340
 but I think if you take the weekly video 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.570
 I give it the importance it deserves and not 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.430
 do you worry that next week 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.660
 There will be a mini on Tuesday or Wednesday and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.010
 the video that corresponds on Friday 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.839
 focusing a little more on this 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.489
 special I have many topics prepared 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:46.170
 for this kind of videos but in this 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.699
 specifically I would like to launch a 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.050
 Thank you message to all 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.909
 collaborators with whom I had the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.559
 pleasure to work open my 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:53.760
 little heart and explain a little more to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.170
 personal level how has the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.730
 experience of being able to collaborate with others 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.649
 Youtubers more or less known until 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.449
 now I will leave you notes to all your 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.309
 channels some videos and so on 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.930
 you can access them without problems and 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.220
 if you do not know any of the channels, 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.260
 hesitate to pay a visit 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.120
 starting at the beginning we have your 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.770
 ruiz we met before creating the 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.450
 channel and when I commented on the idea not 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.220
 he was just happy to collaborate in a 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.960
 video but he made celestino 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.310
 introducing me to many people that more 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.440
 forward helped me in one way or another 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.420
 to grow the whole project I like 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.290
 consider him the godfather of legends and 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.930
 videogames I think I've already commented 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.250
 before it currently has two channels one 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.480
 of video games where he has started to 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.310
 upload pretty game reviews 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.900
 fun the truth I recommend you 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.090
 look at this age and katana is one of those 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.920
 games try 64 chunks some 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.630
 children had the misfortune to suffer and 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.070
 On the other hand, this man looks like 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.110
 vagabond also has a channel where 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.940
 upload your pot lunches from time to time 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.560
 the truth is that recording with its noise is 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.540
 a joke since he is used to 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.920
 to record alone and get stuck a little 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.420
 the words when accompanied 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.460
 So far we have made two videos 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.030
 together this theory about no more hero if 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.159
 this extrapolation on a mass 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.350
 The next one that collaborated with me was co 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.700
 purist of the temple of time the channel 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.409
 I had seen it rebound ever 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.659
 surfing on youtube the topic is good 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.619
 simple if you like zelda that is 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.690
 your site 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.369
 curiosities reviews news gameplays 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.720
 absolutely everything relative and 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.100
 pertaining to the world of zelda what 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.540
 you will find in the temple of time 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.550
 when he already had a few videos 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.350
 uploaded I decided to get in touch with 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.330
 at the time he gave me some 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.709
 fear so we 're going to cheat myself 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.390
 I had just started I think barely 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.100
 he had two or three thousand subscribers and he 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.020
 I already had more than 10,000 finally 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.450
 it turned out to be a fucking motherfucker and 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.250
 we decided to make two videos together wait 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.600
 two videos if there is only one or two is 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.250
 true although for now we have only 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.660
 done this on your channel where we talked 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.340
 about a temporary paradox that happens 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.900
 in ocarina of time I intend to 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.340
 return the favor very soon with a 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.440
 idea that I've been saving for some time 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.140
 for the stay tuned 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.120
 we continue with arachnophobia his ruiz or 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.830
 celestine in this case teaching arachne 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.540
 the channel is excited by 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.430
 finally be able to tell the world what 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.350
 it really means silent hill me 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.180
 He proposed that we make a video together 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.560
 I agreed without thinking because his channel 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.690
 love the quality of the videos is 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.190
 unparalleled the topics he talks about and 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.260
 the charisma that has become a 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.300
 of my favorite bloggers with those 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.950
 touches of madness halloween and a humor 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.540
 very particular certainly does not have 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.160
 loss and not only is a youtuber very 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.600
 charismatic but on a personal level is 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.130
 a beautiful person with whom you can 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.320
 have a pleasant talk of any 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.000
 subject the video that we made together is one 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.470
 of the most complex to date and 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.300
 that touches psychological subjects quite 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.530
 dense but if you like to choose you can 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.210
 take a look to see one of the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.090
 more interesting interpretations up 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.400
 the date 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.750
 before starting the channel I had seen 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.700
 on several occasions tutorials 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.220
 minecraft in the arctic channel of 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.510
 decoration and some redstone and was 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.730
 one of those channels with which I thought 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.680
 that it would be good to collaborate it turned out that 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.150
 by chance of life the world is 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.620
 a handkerchief and we have a few friends 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.239
 together so that through them 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.680
 we got in touch and decided 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.450
 to do the video I already said the 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.549
 collaboration I see art and kraft as the 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.930
 bric or evil of minecraft you can 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.459
 go through your channel to learn with 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.170
 alcasa is as god sends as well as seeing 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.489
 some gameplays jan boxing all with 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.140
 his characteristic style does not have 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.790
 loss in the video that we made together 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.530
 we explain a possible history of 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.030
 minecraft 2 in minecraft does not have 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.530
 History is a sandbox but if we 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.700
 we fix a bit in the environment can that 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.600
 there is something more than what seems simple 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.740
 view 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.940
 probably the best-known youtuber 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.980
 of which I have had the opportunity to 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.850
 collaborate so far is about 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.650
 to reach a million subscribers 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.790
 thanks to his songs and raps 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.560
 generally related to 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.000
 videogames and series although leaving 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.739
 side the fame and the number of subscribers 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.150
 alex is a great kid with whom I 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.950
 I would love to go out for a drink sometime 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.600
 my favorite songs from your channel are 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.340
 the rap of valleseco and the song I am 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.840
 partner and in terms of the video that we made 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.040
 together you can see us talking a little 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.600
 on the theory of the universes 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.320
 multiples and their application to the world of 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.930
 video games of course 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.300
 his king aka 'the godfather' aka the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.520
 celestino I present to pot and max little 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.690
 time after creating the channel not only 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.370
 is one of the biggest fans of my 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.900
 content but it has become 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.760
 a very good friend with whom I can spend 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.650
 evenings playing ligo players would close 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.940
 hold on to mod or until the parchís was 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.130
 fun to do the collaboration with him 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.710
 since to take advantage of its spontaneity 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.120
 and its nonsense characteristics after 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.710
 do the preliminary script I sent it 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.330
 so that he would put any bullshit that 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.220
 It will happen and that everyone 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
 could see how in his personality in 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.980
 your channel you do not find anything in 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.480
 particular since pod and up the 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.310
 content that you want when you 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.770
 fancy in his last video until the 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.860
 date we appear pod and hero and I playing 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.090
 to domino short but very funny in 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.860
 the video that we did together we talked 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.780
 about a very recurring theme because 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.040
 we play video games how to affect 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.830
 our brain which is dopamine 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.510
 etc 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.220
 after some of you what 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.780
 I asked for 6 links and I put in 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.220
 contact and we made the collaboration that 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.890
 to date has gotten more visits 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.210
 a 'top ten' theory is pokemon one of 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.980
 the videos that more work has taken me 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.990
 and I am quite satisfied with the 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.880
 result the truth on a personal level 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.650
 although the link if I think of ways 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.030
 very different to work with him during a 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.800
 couple of weeks it was very interesting and 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.780
 quite enriching in your channel 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.220
 you will find reviews tops and criticisms 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.410
 several games always very focused on the 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.850
 parrot that is to say the plot a story of 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.800
 video game in question very 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.980
 interesting but you'll see that it rolls 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.810
 like the blinds 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.000
 the last youtuber I've had 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.070
 the pleasure of working has been range I'm going 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.930
 to be honest with all of you rank 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.520
 is one of my favorite youtubers I've 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.990
 laughed out loud with some of his 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.200
 moments and when he agreed to collaborate 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.650
 with me I climbed up the walls 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.900
 regardless of the number of 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.490
 subscribers of what grows 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.140
 the channel or how famous it can be a 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.670
 youtuber when you have the opportunity to 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.830
 work with someone you follow 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.570
 usual way emotions in the video that 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.790
 we did together we discussed a theory of 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.080
 range a very interesting vision and that 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.640
 he had told us so far 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.430
