to keep up the server I also spent a lot

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.240 
to keep up the server I also spent a lot
of<00:01:46.390> time<00:01:46.509> looking<00:01:46.899> for<00:01:47.229> more<00:01:47.440> structures<00:01:47.950> but

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
of time looking for more structures but

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.370 
of time looking for more structures but
I<00:01:48.310> could<00:01:48.610> not<00:01:48.760> find<00:01:48.790> any<00:01:49.299> near<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.750> spawn<00:01:50.049> or

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
I could not find any near the spawn or

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.500 
I could not find any near the spawn or
far<00:01:50.740> away<00:01:50.770> from<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.280> spawn<00:01:51.580> it<00:01:51.909> seems<00:01:52.299> that

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
far away from the spawn it seems that

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.719 
far away from the spawn it seems that
there<00:01:52.750> was<00:01:52.870> nothing<00:01:53.020> built<00:01:53.470> close<00:01:53.979> enough<00:01:54.430> to

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
there was nothing built close enough to

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.789 
there was nothing built close enough to
really<00:01:55.060> appreciate<00:01:55.450> in<00:01:55.870> his<00:01:56.020> map<00:01:56.229> i<00:01:56.470> did<00:01:56.620> find

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
really appreciate in his map i did find

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.100 
really appreciate in his map i did find
his<00:01:57.040> text<00:01:57.460> sign<00:01:57.760> I<00:01:58.060> could<00:01:58.330> not<00:01:58.450> actually<00:01:58.869> read

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
his text sign I could not actually read

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.960 
his text sign I could not actually read
it<00:01:59.140> what<00:01:59.680> actually<00:02:00.220> said<00:02:00.490> they're<00:02:00.820> also

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
it what actually said they're also

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.210 
it what actually said they're also
seemed<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:01.450> be<00:02:01.600> underground<00:02:02.260> cave<00:02:02.680> systems

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
seemed to be underground cave systems

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.030 
seemed to be underground cave systems
that<00:02:03.490> led<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:03.820> more<00:02:04.659> places<00:02:05.140> around<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.860> map

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
that led to more places around the map

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.160 
that led to more places around the map
again<00:02:06.369> I<00:02:06.670> spent<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:06.970> long<00:02:07.210> time<00:02:07.240> trying<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:07.990> find

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
again I spent a long time trying to find

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.509 
again I spent a long time trying to find
some<00:02:08.380> things<00:02:08.530> in<00:02:08.739> these<00:02:08.830> cave<00:02:09.130> but<00:02:09.369> they're

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
some things in these cave but they're

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.850 
some things in these cave but they're
actually<00:02:09.850> I<00:02:10.090> could<00:02:10.299> not<00:02:10.450> find<00:02:10.479> anything<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:11.560> did

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
actually I could not find anything I did

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.070 
actually I could not find anything I did
actually<00:02:12.010> find<00:02:12.430> one<00:02:12.640> section<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.450> was<00:02:13.600> that

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
actually find one section that was that

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.259 
actually find one section that was that
took<00:02:14.290> me<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.590> another<00:02:14.739> place<00:02:15.190> lots<00:02:15.820> of<00:02:16.030> stairs

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
took me to another place lots of stairs

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.330 
took me to another place lots of stairs
and<00:02:16.540> major<00:02:16.810> tunnel<00:02:17.230> systems<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.860> pretty<00:02:18.280> much

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
and major tunnel systems and pretty much

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.699 
and major tunnel systems and pretty much
all<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.760> found<00:02:19.000> was<00:02:19.299> a<00:02:19.480> room<00:02:19.870> full<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.320> them<00:02:20.500> I

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
all I found was a room full of them I

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.590 
all I found was a room full of them I
don't<00:02:21.220> know<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:21.519> was<00:02:21.700> done<00:02:21.910> in<00:02:21.940> purpose<00:02:22.420> but

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
don't know this was done in purpose but

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.270 
don't know this was done in purpose but
I'm<00:02:22.840> wondering<00:02:23.110> if<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.440> griefer<00:02:23.799> when<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.130> an

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
I'm wondering if the griefer when in an

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.530 
I'm wondering if the griefer when in an
actually<00:02:24.610> destroyed<00:02:25.000> everything<00:02:25.269> in<00:02:25.480> this

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
actually destroyed everything in this

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.259 
actually destroyed everything in this
room<00:02:25.600> with<00:02:25.959> lava<00:02:26.410> pretty<00:02:27.220> much<00:02:27.370> once<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.030> got<00:02:28.150> in

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
room with lava pretty much once I got in

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.729 
room with lava pretty much once I got in
that<00:02:28.360> room<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.570> pretty<00:02:28.900> much<00:02:29.049> ended<00:02:29.230> my<00:02:29.500> time

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
that room that pretty much ended my time
