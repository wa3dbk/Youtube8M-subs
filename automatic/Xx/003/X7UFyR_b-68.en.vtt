00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.680 
we will for step four yarn over and
we're<00:02:35.040> going<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.250> draw<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.880> yarn<00:02:36.239> through

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
we're going to draw that yarn through

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.660 
we're going to draw that yarn through
the<00:02:36.720> loop<00:02:36.959> as<00:02:37.230> well<00:02:37.440> okay<00:02:38.069> so<00:02:38.130> that's<00:02:38.489> going<00:02:38.610> to

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
the loop as well okay so that's going to

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:47.780 
the loop as well okay so that's going to
start<00:02:39.440> our<00:02:43.190> ring<00:02:45.739> alright<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:46.950> now<00:02:47.220> we're<00:02:47.610> just

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
start our ring alright so now we're just

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.350 
start our ring alright so now we're just
going<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:47.970> basically<00:02:48.390> single<00:02:48.989> crochet<00:02:49.560> into

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
going to basically single crochet into

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.860 
going to basically single crochet into
the<00:02:51.360> ring<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:51.630> I'm<00:02:52.050> going<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.290> insert<00:02:52.800> my<00:02:52.860> hook

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
the ring so I'm going to insert my hook

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.630 
the ring so I'm going to insert my hook
yarn<00:02:54.870> over<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.320> draw<00:02:56.480> through<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:58.640> then

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
yarn over and draw through and then

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.440 
yarn over and draw through and then
we're<00:02:59.790> going<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.030> yarn<00:03:00.239> over<00:03:02.090> move<00:03:03.090> my<00:03:03.269> hands

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
we're going to yarn over move my hands

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.990 
we're going to yarn over move my hands
around<00:03:03.630> here<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:03.989> little<00:03:04.200> bit<00:03:04.489> yarn<00:03:05.489> over<00:03:05.790> and

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
around here a little bit yarn over and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.460 
around here a little bit yarn over and
draw<00:03:06.090> through<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.590> two<00:03:07.830> loops<00:03:08.069> that<00:03:08.430> are<00:03:08.850> on

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
draw through the two loops that are on

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.949 
draw through the two loops that are on
my<00:03:10.470> hook<00:03:10.880> okay<00:03:11.880> insert<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.510> hook<00:03:12.630> into<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
my hook okay insert the hook into the

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.400 
my hook okay insert the hook into the
ring<00:03:13.220> yarn<00:03:14.220> over<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.459> draw<00:03:14.610> through<00:03:15.410> yarn

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
ring yarn over and draw through yarn

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.340 
ring yarn over and draw through yarn
over<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.890> draw<00:03:17.280> through<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:18.450> two<00:03:18.720> loops<00:03:18.959> okay

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
over and draw through the two loops okay

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.199 
over and draw through the two loops okay
so<00:03:19.500> we're<00:03:19.799> just<00:03:19.829> single<00:03:20.340> crocheting<00:03:20.700> into

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
so we're just single crocheting into

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.590 
so we're just single crocheting into
that<00:03:21.690> Center<00:03:22.049> ring<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.590> you'll<00:03:23.340> continue

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
that Center ring and you'll continue

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.780 
that Center ring and you'll continue
doing<00:03:24.600> your<00:03:24.720> single<00:03:24.930> crochets<00:03:25.470> into<00:03:25.890> that

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
doing your single crochets into that

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.970 
doing your single crochets into that
Center<00:03:27.239> ring<00:03:27.510> until<00:03:27.750> you've<00:03:28.530> reached<00:03:28.739> the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
Center ring until you've reached the

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.319 
Center ring until you've reached the
number<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.700> chain<00:03:30.660> stitches<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.890> need

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
number of chain stitches that you need

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.940 
number of chain stitches that you need
or<00:03:33.329> single<00:03:33.780> crochet<00:03:34.079> stitches<00:03:34.320> that<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.769> need

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
real quick into that loop okay and we're

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.760 
real quick into that loop okay and we're
just<00:04:26.639> going<00:04:26.820> to<00:04:26.850> pull<00:04:27.090> this<00:04:27.240> tight<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:27.840> that's

just going to pull this tight and that's

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.500 
just going to pull this tight and that's
going<00:04:28.979> to<00:04:29.040> bring<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.580> bottom<00:04:29.970> part<00:04:30.180> all<00:04:30.479> the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
going to bring that bottom part all the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.050 
going to bring that bottom part all the
way<00:04:30.810> around<00:04:31.639> to<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.669> front<00:04:33.560> okay<00:04:34.910> so<00:04:35.910> we've

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
way around to the front okay so we've

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.030 
way around to the front okay so we've
created<00:04:36.300> our<00:04:36.720> ring<00:04:37.700> at<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:38.940> center<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:40.040> then

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
created our ring at the center and then

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.810 
created our ring at the center and then
I<00:04:41.070> can<00:04:41.370> just<00:04:41.669> finish<00:04:42.330> up<00:04:42.479> this<00:04:42.690> round<00:04:43.760> by<00:04:44.760> doing

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
I can just finish up this round by doing

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:52.219 
I can just finish up this round by doing
a<00:04:45.180> slip<00:04:45.210> stitch<00:04:45.600> into<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.440> first<00:04:46.470> stitch<00:04:51.229> the

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
a slip stitch into the first stitch the

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.430 
a slip stitch into the first stitch the
first<00:04:52.560> stitch<00:04:52.710> is<00:04:52.889> pretty<00:04:53.190> tight<00:04:53.460> there<00:04:53.490> so

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
first stitch is pretty tight there so

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.340 
first stitch is pretty tight there so
let's<00:04:55.440> try<00:04:55.620> not<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:55.919> split<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.340> yarn<00:04:57.350> all

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
let's try not to split the yarn all

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.070 
let's try not to split the yarn all
right<00:05:00.889> yarn<00:05:01.889> over<00:05:02.160> draw<00:05:02.520> through<00:05:03.210> those<00:05:03.750> two

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
right yarn over draw through those two

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.159 
right yarn over draw through those two
stitches<00:05:04.380> and<00:05:04.919> there<00:05:05.100> we<00:05:05.220> go<00:05:05.780> alright<00:05:06.780> so<00:05:06.900> then

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
stitches and there we go alright so then

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.980 
stitches and there we go alright so then
we<00:05:07.289> can<00:05:07.410> continue<00:05:07.800> working<00:05:08.220> our<00:05:08.580> round<00:05:08.880> as<00:05:09.240> we

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
we can continue working our round as we

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.540 
we can continue working our round as we
would<00:05:10.520> normally<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.930> that's<00:05:13.680> how<00:05:13.830> we<00:05:13.889> do<00:05:14.160> the

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
would normally and that's how we do the

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.629 
would normally and that's how we do the
Magic<00:05:15.389> Circle<00:05:16.020> or<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.710> magic<00:05:17.130> ring<00:05:18.680> hey<00:05:19.680> I'm
