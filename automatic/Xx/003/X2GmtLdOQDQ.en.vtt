00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
Canada so let's just do that

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.480 
Canada so let's just do that
so<00:01:18.470> 1200<00:01:19.470> calories<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.900> know<00:01:21.930> adults<00:01:22.830> who<00:01:23.250> try

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
so 1200 calories I know adults who try

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.730 
so 1200 calories I know adults who try
to<00:01:23.520> eat<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.939> much<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.990> that's<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.500> amount

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
to eat this much but that's the amount

for a child who is not active which

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.020 
for a child who is not active which
favor<00:01:43.110> met<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.560> five-year-old<00:01:44.130> they're<00:01:44.520> kind

fed everyone a baseline of something

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.240 
fed everyone a baseline of something
like<00:02:48.970> 2,200<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.150> 2,500<00:02:50.720> like<00:02:51.380> it

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
like 2,200 to 2,500 like it

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.240 
like 2,200 to 2,500 like it
that's<00:02:52.520> just<00:02:52.790> what<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.590> humans<00:02:54.590> need<00:02:54.980> that's

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
what we were built for now that being

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.660 
what we were built for now that being
said<00:02:57.680> not<00:02:58.640> all<00:02:58.700> calories<00:02:59.150> are<00:02:59.360> equal<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:00.320> mean

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
said not all calories are equal I mean

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.860 
said not all calories are equal I mean
1,000<00:03:01.670> calories<00:03:01.910> with<00:03:02.030> bananas<00:03:02.450> compared<00:03:02.780> to

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
1,000 calories with bananas compared to

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.650 
1,000 calories with bananas compared to
1,000<00:03:03.380> calories<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.920> bacon<00:03:04.520> are<00:03:04.850> not<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.330> same

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
1,000 calories of bacon are not the same

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.400 
1,000 calories of bacon are not the same
and<00:03:06.080> you<00:03:06.230> can't<00:03:06.860> really<00:03:07.340> eat<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:07.820> much<00:03:08.410> bacon

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.370 
and you can't really eat that much bacon
I<00:03:09.590> mean<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.010> could<00:03:10.489> with<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.750> know<00:03:11.840> bananas

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
I mean you could with you know bananas

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.770 
I mean you could with you know bananas
come<00:03:12.920> here<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.100> bacon<00:03:13.430> one<00:03:14.420> of<00:03:14.510> them's<00:03:14.660> gonna

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
come here to bacon one of them's gonna

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.600 
come here to bacon one of them's gonna
be<00:03:14.989> better<00:03:15.140> for<00:03:15.350> your<00:03:15.410> body<00:03:15.590> yeah<00:03:15.920> so<00:03:16.160> not<00:03:16.310> all

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
calories are equal and people who eat

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.039 
calories are equal and people who eat
you<00:03:20.720> know<00:03:20.840> high<00:03:21.200> carb<00:03:21.560> plant-based<00:03:23.049> really

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
you know high carb plant-based really

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.650 
you know high carb plant-based really
are<00:03:24.230> eating<00:03:24.680> that<00:03:25.340> much<00:03:25.640> more<00:03:25.910> than<00:03:26.330> other

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
are eating that much more than other

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.070 
are eating that much more than other
people<00:03:27.140> but<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:28.370> volumes<00:03:29.030> are<00:03:29.269> bigger<00:03:29.750> and

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
people but the volumes are bigger and

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.050 
people but the volumes are bigger and
that<00:03:30.410> is<00:03:30.530> because<00:03:30.890> you're<00:03:31.400> consuming<00:03:31.880> more

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
that is because you're consuming more

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.270 
that is because you're consuming more
water<00:03:32.480> rich<00:03:32.750> foods<00:03:33.080> they're<00:03:33.410> less<00:03:33.650> dense<00:03:33.950> and

water rich foods they're less dense and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.240 
water rich foods they're less dense and
you<00:03:35.180> just<00:03:35.420> need<00:03:35.660> more<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:35.959> them<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.530> get<00:03:36.739> the

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
you just need more of them to get the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.750 
you just need more of them to get the
amounts<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.269> you<00:03:38.330> need<00:03:38.750> but<00:03:39.400> you're<00:03:40.400> also

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.570 
amounts that you need but you're also
getting<00:03:41.269> more<00:03:41.780> than<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.140> average<00:03:42.260> person

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580
