00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
how the packet says for this I'm using

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.410 
how the packet says for this I'm using
about<00:00:32.520> 200<00:00:33.239> mils<00:00:33.950> 250<00:00:34.950> mils<00:00:35.190> or<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:36.000> cup<00:00:36.270> of

about 200 mils 250 mils or one cup of
boiling<00:00:36.719> water<00:00:36.930> just<00:00:37.860> add<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> mix<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.399> it

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
boiling water just add the mix to it

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.340 
boiling water just add the mix to it
give<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.059> stir<00:00:39.329> until<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.870> sugar<00:00:39.960> is

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
give it a stir until the sugar is

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.049 
give it a stir until the sugar is
dissolved<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.950> once<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> sugar<00:00:41.879> is

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
dissolved and once the sugar is

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.330 
dissolved and once the sugar is
dissolved<00:00:42.090> we're<00:00:42.540> going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.809> add<00:00:43.070> some<00:00:44.070> cold

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
dissolved we're going to add some cold

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.590 
dissolved we're going to add some cold
water<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:46.230> cool<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.500> down<00:00:46.730> which<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> about<00:00:48.059> 200

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
water to cool it down which is about 200

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.330 
water to cool it down which is about 200
mils<00:00:48.809> worth<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.829> will<00:00:49.920> also<00:00:50.160> make<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
mils worth but that will also make it

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.830 
mils worth but that will also make it
easier<00:00:50.520> because<00:00:50.760> I'm<00:00:51.000> using<00:00:51.180> plastic<00:00:51.660> cups

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
easier because I'm using plastic cups

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.180 
easier because I'm using plastic cups
and<00:00:51.930> we're<00:00:52.079> not<00:00:52.199> using<00:00:52.350> plastic<00:00:52.770> cups<00:00:52.949> don't

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and we're not using plastic cups don't

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.979 
and we're not using plastic cups don't
worry<00:00:53.309> about<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.270> I'm<00:00:54.360> using<00:00:54.510> plastic

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
worry about it but I'm using plastic

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.470 
worry about it but I'm using plastic
cups<00:00:55.250> just<00:00:56.250> make<00:00:56.460> sure<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> water<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.120> cooled

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
cups just make sure the water is cooled

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.610 
cups just make sure the water is cooled
down<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.660> bit<00:00:57.750> otherwise<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.379> could<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
down a bit otherwise you could have a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.799 
down a bit otherwise you could have a
bit<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.890> disaster<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.399> your<00:00:59.430> hands<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.750> I

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
bit of a disaster on your hands so I

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.000 
bit of a disaster on your hands so I
just<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.079> our<00:01:01.199> cups<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.770> I'm<00:01:01.829> just

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
just have our cups here so I'm just

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.549 
just have our cups here so I'm just
going<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.250> add<00:01:02.719> just<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.899> little<00:01:03.930> bit<00:01:04.260> at<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.530> time

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
going to add just a little bit at a time

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.870 
going to add just a little bit at a time
I'm<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.159> even<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.549> out<00:01:05.670> between

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
I'm just going to even it out between

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.190 
I'm just going to even it out between
six<00:01:06.630> plastic<00:01:07.290> cups<00:01:08.630> you<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.900> too<00:01:10.080> much

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
six plastic cups you don't do too much

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.170 
six plastic cups you don't do too much
because<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:11.340> really<00:01:11.610> depends<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.000> how<00:01:12.119> many

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
because it really depends on how many

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.390 
because it really depends on how many
flavours<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.689> you're<00:01:12.900> doing<00:01:12.990> actually<00:01:13.400> you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
flavours that you're doing actually you

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.560 
flavours that you're doing actually you
have<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> do<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.760> couple<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.090> flavors<00:01:15.450> or

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
have to do it a couple of flavors or

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.960 
have to do it a couple of flavors or
colors<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.979> higher<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
colors you can have it higher but if the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.140 
colors you can have it higher but if the
more<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.420> obviously<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:20.189> less<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:21.060> want

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
more you do obviously the less you want

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.580 
more you do obviously the less you want
to<00:01:21.299> add<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.689> each<00:01:21.780> cup<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.200> you've<00:01:22.320> got<00:01:22.409> room<00:01:22.560> to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
to add to each cup so you've got room to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.740 
to add to each cup so you've got room to
add<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> wall<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.820> into<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> base<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.330> each<00:01:24.509> cup

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.179 
add a wall and into the base of each cup
I'm<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.380> add<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:26.720> w<00:01:27.720> wine<00:01:28.189> okay

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
I'm just going to add in one w wine okay

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.530 
I'm just going to add in one w wine okay
so<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.549> place<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:29.880> gummy<00:01:30.090> worms<00:01:30.329> in

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
for about an hour to give them all the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.330 
for about an hour to give them all the
chance<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.450> set<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.740> time<00:01:34.950> just

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340
