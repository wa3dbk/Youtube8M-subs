00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
left-handed as usual you do need to get

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.850 
left-handed as usual you do need to get
used<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> opening<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:19.740> you're

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
used to opening this because you're

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.880 
used to opening this because you're
swinging<00:01:20.369> out<00:01:20.490> such<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> long<00:01:21.150> blade<00:01:21.890> versus

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
swinging out such a long blade versus

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.840 
swinging out such a long blade versus
let's<00:01:23.790> look<00:01:24.030> at<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> Spyderco<00:01:25.020> Cal<00:01:25.530> III<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.729> can

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
let's look at a Spyderco Cal III you can

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.780 
let's look at a Spyderco Cal III you can
just<00:01:27.030> see<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.890> mass<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.670> you're

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
just see that the mass that you're

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.859 
just see that the mass that you're
moving<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.720> longer<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.869> longer

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
moving is is longer so you have a longer

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.100 
moving is is longer so you have a longer
I<00:01:34.229> guess<00:01:34.500> fulcrum<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.450> quite<00:01:36.930> as

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
I guess fulcrum and it's not quite as

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.590 
I guess fulcrum and it's not quite as
fast<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:38.100> definitely<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.150> used<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
fast you definitely have to get used to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.200 
fast you definitely have to get used to
it<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.990> feels<00:01:40.500> faster<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.250> feels<00:01:41.579> easier<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
it this feels faster it feels easier to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.340 
it this feels faster it feels easier to
move<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:43.290> that's<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.399> thing<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.869> other<00:01:46.079> was

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
move so that's one thing the other was

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.300 
move so that's one thing the other was
it<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> big<00:01:47.399> long<00:01:47.670> knife<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.840> felt<00:01:49.710> for

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
it is a big long knife I felt for

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.420 
it is a big long knife I felt for
everyday<00:01:50.610> carry<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.149> was<00:01:51.299> kind<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:52.430> little

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
everyday carry it was kind of a little

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.580 
everyday carry it was kind of a little
too<00:01:53.670> much<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.479> got<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> nice<00:01:54.840> long<00:01:55.079> blade<00:01:55.439> and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
too much it's got a nice long blade and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.560 
too much it's got a nice long blade and
I'll<00:01:55.710> tell<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:55.979> what<00:01:56.180> now<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.479> could

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
I'll tell you what now that I could

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.109 
I'll tell you what now that I could
carrying<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:57.990> bench<00:01:58.290> made<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.700> compare

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
carrying this bench made and you compare

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.929 
carrying this bench made and you compare
that<00:02:00.149> blade<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.140> almost<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.979> same<00:02:02.250> length

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
that blade it's almost the same length

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.929 
that blade it's almost the same length
of<00:02:03.119> blade<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.960> look<00:02:04.079> at<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.290> handle<00:02:04.850> can<00:02:05.850> you

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
of blade but look at that handle can you

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.150 
of blade but look at that handle can you
see<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.299> handle<00:02:06.689> length<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.170> mean<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> blades

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
see that handle length I mean the blades

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.339 
see that handle length I mean the blades
are<00:02:08.340> almost<00:02:08.610> identical<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.959> handle<00:02:10.319> is

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
are almost identical and the handle is

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.309 
are almost identical and the handle is
almost<00:02:10.590> an<00:02:10.800> inch<00:02:11.009> shorter<00:02:11.459> so

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
almost an inch shorter so

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
me so this dis definitely you know would

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.460 
me so this dis definitely you know would
be<00:06:30.720> suitable<00:06:31.169> for<00:06:31.290> poking<00:06:31.800> them<00:06:31.980> away<00:06:32.400> from<00:06:32.640> me

be suitable for poking them away from me

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.500 
be suitable for poking them away from me
so<00:06:34.470> again<00:06:34.530> the<00:06:34.830> Spyderco<00:06:35.610> I<00:06:36.180> think<00:06:36.390> the

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
so again the Spyderco I think the

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.640 
so again the Spyderco I think the
military<00:06:36.930> and<00:06:37.050> police<00:06:38.870> BG<00:06:39.870> 10

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
military and police BG 10

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.740 
military and police BG 10
nice<00:06:40.770> it's<00:06:41.400> actually<00:06:41.550> a<00:06:41.910> little<00:06:42.210> too<00:06:42.419> smooth

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
nice it's actually a little too smooth

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.620 
nice it's actually a little too smooth
for<00:06:42.990> me<00:06:43.020> I<00:06:43.290> like<00:06:43.979> um<00:06:44.750> this<00:06:45.750> you<00:06:46.470> can<00:06:46.620> hear<00:06:46.860> it

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
for me I like um this you can hear it

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.189 
for me I like um this you can hear it
Cal<00:06:48.630> III<00:06:49.020> is<00:06:49.110> definitely<00:06:49.680> this<00:06:50.669> is<00:06:50.990> not<00:06:51.990> making

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 
Cal III is definitely this is not making

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:54.230 
Cal III is definitely this is not making
it's<00:06:52.560> much<00:06:52.770> smoother<00:06:53.220> I<00:06:53.250> would<00:06:53.820> like<00:06:54.000> it<00:06:54.120> to<00:06:54.210> be

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
it's much smoother I would like it to be

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.300 
it's much smoother I would like it to be
a<00:06:54.300> little<00:06:54.539> rougher<00:06:54.810> like<00:06:54.960> this<00:06:55.229> I<00:06:55.440> don't<00:06:56.220> know

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
a little rougher like this I don't know

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.650 
a little rougher like this I don't know
if<00:06:56.400> that's<00:06:56.580> how<00:06:56.729> this<00:06:56.850> started<00:06:57.330> I<00:06:57.449> can't

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
if that's how this started I can't

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.150 
if that's how this started I can't
believe<00:06:57.960> that<00:06:58.110> it<00:06:58.259> would<00:06:58.380> all<00:06:58.530> be<00:06:58.560> that<00:06:58.830> smooth

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
believe that it would all be that smooth

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.779 
believe that it would all be that smooth
by<00:06:59.340> now<00:06:59.490> so<00:06:59.789> I<00:07:00.030> think<00:07:01.460> that's<00:07:02.460> the<00:07:02.580> other<00:07:02.610> thing

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:02.789 
by now so I think that's the other thing

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:08.090 
by now so I think that's the other thing
that<00:07:03.330> they<00:07:03.479> should<00:07:03.810> change<00:07:05.840> great<00:07:06.840> knife<00:07:07.100> if

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 
that they should change great knife if

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:13.009 
that they should change great knife if
you<00:07:08.160> need<00:07:08.370> a<00:07:08.400> long<00:07:08.610> knife<00:07:09.560> you<00:07:10.560> should<00:07:10.710> get<00:07:10.860> one
