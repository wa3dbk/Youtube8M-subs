00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.990 

and<00:01:35.950> as<00:01:36.730> you<00:01:36.850> can<00:01:37.000> see<00:01:37.210> it<00:01:37.300> works<00:01:37.540> perfectly

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.150 

but<00:01:41.660> by<00:01:41.780> doing<00:01:41.840> that<00:01:42.230> because<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.740> battery<00:01:43.070> of

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
but by doing that because the battery of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.580 
but by doing that because the battery of
the<00:01:43.190> original<00:01:43.820> phone<00:01:43.940> is<00:01:44.150> a<00:01:44.180> bit<00:01:44.510> thicker<00:01:44.810> the

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
the original phone is a bit thicker the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.770 
the original phone is a bit thicker the
battery<00:01:45.860> will<00:01:45.980> be<00:01:46.010> coming<00:01:46.460> out<00:01:46.640> of<00:01:46.910> the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
battery will be coming out of the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.600 
battery will be coming out of the
emplacement<00:01:48.080> well<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:48.590> should<00:01:48.800> be<00:01:48.950> okay<00:01:49.400> so

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
emplacement well it should be okay so

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.010 
emplacement well it should be okay so
when<00:01:49.760> we<00:01:49.850> take<00:01:50.000> a<00:01:50.060> close<00:01:50.360> look<00:01:50.450> at<00:01:50.780> both

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
when we take a close look at both

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.710 
when we take a close look at both

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
up at least I could because on both

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.620 
up at least I could because on both
version<00:02:48.799> it<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.070> pretty<00:02:49.370> hard<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.730> do<00:02:50.000> okay<00:02:50.570> so

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
version it is pretty hard to do okay so

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.509 
version it is pretty hard to do okay so
I've<00:02:50.840> done<00:02:51.019> one<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.620> now<00:02:52.070> I'm<00:02:52.160> going<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.340> try

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
I've done one and now I'm going to try

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.039 
I've done one and now I'm going to try
to<00:02:52.580> do<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.880> other<00:02:53.000> one<00:02:53.180> this<00:02:53.390> was<00:02:53.540> quite<00:02:53.810> easy

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
to do the other one this was quite easy

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.860 
to do the other one this was quite easy
it's<00:02:54.560> why<00:02:55.220> well<00:02:55.549> actually<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:56.330> is<00:02:56.480> easier<00:02:56.810> to

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
it's why well actually it is easier to

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.080 
it's why well actually it is easier to
do<00:02:57.110> on<00:02:57.200> your<00:02:57.350> ear<00:02:57.560> on<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:58.010> original<00:02:58.580> one<00:02:58.760> then

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
do on your ear on the original one then

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.910 
do on your ear on the original one then
on<00:02:59.299> the<00:02:59.420> fake<00:02:59.690> one<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.140> can<00:03:00.500> see<00:03:00.680> that<00:03:00.830> the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
on the fake one you can see that the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.190 
on the fake one you can see that the
inside<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.280> kind<00:03:01.519> of<00:03:01.640> similar<00:03:01.970> except<00:03:02.959> for<00:03:02.989> the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
inside is kind of similar except for the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.350

little<00:03:03.380> tap<00:03:03.799> thing<00:03:04.100> on<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.610> original<00:03:05.000> one<00:03:05.120> has

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
little tap thing on the original one has

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.720 
little tap thing on the original one has
some<00:03:05.660> kind<00:03:05.870> of<00:03:05.959> waterproof<00:03:06.440> thingy<00:03:06.739> I<00:03:07.070> bet

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
some kind of waterproof thingy I bet

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.340 
some kind of waterproof thingy I bet
under<00:03:07.910> fake<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:08.420> doesn't<00:03:08.780> have<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.110> same

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350

under fake it doesn't have the same
thing<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:09.920> now<00:03:10.370> when<00:03:10.549> we<00:03:10.640> take<00:03:10.820> a<00:03:10.850> look<00:03:11.090> at<00:03:11.269> the

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
thing and now when we take a look at the

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.449 
thing and now when we take a look at the
power<00:03:11.750> buttons<00:03:12.200> again<00:03:12.709> like<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.010> volume<00:03:13.220> it

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
power buttons again like the volume it

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.550 
power buttons again like the volume it
they<00:03:13.700> look<00:03:13.910> kind<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.239> similar<00:03:14.510> except<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.380> as

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
they look kind of similar except that as

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.190 
they look kind of similar except that as
I<00:03:15.620> said<00:03:15.950> earlier<00:03:16.370> their<00:03:17.060> original<00:03:17.750> one<00:03:17.870> makes

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
I said earlier their original one makes

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.500 
I said earlier their original one makes
more<00:03:18.799> of<00:03:18.860> a<00:03:19.160> click<00:03:19.400> sound<00:03:19.610> than<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:19.910> fake<00:03:20.269> one

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
more of a click sound than the fake one

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.199 
more of a click sound than the fake one
and<00:03:20.750> now<00:03:21.470> on<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.920> back<00:03:22.160> you<00:03:22.670> can<00:03:22.850> see<00:03:23.030> that

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
and now on the back you can see that

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.150 
and now on the back you can see that
everything<00:03:23.720> again<00:03:24.170> is<00:03:24.380> kind<00:03:24.560> of<00:03:24.680> similar<00:03:24.980> we

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
everything again is kind of similar we

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160 
everything again is kind of similar we
get<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.400> microphone<00:03:26.000> at<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.420> bottom<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:26.989> got

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
get a microphone at the bottom you got

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.560 
get a microphone at the bottom you got
the<00:03:27.380> logos<00:03:27.829> right<00:03:28.070> in<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.880> middle<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.450> you

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
the logos right in the middle and you

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.050 
the logos right in the middle and you
guys<00:03:29.780> also<00:03:30.110> have<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.620> camera<00:03:31.100> except<00:03:31.910> that

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
guys also have the camera except that

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.000 
guys also have the camera except that
here<00:03:32.269> is<00:03:32.360> well<00:03:32.660> when<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:33.260> can<00:03:33.530> swear<00:03:33.829> you<00:03:33.920> can

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
here is well when you can swear you can

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.310 
here is well when you can swear you can
see<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.400> actual<00:03:34.579> difference<00:03:34.970> would<00:03:35.750> be<00:03:36.019> as

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
see the actual difference would be as

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.259 
see the actual difference would be as
you<00:03:36.470> can<00:03:36.560> see<00:03:36.739> right<00:03:36.920> now<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.160> LED<00:03:37.790> flash<00:03:38.090> on

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
you can see right now the LED flash on

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.840 
you can see right now the LED flash on
the<00:03:38.450> real<00:03:38.750> looks<00:03:39.410> way<00:03:39.620> better<00:03:39.860> than<00:03:40.160> on<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.459> fake

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
the real looks way better than on a fake

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.690 
the real looks way better than on a fake
as<00:03:41.480> well<00:03:41.720> as<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.019> heart<00:03:42.290> as<00:03:43.160> well<00:03:43.459> as<00:03:43.579> the

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
as well as the heart as well as the

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.330 
as well as the heart as well as the
heart<00:03:43.940> rate<00:03:44.209> sensor<00:03:44.750> on<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.769> real<00:03:45.950> one<00:03:46.160> they

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
heart rate sensor on the real one they

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.949 
heart rate sensor on the real one they
look<00:03:46.519> more<00:03:46.850> kind<00:03:47.060> of<00:03:47.120> circle<00:03:47.570> while<00:03:47.750> on<00:03:47.840> the

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
look more kind of circle while on the

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.470 
look more kind of circle while on the
fake<00:03:48.230> they<00:03:48.620> are<00:03:48.739> also<00:03:49.129> circular<00:03:49.940> but<00:03:50.180> way

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
fake they are also circular but way

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.780 
fake they are also circular but way
bigger<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:51.020> can<00:03:51.620> also<00:03:51.830> see<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.340> difference

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
bigger and can also see the difference

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.460 
bigger and can also see the difference
on<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.060> camera<00:03:53.420> lens<00:03:53.750> on

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
on a camera lens on

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.200 
on a camera lens on
the<00:03:54.530> authentic<00:03:55.040> it<00:03:55.190> is<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.580> lens<00:03:55.790> is<00:03:56.000> way

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
the authentic it is the lens is way

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.600 
the authentic it is the lens is way
bigger<00:03:56.510> than<00:03:56.900> on<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.260> fake<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:57.830> now<00:03:58.280> when<00:03:58.490> we

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
bigger than on the fake and now when we

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.340 
bigger than on the fake and now when we
take<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:58.820> look<00:03:58.940> at<00:03:59.270> the<00:03:59.510> back<00:03:59.750> as<00:04:00.020> well<00:04:00.200> as<00:04:00.320> the

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
take a look at the back as well as the

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.980 
take a look at the back as well as the
interior<00:04:00.830> while<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.820> real<00:04:02.030> one<00:04:02.300> it<00:04:02.540> is<00:04:02.690> kind

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
interior while the real one it is kind

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.740 
interior while the real one it is kind
of<00:04:03.080> more<00:04:03.740> way<00:04:04.160> more<00:04:04.550> soft<00:04:04.910> than<00:04:05.060> on<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.450> fake

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
of more way more soft than on the fake

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.320 
of more way more soft than on the fake
the<00:04:06.230> figure<00:04:06.590> finger<00:04:07.070> just<00:04:07.400> slides<00:04:07.850> over<00:04:08.060> it

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
the figure finger just slides over it

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.120 
the figure finger just slides over it
while<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.720> original<00:04:09.170> you<00:04:09.530> can<00:04:09.560> take<00:04:10.010> your

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
while the original you can take your

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.250 
while the original you can take your
time<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.640> it<00:04:10.700> won't<00:04:10.850> even<00:04:11.060> slide<00:04:11.480> can<00:04:12.050> also

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
time and it won't even slide can also

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.380 
time and it won't even slide can also
see<00:04:12.530> that<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.830> also<00:04:13.010> has<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.940> waterproof

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
backing on the back of the original one

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.360 
backing on the back of the original one
while<00:04:17.480> on<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.750> fake<00:04:17.959> you<00:04:18.079> don't<00:04:18.290> have<00:04:18.500> it<00:04:18.739> the

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
while on the fake you don't have it the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.250 
while on the fake you don't have it the
battery<00:04:19.609> also<00:04:20.180> as<00:04:20.450> I<00:04:20.480> previously<00:04:20.750> mentioned

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
battery also as I previously mentioned

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.280 
battery also as I previously mentioned
it<00:04:21.680> I<00:04:21.890> mentioned<00:04:22.760> on<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.150> video<00:04:23.480> is<00:04:23.810> that<00:04:23.840> the

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
it I mentioned on the video is that the

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.760 
it I mentioned on the video is that the
real<00:04:24.470> one<00:04:24.680> has<00:04:25.150> it's<00:04:26.150> way<00:04:26.420> bigger<00:04:26.690> it<00:04:27.200> is<00:04:27.260> real

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
real one has it's way bigger it is real

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.940 
real one has it's way bigger it is real
2,800<00:04:28.580> milliamps<00:04:29.210> our<00:04:29.390> battery<00:04:29.990> can<00:04:30.560> also<00:04:30.710> see

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
2,800 milliamps our battery can also see

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.220 
2,800 milliamps our battery can also see
that<00:04:31.130> has<00:04:31.280> kind<00:04:31.610> of<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.850> outline<00:04:32.060> of<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.540> NFC

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
that has kind of the outline of the NFC

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.560 
that has kind of the outline of the NFC
and<00:04:33.410> when<00:04:34.340> you<00:04:34.460> also<00:04:34.670> take<00:04:34.940> a<00:04:34.970> look<00:04:35.210> you<00:04:35.540> can

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
and when you also take a look you can

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.750 
and when you also take a look you can
see<00:04:35.660> that<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.960> speaker<00:04:36.400> aren't<00:04:37.400> really<00:04:37.640> the

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
see that the speaker aren't really the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.630 
see that the speaker aren't really the
same<00:04:38.060> just<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:38.960> bit<00:04:39.110> of<00:04:39.230> different<00:04:40.190> just<00:04:40.430> a<00:04:40.490> bit

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
same just a bit of different just a bit

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.430 
same just a bit of different just a bit
of<00:04:40.730> difference<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.510> can<00:04:41.660> see<00:04:41.840> that<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.200> fake

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
of difference you can see that the fake

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.470 
of difference you can see that the fake
also<00:04:42.770> has<00:04:42.920> some<00:04:43.220> kind<00:04:43.430> of<00:04:43.520> screws<00:04:43.880> all<00:04:44.120> over

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
also has some kind of screws all over

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.390 
also has some kind of screws all over
you<00:04:44.600> can<00:04:44.780> also<00:04:45.050> see<00:04:45.440> this<00:04:45.680> thing<00:04:45.950> I<00:04:46.100> think<00:04:46.130> this

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
you can also see this thing I think this

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.000 
you can also see this thing I think this
is<00:04:46.640> the<00:04:46.880> NFC<00:04:47.480> place<00:04:47.750> or<00:04:48.290> the<00:04:48.380> end<00:04:48.500> of<00:04:48.650> some<00:04:48.830> kind

is the NFC place or the end of some kind
of<00:04:49.070> antennas<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:50.030> art<00:04:50.330> will<00:04:50.960> be<00:04:51.080> similar<00:04:51.590> and

when<00:04:52.220> we<00:04:52.370> remove<00:04:52.700> the<00:04:52.880> batteries<00:04:53.330> this<00:04:53.570> is

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
when we remove the batteries this is

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
the samsung galaxy s4 and now let's just

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.620 
the samsung galaxy s4 and now let's just
go<00:05:13.190> ahead<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.430> take<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.610> look<00:05:13.880> at<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.240> booting

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
go ahead and take a look at the booting

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.159 
go ahead and take a look at the booting
screen<00:05:14.990> of<00:05:15.169> both<00:05:15.470> devices<00:05:16.630> you<00:05:17.630> can<00:05:17.810> see<00:05:18.020> that

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
screen of both devices you can see that

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.500 
screen of both devices you can see that
your<00:05:18.320> tentacle<00:05:18.890> is<00:05:19.010> way<00:05:19.220> faster<00:05:19.700> to<00:05:19.820> open<00:05:20.300> and

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
your tentacle is way faster to open and

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.390 
your tentacle is way faster to open and
it<00:05:20.600> also<00:05:20.810> says<00:05:21.140> at<00:05:21.380> the<00:05:21.500> bottom<00:05:21.680> powered<00:05:22.220> by

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
it also says at the bottom powered by

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.820 
it also says at the bottom powered by
Android<00:05:23.030> and<00:05:23.300> on<00:05:23.360> the<00:05:23.479> fake<00:05:23.750> while<00:05:24.380> this<00:05:24.560> boot

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
Android and on the fake while this boot

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.730 
Android and on the fake while this boot
logo<00:05:25.060> happens<00:05:26.060> quite<00:05:26.300> fast<00:05:26.660> and<00:05:26.960> it<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.380> boot

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
logo happens quite fast and it the boot

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.710 
logo happens quite fast and it the boot
look<00:05:27.890> on<00:05:28.070> both<00:05:28.310> phones<00:05:28.640> is<00:05:28.940> also<00:05:29.479> quite

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
look on both phones is also quite

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.480 
look on both phones is also quite
similar<00:05:30.229> but<00:05:30.800> as<00:05:30.950> you<00:05:31.040> can<00:05:31.100> see<00:05:31.160> in<00:05:31.400> a<00:05:31.460> couple

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
similar but as you can see in a couple

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.940 
similar but as you can see in a couple
of<00:05:31.820> second<00:05:32.240> is<00:05:32.390> that<00:05:32.720> even<00:05:33.110> though<00:05:33.290> the<00:05:33.800> white

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
of second is that even though the white

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.940 
of second is that even though the white
version<00:05:34.690> happened<00:05:35.690> with<00:05:35.840> a<00:05:35.990> bit<00:05:36.260> faster<00:05:36.710> while

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
version happened with a bit faster while

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.850 
version happened with a bit faster while
the<00:05:37.160> original<00:05:37.430> one<00:05:38.030> is<00:05:38.240> way<00:05:38.840> faster<00:05:39.110> to<00:05:39.500> open

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
the original one is way faster to open

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.260 
the original one is way faster to open
than<00:05:40.010> the<00:05:40.220> fake<00:05:40.490> one

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
than the fake one

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.360 
than the fake one
and<00:05:42.360> when<00:05:43.260> we<00:05:43.380> take<00:05:43.530> a<00:05:43.590> look<00:05:43.800> at<00:05:44.040> the<00:05:44.160> lock

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
and when we take a look at the lock

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.700 
and when we take a look at the lock
screen<00:05:44.580> concede<00:05:45.030> that<00:05:45.060> under<00:05:45.470> original<00:05:46.470> it

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
screen concede that under original it

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.010 
screen concede that under original it
seems<00:05:47.010> quite<00:05:47.340> quite<00:05:47.760> darker<00:05:48.210> this<00:05:48.510> is<00:05:48.660> because

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
seems quite quite darker this is because

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.810 
seems quite quite darker this is because
the<00:05:49.230> screen<00:05:49.530> on<00:05:49.770> the<00:05:49.860> original<00:05:50.250> is<00:05:50.400> for<00:05:50.640> sure

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
the screen on the original is for sure

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.420 
the screen on the original is for sure
better<00:05:51.120> than<00:05:51.390> on<00:05:51.600> a<00:05:51.630> fake<00:05:51.990> one<00:05:52.230> and<00:05:52.500> then<00:05:53.310> the

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
better than on a fake one and then the

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.130 
better than on a fake one and then the
original<00:05:53.910> version<00:05:54.300> you<00:05:54.420> also<00:05:54.630> get<00:05:54.960> a

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
original version you also get a

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.960 
original version you also get a
fingerprint<00:05:55.890> scanner<00:05:56.190> which<00:05:56.580> is<00:05:56.730> something

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
fingerprint scanner which is something

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.330 
fingerprint scanner which is something
that<00:05:57.240> they<00:05:57.360> fake<00:05:57.630> one<00:05:57.840> lacks<00:05:58.140> okay<00:05:58.950> so<00:05:59.010> I<00:05:59.130> guess

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
that they fake one lacks okay so I guess

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.250 
that they fake one lacks okay so I guess
that<00:05:59.550> this<00:05:59.730> is<00:05:59.790> it<00:06:00.150> for<00:06:00.390> this<00:06:00.510> video<00:06:00.750> make<00:06:01.230> sure
