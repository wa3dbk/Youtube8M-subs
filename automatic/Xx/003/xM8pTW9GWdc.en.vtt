00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
they were in a storage unit that during

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.800 
they were in a storage unit that during
his<00:00:29.220> life<00:00:29.429> he<00:00:29.460> was<00:00:29.789> well<00:00:30.060> aware<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.750> he

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
his life he was well aware of and he

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.359 
his life he was well aware of and he
made<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.109> conscious<00:00:31.349> decision<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:32.009> never

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
made the conscious decision to never

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.100 
made the conscious decision to never
release<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.059> album<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.809> number<00:00:33.930> of

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
release this album and a number of

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
others by that I'm saying there's

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.310 
others by that I'm saying there's
probably<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.940> very<00:00:36.329> good<00:00:36.660> reason<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.170> he

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
probably a very good reason that he

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.900 
probably a very good reason that he
didn't<00:00:37.680> release<00:00:37.980> these<00:00:38.190> songs<00:00:38.430> during<00:00:38.700> his
