 Puerto Rican delicacy that moves me a green 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.740
 you take tree because we the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.440
 Puerto Ricans we have the ability to 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.199
 invent lots of recipes with a 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.150
 simple ingredient for example the yucca 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.370
 not only as woman life or the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.320

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.910

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.190
 is the yucca pie and this is our 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.230
 inventiveness in the kitchen because never 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.960
 has end we invented with what 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.180
 be and this is the case a yukita 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.200
 about two pounds of cassava 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.780

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.420

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.079
 help with the two pounds approximately 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.399
 a quarter pound of pumpkin because 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.960
