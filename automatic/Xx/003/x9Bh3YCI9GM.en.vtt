00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
you saw there rewind if you didn't see

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.080 
you saw there rewind if you didn't see
them<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.399> some<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> goals<00:00:35.880> are

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090

scored with him like I think his
attacking<00:00:38.700> mentality<00:00:38.969> must<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.750> high<00:00:39.960> or

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
attacking mentality must be high or
