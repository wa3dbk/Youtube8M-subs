here there's a just a little scratch on
this<00:02:30.420> one<00:02:33.140> then<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.170> noticed<00:02:34.880> back<00:02:35.880> here<00:02:36.240> on<00:02:36.420> the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
this one then I noticed back here on the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.660 
this one then I noticed back here on the
back<00:02:36.630> fender

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
back fender

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.230 
back fender
there<00:02:39.209> was<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.780> both<00:02:40.050> sides<00:02:40.349> of<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.680> fender

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
there was on both sides of the fender

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.990 
there was on both sides of the fender
some<00:02:42.240> rubbing<00:02:42.750> right<00:02:43.530> in<00:02:43.739> here<00:02:44.220> on<00:02:44.370> both<00:02:44.700> sides

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
some rubbing right in here on both sides

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.570 
some rubbing right in here on both sides
so<00:02:45.330> I'm<00:02:45.870> thinking<00:02:46.319> they<00:02:46.410> probably<00:02:46.709> had<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> set

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
so I'm thinking they probably had a set

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.600 
so I'm thinking they probably had a set
of<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:48.319> throw<00:02:49.319> over<00:02:49.590> bags<00:02:49.860> or<00:02:50.160> something<00:02:50.489> on

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
of of throw over bags or something on

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.300 
of of throw over bags or something on
there<00:02:50.760> maybe<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:52.170> rubbed<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:53.069> that

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
there maybe that rubbed on that

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.030 
there maybe that rubbed on that
scratched<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.910> up<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.209> little<00:02:54.270> bit<00:02:55.040> other

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040
