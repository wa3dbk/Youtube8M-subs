for<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.739> follow<00:00:47.190> steady<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.730> even<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.900 
squad again so I don't think he has a
little<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.899> future<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.469> Liverpool<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
little here the future at Liverpool and

need more firepower because at this

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
point we just look a little bit short of

point we just look a little bit short of
APIs<00:05:36.700> top-four<00:05:37.180> spot<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.750> still<00:05:37.990> believe<00:05:38.350> that

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
we could get up for but for example we

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.190 
we could get up for but for example we
