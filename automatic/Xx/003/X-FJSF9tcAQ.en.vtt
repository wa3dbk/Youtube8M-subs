00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello everyone and today I want to tell 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.040
 about fashion which is called but pistons 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.840
 people who know even a little bit of it together 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.679
 already guessed what he adds 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.860
 more 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.049
 pistons that used to be before 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.140
 only two pistons usually later 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.600
 which chinese need to be thrown away at all 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.570
 and the leagues of the pistons are also obsolete 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.710
 need to throw so let's see 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.470
 what kind of piston is walking this mod 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.640
 total this module with 5 pistons 5 new 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.000
 piston types 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.660
 Well, if the reader is a crew then nine and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.420
 nine 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.840
 dress this cooler than 5 let's see 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.190
 i will start the smallest pistons so 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.020
 this is generally an ordinary guy who can 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.090
 no one needs to break at all 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.590
 let's see this double intro 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.800
 this quad run on 4 here so you 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.960
 look here he is single worthless 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.469
 port which is just for one 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.100
 side and here these are spots 2 this is nice 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.590
 4 blocks shifted representatives on 4 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.960
 book rolled back topics you can do with 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.780
 this last I can not imagine Well 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.360
 since i'm not very good at 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.280
 Sauna though I understand understand but not 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.299
 strongly prevented so to speak well I i would 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.140
 did what gate over steep gate 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.479
 Kazan I do not know there before it was difficult to 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.770
 ordinary pistons make 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:40.920
 and the gate but with this mod put as 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:44.610
 not sport them let's see here I already 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.520
 on doing something look here 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.640
 my mom's design is running some 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.680
 zombies you run here closed on everything to 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:59.100
 you no one else can pass the pancake 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.290
 file had to put double pistons 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.290
 on give now put double pistons 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.520
 let's redo everything 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.780
 so here we do it and so here 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.420
 do everything you run run 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:22.020
 no zombies close to you yet 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:25.420
 the creeper will also be able to run as usual 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:37.180
 diamond pawns as usual will roast 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:40.980
 on the ceiling other pistons recently 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.770
 and added but they are not very much 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.650
 so that you can also abruptly designs I 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.920
 also can not imagine what you can cooler 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:56.070
 designs can be done just beautiful 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:09.510
 do so these pistons move objects 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:09.510
 For example, take the red torch calmly 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:29.610
 Now we see many already thought that 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.840
 he just this piston but no he 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:41.970
 moves quietly without any tension 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:49.600
 interesting is simple and it is the only way 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:04:05.049
 it works quietly it works even me 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:04:07.420
 did not even know that he may even after 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:12.180
 the same is just not lithium being advanced 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:18.419
 I just won't open it 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.419
 red torch push this block up 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:26.289
 cool so you can and do not know there 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:29.509
 take a decorative give and picture 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:32.090
 flower pot and greek greek greek ah 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:41.449
 well just not the grenadines is all 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:43.969
 okay by the way, let's take a look at Kraft 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.819
 double identity nekras from the usual past 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:49.419
 iron and three boards as a triple kravc of 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:53.150
 double iron carriage 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:57.110
 quadruple in short of triple iron and 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:02.259
 three boards all basically the same 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:05.569
 In short , as the piston is awesome piston 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.979
 yes just like the usual late 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.009
 only on the sides of the place 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:13.909
 cobblestone sides below instead 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:17.659
 cobblestone obsidian like next here 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:20.960
 this super nagibatorsky piston which 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:25.270
 I also liked my own 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:28.430
 characteristics so let's set 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:32.330
 I won the subject of Turov such which 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:35.389
 recently updated that without stepping on 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.370
 became hard ugly give give try 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.770
 parking do you think it just now 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.589
 will move on one side and all but no he 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.830
 he will fly up to the sky of kabula 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:48.349
 edging and understandable where let's see 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.710
 Whether he will be able to leave us and he even 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:56.000
 will be able to leave you see so let's 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:58.279
 see the land he can leave and he 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.339
 even the earth throws it at all 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:04.789
 cool you may not know how super damn 

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:10.900
 You can 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:10.900
 finch cool to you yes yo 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:22.159
 we might end super cool designs 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:24.889
 there how to develop to fly up objects and 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:28.070
 wave force somewhere in the village to 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:37.310
 to the inhabitants so that they are provided there 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:39.500
 the earth is clear well its on the diet of 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:43.970
 ordinary piston and prints 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:47.180
 Well, everything seems to be said about 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.860
 I don't even know this mod anymore 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:07:01.000
 adds nothing but 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:07:03.620
 and it's cool and these pistons and everything seems to be 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.640
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.640
 thanks for watching everyone bye
