00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.430
 welcome to boxing today I come explain 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.430
 how the knock out works on the c axis 3 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.130
 well not as broadly speaking this 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.719
 function that the g3 axis has to put a 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.889
 sort of pattern anywhere in 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.480
 the screen that will allow us 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.190
 unlock the phone right now 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.410
 we have no blocking method 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.539
 just the slide to unlock and 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.400
 well I will teach how it would be configured 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.289
 from scratch the knock out we're going to open 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.960
 the settings section then the screen 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.029
 lock or lock screen and let's 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.380
 to choose the type of blockade right now 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.640
 you see that it is in landslides that is 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.320
 what you just saw as he did the 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.780
 finger to unlock the screen 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.600
 it is the most traditional method and here 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.980
 we have knock out here we get four 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.559
 little dots and we have to choose 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.600
 the combination that we want between 3 and 8 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.000
 Sometimes we can press the combination that 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.070
 more we like in this case for example 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.480
 I'm going to put this combination 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.520
 and it's going to make me repeat it 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.960
 Once placed no code will ask us 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.329
 a pin just in case we forget in 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.290
 some time that we can always 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.500
 unlock our phone then with 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.330
 some kind of password 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.380
 note that once this is done 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.050
 we want to unlock our phone 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.510
 we can make this gesture that we just 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.680
 set up we can also do it in 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.220
 any part of the screen by 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.870
 example I could do it up here 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.370
 is that thanks without any problem 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.020
 it could even be unlock the 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.420
 screen and do it in this hollow here 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.520
 which is where it brings them by default could 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.410
 do it so occupy a very space 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.270
 great or even do it like that and that 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.100
 be very tiny and even so also 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.780
 it works the truth that it's fine because 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.000
 it's very safe is a very fast way 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.730
 besides directly accessing your 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.320
 phone from the locked screen and 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.390
 also with a security, let's say 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.980
 that you skip the pattern since the pattern 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.840
 it is implicit in the unlocking itself 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.310
 look what happens if I'm wrong 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.770
 put the knock out or put one 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.479
 just that is wrong I put this 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.160
 and you see that up here is lit a 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.020
 red led that tells us that we are 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.530
 putting the code more than a code 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.690
 incorrect 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.369
 However, if we put it right, 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.080
 automatically speaks the screen to 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.150
 big risk the knock code works 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.770
 pretty good and usually always 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
 the first one works the problem that 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.680
 has is that it conflicts with 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.570
 some other functions that have to 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.150
 three for example if we use 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.830
 the quick key function in this case 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.660
 for example the volume key down if 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.980
 we leave it down now that the camera 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.980
 boot here we have an example 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.870
 normally obviously mobility in 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.780
 landscape and we shoot a photo when 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.819
 let's see it from the gallery 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.530
 there you have the problem that is put in 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.549
 landscape and when we try to put the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.890
 code you see how it changes automatically 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.810
 puts the knockout does not work well 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.690
 look at how you never put yourself 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.670
 it automatically gets always on 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.930
 vertical and the problem is that if you use 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.580
 the quick method to take a picture and 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.870
 now you want to see her then you have 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.790
 that turn the phone tuck the no 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.709
 brooms and if you are not going to give an error to 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.940
 try to unlock it like this maybe 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.920
 explained because it seems silly 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.260
 but when you're using it often 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.879
 you realize that every time you go to 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.829
 have something oysters I have to put it with 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.480
 you have to turn because if you do not date 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.359
 the error is red 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.459
 it's a bit cumbersome but not a 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.049
 which would be good too serious for 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.980
 Of course the knock out can be so 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.980
 simple like this 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.660
 or as complex as this 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.680
 obviously I recommend that you do not pass 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.209
 with complexity because it's like a 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.439
 but it is also invisible and 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.349
 we see ourselves that what we are 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.060
 placing so good he's always going to 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.129
 be easier to remember one thing from 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.989
 more or less simple of course the 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.790
 Unlock function with double is in 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.709
 the screen does not have to have anything 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.390
 what to do with some code or be you or 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.250
 a double tap if it does not activate in any 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.870
 another function serves to unlock 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.970
 the screen as you can see really 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.950
 this is the method of blocking 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.219
 sliding if I want to unlock it 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.079
 double tap and already slid if I have a 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.730
 knock out I also give double tap it 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.889
 turn on the screen and then introduced 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.510
 the nomination I just want to clarify that 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.680
 which are two different things because the 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.299
 be similar because there can not be 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.889
 some kind of confusion and nothing really 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.720
 this is all for today I simply want 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.190
 do some small videos explaining 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.650
 in depth some of the functions 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.449
 of LG 3 since this phone is one of 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.490
 those that more different functionalities 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.080
 includes from the factory it has a lot of 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.410
 options that allow us to be able 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.550
 customize the phone allows us 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.039
 use a lot of curious functions 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.960
 and if I do a thorough analysis of everything 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.180
 that is going to be too long 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.550
 so my idea is to explain thoroughly 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.280
 all 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.890
 functions small shipments and then on 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.330
 the in-depth analysis just hit him 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.880
 a review if you want to learn how 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.900
 works completely then then already 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.820
 enter each of the videos where 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.930
 all the little things are explained 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.190
 I will not do either anyway 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.540
 too many videos do not believe that I'm going 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.180
 to do now 15 video explaining what 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.560
 all of all 3 and ready so nothing this 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.060
 It has been all for today if you liked it 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.010
 this type of video wants them to do more 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.290
 if they accept suggestions, that is, here in 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.880
 the comments then leave then I do not know 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.380
 to rubÃ©n I would like you to explain in 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.330
 depth the camera for example I 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.370
 would like the screen theme the 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.200
 resolution qhd or whatever you want but 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.940
 can leave in the comments and we see 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.410
 what can we do please know 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.110
 that helps me a lot that you give him 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.040
 a like and that costs nothing and you can 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.660
 follow through social networks 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.460
 to be up to date with each of the 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.100
 news of each video that I upload 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.020
 leaks news and raffles this has 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.530
 been all for today a greeting to all and 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.530
 until next time 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.160
 two
