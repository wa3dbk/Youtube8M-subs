the math to create a stringer and the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.560 
the math to create a stringer and the
first<00:00:16.740> three<00:00:17.039> sessions<00:00:17.850> we<00:00:17.970> create<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> drawing

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
first three sessions we create a drawing

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.240 
first three sessions we create a drawing
plane<00:00:18.960> added<00:00:19.470> elements<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.070> would<00:00:20.189> be

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
plane added elements that would be

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.550 
plane added elements that would be
encountered<00:00:20.760> on<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> job<00:00:21.180> site<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.260> third

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
encountered on a job site in the third

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.220 
encountered on a job site in the third
we<00:00:24.380> calculated<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:26.220> rise<00:00:26.630> for<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.660> stairway

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
we calculated the rise for the stairway

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.429 
we calculated the rise for the stairway
added<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.099> run<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.789> created<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.480> stair

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
added the run and created this stair

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.370 
added the run and created this stair
stringer<00:00:31.890> component<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:35.420> I'll<00:00:36.420> clarify<00:00:36.809> one

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
stringer component and I'll clarify one

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.340 
stringer component and I'll clarify one
thing<00:00:37.410> here<00:00:38.129> when<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.850> did<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> drawing<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.870> drew

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
thing here when I did the drawing I drew

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.220 
thing here when I did the drawing I drew
this<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> rough<00:00:41.190> trust<00:00:41.489> here<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
this as a rough trust here is the

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.630 
this as a rough trust here is the
subfloor<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.950> job<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.460> then<00:00:44.610> I

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
subfloor on the on the job and then I

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.180 
subfloor on the on the job and then I
said<00:00:44.969> I'd<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> use<00:00:45.739> 3/4<00:00:46.739> inch<00:00:46.890> plywood

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
said I'd like to use 3/4 inch plywood

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.360 
said I'd like to use 3/4 inch plywood
for<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> stringer<00:00:48.300> or<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.870> hanger<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.370> to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
for a stringer or for a hanger to to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.110 
for a stringer or for a hanger to to
support<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.510> stair<00:00:51.780> jacks<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.489> left<00:00:53.820> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
support the stair jacks and I left I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.119 
support the stair jacks and I left I
used<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.600> guide<00:00:54.809> line<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.260> represent<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.920> here

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
used a guide line to represent that here

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.910 
used a guide line to represent that here
I'm<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.340> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.579> trace<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.149> geometry

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
I'm just going to trace this geometry

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.990 
I'm just going to trace this geometry
that<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.609> was<00:00:59.789> grouped<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.020> first

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
that is that was grouped in the first

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.420 
that is that was grouped in the first
section<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.390> video<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:04.769> I'll<00:01:04.860> create

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
section of this video so I'll create

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.789 
section of this video so I'll create
make<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> component<00:01:06.840> out<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.650> is

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
make a component out of this and that is

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.530 
make a component out of this and that is
going<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.369> hanger<00:01:11.000> which<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.180> simple

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
going to be the hanger which is simple

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.580 
going to be the hanger which is simple
enough<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:13.340> jump<00:01:14.340> into<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.990> mode<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
enough to do jump into this mode and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.770 
enough to do jump into this mode and
then<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.619> pulled<00:01:19.890> this

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
then you can see I just pulled this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.990 
then you can see I just pulled this
material<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:21.900> let's<00:01:22.259> say<00:01:22.530> 42<00:01:23.220> inches<00:01:23.700> wide

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
material out let's say 42 inches wide

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.070 
material out let's say 42 inches wide
for<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> 42<00:01:24.960> inch<00:01:24.990> wide<00:01:25.350> staircase<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.840> we'll

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
for a 42 inch wide staircase and we'll

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.810 
for a 42 inch wide staircase and we'll
get<00:01:28.200> rid<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.470> extra<00:01:28.950> geometry<00:01:29.250> line

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
get rid of that extra geometry line

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.649 
get rid of that extra geometry line
there<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:31.070> because<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.460> typically<00:01:33.450> made

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
there and because this is typically made

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.190 
there and because this is typically made
out<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.960> plywood<00:01:35.810> I'm<00:01:36.810> gonna<00:01:38.689> select<00:01:39.689> use<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
out of plywood I'm gonna select use the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.910 
out of plywood I'm gonna select use the
eyedropper<00:01:40.409> tool<00:01:41.009> select<00:01:42.000> our<00:01:42.439> plywood<00:01:43.439> color

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
eyedropper tool select our plywood color

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.749 
eyedropper tool select our plywood color
material<00:01:45.500> just<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.740> our<00:01:46.950> plywood<00:01:47.310> color

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
material just like our plywood color

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.410 
material just like our plywood color
material

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
material

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.359 
material
come<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.049> Sketch<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.380> let's<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.130> right

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
come on Sketch up let's get this right

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.420 
come on Sketch up let's get this right
and<00:01:51.590> that's<00:01:52.590> not<00:01:52.799> gonna<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.369> not

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
and that's not gonna it's not

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.940 
and that's not gonna it's not
cooperating<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.420> saw<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:54.570> used<00:01:54.960> in

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
cooperating I just saw I just used in

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.709 
cooperating I just saw I just used in
model<00:01:56.689> there<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.719> got<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.290> plywood<00:01:58.860> sample

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
model there I got the plywood sample

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.899 
model there I got the plywood sample
just<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.810> different<00:02:01.380> way<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.729> going<00:02:02.729> about

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
just a different way of going about

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.609 
just a different way of going about
getting<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.479> color<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.380> how

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
getting that color so you can see how

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.809 
getting that color so you can see how
the<00:02:05.490> stair<00:02:05.820> stringer<00:02:07.099> could<00:02:08.099> be<00:02:08.220> attached<00:02:08.550> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
the stair stringer could be attached to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.369 
the stair stringer could be attached to
the<00:02:08.940> plywood<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> plywood<00:02:09.750> attached<00:02:10.170> to

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
the plywood and the plywood attached to

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.000 
the plywood and the plywood attached to
the<00:02:10.500> face<00:02:10.739> face<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.250> those<00:02:11.370> floor

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
the face face of those floor

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.119 
the face face of those floor
and<00:02:12.780> because<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:13.900> created<00:02:14.349> a<00:02:14.409> component<00:02:14.980> it's

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
and because we created a component it's

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.610 
and because we created a component it's
simple<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:16.980> select<00:02:17.980> our<00:02:18.159> stringer<00:02:18.640> component

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
simple to select our stringer component

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.309 
simple to select our stringer component
the<00:02:20.620> move<00:02:20.830> tool<00:02:21.099> hit<00:02:21.489> ctrl<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.930> then<00:02:23.140> it'll

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
the move tool hit ctrl and then it'll

up with a 7 3/4 rise that we're after

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.870 
up with a 7 3/4 rise that we're after
you<00:03:30.160> can<00:03:30.310> also<00:03:30.489> calculate<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.900> hypotenuse

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
you can also calculate the hypotenuse

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.500 
you can also calculate the hypotenuse
dimension<00:03:33.880> of<00:03:34.000> this<00:03:35.190> should<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.510> be

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
dimension of this should that be

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.580 
dimension of this should that be
something<00:03:37.959> that's<00:03:39.690> meaningful<00:03:40.690> another

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
something that's meaningful another

something that's meaningful another
thing<00:03:41.829> we<00:03:41.980> can<00:03:42.130> do

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
thing we can do

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.539 
thing we can do
is<00:03:44.099> determined<00:03:45.810> how<00:03:46.810> long<00:03:47.139> of<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.739> 2<00:03:47.919> by<00:03:47.950> 12<00:03:48.130> we

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
is determined how long of a 2 by 12 we

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.159 
is determined how long of a 2 by 12 we
would<00:03:48.700> need<00:03:48.849> to<00:03:49.000> cut<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.329> stairway<00:03:49.750> out<00:03:49.900> so<00:03:50.109> I

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
would need to cut the stairway out so I

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.680 
would need to cut the stairway out so I
click<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.470> long<00:03:50.769> point<00:03:51.040> at<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.220> top<00:03:51.690> click

click the long point at the top click

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.830 
click the long point at the top click
this<00:03:52.900> point<00:03:53.530> at<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.709> bottom<00:03:54.629> get<00:03:55.629> this

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
this point at the bottom get this

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.400 
this point at the bottom get this
dimension<00:03:56.379> to<00:03:56.500> behave

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.090 

which<00:03:59.560> it's<00:04:00.780> being<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.870> little<00:04:02.170> erratic<00:04:02.920> here

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
which it's being a little erratic here

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.700 
which it's being a little erratic here
on<00:04:03.280> me<00:04:03.460> so<00:04:03.670> I'm<00:04:03.760> just<00:04:03.910> going<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.150> back<00:04:04.390> up<00:04:04.710> try

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
on me so I'm just going to back up try

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.540 
on me so I'm just going to back up try
that<00:04:05.920> again

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.590 

sometimes<00:04:09.550> Sketchup<00:04:10.150> gets<00:04:10.360> a<00:04:10.450> little

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
sometimes Sketchup gets a little

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.850 
sometimes Sketchup gets a little
temperamental<00:04:11.260> on<00:04:12.330> not<00:04:13.590> deciphering<00:04:14.590> what<00:04:14.740> it

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
temperamental on not deciphering what it

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.270 
temperamental on not deciphering what it
is<00:04:14.980> you're<00:04:15.160> trying<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.520> get<00:04:15.730> at<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:15.970> duel<00:04:20.280> it's

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
is you're trying to get at the duel it's

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.920 
is you're trying to get at the duel it's
just<00:04:21.489> kind<00:04:21.730> of<00:04:21.760> fight<00:04:22.060> me<00:04:22.240> every<00:04:22.270> step<00:04:22.480> of<00:04:22.840> the

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
just kind of fight me every step of the

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.810 
just kind of fight me every step of the
way<00:04:22.960> here<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:23.560> can<00:04:23.710> see<00:04:23.920> how<00:04:24.100> it's<00:04:24.310> wanting<00:04:24.670> to

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
way here you can see how it's wanting to

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.760 
way here you can see how it's wanting to
measure<00:04:25.000> diagonally<00:04:25.360> there<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:25.960> finally<00:04:26.530> got

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
measure diagonally there I finally got

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.310 
measure diagonally there I finally got
it<00:04:26.980> all<00:04:27.700> right<00:04:27.910> we<00:04:28.120> can<00:04:28.240> see<00:04:28.360> that<00:04:28.480> take<00:04:28.720> 15

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
it all right we can see that take 15

to be the total length of that stair

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.930 
to be the total length of that stair
stringer<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:35.710> remember<00:04:36.160> that<00:04:36.340> line<00:04:36.580> is<00:04:36.820> not

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
stringer and remember that line is not

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.550 
stringer and remember that line is not
parallel<00:04:37.480> to<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.750> edge<00:04:37.870> but<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:38.230> could<00:04:38.380> get

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
parallel to the edge but you could get

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.790 
parallel to the edge but you could get
that<00:04:38.740> stringer<00:04:39.370> out<00:04:39.520> of<00:04:39.640> a<00:04:39.700> 16-footer<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:41.590> I

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
that stringer out of a 16-footer and I

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.380 
that stringer out of a 16-footer and I
guess<00:04:41.980> the<00:04:42.130> last<00:04:42.160> thing<00:04:42.520> I'll<00:04:42.610> show<00:04:42.640> on<00:04:43.000> this

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
guess the last thing I'll show on this

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.070 
guess the last thing I'll show on this
is<00:04:44.670> that<00:04:45.670> you<00:04:45.790> can<00:04:45.970> calculate<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.570> angle<00:04:46.960> of

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
is that you can calculate the angle of

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.370 
is that you can calculate the angle of
the<00:04:47.170> stairs<00:04:47.500> by<00:04:48.300> using<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.570> protractor<00:04:50.170> tool

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
the stairs by using the protractor tool

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
this stair jack you can see I'm going

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.020 
this stair jack you can see I'm going
off<00:04:57.280> in<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.580> red<00:04:57.900> event<00:04:58.900> red<00:04:59.590> axis<00:05:00.550> here<00:05:00.820> and

off in the red event red axis here and

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.420 
off in the red event red axis here and
when<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:01.900> pivot<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.440> line<00:05:02.650> up<00:05:02.950> I'm<00:05:03.190> going<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.340> go

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
when I pivot the line up I'm going to go

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.740 
when I pivot the line up I'm going to go
all<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:03.640> way<00:05:03.760> up<00:05:03.940> to<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.210> top<00:05:04.450> of<00:05:04.660> the

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
all the way up to the top of the

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.590 
all the way up to the top of the
stringer<00:05:06.840> and<00:05:07.840> click<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.590> point<00:05:09.300> along<00:05:10.300> that

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
stringer and click the point along that

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.210 
stringer and click the point along that
same<00:05:10.870> edge<00:05:11.020> in<00:05:11.200> the<00:05:11.290> bottom<00:05:11.620> of<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.800> stringer

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
same edge in the bottom of the stringer

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:25.500 
same edge in the bottom of the stringer
and<00:05:15.360> that<00:05:16.360> tells<00:05:16.720> us<00:05:16.930> that<00:05:16.960> our<00:05:17.200> stairway<00:05:19.590> is

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:31.680 

I<00:05:26.040> think<00:05:27.040> it's<00:05:27.190> up<00:05:27.370> 37.8<00:05:28.360> degrees<00:05:28.390> I<00:05:30.690> wasn't

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
I think it's up 37.8 degrees I wasn't

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.960 
I think it's up 37.8 degrees I wasn't
watching<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:32.200> value<00:05:32.980> control<00:05:33.400> box<00:05:33.610> when<00:05:33.880> I

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
watching the value control box when I

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.530 
watching the value control box when I
click<00:05:34.210> that<00:05:34.360> top<00:05:34.630> point<00:05:34.980> we'll<00:05:35.980> do<00:05:36.100> it<00:05:36.220> again

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
click that top point we'll do it again

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.000 
click that top point we'll do it again
and<00:05:38.490> by<00:05:39.490> clicking<00:05:39.760> up<00:05:40.090> here<00:05:40.150> yes<00:05:40.480> it's<00:05:41.010> 37.8

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
and by clicking up here yes it's 37.8

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.370 
and by clicking up here yes it's 37.8
degrees<00:05:42.040> is<00:05:42.940> the<00:05:43.600> angle<00:05:43.960> of<00:05:44.050> our<00:05:44.200> stairway<00:05:46.380> so

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
degrees is the angle of our stairway so

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.680 
degrees is the angle of our stairway so
that's<00:05:47.680> how<00:05:47.860> to<00:05:47.890> use<00:05:48.150> Sketchup<00:05:49.150> to<00:05:49.180> do<00:05:49.570> the

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
that's how to use Sketchup to do the

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.340 
that's how to use Sketchup to do the
layout<00:05:49.990> for<00:05:50.290> stairs<00:05:51.130> I<00:05:51.870> think<00:05:52.870> I'll<00:05:53.050> do

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
layout for stairs I think I'll do

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.210 
layout for stairs I think I'll do
