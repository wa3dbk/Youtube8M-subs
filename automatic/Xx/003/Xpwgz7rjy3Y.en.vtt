00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
they gave me the option to turn it off

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.210 
they gave me the option to turn it off
so<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.299> hope<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:46.569> you<00:03:47.290> know<00:03:47.410> these<00:03:47.680> developers

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
so I hope that you know these developers

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.069 
so I hope that you know these developers
who<00:03:48.400> are<00:03:48.430> developing<00:03:49.000> these<00:03:49.150> games<00:03:49.420> I<00:03:49.690> hope

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
who are developing these games I hope

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.420 
who are developing these games I hope
they<00:03:50.230> still<00:03:50.470> at<00:03:50.620> least<00:03:50.739> give<00:03:51.010> us<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.280> option

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
they still at least give us the option

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.129 
they still at least give us the option
to<00:03:51.639> turn<00:03:51.850> it<00:03:51.970> off<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.480> other<00:03:52.630> thing<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:52.930> I'm

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
to turn it off the other thing that I'm

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.449 
to turn it off the other thing that I'm
worried<00:03:53.440> about<00:03:53.500> is<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:56.920> know<00:03:56.980> if<00:03:57.280> you're

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
worried about is you know if you're

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.789 
worried about is you know if you're
going<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.880> be<00:03:58.090> constantly<00:03:58.660> giving<00:03:59.109> us<00:03:59.290> new

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
going to be constantly giving us new

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.250 
going to be constantly giving us new
things<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.400> this<00:04:00.519> is<00:04:00.670> a<00:04:00.700> new<00:04:01.030> model<00:04:01.480> I<00:04:01.630> hope

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
things and this is a new model I hope

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.110 
things and this is a new model I hope
that<00:04:02.470> it<00:04:02.650> doesn't<00:04:02.980> turn<00:04:03.100> into<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.430> subscription

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
that it doesn't turn into a subscription

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.270 
that it doesn't turn into a subscription
model<00:04:04.389> because<00:04:04.900> if<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.139> does<00:04:05.350> then<00:04:06.040> you

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
model because if it does then you

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.360 
model because if it does then you
basically<00:04:06.519> got<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.180> model<00:04:07.810> that<00:04:08.049> is<00:04:08.380> sinking

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
basically got the model that is sinking

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.930 
basically got the model that is sinking
right<00:04:09.579> now<00:04:09.819> which<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.810> MMO<00:04:11.609> people<00:04:12.609> people

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
right now which is the MMO people people

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.610 
right now which is the MMO people people
stopped<00:04:13.359> wanting<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:13.989> pay<00:04:14.200> for<00:04:14.590> a

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
stopped wanting to pay for a

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.560 
stopped wanting to pay for a
subscription<00:04:14.859> that's<00:04:15.760> why<00:04:15.940> everything<00:04:16.450> is

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
subscription that's why everything is

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.810 
subscription that's why everything is
now<00:04:16.690> going<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:17.139> free<00:04:17.350> delay<00:04:17.590> but<00:04:18.220> i'm<00:04:18.489> afraid

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
now going to free delay but i'm afraid

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.849 
now going to free delay but i'm afraid
that<00:04:19.060> now<00:04:19.479> they're<00:04:19.720> going<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.049> try<00:04:20.229> to<00:04:20.260> drift

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
that now they're going to try to drift

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.920 
that now they're going to try to drift
us<00:04:21.010> back<00:04:21.250> into<00:04:21.489> another<00:04:21.880> direction<00:04:22.180> where<00:04:22.810> you

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
us back into another direction where you

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.080 
us back into another direction where you
can<00:04:23.110> constantly<00:04:23.560> be<00:04:23.710> pulling<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.669> feeding

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
can constantly be pulling and feeding

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.520 
can constantly be pulling and feeding
this<00:04:25.240> money<00:04:25.539> off<00:04:25.750> now<00:04:26.229> no

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
putting it out there I'm afraid that

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.790 
putting it out there I'm afraid that
this<00:04:31.060> is<00:04:31.330> direction<00:04:31.960> that<00:04:32.080> this<00:04:32.260> could<00:04:32.530> go

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
this is direction that this could go

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.950 
this is direction that this could go
when<00:04:33.310> we<00:04:33.430> start<00:04:33.760> talking<00:04:33.970> about<00:04:34.270> living

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
it costs money to constantly develop and

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.650 
it costs money to constantly develop and
give<00:04:40.690> these<00:04:41.080> living<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:42.010> breathing
