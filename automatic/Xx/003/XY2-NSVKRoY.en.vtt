welcome to your tutor online video
lessons<00:00:12.230> today<00:00:13.230> I'm<00:00:13.289> gonna<00:00:13.440> show<00:00:13.619> you<00:00:13.650> a

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
lessons today I'm gonna show you a

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.199 
lessons today I'm gonna show you a
method<00:00:13.950> for<00:00:14.309> adding<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.849> subtracting

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:15.209 
method for adding and subtracting

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.010 
method for adding and subtracting
positive<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.049> negative<00:00:16.260> numbers<00:00:18.020> for

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
positive and negative numbers for

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.460 
positive and negative numbers for
example<00:00:19.410> let's<00:00:19.590> look<00:00:19.680> at<00:00:19.890> negative<00:00:20.310> 9<00:00:20.460> plus<00:00:20.700> 3

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
example let's look at negative 9 plus 3

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.679 
example let's look at negative 9 plus 3
one<00:00:22.470> simple<00:00:22.950> way<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.490> tackle<00:00:23.700> this<00:00:23.939> problem<00:00:24.180> is

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
one simple way to tackle this problem is

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.089 
one simple way to tackle this problem is
with<00:00:25.020> the<00:00:25.140> number<00:00:25.410> line<00:00:27.619> we'll<00:00:28.619> go<00:00:28.739> ahead<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
with the number line we'll go ahead and

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.790 
with the number line we'll go ahead and
draw<00:00:29.610> a<00:00:29.640> number<00:00:29.880> line<00:00:30.180> and<00:00:30.419> we'll<00:00:31.349> start<00:00:31.619> with

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
draw a number line and we'll start with

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.750 
draw a number line and we'll start with
our<00:00:32.040> point<00:00:33.350> at<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.649> first<00:00:34.860> number<00:00:35.129> negative<00:00:35.370> 9

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
our point at the first number negative 9

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.529 
our point at the first number negative 9
and<00:00:36.090> then<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.320> just<00:00:37.500> count<00:00:37.950> over<00:00:38.690> 3<00:00:39.800> 1<00:00:40.800> 2<00:00:41.670> 3

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
and then we can just count over 3 1 2 3

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.430 
and then we can just count over 3 1 2 3
so<00:00:43.499> answer<00:00:43.859> is<00:00:43.980> negative<00:00:44.339> 6<00:00:45.170> we're<00:00:46.170> gonna<00:00:46.289> move

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
so answer is negative 6 we're gonna move

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.610 
so answer is negative 6 we're gonna move
to<00:00:46.859> the<00:00:46.890> right<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.999> addition<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
to the right for addition and to the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.759 
to the right for addition and to the
left<00:00:49.859> for<00:00:50.489> subtraction<00:00:54.230> now<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.289> number<00:00:55.620> line

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
left for subtraction now the number line

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.739 
left for subtraction now the number line
method<00:00:56.159> works<00:00:56.309> pretty<00:00:56.609> well<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.879> small

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
method works pretty well with small

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.799 
method works pretty well with small
numbers<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.499> about<00:00:58.649> big<00:00:58.859> numbers<00:00:58.890> say

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
numbers but what about big numbers say

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.770 
numbers but what about big numbers say
32<00:01:00.809> minus<00:01:01.199> 56<00:01:01.760> now<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.819> could<00:01:03.269> draw<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.569> number

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
32 minus 56 now you could draw a number

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.770 
32 minus 56 now you could draw a number
line<00:01:03.929> and<00:01:04.320> move<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> 56<00:01:05.190> times<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.630> will

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
line and move it 56 times but this will

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.780 
line and move it 56 times but this will
take<00:01:06.960> forever

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
take forever

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.300 
take forever
imagining<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.820> even<00:01:09.180> bigger<00:01:09.720> numbers<00:01:10.110> like

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
imagining the even bigger numbers like

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.859 
imagining the even bigger numbers like
132<00:01:11.310> minus<00:01:12.079> 456<00:01:13.549> instead<00:01:14.549> use<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.329> method<00:01:15.659> I'm

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
132 minus 456 instead use the method I'm

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.300 
132 minus 456 instead use the method I'm
about<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.350> teach<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:18.680> there<00:01:19.680> are<00:01:19.829> two<00:01:20.040> simple

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
about to teach you there are two simple

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.420 
about to teach you there are two simple
rules<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.820> remember<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:21.719> this<00:01:21.899> method<00:01:22.430> rule

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
rules to remember for this method rule

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.080 
rules to remember for this method rule
one<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.869> signs<00:01:25.170> are<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.649> same<00:01:25.850> then<00:01:26.850> add

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
one if the signs are the same then add

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.810 
one if the signs are the same then add
the<00:01:27.420> numbers<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.049> keep<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.619> original<00:01:29.219> sign

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.029 

for<00:01:32.820> example<00:01:34.219> negative<00:01:35.219> 42<00:01:35.939> minus<00:01:36.600> 15<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
for example negative 42 minus 15 the

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.219 
for example negative 42 minus 15 the
signs<00:01:38.280> are<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.579> same<00:01:38.609> the<00:01:39.509> first<00:01:39.780> number<00:01:40.170> is

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
signs are the same the first number is

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.550 
signs are the same the first number is
negative<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.039> minus<00:01:42.000> 15<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> negative

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
negative and minus 15 we have a negative

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.609 
negative and minus 15 we have a negative
and<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.250> negative<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.109> put<00:01:46.289> these<00:01:46.469> two

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and a negative so to put these two

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.770 
and a negative so to put these two
together<00:01:46.740> I'll<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.759> 42<00:01:48.770> plus<00:01:49.770> 15<00:01:50.570> don't<00:01:51.570> worry

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
together I'll do 42 plus 15 don't worry

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.090 
together I'll do 42 plus 15 don't worry
it<00:01:51.929> doesn't<00:01:51.960> matter<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.439> they're<00:01:52.649> negatives

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
it doesn't matter that they're negatives

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.620 
it doesn't matter that they're negatives
we're<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.880> going<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> add<00:01:54.329> them<00:01:54.450> together

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
we're just going to add them together

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:08.270 
we're just going to add them together
for<00:01:55.020> now<00:01:58.820> 42<00:01:59.820> plus<00:02:00.810> 15<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.850> equal<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:05.539> 57<00:02:07.220> now<00:02:08.220> we

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
for now 42 plus 15 is equal to 57 now we

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.300 
for now 42 plus 15 is equal to 57 now we
keep<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:09.270> original<00:02:09.899> sign<00:02:10.140> which<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.220> this

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
keep the original sign which in this

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.580 
keep the original sign which in this
case<00:02:11.520> was<00:02:11.670> negative<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.360> our<00:02:13.200> answer<00:02:13.560> is

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
case was negative and our answer is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.250 
case was negative and our answer is
negative<00:02:14.120> 57

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.059 

Rule<00:02:17.920> two<00:02:17.950> if<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:19.420> signs<00:02:19.659> are<00:02:19.989> different<00:02:20.069> then

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
Rule two if the signs are different then

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.420 
Rule two if the signs are different then
subtract<00:02:22.019> big<00:02:23.019> number<00:02:23.349> minus<00:02:23.769> little<00:02:24.099> number

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
subtract big number minus little number

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.920 
subtract big number minus little number
keep<00:02:25.299> the<00:02:25.480> sign<00:02:25.689> of<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.930> big<00:02:26.170> number<00:02:27.870> for<00:02:28.870> an

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
keep the sign of the big number for an

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.809 
keep the sign of the big number for an
example<00:02:29.230> we'll<00:02:30.159> have<00:02:30.340> 12<00:02:30.939> minus<00:02:31.870> 23

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
example we'll have 12 minus 23

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.190 
example we'll have 12 minus 23
we<00:02:33.819> knew<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:33.970> 12<00:02:34.329> is<00:02:34.450> positive<00:02:34.959> because

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
we knew that 12 is positive because

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.110 
we knew that 12 is positive because
there<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.680> not<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.129> sign<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.519> front<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.909> and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
there is not a sign in front of it and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.240 
there is not a sign in front of it and
whenever<00:02:37.720> there<00:02:38.049> isn't<00:02:38.409> a<00:02:38.470> sign<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:38.890> front<00:02:39.129> of

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
whenever there isn't a sign in front of

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.759 
whenever there isn't a sign in front of
a<00:02:39.340> number<00:02:39.640> it's<00:02:40.000> positive<00:02:40.349> without<00:02:41.349> being

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
a number it's positive without being

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.330 
a number it's positive without being
written<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:44.200> we<00:02:44.409> have<00:02:44.530> different<00:02:44.680> signs<00:02:45.099> a

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
written so we have different signs a

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.819 
written so we have different signs a
positive<00:02:46.000> 12<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.629> a<00:02:47.379> negative<00:02:47.890> 23<00:02:49.620> 23<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:50.709> the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
positive 12 and a negative 23 23 is the

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.280 
positive 12 and a negative 23 23 is the
bigger<00:02:51.040> number<00:02:51.329> so<00:02:52.329> we're<00:02:52.450> going<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.629> do<00:02:52.720> 23

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
bigger number so we're going to do 23

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:02.640 
bigger number so we're going to do 23
minus<00:02:54.250> 12<00:02:57.359> which<00:02:58.359> is<00:02:58.569> equal<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:58.959> 11<00:03:01.620> where<00:03:02.620> I

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
minus 12 which is equal to 11 where I

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.890 
minus 12 which is equal to 11 where I
keep<00:03:02.889> the<00:03:03.099> sign<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.670> big<00:03:03.940> number<00:03:04.269> which<00:03:04.750> in

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
keep the sign of the big number which in

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.490 
keep the sign of the big number which in
this<00:03:05.019> case<00:03:05.260> is<00:03:05.680> 23<00:03:06.659> 23<00:03:07.659> is<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.870> big<00:03:07.989> number<00:03:08.139> a

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
this case is 23 23 is the big number a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.250 
this case is 23 23 is the big number a
negative<00:03:09.280> is<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:09.549> front<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.819> the<00:03:09.909> 23<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:11.079> our

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
negative is in front of the 23 so our

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.610 
negative is in front of the 23 so our
final<00:03:11.530> answer<00:03:12.000> will<00:03:13.000> be<00:03:13.030> negative<00:03:13.329> I<00:03:16.560> want<00:03:17.560> to

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
final answer will be negative I want to

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.500 
final answer will be negative I want to
show<00:03:17.769> you<00:03:17.920> one<00:03:18.400> more<00:03:18.549> example<00:03:18.819> for<00:03:18.970> this<00:03:19.269> rule

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
show you one more example for this rule

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.270 
show you one more example for this rule
number<00:03:19.690> 2<00:03:20.459> negative<00:03:21.459> 17<00:03:21.970> plus<00:03:22.000> 92<00:03:22.919> again<00:03:23.919> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
number 2 negative 17 plus 92 again the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.339 
number 2 negative 17 plus 92 again the
signs<00:03:24.519> are<00:03:24.699> different<00:03:24.790> we<00:03:25.299> have<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.720> negative

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
signs are different we have a negative

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.830 
signs are different we have a negative
17<00:03:27.250> a<00:03:27.599> positive<00:03:28.599> 92<00:03:29.910> 92<00:03:30.910> is<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.299> bigger<00:03:31.480> number

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
17 a positive 92 92 is the bigger number

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.780 
17 a positive 92 92 is the bigger number
so<00:03:32.019> we<00:03:32.709> take<00:03:32.889> 92<00:03:33.780> minus<00:03:34.780> 17<00:03:35.349> and<00:03:35.620> we<00:03:36.430> get<00:03:36.609> an

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
so we take 92 minus 17 and we get an

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:44.369 
so we take 92 minus 17 and we get an
answer<00:03:38.069> 75<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:41.410> big<00:03:41.620> number<00:03:41.949> was<00:03:42.639> 92<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:43.599> in

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
answer 75 the big number was 92 and in

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.890 
answer 75 the big number was 92 and in
this<00:03:44.470> case<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:44.949> was<00:03:45.099> positive<00:03:45.639> sir<00:03:46.449> a<00:03:46.480> final

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
this case it was positive sir a final

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.309 
this case it was positive sir a final
answer<00:03:47.290> is<00:03:47.500> positive<00:03:47.829> 75<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:49.120> won't<00:03:49.930> write<00:03:50.169> the

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
answer is positive 75 I won't write the

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.770 
answer is positive 75 I won't write the
positive<00:03:50.500> sign<00:03:50.949> because<00:03:51.760> when<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.569> have<00:03:52.750> a

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
positive sign because when you have a

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.780 
positive sign because when you have a
number<00:03:53.049> just<00:03:53.230> by<00:03:53.379> itself<00:03:53.709> you<00:03:54.400> don't<00:03:54.609> write

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
number just by itself you don't write

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.069 
number just by itself you don't write
the<00:03:54.970> positive<00:03:55.419> in<00:03:55.569> front<00:03:57.750> okay<00:03:58.750> so<00:03:58.810> let's

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
the positive in front okay so let's

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.680 
the positive in front okay so let's
review<00:03:59.440> what<00:03:59.620> we<00:03:59.739> went<00:03:59.919> over<00:04:00.359> first<00:04:01.359> you<00:04:01.569> can

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
review what we went over first you can

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.360 
review what we went over first you can
use<00:04:01.840> a<00:04:01.870> number<00:04:02.199> line<00:04:02.349> to<00:04:02.379> solve<00:04:02.709> problems<00:04:03.159> with

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
use a number line to solve problems with

use a number line to solve problems with
positive<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.090> negative<00:04:04.449> signs<00:04:04.690> move<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.799> the

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
positive and negative signs move to the

right for addition move to the left for

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.189 
right for addition move to the left for
subtraction<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.510> better<00:04:10.510> way<00:04:10.720> though<00:04:10.959> is<00:04:11.109> the

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
subtraction a better way though is the

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.439 
subtraction a better way though is the
method<00:04:11.500> I<00:04:11.590> taught<00:04:11.799> you<00:04:12.040> if<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:13.000> signs<00:04:13.239> are<00:04:13.359> the

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:13.449 
method I taught you if the signs are the

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:16.379 
method I taught you if the signs are the
same<00:04:13.569> then<00:04:14.530> add<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:15.069> numbers<00:04:15.430> keep<00:04:16.150> the

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
same then add the numbers keep the

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.659 
same then add the numbers keep the
original<00:04:16.810> sign<00:04:17.049> if<00:04:17.949> the<00:04:18.159> signs<00:04:18.400> are<00:04:18.519> different

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
original sign if the signs are different

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.509 
original sign if the signs are different
then<00:04:19.209> subtract<00:04:19.720> big<00:04:20.620> number<00:04:20.979> minus<00:04:21.310> little

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
then subtract big number minus little

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.410 
then subtract big number minus little
number<00:04:21.849> keep<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:23.229> sign<00:04:23.500> of<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:24.250> big<00:04:24.400> number

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
number keep the sign of the big number
