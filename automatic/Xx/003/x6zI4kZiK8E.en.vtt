something<00:01:12.630> good<00:01:13.400> in<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.460> way<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.299> of

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479

thought this was really good i give the
this<00:03:21.680> complete<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:23.739> besides<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:25.790> flaw<00:03:26.269> i

would<00:03:28.489> give<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.790> an<00:03:29.299> eight<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:30.140> half<00:03:30.320> on<00:03:31.040> a

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
would give it an eight and a half on a

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.720 
would give it an eight and a half on a
10<00:03:33.880> yeah<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.980> i'm<00:03:36.980> saying<00:03:37.250> that<00:03:37.310> i<00:03:37.430> just

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
10 yeah and i'm saying that i just

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.830 
10 yeah and i'm saying that i just
noticed<00:03:38.120> on<00:03:39.160> tiktik<00:03:40.160> trucks<00:03:40.690> they're<00:03:41.690> like

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
noticed on tiktik trucks they're like

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.319 
noticed on tiktik trucks they're like
round<00:03:42.290> kinda<00:03:43.070> these<00:03:43.970> are<00:03:44.360> more<00:03:44.600> like<00:03:44.890> square

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
round kinda these are more like square

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.110 
round kinda these are more like square
like<00:03:47.329> you<00:03:47.630> go<00:03:47.810> straight<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:48.380> they're<00:03:48.590> flat

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
like you go straight and they're flat

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.920 
like you go straight and they're flat
and<00:03:50.120> then<00:03:50.720> every<00:03:51.560> let's<00:03:52.040> round<00:03:52.750> but<00:03:53.750> I'm

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
and then every let's round but I'm

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.520 
and then every let's round but I'm
tactic<00:03:54.410> is<00:03:54.590> just<00:03:54.890> all<00:03:55.070> round<00:03:56.799> yeah<00:03:57.799> so
