since<00:00:05.759> I'm<00:00:05.910> speaking<00:00:06.269> about<00:00:06.300> the<00:00:06.540> lens<00:00:06.779> this

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
since I'm speaking about the lens this

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.910 
since I'm speaking about the lens this
is<00:00:07.019> a<00:00:07.170> Zeiss<00:00:07.470> 35<00:00:08.660> by<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.690> gun<00:00:09.930> it's<00:00:10.170> an<00:00:10.290> f2<00:00:10.650> lens

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
is a Zeiss 35 by a gun it's an f2 lens

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.470 
is a Zeiss 35 by a gun it's an f2 lens
this<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:12.059> really<00:00:12.389> great<00:00:12.510> lens<00:00:12.869> the<00:00:13.230> Zeiss<00:00:14.480> 25

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
this is a really great lens the Zeiss 25

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.300 
this is a really great lens the Zeiss 25
millimeter<00:00:16.109> F<00:00:17.039> 2.8<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.830> incredible<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:20.010> this

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
millimeter F 2.8 is incredible on this

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.450 
millimeter F 2.8 is incredible on this
camera<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.030> have<00:00:21.150> one<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.420> those<00:00:21.570> too<00:00:22.460> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
camera and I have one of those too the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.400 
camera and I have one of those too the
25<00:00:24.150> shoots<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> 35<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.800> an<00:00:25.920> m8<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:27.570> 35<00:00:27.990> kind

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
25 shoots like a 35 on an m8 the 35 kind

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.170 
25 shoots like a 35 on an m8 the 35 kind
of<00:00:28.530> shoots<00:00:28.740> like<00:00:28.950> a<00:00:28.980> 50<00:00:29.430> is<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> short<00:00:30.060> 50

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
of shoots like a 50 is like a short 50

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.910 
of shoots like a 50 is like a short 50
that's<00:00:33.180> because<00:00:33.539> of<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.719> crop<00:00:33.930> factor<00:00:34.170> that's

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
that's because of the crop factor that's

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.739 
that's because of the crop factor that's
I<00:00:35.280> guess<00:00:35.489> I'm<00:00:35.760> getting<00:00:35.879> back<00:00:36.149> into<00:00:36.329> negatives

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:36.749 
I guess I'm getting back into negatives

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:41.299 
I guess I'm getting back into negatives
again<00:00:37.280> an<00:00:38.280> m8<00:00:38.579> has<00:00:38.789> a<00:00:38.819> 1.3<00:00:39.510> III<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.289> think<00:00:40.499> crop

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
again an m8 has a 1.3 III I think crop

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.790 
again an m8 has a 1.3 III I think crop
factor<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.059> any<00:00:42.359> lens<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.780> put<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.109> you're

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
factor so any lens you put on you're

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.139 
factor so any lens you put on you're
going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.979> have<00:00:44.069> to<00:00:44.159> multiply<00:00:44.309> its<00:00:44.729> focal

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
going to have to multiply its focal

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.299 
going to have to multiply its focal
length<00:00:45.359> times<00:00:45.929> 1<00:00:46.199> point<00:00:46.440> 3<00:00:46.499> 3<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.039> get<00:00:47.159> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
length times 1 point 3 3 to get the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.450 
length times 1 point 3 3 to get the
actual<00:00:47.760> effective<00:00:48.269> focal<00:00:48.479> length<00:00:49.249> that's<00:00:50.249> not

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
actual effective focal length that's not

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.329 
actual effective focal length that's not
that<00:00:50.639> big<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.089> deal<00:00:51.589> most<00:00:52.589> people<00:00:52.859> don't<00:00:52.979> care

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
that big a deal most people don't care

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:54.799 
that big a deal most people don't care
about<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.639> all<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.940> much<00:00:54.089> most<00:00:54.389> people<00:00:54.479> don't

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
about it all that much most people don't

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.789 
about it all that much most people don't
shoot<00:00:55.170> full-frame<00:00:55.710> 35<00:00:56.370> millimeter<00:00:57.799> sensors

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:58.799 
shoot full-frame 35 millimeter sensors

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:02.449 
shoot full-frame 35 millimeter sensors
so<00:00:59.760> they're<00:01:00.120> used<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.479> that<00:01:00.600> idea<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:02.459 
so they're used to that idea but the

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:04.100 
so they're used to that idea but the
problem<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:02.909> me<00:01:03.209> is<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.569> you<00:01:03.659> like<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.929> shoot

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
problem for me is if you like to shoot

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.950 
problem for me is if you like to shoot
wide<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:04.890> occasionally<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.780> also

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
wide and I do occasionally and I also

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.660 
wide and I do occasionally and I also
like<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.440> shoot<00:01:07.619> fast<00:01:07.979> lens<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.490> you're<00:01:08.579> at

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
like to shoot fast lens and you're at

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.359 
like to shoot fast lens and you're at
least<00:01:08.759> relatively<00:01:09.390> fast<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:10.500> means<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.920> if

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
least relatively fast that means you if

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.459 
least relatively fast that means you if
you<00:01:11.579> want<00:01:11.759> to<00:01:11.880> shoot<00:01:12.090> wide<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.200> want<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
you want to shoot wide and you want to

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.469 
you want to shoot wide and you want to
have<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> lens<00:01:13.920> that's<00:01:14.159> fast<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.820> increases

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
have the lens that's fast that increases

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.859 
have the lens that's fast that increases
your<00:01:15.860> investment<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.039> the<00:01:17.130> lens<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.670> mean

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
your investment in the lens I mean

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.899 
your investment in the lens I mean
pretty<00:01:18.869> much<00:01:19.049> only<00:01:19.259> Leica<00:01:19.829> is<00:01:20.130> making<00:01:20.549> very

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
pretty much only Leica is making very

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.630 
pretty much only Leica is making very
fast<00:01:21.329> short<00:01:21.719> lenses<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.500> they're<00:01:22.979> very<00:01:23.219> fast

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
fast short lenses and they're very fast

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.240 
fast short lenses and they're very fast
very<00:01:23.969> short<00:01:24.420> lenses<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:25.020> very<00:01:25.740> very

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
very short lenses are very very

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.859 
very short lenses are very very
expensive<00:01:26.640> we're<00:01:27.000> talking<00:01:27.329> thousands<00:01:27.719> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
expensive we're talking thousands and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.740 
expensive we're talking thousands and
thousands<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.289> dollars<00:01:28.649> so<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.359> kind<00:01:30.630> of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
thousands of dollars so that is kind of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.440 
thousands of dollars so that is kind of
a<00:01:30.979> bummer<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.280> guess<00:01:32.609> it's<00:01:32.850> about<00:01:32.969> the<00:01:33.210> only<00:01:33.329> we

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
a bummer I guess it's about the only we

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.880 
a bummer I guess it's about the only we
can<00:01:33.600> put<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.899> when<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.109> terms<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.560> when<00:01:34.799> it

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
can put it when it terms to when it

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.359 
can put it when it terms to when it
comes<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.250> expenses<00:01:36.289> related<00:01:37.289> to<00:01:37.320> having<00:01:38.189> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
comes to expenses related to having a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.120 
comes to expenses related to having a
crop<00:01:38.609> camera<00:01:39.500> but<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.859> shoot

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
crop camera but if you like to shoot

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.389 
crop camera but if you like to shoot
long<00:01:41.399> this<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.299> better<00:01:42.659> you're<00:01:43.259> 90<00:01:43.590> becomes<00:01:44.039> I

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
long this is better you're 90 becomes I

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.889 
long this is better you're 90 becomes I
don't<00:01:44.909> know<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.179> don't<00:01:45.359> feel<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.600> doing<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
don't know I don't feel like doing the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.109 
don't know I don't feel like doing the
math<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.189> 120<00:01:47.759> something

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
math but you know it's 120 something

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.230 
math but you know it's 120 something
like<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:50.789> you<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:50.999> to<00:01:51.090> shoot

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
like that so if you like to shoot

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.749 
like that so if you like to shoot
telephoto<00:01:51.749> or<00:01:52.200> long<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.579> actually

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
telephoto or long then it's actually

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.230 
telephoto or long then it's actually
good<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.299> crop<00:01:54.479> camera<00:01:54.899> still<00:01:56.240> I'd

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
good to have a crop camera still I'd

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.660 
good to have a crop camera still I'd
rather<00:01:57.509> not<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.020> can't<00:01:58.439> afford<00:01:58.530> midnight<00:01:59.100> so

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
rather not I can't afford midnight so

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.480 
rather not I can't afford midnight so
that's<00:01:59.999> why<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> bought<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.509> m2<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:02.429> a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
that's why I bought the m2 it is a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.179 
that's why I bought the m2 it is a
full-frame<00:02:03.090> camera<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.740> digital

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
full-frame camera it's just not digital

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.069 
full-frame camera it's just not digital
so<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.850> shoots<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.749> way<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.899> would

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
so it shoots just the way you would

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.130 
so it shoots just the way you would
expect<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.399> have<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.759> side<00:02:09.690> effects<00:02:10.020> of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
expect you just have the side effects of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.790 
expect you just have the side effects of
shooting<00:02:10.410> film

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
shooting film

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.670 
shooting film
okay<00:02:12.610> I'll<00:02:13.390> say<00:02:13.630> I'll<00:02:13.780> pull<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.050> lens<00:02:14.260> off<00:02:14.530> of

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
okay I'll say I'll pull the lens off of

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.200 
okay I'll say I'll pull the lens off of
here<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.400> can<00:02:15.460> get<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.700> view<00:02:15.970> the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
here and so you can get a view the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.260 
here and so you can get a view the
inside<00:02:16.570> of<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.870> EM<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:18.370> can<00:02:18.520> see<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:19.030> white

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
inside of the EM you can see that white

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.630 
inside of the EM you can see that white
stripe<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.620> metering<00:02:20.950> reflecting

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
stripe is the the metering reflecting

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.610 
stripe is the the metering reflecting
the<00:02:22.300> reflecting<00:02:22.840> area<00:02:23.110> for<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.440> metering

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the reflecting area for the metering

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.280 
the reflecting area for the metering
just<00:02:26.620> like<00:02:26.770> all<00:02:26.980> M's<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:27.550> bayonet<00:02:28.000> mount<00:02:28.290> and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
just like all M's it's bayonet mount and

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.070 
just like all M's it's bayonet mount and
it'll<00:02:29.980> take<00:02:30.160> any<00:02:30.370> lens<00:02:30.940> ever<00:02:31.360> made<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.840> fit<00:02:32.050> a

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
it'll take any lens ever made to fit a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.270 
it'll take any lens ever made to fit a
screw<00:02:32.500> mount<00:02:33.100> like<00:02:33.370> a--<00:02:33.400> or<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:34.120> bayonet<00:02:34.450> mount

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
screw mount like a-- or a bayonet mount

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.550 
screw mount like a-- or a bayonet mount
like<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.310> lens<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.690> that's<00:02:37.930> nice

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
like a lens so that's nice

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.710 
like a lens so that's nice
I've<00:02:39.010> shot<00:02:39.310> lenses<00:02:39.790> on<00:02:39.910> this<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.330> were<00:02:40.420> 50

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
I've shot lenses on this that were 50

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.930 
I've shot lenses on this that were 50
years<00:02:40.870> old<00:02:41.140> that's<00:02:42.070> a<00:02:42.190> pretty<00:02:42.370> cool<00:02:42.580> thing<00:02:42.820> if

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
years old that's a pretty cool thing if

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.600 
years old that's a pretty cool thing if
you<00:02:43.030> think<00:02:43.060> about<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.860> having<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.580> know

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
you think about it having a you know

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.060 
you think about it having a you know
relatively<00:02:46.210> new<00:02:46.480> high-tech<00:02:47.440> camera<00:02:47.890> that

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
relatively new high-tech camera that

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.030 
relatively new high-tech camera that
shoots<00:02:48.310> lenses<00:02:48.820> at<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.120> old<00:02:49.740> shutter<00:02:50.740> speeds

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
shoots lenses at that old shutter speeds

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.350 
shoots lenses at that old shutter speeds
on<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.370> m8<00:02:52.170> go<00:02:53.170> from<00:02:53.470> 8,000<00:02:54.400> on<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.700> fast<00:02:55.120> side

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
on the m8 go from 8,000 on the fast side

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.900 
on the m8 go from 8,000 on the fast side
to<00:02:55.750> four<00:02:56.590> seconds<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.340> bulb<00:02:58.240> of<00:02:58.480> course<00:02:59.910> so

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
to four seconds and bulb of course so

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.490 
to four seconds and bulb of course so
you<00:03:00.970> get<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.420> lot<00:03:01.540> more<00:03:01.570> flexibility<00:03:02.320> with<00:03:02.440> a

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
you get a lot more flexibility with a

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.200 
you get a lot more flexibility with a
new<00:03:02.680> camera<00:03:02.950> like<00:03:03.190> this<00:03:03.430> in<00:03:03.640> terms<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:03.970> shutter

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
new camera like this in terms of shutter

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.570 
new camera like this in terms of shutter
speeds<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:05.470> other<00:03:05.590> thing<00:03:05.890> is<00:03:06.100> you<00:03:06.280> actually

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
speeds the other thing is you actually

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.630 
speeds the other thing is you actually
get<00:03:07.030> auto<00:03:07.240> exposure<00:03:07.770> aperture<00:03:08.770> priority<00:03:09.010> so

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
get auto exposure aperture priority so

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.120 
get auto exposure aperture priority so
if<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.850> set<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.300> dial<00:03:10.750> on<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:11.230> like<00:03:11.740> on<00:03:11.890> most

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
if you set the dial on a like on most

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.040 
if you set the dial on a like on most
cameras<00:03:12.520> and<00:03:13.030> you're<00:03:13.420> free<00:03:13.600> to<00:03:13.660> change<00:03:13.930> the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
cameras and you're free to change the

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.410 
cameras and you're free to change the
aperture<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.130> m8<00:03:15.550> will<00:03:15.760> figure<00:03:16.000> out<00:03:16.209> what

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
aperture and the m8 will figure out what

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.470 
aperture and the m8 will figure out what
to<00:03:16.570> do<00:03:16.660> about<00:03:16.690> that<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.760> other<00:03:18.940> thing<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.240> it

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
to do about that the other thing that it

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.160 
to do about that the other thing that it
has<00:03:19.510> it's<00:03:19.870> kind<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.170> cool<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.770> auto<00:03:22.170> ISO

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
has it's kind of cool is auto ISO

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.900 
has it's kind of cool is auto ISO
adjustment<00:03:24.540> that's<00:03:25.540> cool<00:03:25.870> because<00:03:26.670> if<00:03:27.670> you've

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
adjustment that's cool because if you've

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.220 
adjustment that's cool because if you've
reached<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.450> boundaries<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:29.170> the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
reached the boundaries of the

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.800 
reached the boundaries of the
capabilities<00:03:29.860> of<00:03:30.040> your<00:03:30.070> cameras<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.720> know

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
capabilities of your cameras you know

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.050 
capabilities of your cameras you know
the<00:03:31.959> lens<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.290> have<00:03:32.320> mounted<00:03:32.860> or<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.880> shutter

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
the lens you have mounted or the shutter

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.480 
the lens you have mounted or the shutter
speed<00:03:34.270> that<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:34.570> can<00:03:34.630> get<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.800> m8<00:03:36.130> will

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
speed that you can get to the m8 will

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.880 
speed that you can get to the m8 will
actually<00:03:36.910> adjust<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.420> ISO<00:03:37.600> in<00:03:38.500> order<00:03:38.770> to

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
actually adjust the ISO in order to

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.190 
actually adjust the ISO in order to
extend<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.430> boundary<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:40.180> trade-off<00:03:40.780> is<00:03:40.810> of

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
extend that boundary the trade-off is of

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.960 
extend that boundary the trade-off is of
course<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:41.650> didn't<00:03:41.860> get<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.130> choose<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.520> ISO

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
course you didn't get to choose the ISO

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.480 
course you didn't get to choose the ISO
and<00:03:43.240> if<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.290> camera<00:03:44.590> happens<00:03:44.920> to<00:03:45.040> pick<00:03:45.190> a<00:03:45.220> very

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
and if the camera happens to pick a very

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.490 
and if the camera happens to pick a very
high<00:03:45.700> ISO<00:03:46.300> well<00:03:46.900> then<00:03:47.080> you're<00:03:47.200> going<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.350> get

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
high ISO well then you're going to get

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.030 
high ISO well then you're going to get
some<00:03:47.709> noise<00:03:48.720> but<00:03:49.720> that's<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.350> trade-off<00:03:50.620> you

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
some noise but that's the trade-off you

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.209 
some noise but that's the trade-off you
did<00:03:51.280> get<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.580> shot<00:03:51.820> at<00:03:52.030> least
