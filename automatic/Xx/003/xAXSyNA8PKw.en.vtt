00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.150 
specific because it's a slow twitch
fibers<00:00:57.449> which<00:00:57.809> means<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.350> slow<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.859> fatigue

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
fibers which means it's slow to fatigue

fibers which means it's slow to fatigue
it<00:00:59.399> doesn't<00:00:59.670> get<00:00:59.730> tired<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.180> much<00:01:00.390> which<00:01:01.199> is

minute<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.390> leg<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.340> 160

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340

so<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.630> get<00:02:00.750> about<00:02:00.870> 30<00:02:01.080> seconds<00:02:02.000> okay<00:02:03.000> so

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
so you get about 30 seconds okay so

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.600 
so you get about 30 seconds okay so

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
once again on the second side you really

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.490 
once again on the second side you really
can<00:03:09.970> feel<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.390> near<00:03:10.629> the<00:03:10.780> bottom<00:03:11.019> by<00:03:11.470> your

can feel it near the bottom by your

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.039 
can feel it near the bottom by your
Achilles<00:03:12.069> tendon<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:13.180> shouldn't<00:03:13.480> feel<00:03:13.510> in<00:03:13.870> on

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
Achilles tendon you shouldn't feel in on

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.809 
Achilles tendon you shouldn't feel in on
the<00:03:14.140> top<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.440> behind<00:03:15.370> your<00:03:15.459> knee<00:03:15.579> because

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
the top of behind your knee because

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.940 
the top of behind your knee because
you're<00:03:16.060> not<00:03:16.150> working<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:16.569> muscle<00:03:16.950> lat

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
you're not working that muscle lat

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.339 
you're not working that muscle lat
muscle<00:03:18.430> when<00:03:19.269> you<00:03:19.359> go<00:03:19.510> up<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:19.840> down<00:03:19.989> you'll

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
muscle when you go up and down you'll

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.289 
muscle when you go up and down you'll
feel<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.829> that's<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.250> gastrocnemius<00:03:21.700> that's

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
feel it that's the gastrocnemius that's

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.270 
feel it that's the gastrocnemius that's
this<00:03:22.510> large<00:03:23.260> as<00:03:23.440> muscle<00:03:23.799> this<00:03:23.980> one's<00:03:24.220> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
this large as muscle this one's the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.400 
this large as muscle this one's the
second-largest<00:03:24.849> and<00:03:25.299> they<00:03:25.389> both<00:03:25.540> pretty<00:03:26.200> much

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
second-largest and they both pretty much

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.690 
second-largest and they both pretty much
do<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.620> same<00:03:26.859> thing<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:29.400> rest<00:03:30.400> for<00:03:30.459> five

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
do the same thing and rest for five

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.990 
do the same thing and rest for five
seconds<00:03:31.150> again<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:33.989> ready<00:03:34.989> okay<00:03:35.530> last<00:03:35.980> set<00:03:36.280> 30

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
seconds again and ready okay last set 30

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.990 
seconds again and ready okay last set 30
seconds<00:03:37.569> almost<00:03:38.470> there<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:39.400> if<00:03:39.639> you're<00:03:39.760> pretty

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
seconds almost there so if you're pretty

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.430 
seconds almost there so if you're pretty
comfortable<00:03:40.389> with<00:03:40.450> these<00:03:40.660> then<00:03:41.109> try<00:03:41.410> to

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
comfortable with these then try to

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.110 
comfortable with these then try to
increase<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.889> time<00:03:42.099> to<00:03:42.340> about<00:03:42.579> you<00:03:42.669> know<00:03:42.760> 40

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
increase the time to about you know 40

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.509 
increase the time to about you know 40
seconds<00:03:43.569> 45<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.709> get<00:03:44.829> to<00:03:44.980> about<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.220> minute

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
seconds 45 so you get to about a minute

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.000 
seconds 45 so you get to about a minute
you're<00:03:46.120> can<00:03:46.569> actually<00:03:47.079> become<00:03:47.230> much<00:03:47.620> stronger

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
you're can actually become much stronger

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.870 
you're can actually become much stronger
in<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:49.450> portion<00:03:50.200> of<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.470> video<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:50.980> can<00:03:51.609> see

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
in this portion of the video you can see

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.030 
in this portion of the video you can see
that<00:03:52.090> i<00:03:52.120> had<00:03:52.450> her<00:03:52.569> shift<00:03:53.049> to<00:03:53.260> or<00:03:53.440> left<00:03:53.739> more

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
that i had her shift to or left more

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.430 
that i had her shift to or left more
that's<00:03:54.519> because<00:03:54.730> her<00:03:55.419> right<00:03:55.900> side<00:03:56.109> some<00:03:56.319> more

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
that's because her right side some more

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.309 
that's because her right side some more
develops<00:03:56.829> or<00:03:57.010> less<00:03:57.250> than<00:03:57.459> used<00:03:57.609> to<00:03:57.700> catch<00:03:57.880> up

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
develops or less than used to catch up

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.720 
develops or less than used to catch up
and<00:03:59.319> she's<00:03:59.590> actually<00:03:59.769> doing<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.340> really<00:04:00.579> good

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
and she's actually doing a really good

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.000 
and she's actually doing a really good
job<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.329> that's<00:04:01.660> it<00:04:01.959> glad<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:02.829> guys<00:04:02.950> enjoyed
