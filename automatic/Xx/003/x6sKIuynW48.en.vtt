you<00:00:16.859> just<00:00:17.039> open<00:00:17.400> up<00:00:17.550> these<00:00:18.300> tubes<00:00:18.720> I'm<00:00:19.500> using

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
you just open up these tubes I'm using

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.070 
you just open up these tubes I'm using
frozen<00:00:20.010> squid<00:00:20.490> which<00:00:20.640> I've<00:00:20.760> defrosted<00:00:21.330> which

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
frozen squid which I've defrosted which

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.990 
frozen squid which I've defrosted which
means<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.560> very<00:00:23.550> little<00:00:23.760> preparation

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
means that it's very little preparation

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.430 
means that it's very little preparation

using<00:00:28.080> very<00:00:28.260> sharp<00:00:28.500> knife<00:00:28.710> we're<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.070> going

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
using very sharp knife we're just going

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.730 
using very sharp knife we're just going
to<00:00:29.250> cut<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:30.140> millimeter<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.260> two<00:00:31.529> millimeters

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
to cut a millimeter to two millimeters

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.550 
to cut a millimeter to two millimeters
into<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> squid<00:00:32.960> keep<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.140> knife<00:00:34.290> at<00:00:34.470> an

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
into the squid keep the knife at an

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.120 
into the squid keep the knife at an
angle<00:00:36.260> and<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.500> what<00:00:37.649> we're<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.010> is

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
angle and then what we're going to do is

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.420 
angle and then what we're going to do is
turn<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.850> squid<00:00:39.090> around<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.280> other

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
turn the squid around and go the other

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.830 
turn the squid around and go the other
direction<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.270> end<00:00:42.360> up<00:00:42.450> with<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.630> lovely

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
direction so you end up with this lovely

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.500 
direction so you end up with this lovely
crisscross<00:00:43.350> pattern<00:00:44.149> now<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.210> reason<00:00:45.450> I'm

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
crisscross pattern now the reason I'm

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.060 
crisscross pattern now the reason I'm
doing<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:45.989> twofold<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.860> looks

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
doing this it's twofold one it looks

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.120 
doing this it's twofold one it looks
very<00:00:47.430> pretty<00:00:47.870> but<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.230> also<00:00:49.380> has<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> functional

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
very pretty but it also has a functional

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.319 
very pretty but it also has a functional
purpose<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.579> means<00:00:50.790> that<00:00:50.880> you<00:00:51.030> increase

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
purpose and that means that you increase

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.790 
purpose and that means that you increase
the<00:00:51.630> surface<00:00:51.840> area<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> squid<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.710> you've

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
the surface area of the squid so you've

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.200 
the surface area of the squid so you've
got<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> bigger<00:00:53.160> area<00:00:53.430> for<00:00:53.640> those<00:00:53.730> flavors<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
got a bigger area for those flavors to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.709 
got a bigger area for those flavors to
cling<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.250> carry<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.700> that<00:00:56.879> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
cling to so just carry on on that and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.790 
cling to so just carry on on that and
then<00:00:57.930> what<00:00:58.079> we're<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.320> do<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.559> cut<00:00:58.770> that

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
then what we're going to do is cut that

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.789 
then what we're going to do is cut that
into<00:00:59.070> and<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.750> eight<00:01:00.930> pieces<00:01:01.760> well<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.910> way

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
into and of eight pieces well that way

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.840 
into and of eight pieces well that way
straight<00:01:04.799> down

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.670 

and<00:01:08.390> this<00:01:08.600> one<00:01:08.780> we're<00:01:08.930> just<00:01:08.960> gonna<00:01:09.140> slice<00:01:09.470> into

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
and this one we're just gonna slice into

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.530 
and this one we're just gonna slice into
rings<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:10.550> about<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:10.760> centimeter<00:01:11.360> two

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
rings so about a centimeter two

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:20.800 
rings so about a centimeter two
centimeter<00:01:11.570> thick<00:01:13.420> very<00:01:14.420> simple<00:01:19.600> I'm<00:01:20.600> gonna

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
centimeter thick very simple I'm gonna

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.899 
centimeter thick very simple I'm gonna
roll<00:01:21.080> all<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:21.440> this<00:01:21.530> squid<00:01:21.830> in<00:01:22.070> some<00:01:22.490> seasoned

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
roll all of this squid in some seasoned

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.060 
roll all of this squid in some seasoned
corn<00:01:23.119> flour<00:01:23.390> now<00:01:24.229> I'm<00:01:24.290> using<00:01:24.470> corn<00:01:24.800> flour

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
corn flour now I'm using corn flour

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.620 
corn flour now I'm using corn flour
because<00:01:25.369> you<00:01:25.430> get<00:01:25.550> a<00:01:25.580> much<00:01:25.790> crispier<00:01:26.240> finish

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
because you get a much crispier finish

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.030 
because you get a much crispier finish
so<00:01:27.110> what<00:01:27.200> I<00:01:27.259> need<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.440> do<00:01:27.619> is<00:01:27.710> make<00:01:27.890> sure<00:01:27.920> that

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
all of those pieces of squid are

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.530 
all of those pieces of squid are
completely<00:01:30.320> coated<00:01:30.470> in<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.830> corn<00:01:31.009> flour

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
completely coated in the corn flour

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.999 
completely coated in the corn flour
there<00:01:32.540> we<00:01:32.600> go<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:33.380> now<00:01:33.560> I'm<00:01:33.619> gonna<00:01:33.710> go<00:01:33.890> and
