else do we know about these tacks that

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.120 
else do we know about these tacks that
are<00:01:19.590> very<00:01:19.740> similar

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
are very similar

siobhan<00:01:20.580> because<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.600> didn't<00:01:21.869> expect<00:01:22.259> both

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
siobhan because we didn't expect both

okay<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.450> exactly<00:01:25.520> another<00:01:26.520> significant

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
okay that is exactly another significant

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.859 
okay that is exactly another significant
point<00:01:27.450> okay

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
point okay

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.510 
point okay
I<00:01:27.900> mean<00:01:28.170> your<00:01:28.320> answer<00:01:28.740> could<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:29.159> we'll<00:01:29.400> look

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
I mean your answer could be we'll look

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.190 
I mean your answer could be we'll look
they're<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:29.790> basically<00:01:30.329> comparing<00:01:30.869> Pearl

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
they're just basically comparing Pearl

they're just basically comparing Pearl
Harbor<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:32.130> 9/11<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.939> mean<00:01:33.119> that's<00:01:33.210> what

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
Harbor to 9/11 that I mean that's what

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.149 
Harbor to 9/11 that I mean that's what
the<00:01:33.509> obvious<00:01:33.960> thing<00:01:34.170> they're<00:01:34.350> doing<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:34.979> if

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the obvious thing they're doing but if

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.399 
the obvious thing they're doing but if
you<00:01:35.369> take<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.880> step<00:01:36.119> further<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:37.170> they're

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
you take it a step further what they're

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.980 
you take it a step further what they're
really<00:01:37.650> wanting<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.220> compare<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
really wanting to compare it to is the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.530 
really wanting to compare it to is the
fact<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.619> was<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> surprise<00:01:41.250> attack<00:01:41.540> by

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
