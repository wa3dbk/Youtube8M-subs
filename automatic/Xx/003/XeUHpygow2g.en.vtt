have<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.850> Minecraft<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:56.160> knew<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.730> we

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
have in Minecraft so I knew I know we

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.900 
have in Minecraft so I knew I know we
don't<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.329> lot<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.690> colors<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.520> that's<00:00:59.760> why
