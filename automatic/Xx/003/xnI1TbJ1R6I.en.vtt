00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.590 
two liters all fleshed out and then put
it<00:02:22.350> off<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.710> an<00:02:22.800> angle<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.690> don't

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
it off to an angle so that you don't

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.000 
it off to an angle so that you don't
really<00:02:27.600> mix<00:02:27.840> them<00:02:27.990> together<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:31.410> my<00:02:31.770> paint

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
really mix them together and my paint

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.140 
really mix them together and my paint
thinner<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.340> really<00:02:32.610> full<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:35.370> oh<00:02:35.520> man<00:02:35.910> is

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
thinner is really full so and oh man is

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.340 
thinner is really full so and oh man is
that<00:02:36.180> smell<00:02:37.190> if<00:02:38.190> you're<00:02:38.790> doing<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.330> at<00:02:39.810> home

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
that smell if you're doing this at home

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.550 
that smell if you're doing this at home
and<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:42.920> are<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.950> minor<00:02:44.459> I'd<00:02:44.820> ask<00:02:45.000> permission

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
and you are a minor I'd ask permission

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.430 
and you are a minor I'd ask permission
because<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.830> smell<00:02:47.100> doesn't<00:02:47.340> go<00:02:47.550> away<00:02:47.640> for

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
because this smell doesn't go away for

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.010 
because this smell doesn't go away for
real<00:02:49.440> quick<00:02:50.330> I'm<00:02:51.330> getting<00:02:51.510> pretty<00:02:51.840> full<00:02:52.140> here

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
real quick I'm getting pretty full here

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.880 
real quick I'm getting pretty full here
and<00:02:55.020> that<00:02:55.410> backup<00:02:57.200> I'm<00:02:58.200> going<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.470> fill<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.740> all

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
and that backup I'm going to fill it all

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.000 
and that backup I'm going to fill it all
the<00:02:59.300> way<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.660> top<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.290> have<00:03:01.470> no<00:03:01.770> air

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
the way to the top so I have no air

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.610 
the way to the top so I have no air
bubbles<00:03:03.680> get<00:03:04.680> all<00:03:04.860> flat<00:03:06.230> hold<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.380> up<00:03:07.500> an

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
bubbles get all flat hold it up an

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.110 
bubbles get all flat hold it up an
overflow<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:09.120> then<00:03:09.300> put<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.630> cap<00:03:09.840> back<00:03:09.870> on

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:23.000 

now<00:03:15.260> Prince<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.410> off<00:03:19.820> there<00:03:20.820> you<00:03:20.910> go<00:03:21.980> got<00:03:22.980> a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
now Prince it off there you go got a

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.460 
now Prince it off there you go got a
notion<00:03:23.570> in<00:03:24.570> a<00:03:25.230> bottle<00:03:26.750> now<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.840> reason<00:03:28.140> that

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
notion in a bottle now the reason that

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.190 
notion in a bottle now the reason that
this<00:03:28.650> happens<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:30.269> reason<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.780> this

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
this happens and the reason that this

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.280 
this happens and the reason that this
happens<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:34.280> liquids<00:03:36.110> aren't<00:03:37.110> going

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
happens is that the liquids aren't going

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.080 
happens is that the liquids aren't going
to<00:03:37.380> mix<00:03:37.590> together<00:03:37.739> like<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.310> like<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.700> gas

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
to mix together like the like a gas

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:48.199 
to mix together like the like a gas
would<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.970> oil<00:03:42.300> on<00:03:42.780> top<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:46.370> nonpolar<00:03:47.370> but

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
would and the oil on top is nonpolar but

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.240 
would and the oil on top is nonpolar but
the<00:03:48.420> water<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:48.870> polar<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:50.360> because<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.570> water

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
the water is polar and because the water

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.110 
the water is polar and because the water
really<00:03:53.250> really<00:03:54.440> has<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.470> very<00:03:56.160> slight<00:03:56.519> charge

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
really really has a very slight charge

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.240 
really really has a very slight charge
on<00:03:57.480> one<00:03:57.690> end<00:03:57.959> towards<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.560> oxygen<00:03:59.100> because

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
on one end towards the oxygen because

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.490 
on one end towards the oxygen because
the<00:03:59.340> oxygen<00:03:59.489> is<00:03:59.850> going<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.060> take<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:01.019> electron

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
the oxygen is going to take the electron

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.000 
the oxygen is going to take the electron
most<00:04:01.799> of<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:01.980> time<00:04:02.220> from<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.549> hydrogen<00:04:04.010> so

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
most of the time from the hydrogen so

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.350 
most of the time from the hydrogen so
since<00:04:05.310> water<00:04:05.850> is<00:04:06.620> polar<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:09.540> oil<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.989> not

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
since water is polar and the oil is not

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:18.050 
since water is polar and the oil is not
the<00:04:12.360> water<00:04:13.190> cannot<00:04:14.190> dissolve<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:15.660> oil<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:17.060> so

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
the water cannot dissolve the oil and so

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.810 
the water cannot dissolve the oil and so
you<00:04:18.690> don't<00:04:18.900> make<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.079> solution<00:04:19.680> or<00:04:19.769> anything

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
you don't make a solution or anything

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.140 
you don't make a solution or anything
and<00:04:20.910> then<00:04:21.240> the<00:04:21.900> oil<00:04:23.060> is<00:04:24.080> also<00:04:25.340> less<00:04:26.340> dense<00:04:26.730> than

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
and then the oil is also less dense than

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.530 
and then the oil is also less dense than
the<00:04:27.870> water<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.790> the<00:04:29.790> food<00:04:30.000> coloring<00:04:30.450> of

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
the water and the food coloring of

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.390 
the water and the food coloring of
course<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.520> solution<00:04:32.520> so<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.150> die<00:04:34.080> in<00:04:34.530> the

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
course is a solution so the die in the

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.890 
course is a solution so the die in the
food<00:04:35.580> coloring<00:04:36.120> is<00:04:36.380> polar<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:38.880> it<00:04:39.360> does

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
food coloring is polar and so it does

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.310 
food coloring is polar and so it does
dissolve<00:04:40.350> in<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.330> water<00:04:42.330> so<00:04:42.900> that's<00:04:43.020> why<00:04:43.290> that

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
dissolve in the water so that's why that

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.100 
dissolve in the water so that's why that
works<00:04:43.790> this<00:04:44.790> has<00:04:44.940> been<00:04:44.970> Justin<00:04:45.450> Higgins<00:04:45.600> let's
