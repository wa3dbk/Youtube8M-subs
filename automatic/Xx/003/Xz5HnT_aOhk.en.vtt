the and this breaks a lot whenever I

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.940 
the and this breaks a lot whenever I
move<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.280> does<00:02:45.430> move<00:02:46.050> this<00:02:47.050> under<00:02:47.470> here<00:02:47.739> is

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
move but it does move this under here is

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.290 
move but it does move this under here is
it<00:02:48.160> was<00:02:48.910> spinning<00:02:49.300> thing<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.810> um<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:51.550> can<00:02:51.790> spin

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
it was spinning thing it um you can spin

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.270 
it was spinning thing it um you can spin
and<00:02:52.630> just<00:02:52.870> like<00:02:53.019> that<00:02:53.050> all<00:02:53.709> these<00:02:54.069> little

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
and just like that all these little

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.090 
and just like that all these little
satellites<00:02:54.850> that<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.209> see<00:02:55.450> right<00:02:55.480> here

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
satellites that you see right here

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.160 
satellites that you see right here
removable<00:02:57.390> back<00:02:58.390> here<00:03:00.090> here<00:03:01.090> even<00:03:01.450> even<00:03:02.050> the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
removable back here here even even the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.050 
removable back here here even even the
ones<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.650> satellite<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:03.190> spin<00:03:03.519> spin

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
ones on the satellite that spin spin

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.940 
ones on the satellite that spin spin
moves<00:03:06.840> there's<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.900> little<00:03:08.080> ones<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.500> lost<00:03:08.800> that

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
moves there's a little ones I lost that

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.650 
moves there's a little ones I lost that
a<00:03:09.220> little<00:03:09.519> bit<00:03:09.610> one<00:03:09.880> I<00:03:10.090> don't<00:03:10.269> know<00:03:10.420> where<00:03:10.600> it

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
a little bit one I don't know where it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.900 
a little bit one I don't know where it
went<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:13.890> hear<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.070> little<00:03:15.250> one<00:03:15.400> moves<00:03:15.700> are

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
went I hear that little one moves are

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.100 
went I hear that little one moves are
here<00:03:16.920> it's<00:03:17.920> very<00:03:18.160> cool<00:03:18.459> all<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.060> satellite<00:03:19.480> so

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
here it's very cool all the satellite so

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.000 
here it's very cool all the satellite so

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
of them here some um that's just

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.020 
of them here some um that's just
part<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.579> it<00:03:42.700> this<00:03:43.180> these<00:03:43.600> right<00:03:43.810> here<00:03:43.840> open<00:03:44.590> up

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
this little brown thing right here you

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.880 
this little brown thing right here you
move<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.890> and<00:03:48.220> will<00:03:48.970> miss<00:03:49.150> it<00:03:49.180> was<00:03:49.359> come<00:03:49.510> out

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
move that and will miss it was come out

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.310 
move that and will miss it was come out
you<00:03:50.890> can't<00:03:51.100> blink<00:03:51.400> image<00:03:51.640> just<00:03:51.820> for<00:03:52.090> display

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
you can't blink image just for display

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.270 
you can't blink image just for display
you<00:03:53.320> know<00:03:53.500> it's<00:03:53.950> just<00:03:54.100> for<00:03:54.340> looks<00:03:54.549> and<00:03:56.280> close

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
you know it's just for looks and close

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.320 
you know it's just for looks and close
that<00:03:57.310> back<00:03:57.640> same<00:03:58.299> for<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.600> other<00:03:58.780> side

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:11.230 

that's<00:04:07.570> all<00:04:08.570> right<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:10.550> final<00:04:10.790> part<00:04:11.120> I

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
that's all right and the final part I

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.900 
that's all right and the final part I
think<00:04:11.270> this<00:04:11.570> is<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:11.720> best<00:04:11.870> part<00:04:12.550> this<00:04:13.550> whole

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
think this is the best part this whole

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.840 
think this is the best part this whole
part<00:04:14.570> comes<00:04:15.170> off<00:04:15.459> share<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.580> inside<00:04:18.850> where

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
part comes off share the inside where

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.860 
part comes off share the inside where
you<00:04:19.970> see<00:04:20.090> there's<00:04:20.270> a<00:04:20.330> little<00:04:20.390> hug<00:04:20.660> outside

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
you see there's a little hug outside

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.780 
you see there's a little hug outside
there<00:04:21.350> that's<00:04:21.680> where<00:04:21.950> this<00:04:22.100> stuff<00:04:22.370> goes<00:04:22.550> right

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
there that's where this stuff goes right

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.470 
there that's where this stuff goes right
here<00:04:23.080> this<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.230> a<00:04:24.260> little<00:04:24.500> skate<00:04:24.740> pod<00:04:25.040> for<00:04:26.030> this

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
here this is a little skate pod for this

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.520 
here this is a little skate pod for this
guy<00:04:26.690> right<00:04:26.840> here<00:04:28.510> he<00:04:29.510> sits<00:04:29.750> on<00:04:29.900> there<00:04:30.110> and<00:04:30.440> he

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
guy right here he sits on there and he

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
guy right here he sits on there and he
flies<00:04:30.770> off<00:04:30.800> these<00:04:31.340> wings<00:04:31.610> fold<00:04:31.970> down<00:04:33.550> like

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
flies off these wings fold down like

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.210 
flies off these wings fold down like
that<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:37.090> then<00:04:38.090> there's<00:04:38.270> little<00:04:38.540> controls

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
that and then there's little controls

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:47.620 
that and then there's little controls
I'm<00:04:40.220> so<00:04:40.580> that<00:04:40.730> sets<00:04:41.240> right<00:04:41.890> here<00:04:46.450> whatever<00:04:47.450> you

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
I'm so that sets right here whatever you

I'm so that sets right here whatever you
want<00:04:47.660> to<00:04:48.790> bet<00:04:49.790> you<00:04:50.270> just<00:04:50.450> take<00:04:50.600> it<00:04:50.720> out<00:04:50.840> and

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
want to bet you just take it out and

want to bet you just take it out and
this<00:04:51.800> is<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.130> thing<00:04:52.340> where<00:04:52.640> it<00:04:52.730> holds<00:04:53.060> the

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
this is the thing where it holds the

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:00.000 
this is the thing where it holds the
guns<00:04:53.390> inside<00:04:53.860> they<00:04:54.860> show<00:04:55.070> you<00:04:55.130> that<00:04:58.600> that<00:04:59.600> gun
