00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.160
 I am erubey cabuto at the moment archer 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:13.559
 of the money of the atlas I was here 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.559
 year 95 to 2002 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.370
 at the beginning of that of that great team 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.370
 gave us a lot of satisfactions I think 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.739
 that it was not easy, it will be much of the 99 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.720
 that was the year in which we took 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.690
 enough to talk about we even arrived 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.760
 to dispute the title if we go back 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.190
 a little bit behind, the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.559
 LavallÃ©n himself had already arrived this 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.440
 there were among other players that at 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.230
 post they were giving little by little this 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.760
 mold or that mold that a lot of guilt and I think 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.970
 who is the main responsible for 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.960
 what to charge by blow that much taught us 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.729
 a lot bit us he did not even learn 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.799
 really what he wanted inside the 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.170
 court and that fortunately the ones 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.180
 reflecting little by little really was a 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.970
 generation the players with big 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.640
 qualities that today more than one 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.470
 keep playing for its qualities we 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.760
 It cost work, believe me it cost us work 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.010
 but I think we 're learning 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.550
 slow but sure the way I wanted 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.080
 the teacher is that we work in 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.970
 its moment we gave of what to speak in the 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.860
 liberators I think that filled us 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.350
 pretty confident to know that 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.030
 we really could have what 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.610
 and that we continue to demonstrate in his 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.640
 moment so it is so in the summer 99 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.150
 we reached the final a final that 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.540
 It took us a long time to get to her 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.810
 It took a lot of effort, tears and so on 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.320
 but it was a yearning we all had in 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.410
 maybe this many children thought 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.120
 but as that happens, time to know 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.350
 that we were already a step away from achieving 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.560
 what we all wanted to create the 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.530
 championship filled us with satisfaction with 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.170
 its final form quite close against a 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.570
 great team as it was toluca in his 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.570
 moment I think we were the two teams 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.090
 what better football do we play if you give 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.110
 account in each one that we face 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.110
 before the final 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.140
 were 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.660
 matches of two goals up 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.730
 emotions from the first minute up 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.960
 the ninety minute of a coming and going 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.450
 quite accelerated then it was from a 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.610
 pace up a pretty soccer guy 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.530
 special and a football that played the 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.590
 two teams quite particular not 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.340
 talking about atlas was a pretty team 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.990
 dynamic with a very special treatment 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.720
 do the ball and we played well 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.550
 he played well he liked people too 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.620
 so we gave a lot to talk and 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.870
 many followed by other teams 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.459
 always be a true performance that we 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.530
 We took pride in everything 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.989
 liability responsibility and 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.680
 good wish to continue later 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.480
 that end of the contract luca beyond 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.630
 that the goal that was 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.300
 win in the believe me that we 're left with 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.050
 that with that tranquility of looking at us 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.430
 the face of knowing that we gave everything for 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.209
 stream by forums by trying to 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.650
 earn it 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.580
 we just gave ourselves to analysts from 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.830
 gratitude 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.680
 of growth with each other to know 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.600
 that we gave everything and the question of the 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.090
 criminals alone was already a crop 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.040
 air a coin to the air that none 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.690
 had to win definitely not him 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.480
 we blame nobody because everyone 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.160
 we are winners photos of losers in s 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.170
 then all feel 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.990
 winners with a pretty flavor 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.340
 bittersweet you know we saw all but 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.220
 we lost 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.650
 I think it was quite an experience 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.000
 pretty for all of us who 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.330
 regardless of what was the 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.050
 team I think friendship prevails and 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.050
 we stay with him
