00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.770
 sony will be review on the game for amazing 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.579
 spider-man 2 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.680
 new spider-man 2 translate means 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:31.820
 so general, first go through the schedule 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.380
 then for all the other advantages of this 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.780
 games and cons in general as you can see 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.430
 detailing and reflection of all this graphics 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.329
 all character textures are made 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.019
 it is clear that without any there 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:51.140
 by the way there are few such angles anyway 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.800
 somehow it looks like the quality seems to me 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.980
 even better in the first part in general 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.569
 approximately from the level of graphics spider-man 3 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.430
 on computers we mean compared 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:06.440
 from the first part there are some movements 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.530
 so smooth that is really possible 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.920
 compare with the computer version of the game 3 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.320
 spiderman means well in principle here 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.230
 learn much graphics do not consider so 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.710
 how do you need to start the boss now 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.810
 who ruined the weather so now 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.880
 no sun of these highlights here it is not 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:32.510
 will actually be seen graphics 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.220
 much better here in general who 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.470
 watched a movie he knows I probably don’t 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.180
 watched 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.800
 electric what are you in general in general 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.780
 clouds and everywhere that's about reflection 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.910
 on houses they are not pseudo reflections 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.770
 real but still looks beautiful 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:55.070
 that is, it is constantly reflected on 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:57.010
 the same picture on the glass here is the texture 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.170
 then done well, too, in principle 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:04.190
 Here is the drawing distance thing worthless 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.370
 in fact, because it is clear that at home 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:12.140
 It appears literally somewhere meters 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:16.120
 fifty maybe somewhere so 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.670
 further 50 meters all blurry like that 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.030
 but again if you would all be clear 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.709
 it turns out the game was scored 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.519
 so apparently they did everything 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.540
 so better to play than 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.330
 than with bad graphics 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.819
 with a range of drawing huge sense 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.290
 No, it seems to me in the general machine graphics 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.450
 textures machines too so-so principle 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.629
 done again it seems to me for 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.500
 optimization then what will release 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:49.019
 characters square respectively 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.209
 you see 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:58.629
 so now the texture is still visible in a very 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.620
 small resolution characters themselves 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.819
 square literally here and 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:10.209
 Respectively, I am not 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:11.430
 they do n't even have full animation here 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.579
 principle here 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:21.359
 nice to play flying through buildings 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:21.359
 the mission city ​​is quite interesting 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.250
 interesting missions to start all sorts 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.060
 gangsters will seem Iraq and 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.069
 some kind of dumb well, and then there already 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.930
 the plot develops in principle the game 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:42.419
 normal and graphic for smartphones 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.129
 specifically for smartphones on the computer 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:49.419
 the graphics are ok i'm happy with everything 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:51.040
 excellent, in principle, put the way 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:55.230
 maximum graphics here for what you can 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:58.230
 select settings where 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.230
 So 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:08.870
 these graphics are generally understood shorter 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.060
 settings you just need to set up the main thing 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.010
 the graphics settings menu is better here 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.980
 two modes of graphics settings are the most 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:21.260
 minimal for optimization for what 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:23.210
 went great and to improve graphics 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:30.169
 now it is at the maximum 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:32.720
 graphics means this is such a great 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:36.229
 Toy I advise you to play principle 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.200
 interesting again saying no stupid plot 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.190
 vitamins principle is fun to play here 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.960
 general on this review 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.330
 given when the customer subscribe to 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.120
 channel wait for the following reviews on new 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.590
 via android also see the game test 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:56.720
 at 850 and also see triple reviews 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.639
 just three new games at once so 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.810
 On this review I sign up 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.810
 on the channel all bye
