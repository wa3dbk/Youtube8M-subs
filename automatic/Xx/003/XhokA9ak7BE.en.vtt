a large sheet of baking paper just cut
it<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.640> this<00:04:17.640> is<00:04:17.790> where<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.940> sharp<00:04:18.269> knife<00:04:18.450> comes

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
it and this is where a sharp knife comes

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.650 
it and this is where a sharp knife comes
in<00:04:18.989> handy<00:04:19.169> like<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:23.760> look<00:04:23.970> that's<00:04:24.390> not

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
in handy like that and look that's not

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.240 
in handy like that and look that's not
going<00:04:24.900> anywhere<00:04:25.580> perfect<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.669> start<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:28.250> so

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
going anywhere perfect to start and so

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:38.719 
going anywhere perfect to start and so
I'm<00:04:29.370> totally<00:04:29.730> ready<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:30.270> roll<00:04:30.480> out<00:04:30.660> our<00:04:30.810> dough

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.149 

and<00:04:38.939> yes<00:04:39.599> that<00:04:39.900> half<00:04:40.169> hour<00:04:40.439> in<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.710> fridge<00:04:40.740> has

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159 
and yes that half hour in the fridge has

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:43.459 
and yes that half hour in the fridge has
made<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.699> stork<00:04:42.059> solid<00:04:42.509> again<00:04:42.749> providing<00:04:43.319> a

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:43.469 
made the stork solid again providing a

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:45.709 
made the stork solid again providing a
firm<00:04:43.800> dough<00:04:44.189> which<00:04:44.669> I<00:04:44.789> can<00:04:44.969> roll<00:04:45.180> out<00:04:45.210> nicely

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719 
firm dough which I can roll out nicely

00:04:45.719 --> 00:05:02.690 
firm dough which I can roll out nicely
now

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.330 

and<00:05:02.820> then<00:05:03.780> of<00:05:03.930> course<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.380> good<00:05:04.560> old<00:05:04.770> rolling

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
and then of course the good old rolling

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.810 
and then of course the good old rolling
pinched<00:05:06.800> always<00:05:07.800> start<00:05:08.100> from<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.430> middle<00:05:08.460> and

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
pinched always start from the middle and

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.580 
pinched always start from the middle and
certainly<00:05:09.540> in<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:09.750> case<00:05:09.780> of<00:05:09.990> speculaas

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
certainly in the case of speculaas

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.730 
certainly in the case of speculaas
cookies<00:05:11.040> we<00:05:11.700> don't<00:05:11.850> need<00:05:12.060> to<00:05:12.180> go<00:05:12.300> to<00:05:12.330> thin<00:05:12.960> and

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
cookies we don't need to go to thin and

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.200 
cookies we don't need to go to thin and
doesn't<00:05:14.040> everybody<00:05:14.400> want<00:05:14.490> their<00:05:14.760> speculaas

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
doesn't everybody want their speculaas

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.600 
doesn't everybody want their speculaas
nice<00:05:15.600> and<00:05:15.870> crusty<00:05:16.200> on<00:05:16.230> the<00:05:16.320> outside<00:05:16.410> yet<00:05:17.250> still

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
nice and crusty on the outside yet still

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:26.030 
nice and crusty on the outside yet still
a<00:05:17.670> little<00:05:17.880> bit<00:05:18.120> soft<00:05:18.480> on<00:05:18.840> the<00:05:19.110> inside<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:25.560> then

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
a little bit soft on the inside and then

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.270 
a little bit soft on the inside and then
we<00:05:26.670> need<00:05:26.820> to<00:05:26.880> be<00:05:27.090> careful<00:05:27.390> and<00:05:27.920> as<00:05:28.920> you<00:05:29.070> can<00:05:29.250> see

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
we need to be careful and as you can see

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.060 
we need to be careful and as you can see
in<00:05:29.700> my<00:05:29.760> case<00:05:30.270> if<00:05:30.480> it<00:05:30.840> crumbles<00:05:31.080> too<00:05:31.470> much<00:05:31.620> you

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
in my case if it crumbles too much you

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.640 
in my case if it crumbles too much you
can<00:05:32.250> easily<00:05:32.610> cut<00:05:32.880> it<00:05:33.030> in<00:05:33.180> two<00:05:33.560> decreasing<00:05:34.560> the

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
can easily cut it in two decreasing the

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.010 
can easily cut it in two decreasing the
risk<00:05:34.770> of<00:05:35.010> breaking<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:36.060> whole<00:05:36.480> lot

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:50.379 

look<00:05:40.680> at<00:05:40.800> that

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.390 

and<00:05:51.389> now<00:05:51.750> the<00:05:51.810> speculaas<00:05:52.410> is<00:05:52.710> ready<00:05:52.949> to<00:05:53.220> hit

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
and now the speculaas is ready to hit

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.420 
and now the speculaas is ready to hit
the<00:05:53.430> preheated<00:05:54.120> oven<00:05:54.210> at<00:05:54.509> a<00:05:54.750> temperature<00:05:55.199> of

the preheated oven at a temperature of
185<00:05:56.430> degrees<00:05:56.669> Celsius<00:05:57.330> for<00:05:57.479> about<00:05:57.750> 15<00:05:58.349> minutes

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.370 

and<00:06:14.759> yes<00:06:15.150> the<00:06:15.360> speculaas<00:06:15.810> turned<00:06:16.169> out

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
and yes the speculaas turned out

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.680 
and yes the speculaas turned out
perfectly<00:06:16.919> you<00:06:17.550> can<00:06:17.729> nicely<00:06:18.000> see<00:06:18.479> these

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
perfectly you can nicely see these

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.390 
perfectly you can nicely see these

little cracks on the surface of our
large<00:06:20.789> cookie<00:06:21.530> I'll<00:06:22.530> let<00:06:22.830> it<00:06:22.860> cool<00:06:23.160> for<00:06:23.220> a

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
large cookie I'll let it cool for a

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.980 
large cookie I'll let it cool for a
little<00:06:23.550> while<00:06:23.759> so<00:06:24.060> I<00:06:24.090> can<00:06:24.330> cut<00:06:24.509> it<00:06:24.599> more<00:06:24.750> easily

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
little while so I can cut it more easily

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.080 
little while so I can cut it more easily
but<00:06:25.680> make<00:06:25.830> sure<00:06:25.860> you<00:06:26.160> don't<00:06:26.370> let<00:06:26.460> it<00:06:26.610> cool<00:06:26.759> too

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
but make sure you don't let it cool too

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.740 
but make sure you don't let it cool too
much<00:06:27.330> because<00:06:27.810> then<00:06:28.199> you're<00:06:28.470> in<00:06:28.590> trouble<00:06:29.750> cool

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
much because then you're in trouble cool

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.080 
much because then you're in trouble cool
down<00:06:30.960> just<00:06:31.020> enough<00:06:31.440> to<00:06:31.710> cut<00:06:31.860> it<00:06:32.039> and<00:06:32.340> now<00:06:32.789> I'll

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
down just enough to cut it and now I'll

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.790 
down just enough to cut it and now I'll
give<00:06:33.300> the<00:06:33.419> speculaas<00:06:33.870> it's<00:06:34.199> typical

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
give the speculaas it's typical

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:42.320 
give the speculaas it's typical
rectangular<00:06:35.430> shape<00:06:40.610> now<00:06:41.610> it's<00:06:41.880> a<00:06:42.000> matter<00:06:42.150> of

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
rectangular shape now it's a matter of

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.570 
rectangular shape now it's a matter of
working<00:06:42.599> fast<00:06:43.050> enough<00:06:43.199> to<00:06:43.800> avoid<00:06:43.919> the<00:06:44.280> cookies

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
working fast enough to avoid the cookies

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.059 
working fast enough to avoid the cookies
becoming<00:06:44.970> too<00:06:45.150> hard<00:06:45.419> if<00:06:45.750> that<00:06:46.349> happens<00:06:46.800> and

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:47.069 
becoming too hard if that happens and

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:49.249 
becoming too hard if that happens and
obviously<00:06:47.580> it<00:06:47.759> sometimes<00:06:48.210> does<00:06:48.449> put<00:06:49.139> the

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 
obviously it sometimes does put the

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.020 
obviously it sometimes does put the
baking<00:06:49.620> tray<00:06:49.770> back<00:06:50.130> in<00:06:50.340> the<00:06:50.430> oven<00:06:50.610> for<00:06:50.789> a

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
baking tray back in the oven for a

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.060 
baking tray back in the oven for a
moment<00:06:51.270> and<00:06:51.750> the<00:06:51.900> cookies<00:06:52.229> will<00:06:52.409> soften<00:06:52.680> again

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
moment and the cookies will soften again

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.219 
moment and the cookies will soften again
I<00:06:53.310> need<00:06:54.090> to<00:06:54.330> hurry<00:06:54.509> up<00:06:54.570> now

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:57.229 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:00.439 

once<00:06:58.229> called<00:06:58.559> our<00:06:59.009> speculaas<00:06:59.610> is<00:06:59.849> totally
