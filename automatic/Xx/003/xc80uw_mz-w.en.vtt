welcome to this screencast about ground
org<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.540> its<00:00:03.870> features<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.920> voice<00:00:05.190> an<00:00:05.549> organ

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.049 

we<00:00:12.870> will<00:00:13.049> start<00:00:13.410> by<00:00:13.650> opening<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:14.429> sample<00:00:14.849> set

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
we will start by opening a sample set

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.250 
we will start by opening a sample set
and<00:00:16.369> we<00:00:17.369> will<00:00:17.520> discuss<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> bit<00:00:18.420> about<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
and we will discuss a bit about the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.070 
and we will discuss a bit about the
tuning<00:00:19.770> when<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.699> open<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.270> set<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.810> will

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
tuning when you open a set it will

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.849 
tuning when you open a set it will
normally<00:00:22.320> start<00:00:22.980> us<00:00:24.170> original<00:00:25.170> temperament

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
normally start us original temperament

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.960 
normally start us original temperament
or<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.670> audio<00:00:27.330> files<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:28.050> samples<00:00:28.680> as<00:00:29.039> they

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
or the audio files to samples as they

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.479 
or the audio files to samples as they
are<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.500> hard<00:00:31.710> drive<00:00:32.840> and<00:00:34.010> in<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.219> case

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
are on the hard drive and in this case

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.619 
are on the hard drive and in this case
for<00:00:35.760> instance<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:36.390> will<00:00:36.510> hear<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:38.300> c2<00:00:39.300> is

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
for instance we will hear that the c2 is

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.220 
for instance we will hear that the c2 is
outer<00:00:39.899> tuned

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.200 

with<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.620> sample<00:00:47.160> set<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:48.260> pitch<00:00:50.210> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
with this sample set the pitch the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.569 
with this sample set the pitch the
information<00:00:51.929> about<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.440> pitch<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.129> sample

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
information about the pitch of a sample

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.200 
information about the pitch of a sample
is<00:00:53.729> embedded<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.379> file<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.519> if<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.969> select

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
is embedded in the file so if you select

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.729 
is embedded in the file so if you select
a<00:00:57.750> temperament<00:00:59.869> everything<00:01:00.869> should<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.379> tuned

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
a temperament everything should be tuned

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.359 
a temperament everything should be tuned
correctly<00:01:02.190> now<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.089> we<00:01:03.539> will<00:01:03.750> see

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.749 

and<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:08.030> works<00:01:09.759> in<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:12.110> old<00:01:12.259> days<00:01:12.759> this

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
and it works in the old days this

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.380 
and it works in the old days this
feature<00:01:14.119> didn't<00:01:14.689> exist<00:01:15.079> so<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.880> sample<00:01:17.240> set

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
feature didn't exist so the sample set

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.609 
feature didn't exist so the sample set
producers<00:01:18.079> tuned<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:19.250> samples<00:01:20.350> directly<00:01:21.350> in

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
producers tuned the samples directly in

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.499 
producers tuned the samples directly in
the<00:01:22.130> editing<00:01:23.060> process<00:01:24.640> this<00:01:25.640> is<00:01:25.850> something<00:01:26.299> I

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
the editing process this is something I

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.620 
the editing process this is something I
don't<00:01:26.960> do<00:01:27.200> anymore<00:01:27.590> since<00:01:28.490> I<00:01:28.850> think<00:01:29.179> that

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
don't do anymore since I think that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.590 
don't do anymore since I think that
everything<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:30.829> do<00:01:31.009> to<00:01:31.280> an<00:01:31.429> audio<00:01:31.880> file<00:01:32.240> of

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
everything you do to an audio file of

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.169 
everything you do to an audio file of
the<00:01:33.200> recording<00:01:33.770> will<00:01:33.979> degrade<00:01:34.250> it<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:34.909> some

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
the recording will degrade it to some

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.010 
the recording will degrade it to some
degree<00:01:35.320> and<00:01:36.460> I<00:01:37.460> like<00:01:37.789> to<00:01:37.939> keep<00:01:38.149> it<00:01:38.420> as<00:01:38.630> original

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
degree and I like to keep it as original

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.520 
degree and I like to keep it as original
as<00:01:39.770> possible<00:01:40.330> so<00:01:41.330> it's<00:01:41.509> very<00:01:41.780> nice<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:42.080> have

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
as possible so it's very nice to have

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.039 
as possible so it's very nice to have
this<00:01:42.920> feature<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.580> embed<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.390> information

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
this feature to embed the information

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.429 
this feature to embed the information
instead<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:45.740> them<00:01:46.009> correct<00:01:46.789> the<00:01:46.939> tuning<00:01:47.439> by

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
instead and them correct the tuning by

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.520 
instead and them correct the tuning by
selecting<00:01:48.979> a<00:01:49.069> temperament<00:01:50.860> but<00:01:51.860> if<00:01:53.229> it's<00:01:54.229> not

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
selecting a temperament but if it's not

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.339 
selecting a temperament but if it's not
tuned<00:01:54.890> properly<00:01:55.189> you<00:01:55.880> can<00:01:56.240> correct<00:01:57.170> it

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
tuned properly you can correct it

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:01.419 
tuned properly you can correct it
manually<00:01:58.099> instead<00:01:58.580> if<00:01:59.539> you<00:02:00.259> go<00:02:00.409> into<00:02:00.709> organ

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
manually instead if you go into organ

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:08.109 
manually instead if you go into organ
settings<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.780> select<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.439> stop<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:07.119> the

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
settings and select the stop and the

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.900 
settings and select the stop and the
pipes<00:02:08.599> that<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:09.049> want<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:10.630> change<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.670> go

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
pipes that you want to change you can go

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.360 
pipes that you want to change you can go
in<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.390> change<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.530> tuning<00:02:16.400> here<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.840> it's

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
in and change the tuning here and it's

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.890 
in and change the tuning here and it's
incense<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.920> should<00:02:22.310> work<00:02:22.340> about<00:02:23.150> nine

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
incense so this should work about nine

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.430 
incense so this should work about nine
cents<00:02:24.560> higher<00:02:24.859> and<00:02:25.359> then<00:02:26.359> you<00:02:26.480> hit<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:27.109> apply

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
cents higher and then you hit the apply

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.490 
cents higher and then you hit the apply
and<00:02:27.829> we'll<00:02:28.100> listen

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.400 

no<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.770> course<00:02:35.330> what<00:02:36.330> was<00:02:36.870> wrong

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
no of course what was wrong

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.680 
no of course what was wrong
yes<00:02:37.830> we<00:02:38.220> had<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.459> temperament<00:02:39.090> already

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
yes we had a temperament already

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.100 
yes we had a temperament already
selected<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.790> tuning<00:02:42.890> already<00:02:43.890> was<00:02:44.700> in

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
selected so the tuning already was in

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.050 
selected so the tuning already was in
place<00:02:46.110> actually<00:02:46.709> now<00:02:46.890> with<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.400> original

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
place actually now with the original

00:02:48.060 --> 00:03:03.510 
place actually now with the original
temperament<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:51.540> should<00:02:51.930> be<00:02:52.110> correct

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.410 

and<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:04.840> already<00:03:04.990> had<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.560> have<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.130> tuned<00:03:06.730> nine

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
and we already had to have it tuned nine

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.340 
and we already had to have it tuned nine
cents<00:03:07.840> high<00:03:07.990> so<00:03:08.410> it<00:03:08.560> will<00:03:08.770> be<00:03:09.030> pretty<00:03:10.030> okay<00:03:10.480> if

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
cents high so it will be pretty okay if

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.280 
cents high so it will be pretty okay if
you<00:03:11.860> wish<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.210> restore<00:03:13.210> the<00:03:13.390> default<00:03:13.540> values

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
you wish to restore the default values

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.090 
you wish to restore the default values
you<00:03:14.320> can<00:03:14.470> always<00:03:14.770> do<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:17.350> is<00:03:17.410> how

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
you can always do that and this is how

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.660 
you can always do that and this is how
it<00:03:18.250> sounded<00:03:18.730> originally<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:19.980> we<00:03:20.980> can<00:03:21.160> overdo

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
it sounded originally and we can overdo

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:29.280 
it sounded originally and we can overdo
it<00:03:21.700> just<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.510> see<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:27.270> you<00:03:28.270> can<00:03:28.510> go<00:03:28.690> up<00:03:28.900> pretty

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
it just to see and you can go up pretty

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:42.450 
it just to see and you can go up pretty
high<00:03:29.670> it's<00:03:30.670> an<00:03:30.910> octave<00:03:31.950> actually<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:42.070> always

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
high it's an octave actually and always

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:49.890 
high it's an octave actually and always
you<00:03:42.640> can<00:03:42.850> hit<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.360> default<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:44.740> return<00:03:48.900> you

you can hit the default to return you

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.730 
you can hit the default to return you
can<00:03:50.050> also<00:03:50.820> select<00:03:51.820> to<00:03:52.320> increase<00:03:53.320> or<00:03:53.620> decrease

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
can also select to increase or decrease

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.840 
can also select to increase or decrease
the<00:03:54.040> volume<00:03:54.520> of<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.270> sample<00:03:56.460> that<00:03:57.460> is<00:03:57.610> called

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
the volume of a sample that is called

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.670 
the volume of a sample that is called
voicing<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:59.920> do<00:04:00.070> it<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.490> get<00:04:01.330> an

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
voicing and you do it to get an

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.310 
voicing and you do it to get an
approximately<00:04:02.680> equal<00:04:03.960> feeling<00:04:04.960> of<00:04:05.170> the

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
approximately equal feeling of the

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.589 
approximately equal feeling of the
volume<00:04:05.710> of<00:04:05.920> each<00:04:06.370> note

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:18.370 

we<00:04:12.170> can<00:04:12.349> try<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.620> increase<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.999> value<00:04:17.320> quite<00:04:18.320> a

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
we can try to increase the value quite a

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:25.190 
we can try to increase the value quite a
lot<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.840> hit<00:04:21.259> apply

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.850 

and<00:04:25.740> it's<00:04:25.890> very<00:04:26.100> much<00:04:26.400> stronger<00:04:27.330> or<00:04:28.110> we<00:04:28.680> can

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
and it's very much stronger or we can

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:37.250 
and it's very much stronger or we can
decrease<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.880> value<00:04:34.880> and<00:04:35.880> we<00:04:36.780> can<00:04:36.810> always

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
decrease the value and we can always

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:47.170 
decrease the value and we can always
return<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.460> default<00:04:39.000> values<00:04:39.840> instead

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.930 

now<00:04:48.180> I<00:04:49.020> would<00:04:49.560> like<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.800> point<00:04:50.129> out<00:04:50.400> once<00:04:50.729> again

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
now I would like to point out once again

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.760 
now I would like to point out once again
that<00:04:52.310> here<00:04:53.310> you<00:04:53.460> have<00:04:53.669> the<00:04:54.509> option<00:04:54.930> to<00:04:55.169> select

that here you have the option to select
ignore<00:04:56.190> pitch<00:04:56.819> info<00:04:57.569> and<00:04:57.870> this<00:04:58.530> you<00:04:58.770> can<00:04:58.979> use

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
ignore pitch info and this you can use

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.059 
ignore pitch info and this you can use
if<00:04:59.639> the<00:05:00.180> sample<00:05:00.539> set<00:05:00.690> producer<00:05:01.080> didn't<00:05:01.590> put<00:05:01.860> in

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:02.069 
if the sample set producer didn't put in

the the pitch info into the files and
you<00:05:07.229> wish<00:05:07.409> to<00:05:07.590> use<00:05:07.770> that<00:05:08.039> the<00:05:08.490> temperament

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
you wish to use that the temperament

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.270 
you wish to use that the temperament
feature<00:05:09.680> you<00:05:10.680> will<00:05:10.830> have<00:05:11.099> to<00:05:11.280> select<00:05:11.490> this<00:05:13.280> to

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
feature you will have to select this to

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.219 
feature you will have to select this to
have<00:05:14.669> it<00:05:14.819> react<00:05:15.389> the<00:05:15.629> proper<00:05:16.020> way<00:05:18.110> but<00:05:19.110> again

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
have it react the proper way but again

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.399 
have it react the proper way but again
this<00:05:19.969> depends<00:05:20.969> on<00:05:21.210> if<00:05:21.449> the<00:05:21.930> sample<00:05:22.259> set

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
this depends on if the sample set

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:25.820 
this depends on if the sample set
producer<00:05:22.949> did<00:05:23.610> put<00:05:23.909> that<00:05:24.659> info<00:05:25.080> in<00:05:25.319> the<00:05:25.590> files

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
producer did put that info in the files

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.140 
producer did put that info in the files
or<00:05:26.099> not<00:05:26.310> you<00:05:27.030> will<00:05:27.830> actually<00:05:28.830> we<00:05:29.580> can<00:05:29.819> load<00:05:30.120> a

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
or not you will actually we can load a

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.420 
or not you will actually we can load a
set<00:05:30.599> and<00:05:30.960> you<00:05:31.349> will<00:05:31.759> hear<00:05:32.759> what<00:05:33.000> it's<00:05:34.250> what<00:05:35.250> it

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
set and you will hear what it's what it

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.850 
set and you will hear what it's what it
will<00:05:35.580> sound<00:05:35.849> like<00:05:36.060> if<00:05:37.669> if<00:05:38.669> it's<00:05:38.940> not<00:05:39.180> present

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
will sound like if if it's not present

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:52.360 
will sound like if if it's not present
we<00:05:40.860> will<00:05:41.009> select<00:05:42.469> one<00:05:43.469> of<00:05:43.620> my<00:05:43.740> old<00:05:44.009> sets

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.090 

and<00:05:52.460> this<00:05:53.449> set<00:05:53.780> was<00:05:54.020> produced<00:05:54.530> in<00:05:54.710> the<00:05:54.860> time

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
and this set was produced in the time

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.000 
and this set was produced in the time
where<00:05:55.520> the<00:05:55.940> only<00:05:56.240> option<00:05:56.630> was<00:05:56.870> to<00:05:56.930> tune<00:05:57.770> the

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
where the only option was to tune the

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:04.990 
where the only option was to tune the
samples<00:05:58.550> in<00:05:59.360> the<00:05:59.630> audio<00:05:59.990> editor<00:06:00.940> and<00:06:04.000> it's

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
samples in the audio editor and it's

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:16.860 
samples in the audio editor and it's
approximately<00:06:05.449> equal<00:06:06.460> temperament

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:24.180 

and<00:06:17.380> I<00:06:17.530> first<00:06:17.919> configure<00:06:18.580> it<00:06:18.760> a<00:06:19.199> little<00:06:21.060> and<00:06:23.190> we

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
and I first configure it a little and we

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:31.730 
and I first configure it a little and we
will<00:06:24.370> see<00:06:24.580> that<00:06:24.970> I<00:06:25.000> select<00:06:25.540> a<00:06:25.690> few<00:06:25.870> stops<00:06:30.330> and

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
will see that I select a few stops and

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.870 
will see that I select a few stops and
try<00:06:32.740> to<00:06:32.800> change<00:06:33.790> the<00:06:34.150> temperaments<00:06:34.930> and<00:06:35.880> what

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
try to change the temperaments and what

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.360 
try to change the temperaments and what
will<00:06:37.090> happen

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:49.080 

Oh<00:06:46.050> interesting<00:06:47.050> but<00:06:47.650> it<00:06:47.800> was<00:06:48.040> not<00:06:48.340> what<00:06:48.880> was

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
Oh interesting but it was not what was

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.740 
Oh interesting but it was not what was
intended<00:06:49.150> really<00:06:50.550> and<00:06:51.550> this<00:06:51.790> is<00:06:52.000> due<00:06:52.389> to<00:06:52.419> that

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
intended really and this is due to that

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.270 
intended really and this is due to that
there<00:06:53.110> is<00:06:53.169> no<00:06:53.590> pitch<00:06:53.919> info<00:06:54.550> in<00:06:54.820> the<00:06:55.060> files<00:06:56.280> so

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
there is no pitch info in the files so

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.960 
there is no pitch info in the files so
into<00:06:57.970> the<00:06:58.090> organ<00:06:58.540> settings<00:06:59.250> ignore<00:07:00.250> pitch<00:07:00.669> in

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970 
into the organ settings ignore pitch in

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:07.830 
into the organ settings ignore pitch in
for<00:07:01.240> okay<00:07:04.860> and<00:07:06.030> now<00:07:07.030> it<00:07:07.240> should<00:07:07.479> be<00:07:07.510> possible

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
for okay and now it should be possible

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.710 
for okay and now it should be possible
to<00:07:10.050> also<00:07:11.050> change<00:07:11.639> temperaments<00:07:12.639> and<00:07:12.790> have<00:07:13.570> it

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:13.720 
to also change temperaments and have it

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.920 
to also change temperaments and have it
working<00:07:13.990> as<00:07:14.320> it<00:07:14.500> should

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
working as it should

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.190 
working as it should
let's<00:07:16.930> try<00:07:17.340> emajor<00:07:18.340> as<00:07:19.120> that<00:07:19.510> won't<00:07:19.900> work

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:20.200 
let's try emajor as that won't work

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:33.330 
let's try emajor as that won't work
really

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:33.340 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.280 

in<00:07:33.700> Minto<00:07:35.280> so<00:07:36.280> now<00:07:36.670> you<00:07:36.730> have<00:07:37.090> a<00:07:37.360> demonstration

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.290 
in Minto so now you have a demonstration

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.190 
in Minto so now you have a demonstration
of<00:07:38.680> this<00:07:39.130> nice<00:07:39.790> feature<00:07:40.240> of<00:07:40.450> ground<00:07:40.930> org

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:41.200
