00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
all right so that pack was not great for

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.780 
all right so that pack was not great for
us<00:00:03.080> we're<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.110> little<00:00:04.680> low<00:00:04.890> on<00:00:04.920> creatures<00:00:05.640> at

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
us we're a little low on creatures at

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.829 
us we're a little low on creatures at
this<00:00:05.910> point<00:00:06.150> so<00:00:06.299> we<00:00:06.420> want<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.600> prioritize

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
this point so we want to prioritize

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.089 
this point so we want to prioritize
taking<00:00:07.560> creatures<00:00:07.980> over<00:00:08.280> anything<00:00:08.490> else

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:10.099 
taking creatures over anything else

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.560 
taking creatures over anything else
unfortunately<00:00:11.099> looking<00:00:11.370> at<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.550> pack<00:00:11.929> I

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
unfortunately looking at this pack I

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.429 
unfortunately looking at this pack I
think<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.230> take<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.100> corrupt<00:00:17.520> I

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
think we have to take the corrupt I

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.650 
think we have to take the corrupt I
don't<00:00:19.439> think<00:00:19.619> there's<00:00:19.800> actually<00:00:20.160> any<00:00:20.660> any

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
don't think there's actually any any

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.870 
don't think there's actually any any
other<00:00:21.869> valid<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.439> lightning<00:00:23.039> bolt<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.789> know

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
other valid a lightning bolt is you know

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.750 
other valid a lightning bolt is you know
fine<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:25.220> we<00:00:26.220> don't<00:00:26.340> have<00:00:26.369> any<00:00:26.490> fixing<00:00:26.970> yet<00:00:27.650> so

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
fine but we don't have any fixing yet so

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.310 
fine but we don't have any fixing yet so
playing<00:00:29.760> multiple<00:00:30.300> red<00:00:30.510> cards<00:00:30.869> probably<00:00:31.199> not

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
playing multiple red cards probably not

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.280 
playing multiple red cards probably not
what<00:00:31.500> we're<00:00:31.650> looking<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.949> do<00:00:33.050> you<00:00:34.050> know<00:00:34.140> we

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
what we're looking to do you know we

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.840 
what we're looking to do you know we
look<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.649> actually<00:00:34.950> heavier<00:00:35.309> black<00:00:35.550> than<00:00:35.760> I

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
look to be actually heavier black than I

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.030 
look to be actually heavier black than I
had<00:00:35.940> originally<00:00:36.000> thought<00:00:36.800> we're<00:00:37.800> certainly

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
had originally thought we're certainly

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.500 
had originally thought we're certainly
going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.309> heavy<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.550> two<00:00:38.730> colors<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
going to be heavy in two colors but I

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.299 
going to be heavy in two colors but I
think<00:00:39.719> that's<00:00:39.870> okay<00:00:40.140> corrupt<00:00:40.620> even<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.070> three

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
think that's okay corrupt even for three

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.060 
think that's okay corrupt even for three
or<00:00:41.399> four<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.790> usually<00:00:42.090> pretty<00:00:42.239> good<00:00:45.620> ok<00:00:46.620> we

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
or four is usually pretty good ok we

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.819 
or four is usually pretty good ok we
have<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.430> bomb<00:00:48.210> white<00:00:48.809> flyer<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:52.260> know<00:00:52.440> deck<00:00:52.649> if

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
have a bomb white flyer you know deck if

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.020 
have a bomb white flyer you know deck if
we<00:00:52.949> had<00:00:53.070> gone<00:00:53.190> white<00:00:53.430> would<00:00:53.640> probably<00:00:53.670> have

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
we had gone white would probably have

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.740 
we had gone white would probably have
ended<00:00:54.210> up<00:00:54.329> pretty<00:00:54.570> good<00:00:54.690> oh<00:00:55.520> well<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:57.000> think<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
ended up pretty good oh well I think the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.930 
ended up pretty good oh well I think the
specter<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.620> definitely<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.460> pic<00:00:59.640> and

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
specter here is definitely the pic and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.330 
specter here is definitely the pic and
just<00:01:00.809> hope<00:01:00.989> we<00:01:01.109> don't<00:01:01.260> run<00:01:01.320> into<00:01:01.469> ventral<00:01:02.160> arc

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
just hope we don't run into ventral arc

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.399 
just hope we don't run into ventral arc
on<00:01:06.650> Derek's<00:01:07.650> pack<00:01:08.040> leader<00:01:08.600> drawing<00:01:09.600> cards<00:01:10.170> is

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
on Derek's pack leader drawing cards is

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.370 
on Derek's pack leader drawing cards is
always<00:01:11.070> very<00:01:11.400> good<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.689> right<00:01:12.840> now<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.080> have

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
always very good and right now we have

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.630 
always very good and right now we have
one<00:01:13.619> two<00:01:13.860> three<00:01:15.530> four<00:01:16.530> creatures<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.280> set<00:01:17.549> it

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
one two three four creatures that set it

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.050 
one two three four creatures that set it
off<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.979> other<00:01:20.250> option<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.759> land<00:01:20.970> or

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
off the other option here is land or

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.080 
off the other option here is land or
elves<00:01:21.380> but<00:01:22.380> i<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.430> pack<00:01:23.640> leader<00:01:23.670> in

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
elves but i think the pack leader in

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.580 
elves but i think the pack leader in
general<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.659> going<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.990> more

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
general is just going to be a more

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
general is just going to be a more
valuable<00:01:29.240> cultivate<00:01:30.240> no<00:01:30.990> doubt

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
which could actually be very good in our

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.420 
which could actually be very good in our
deck<00:02:02.080> allowing<00:02:02.500> us<00:02:02.620> to<00:02:02.650> swing<00:02:02.979> through<00:02:03.280> with

question bear fine No alright so our

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:09.140 
question bear fine No alright so our
deck<00:04:04.079> is<00:04:06.110> strong<00:04:07.110> on<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.349> top<00:04:07.530> end<00:04:07.849> if<00:04:08.849> we<00:04:09.030> can

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
deck is strong on the top end if we can

deck is strong on the top end if we can
get<00:04:09.209> there<00:04:09.709> so<00:04:11.299> let's<00:04:12.299> take<00:04:12.599> a<00:04:12.660> look<00:04:12.930> at<00:04:13.049> how

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
get there so let's take a look at how

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:22.250 
get there so let's take a look at how
this<00:04:13.290> builds<00:04:20.329> so<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.389> start<00:04:21.510> off<00:04:21.750> with<00:04:22.019> will

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
this builds so to start off with will

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:46.550 
this builds so to start off with will
play<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:23.820> following<00:04:24.510> car

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.510 

alright<00:04:47.280> so<00:04:47.490> that's<00:04:47.820> 24<00:04:48.510> and<00:04:48.720> even<00:04:48.990> split<00:04:49.520> our

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
alright so that's 24 and even split our

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.720 
alright so that's 24 and even split our
mana<00:04:50.730> is<00:04:50.850> not<00:04:50.970> going<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.120> be<00:04:51.210> great<00:04:52.700> what<00:04:53.700> can

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
mana is not going to be great what can

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:10.159 
mana is not going to be great what can
you<00:04:54.060> do

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.019 

I<00:05:10.229> mean<00:05:10.889> that<00:05:11.039> the<00:05:11.249> tutor<00:05:11.550> could<00:05:11.699> certainly

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:12.029 
I mean that the tutor could certainly

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:14.659 
I mean that the tutor could certainly
come<00:05:12.150> out<00:05:12.529> but<00:05:13.529> we<00:05:13.680> do<00:05:13.860> have<00:05:14.069> some<00:05:14.400> interesting

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
come out but we do have some interesting

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.709 
come out but we do have some interesting
targets<00:05:16.430> tutoring<00:05:17.430> for<00:05:17.610> Rhys<00:05:17.909> corrupt<00:05:18.449> or

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
targets tutoring for Rhys corrupt or

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:27.640 
targets tutoring for Rhys corrupt or
Garrick<00:05:19.289> is<00:05:19.580> probably<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:20.699> pretty<00:05:20.909> good<00:05:21.629> idea

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:41.780 

so<00:05:28.650> we<00:05:28.740> gotta<00:05:28.890> cut<00:05:29.160> a<00:05:29.340> card<00:05:29.790> here<00:05:30.710> up<00:05:31.710> yep

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.540 

I<00:05:41.880> think<00:05:42.570> at<00:05:42.660> this<00:05:42.720> point<00:05:42.810> I'm<00:05:43.140> not<00:05:44.040> going<00:05:44.460> to

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
I think at this point I'm not going to

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.280 
I think at this point I'm not going to
splash<00:05:44.820> for<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.120> pyroclasm<00:05:45.540> although<00:05:46.020> I<00:05:46.050> am

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
splash for the pyroclasm although I am

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.960 
splash for the pyroclasm although I am
certainly<00:05:47.130> going<00:05:47.220> to<00:05:47.310> keep<00:05:47.460> it<00:05:47.520> in<00:05:47.640> mind<00:05:47.820> as<00:05:47.940> a

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
certainly going to keep it in mind as a

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.510 
certainly going to keep it in mind as a
sideboard<00:05:48.390> card<00:05:48.660> because<00:05:49.200> we<00:05:50.070> do<00:05:50.220> only<00:05:50.370> have

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
sideboard card because we do only have

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.930 
sideboard card because we do only have
one<00:05:50.820> fixer<00:05:51.420> to<00:05:52.020> cultivate<00:05:52.550> but<00:05:53.550> against<00:05:53.760> like

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
one fixer to cultivate but against like

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.180 
one fixer to cultivate but against like
you<00:05:54.090> know<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.300> white<00:05:54.450> Flyers<00:05:54.780> deck<00:05:55.190> pretty

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
you know the white Flyers deck pretty

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:04.160 
you know the white Flyers deck pretty
good<00:05:57.410> so<00:05:58.820> I<00:06:00.770> think<00:06:02.210> if<00:06:03.210> i<00:06:03.390> didn't<00:06:03.630> have<00:06:03.690> Garak<00:06:04.080> i

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
good so I think if i didn't have Garak i

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.270 
good so I think if i didn't have Garak i
would<00:06:04.290> not<00:06:04.380> even<00:06:04.500> consider<00:06:04.650> playing<00:06:05.130> the

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
would not even consider playing the

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.100 
would not even consider playing the
diabolic<00:06:05.640> tutor<00:06:05.820> so<00:06:06.060> possibly<00:06:06.690> it's<00:06:06.900> just

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
diabolic tutor so possibly it's just

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.970 
diabolic tutor so possibly it's just
correct<00:06:07.380> to<00:06:07.470> cut<00:06:07.650> that<00:06:09.410> then<00:06:10.410> again<00:06:10.650> I<00:06:10.680> mean

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
correct to cut that then again I mean

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.670 
correct to cut that then again I mean
it's<00:06:11.730> really<00:06:12.180> hard<00:06:12.570> to<00:06:12.840> beat<00:06:13.020> Derek<00:06:13.440> and

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
it's really hard to beat Derek and

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.330 
it's really hard to beat Derek and
limited<00:06:14.340> and<00:06:15.290> even<00:06:16.290> if<00:06:16.380> it's<00:06:16.560> a<00:06:16.650> slow<00:06:16.950> Garak

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
limited and even if it's a slow Garak

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.840 
limited and even if it's a slow Garak
you<00:06:17.640> know<00:06:17.930> over<00:06:18.930> two<00:06:19.080> turns<00:06:19.520> it's<00:06:20.520> still<00:06:20.820> a

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
you know over two turns it's still a

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.680 
you know over two turns it's still a
planeswalker<00:06:21.920> I<00:06:23.030> kind<00:06:24.030> of<00:06:24.060> like<00:06:24.240> having<00:06:24.450> the

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
planeswalker I kind of like having the

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.170 
planeswalker I kind of like having the
tutor<00:06:24.960> in<00:06:25.080> here<00:06:25.340> so<00:06:26.340> if<00:06:26.580> we're<00:06:26.790> not<00:06:26.880> going<00:06:27.090> to

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
tutor in here so if we're not going to

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:36.500 
tutor in here so if we're not going to
cut<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:27.450> tutor<00:06:27.860> the<00:06:28.860> options<00:06:29.280> i<00:06:29.580> see<00:06:29.940> are<00:06:35.510> the

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
cut the tutor the options i see are the

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.710 
cut the tutor the options i see are the
sign<00:06:36.780> in<00:06:36.930> blood<00:06:37.050> of<00:06:37.260> the<00:06:37.350> giant<00:06:37.740> growth<00:06:37.980> I

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
sign in blood of the giant growth I

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.530 
sign in blood of the giant growth I
don't<00:06:39.720> think<00:06:39.780> you<00:06:40.020> can<00:06:40.140> reasonably<00:06:40.620> cut<00:06:41.540> you

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
don't think you can reasonably cut you

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.240 
don't think you can reasonably cut you

or<00:06:47.270> so<00:06:48.270> let's<00:06:48.750> see<00:06:49.290> I<00:06:49.560> think

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.830 

let's<00:06:53.610> go<00:06:53.729> ahead<00:06:53.789> and<00:06:53.879> add<00:06:54.030> land<00:06:54.360> while<00:06:54.659> we're

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
let's go ahead and add land while we're

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.510 
let's go ahead and add land while we're
making<00:06:54.870> up<00:06:55.199> our<00:06:55.349> mind<00:06:55.620> we<00:06:56.159> want<00:06:56.340> to<00:06:56.400> go<00:06:56.490> a

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
making up our mind we want to go a

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.149 
making up our mind we want to go a
little<00:06:57.030> bit<00:06:57.419> heavier<00:06:57.719> on<00:06:57.870> the<00:06:58.020> black<00:06:58.620> than<00:06:59.069> the

00:06:59.149 --> 00:06:59.159 
little bit heavier on the black than the

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:02.269 
little bit heavier on the black than the
green<00:06:59.430> so<00:07:00.030> it<00:07:00.060> should<00:07:00.330> be<00:07:00.379> a<00:07:01.379> total<00:07:02.129> of<00:07:02.189> nine

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:02.279 
green so it should be a total of nine

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:10.399 
green so it should be a total of nine
eight<00:07:06.289> so<00:07:07.289> the<00:07:07.740> card<00:07:08.039> that<00:07:08.129> gets<00:07:08.729> cut<00:07:09.060> is<00:07:09.409> gonna

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:10.409 
eight so the card that gets cut is gonna

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:19.430 
eight so the card that gets cut is gonna
be

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.810 

I'm<00:07:20.440> gonna<00:07:20.590> cut<00:07:20.740> the<00:07:20.830> giant<00:07:21.130> growth<00:07:21.280> I<00:07:21.520> think

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:21.820 
I'm gonna cut the giant growth I think

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.659 
I'm gonna cut the giant growth I think
that<00:07:21.880> you<00:07:22.510> know<00:07:22.600> it's<00:07:22.750> not<00:07:22.870> necessarily

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:23.669 
that you know it's not necessarily

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:27.870 
that you know it's not necessarily
necessary<00:07:24.669> in<00:07:24.850> the<00:07:24.940> deck<00:07:25.680> all<00:07:26.680> right<00:07:26.830> so<00:07:27.010> there

necessary in the deck all right so there

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.689 
necessary in the deck all right so there
