and just try and make sure I got the
whole<00:04:35.870> thing<00:04:35.900> cook<00:04:36.440> coded<00:04:37.340> here<00:04:37.520> before<00:04:37.760> I

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
whole thing cook coded here before I

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:45.220 
whole thing cook coded here before I
hang<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.120> up<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.390> let<00:04:38.540> it<00:04:38.660> go<00:04:39.730> but<00:04:44.020> yeah<00:04:45.020> this

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
hang it up and let it go but yeah this

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.360 
hang it up and let it go but yeah this
is<00:04:45.410> a<00:04:46.780> great<00:04:47.780> way<00:04:47.960> if<00:04:47.990> you're<00:04:48.380> just<00:04:48.410> uh<00:04:48.770> you

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
is a great way if you're just uh you

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.830 
is a great way if you're just uh you
know<00:04:49.460> I'm<00:04:49.580> gonna<00:04:49.760> be<00:04:50.090> painting<00:04:50.450> a<00:04:50.540> couple

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
know I'm gonna be painting a couple

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.290 
know I'm gonna be painting a couple
dates<00:04:50.990> for<00:04:51.230> yourself<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:51.740> know<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:52.240> epoxy<00:04:53.240> is

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
dates for yourself you know the epoxy is

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.740 
dates for yourself you know the epoxy is
a<00:04:53.390> great<00:04:53.600> way<00:04:53.780> to<00:04:54.070> get<00:04:55.070> your<00:04:55.190> baits<00:04:55.460> coated<00:04:55.940> and

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
a great way to get your baits coated and

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.280 
a great way to get your baits coated and
get<00:04:56.990> them<00:04:57.080> protected<00:04:59.320> so<00:05:00.320> I<00:05:01.840> think<00:05:02.840> that's

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
get them protected so I think that's

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:13.060 
get them protected so I think that's
pretty<00:05:03.590> good<00:05:04.630> a<00:05:10.090> little<00:05:11.090> bit<00:05:11.240> down<00:05:11.480> here<00:05:12.110> and

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
pretty good a little bit down here and

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.860 
pretty good a little bit down here and
then<00:05:13.430> after<00:05:13.760> you're<00:05:13.910> done<00:05:14.120> make<00:05:14.450> sure<00:05:14.480> you

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
then after you're done make sure you

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.010 
then after you're done make sure you
don't<00:05:15.200> close<00:05:16.010> your<00:05:16.250> vise<00:05:16.490> grip<00:05:16.910> if<00:05:17.240> you<00:05:17.720> still

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
don't close your vise grip if you still

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.840 
don't close your vise grip if you still
have<00:05:18.200> a<00:05:18.260> little<00:05:18.530> epoxy<00:05:18.950> left<00:05:19.340> on<00:05:19.580> it<00:05:19.700> you're

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
have a little epoxy left on it you're

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.520 
have a little epoxy left on it you're
gonna<00:05:19.940> be<00:05:20.180> fighting<00:05:20.660> to<00:05:20.750> get<00:05:20.900> it<00:05:20.990> open<00:05:21.320> again

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
gonna be fighting to get it open again

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.510 
gonna be fighting to get it open again
like<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:21.920> did<00:05:22.190> before<00:05:22.340> I<00:05:22.520> started<00:05:23.060> this<00:05:23.180> video

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
like I did before I started this video

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.540 
like I did before I started this video
so<00:05:26.500> there<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.710> I<00:05:27.800> think<00:05:27.860> we'll<00:05:28.130> call<00:05:28.370> that

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
so there and I think we'll call that

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.600 
so there and I think we'll call that
good<00:05:28.960> and<00:05:29.960> then<00:05:30.230> just<00:05:30.530> I<00:05:32.620> got<00:05:33.620> a<00:05:33.650> piece<00:05:34.340> of<00:05:34.460> wire

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
good and then just I got a piece of wire

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.090 
good and then just I got a piece of wire
already<00:05:35.090> bent<00:05:35.330> and<00:05:35.540> ready<00:05:35.720> to<00:05:35.930> go<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:36.980> I'll

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
already bent and ready to go and I'll

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.650 
already bent and ready to go and I'll
just<00:05:37.280> hang<00:05:37.520> it<00:05:37.670> up<00:05:37.790> and<00:05:38.350> we'll<00:05:39.350> let<00:05:39.500> it<00:05:39.560> dry<00:05:40.660> all

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
just hang it up and we'll let it dry all

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.960 
just hang it up and we'll let it dry all
right<00:05:41.810> so<00:05:41.990> I<00:05:42.020> got<00:05:42.260> our<00:05:42.860> bait<00:05:43.070> here<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.400> 2.5

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
right so I got our bait here the 2.5

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.210 
right so I got our bait here the 2.5
