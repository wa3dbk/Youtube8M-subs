00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.480
 every person as they are is because I am 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.550
 very well today I bring you the review 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.910
 of a very good book in English world war 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.320
 world war z of max brooks in the 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.000
 part was very curious about the 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.509
 that was going to treat the movie that is going to 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.340
 to release in two days that stars brad 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.750
 pitt then I started to read it what 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.530
 finish and the truth is that it is a book 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.550
 very very good has 475 pages this 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.210
 edition that I have that is that of 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.649
 box per narrative package cost me 225 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.800
 weights there is a more expensive edition I think 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.510
 It costs 300 and 400 pesos. I do not remember very 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.769
 well and the truth that I write is very 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.460
 well this book tells us 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.680
 chronologically how it was happening 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.559
 this world war zo this epidemic 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.239
 zombie how are patient generated 0 and how 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.070
 it was spreading little by little all over 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.449
 the world and how it almost brings us to the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.899
 gay union mankind is destroyed 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.280
 then wow came to us if I do not go out to 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.560
 all because you know this from the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.560
 beginning because he says start commenting 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.500
 Our interviewer gives his opinion 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.179
 about world war z and you give yourself 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.740
 realize that if it survives the 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.720
 humanity but we are that it takes us to 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.880
 and like 30 percent of the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.240
 population that had before then 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.490
 was very intense this book has something 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.700
 very special that is that 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.649
 there are many, many, many interviews 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.990
 different people from so many parts of the 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.240
 world then you see how the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.020
 Chinese epidemic and then as if it was USA 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.119
 to Brazil to New Zealand to Mexico 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.310
 russia then it is very very interesting 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.380
 the different points of view of the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.840
 different types of culture that there are in 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.420
 I recommend this book a lot in 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.000
 you see views of doctors from 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.990
 pilots publicists of the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.720
 Army housewives a granny 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.000
 of like a buddha or something like that and something weird 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.160
 in Japan then it is very very good 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.420
 I highly recommend the goal of a 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.830
 opportunity before they go to see the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.959
 movie because I feel that the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.850
 movie can not resemble anything at 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.690
 book I do not think beijing to interview 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.000
 a lot of little things and little woman yes 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.380
 doctor yes I do pilotillos and they put it 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.660
 in the cinema then I think it's going to be 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.569
 very different the book in the movie in 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.370
 the truth is I'm excited yes because 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.080
 all that zombie theme of the walking 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.510
 dead are villani I am a legend I like 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.950
 much then is this opportunity this 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.050
 book is a very good 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.790
 I put four of five stars 53 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.250
 because I liked it a lot but not on the edge 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.920
 to make him a son max brooks then 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.470

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.209
