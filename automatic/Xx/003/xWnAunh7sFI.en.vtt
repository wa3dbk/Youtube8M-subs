00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
before I cover it up and any water that

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.060 
before I cover it up and any water that
gets<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:01.090> be<00:01:01.210> too<00:01:01.239> high<00:01:01.600> in<00:01:01.780> there<00:01:01.989> flows<00:01:02.800> out

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
gets to be too high in there flows out

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.240 
gets to be too high in there flows out
it's<00:01:03.520> an<00:01:03.640> easy<00:01:03.820> one<00:01:04.119> and<00:01:04.329> also<00:01:04.950> if<00:01:05.950> you're

going to move it around there's some
casters<00:01:08.289> on<00:01:08.500> it<00:01:08.680> these<00:01:08.829> little<00:01:09.130> casters<00:01:09.579> go<00:01:09.790> on

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
casters on it these little casters go on

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.490 
casters on it these little casters go on
the<00:01:10.090> bottom<00:01:10.420> of<00:01:10.570> it<00:01:10.659> make<00:01:10.869> it<00:01:11.020> easy<00:01:11.200> to<00:01:11.380> move

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
the bottom of it make it easy to move

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.530 
the bottom of it make it easy to move
around<00:01:11.619> once<00:01:12.070> it's<00:01:12.280> filled<00:01:12.820> or<00:01:13.119> got<00:01:13.270> stuff

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
around once it's filled or got stuff

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.750 
around once it's filled or got stuff
growing<00:01:13.810> in<00:01:14.020> it<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.380> lights<00:01:14.590> moving<00:01:14.979> then

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
growing in it and the lights moving then

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.810 
growing in it and the lights moving then
this<00:01:16.479> goes<00:01:16.810> on<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.200> bottom<00:01:17.350> this<00:01:18.070> right<00:01:18.340> here

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
this goes on the bottom this right here

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.109 
this goes on the bottom this right here
is<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.210> way<00:01:19.690> that<00:01:20.380> we<00:01:20.590> keep<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:21.070> soil<00:01:21.369> out<00:01:21.850> of

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
is the way that we keep the soil out of

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.080 
is the way that we keep the soil out of
the<00:01:22.240> water<00:01:22.450> so<00:01:22.990> this<00:01:23.560> goes<00:01:23.830> on<00:01:24.040> nice<00:01:24.430> and<00:01:24.460> snug

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
the water so this goes on nice and snug

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.330 
the water so this goes on nice and snug
in<00:01:25.450> there<00:01:25.720> but<00:01:26.229> it's<00:01:26.380> a<00:01:26.470> few<00:01:26.680> inches<00:01:26.860> above<00:01:27.189> the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
in there but it's a few inches above the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.429 
in there but it's a few inches above the
bottom<00:01:27.670> so<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.240> plants<00:01:28.630> are<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.960> soil<00:01:29.170> isn't

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
bottom so the plants are the soil isn't

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.039 
bottom so the plants are the soil isn't
really<00:01:29.799> sitting<00:01:30.159> there<00:01:30.369> although<00:01:31.180> we<00:01:31.840> will

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
really sitting there although we will

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.140 
really sitting there although we will
add<00:01:32.260> some<00:01:32.290> soil<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.250> sides<00:01:33.520> to<00:01:33.939> help

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
add some soil to the sides to help

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.420 
add some soil to the sides to help
siphon<00:01:34.869> it<00:01:34.990> up<00:01:35.170> now<00:01:35.740> one<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.159> other<00:01:36.310> things

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
siphon it up now one of the other things

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.230 
siphon it up now one of the other things
is<00:01:37.000> you<00:01:37.240> water<00:01:37.750> from<00:01:38.140> above<00:01:38.290> and<00:01:38.860> so<00:01:39.549> you<00:01:40.000> take

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
is you water from above and so you take

and<00:01:46.509> so<00:01:47.020> that<00:01:47.409> makes<00:01:47.619> it<00:01:47.710> easy<00:01:47.890> one<00:01:48.640> of<00:01:48.759> the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
and so that makes it easy one of the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.969 
and so that makes it easy one of the
other<00:01:49.000> things<00:01:49.150> is<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:49.810> need<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.229> good<00:01:50.560> potting

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
other things is you need a good potting

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.760 
other things is you need a good potting
soil<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:51.790> so<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:52.659> mix<00:01:53.049> this<00:01:53.229> one<00:01:53.439> up<00:01:53.560> myself

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
soil and so I mix this one up myself

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.569 
soil and so I mix this one up myself
this<00:01:54.670> is<00:01:54.880> some<00:01:55.060> compost<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:56.070> some<00:01:57.070> perlite

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
this is some compost and some perlite

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.850 
this is some compost and some perlite
and<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:58.030> little<00:01:58.240> bit<00:01:58.360> of<00:01:58.390> vermiculite<00:01:58.869> and<00:01:59.049> the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
and a little bit of vermiculite and the

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.980 
and a little bit of vermiculite and the
product<00:02:00.220> called<00:02:00.430> coir<00:02:00.700> fiber<00:02:01.000> now<00:02:01.689> this<00:02:01.930> is

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
product called coir fiber now this is

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.560 
product called coir fiber now this is
the<00:02:02.140> husk<00:02:02.500> from<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:02.950> coconuts<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.790> it's<00:02:04.360> a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
the husk from the coconuts and it's a

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.539 
the husk from the coconuts and it's a
peat<00:02:05.049> moss<00:02:05.200> replacement<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.009> like<00:02:06.189> it<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.399> whole

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
peat moss replacement I like it a whole

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.490 
peat moss replacement I like it a whole
lot<00:02:06.579> it's<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:06.909> very<00:02:07.119> sustainable<00:02:07.390> product<00:02:08.319> and

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
lot it's a very sustainable product and

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.089 
lot it's a very sustainable product and
so<00:02:09.069> this<00:02:09.909> is<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.119> real<00:02:10.479> nice<00:02:10.869> light<00:02:11.349> mix<00:02:11.769> and

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
so this is a real nice light mix and

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.920 
so this is a real nice light mix and
that's<00:02:12.430> what<00:02:12.579> goes<00:02:12.730> into<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.150> corners<00:02:13.659> first

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
that's what goes into the corners first

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.890 
that's what goes into the corners first
so<00:02:14.529> that<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.919> water<00:02:15.069> is<00:02:15.279> siphoned<00:02:15.999> up<00:02:16.239> into

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
so that the water is siphoned up into

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.130 
so that the water is siphoned up into
the<00:02:17.019> growing<00:02:17.260> medium

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
the growing medium

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.140 
the growing medium
and<00:02:18.260> that's<00:02:18.740> what<00:02:18.950> makes<00:02:19.160> this<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:19.610> darn<00:02:19.850> neat

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
and that's what makes this so darn neat

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.780 
and that's what makes this so darn neat
it's<00:02:20.390> easy<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.080> water<00:02:21.290> it's<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.980> limited<00:02:22.190> space

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
it's easy to water it's a limited space

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.990 
it's easy to water it's a limited space
and<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.510> can<00:02:23.660> go<00:02:23.840> in<00:02:24.110> front<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.530> window<00:02:25.000> and

what we'll do is we'll cut some little
squares<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:09.650> keeps<00:03:10.190> it<00:03:10.340> from<00:03:10.489> evaporating

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
squares that keeps it from evaporating

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.330 
squares that keeps it from evaporating
too<00:03:11.420> quickly<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:12.050> then<00:03:12.410> we<00:03:12.590> put<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:12.890> plants

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
too quickly and then we put the plants

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.970 
too quickly and then we put the plants
in<00:03:13.550> those<00:03:13.730> little<00:03:13.970> squares<00:03:14.360> for<00:03:15.110> example<00:03:15.680> in

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
in those little squares for example in

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.590 
in those little squares for example in
the<00:03:16.130> cool<00:03:16.340> months<00:03:16.760> we<00:03:16.940> might<00:03:17.180> grow<00:03:17.390> some

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
the cool months we might grow some

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.410 
the cool months we might grow some
cabbage<00:03:18.050> well<00:03:18.560> we'll<00:03:18.920> be<00:03:19.070> able<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.550> put<00:03:19.760> six

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
cabbage well we'll be able to put six

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.360 
cabbage well we'll be able to put six
big<00:03:20.810> old<00:03:21.019> cabbage<00:03:21.410> in<00:03:21.590> here<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:21.830> mean<00:03:22.010> this<00:03:22.160> is<00:03:22.220> a

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
big old cabbage in here I mean this is a

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.250 
big old cabbage in here I mean this is a
nice<00:03:22.610> container<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.239> grow<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.540> much<00:03:23.810> cabbage

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
nice container to grow that much cabbage

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.410 
nice container to grow that much cabbage
so<00:03:24.470> you'll<00:03:24.890> have<00:03:25.160> three<00:03:25.519> across<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:26.150> front

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
so you'll have three across the front

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.630 
so you'll have three across the front
and<00:03:26.690> three<00:03:26.780> across<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.410> back<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.890> we'll<00:03:28.430> grow

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
and three across the back and we'll grow

you can put ten plants in there of

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.390

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
rather easily so you need a whole bunch

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.860 
rather easily so you need a whole bunch
of<00:04:00.890> them<00:04:01.040> so<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.489> would<00:04:01.700> put<00:04:01.940> ten<00:04:02.209> plants<00:04:02.540> of
