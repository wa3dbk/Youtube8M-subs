00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.630
 immediately at the beginning 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.660
 read the chat what the allies write and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.470
 opponents write what pink what 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:37.500
 tupit a little something that they play poorly 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.600
 our hero goes to the water well, you can say 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.550
 not on the water on the shelf which is above water 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.550

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:56.150
 abruptly begins to capture our base as 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.040
 you can see what swam across 5 5 this 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.050
 because i x2 included kinda well there 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.630
 one opponent only stands on base 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.800
 don't capture like our our player sees that 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.960
 that all our allies are stuck not playing 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.740
 hang and decides to check what is there with 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.420
 opponents are going to go through the water 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.100
 to the opponents I will accelerate here a little bit 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.290
 Everywhere here Jagdpanther on her throws 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.570

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.150
 walks behind the stone and continues to rise 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.820

 blind shot a little bit did not hit 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.630
 keep moving up the hill to 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.610
 to the enemy 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.080
 thinking what is it for now because 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.780
 only three were loaded 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.670
 Yurovskih enemy until we see for 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.070

 throws on e75 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.520
 look at the number of shells he has 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.790

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.720

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.230
 here he does not pierce the and kashin e 50 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.150
 starts shooting at baku her 4 then you 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.630
 You see that it would be better to shoot for ebe 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.700
 10 nakidu stupid fourth trying 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:03:00.170

 7 who came here also realized that 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.190

 remaining allies begin to ram 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.120
 laura 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:09.200
 40 tons of our 7, too, here is not bad 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:13.030

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.030

 are 70 kb opponents writes that cool 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:31.700
 on and our player is hesitant for 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:34.540
 more heavily ramming already 704 and just 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:40.490
 stands and looks like is-7 parses it 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:43.190
 standing here is such an interesting fight well 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.430
 how interesting and just this happens alone 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:49.870
 a battle for 10,000 may even have many such 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:52.640
 and it was not yet late I will show 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.979
 In general, the results of this battle by experience 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:59.020
 how many nadamashie allies and 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:07:02.479
 opponents here are the results of the battle 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.940
 We look at the personal result of this 196 thousand 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:07.580

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:13.190
 sniper team result by experience we 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.620
 in the first place is still very damaging 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.660
 okay sevens affairs too 6 frags 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.810
 but since we have more experience we 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:23.120
 we get a warrior they seven 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.530

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:37.780
 44 struck if our player 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:41.379
 with the nickname the king of the bottom would not shoot 

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:43.449
 so waste shells blindly and not 

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:46.150
 punched there several luxurious tanks 

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:48.610
 then there would be a result 

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.939
