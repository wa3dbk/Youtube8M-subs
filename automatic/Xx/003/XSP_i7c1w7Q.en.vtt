 past you learned how to make a 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:34.620
 muddy and minty but super dessert 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.280
 refreshing, easy and logical 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.100
 do 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.800
 we are now in this field of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.280
 sweet and again with the chef 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.710
 daniel tessari the confectioner né ie 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.210
 sweet logic here in our program 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.089
 This time we 'll teach you 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.089
 home make a danny pie but it is 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.579
 commonly known as the right applications 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.609
 strawberry is easy to make too much 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.379
 easy to do has no secret not the person 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.569
 can do for example saw weed 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.120
 can make the own danoninho without the 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:08.670
 rotten pasta underneath also serve as 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.260
 in houses like we did it is clay at 0 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.299
 now we stayed a little bit about anyway 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.890
 without any basis , but with certainty and 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.260
 as pie also as an afternoon coffee 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.150
 very good, it was cool 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.160
 ah ah now we will pass the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.350
 ingredients the amount that people 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.160
 will go to serve for a pie for 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.810
 a whole door that is the engine of a 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.720
 diameter of 20 centimeters 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.420
 people, let's go there and write down the ingredients 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.670
 We need to start with a filling 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.540
 after the mass for the ingredients 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.730
 north 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.300
 for the filling you will need a 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:45.180
 pack of strawberry tang juice a can 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.120
 of condensed milk a unit of 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.930
 natural august and two cans of 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.470
 milk 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:57.450
 mass will require 125 grams of 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:01.710
 sugar 125 grams of butter 250 grams 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.490
 of wheat and an egg to decorate fruits 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.680
 reds 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.920
 the first so let's start by doing the 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.489
 Mass is not for us, but we need not only 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.489
 of sugar 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:19.950
 wheat and butter cold butter right 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.620
 not at room temperature 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:30.209
 done it then the fingertips we 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:32.430
 Let's make a farofa botton already arrived 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.780
 there is not what we wanted the team to do 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.280
 a farofa né 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.280
 so I think I'll add the egg 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.670
 done that we will usually mix 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.250
 that our mass is homogeneous 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.110
 You can see that she is not elastic. 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.610
 then this one every time we want 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.620
 that she has because she so that she 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.750
 a crunchy and brittle dough 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.610
 then our march rested 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.190
 for five minutes now we have a 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.269
 new shape of 20cm deep 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.730
 false 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.280
 Let's focus, it's pretty easy to do. 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.550
 we made a roll make the first 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.519
 sides 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:18.079
 and automatically the mass that rises 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.079
 people are going to make you stay at the base 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.180
 as I said before 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.850
 It was this base here, then we 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.519
 will add the dough on top 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.010
 were also our background, right? 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.880
 automatically 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.880
 there will be no amendment 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.109
 then our dough is lined a 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.630
 legal tip before taking the profane mass is 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.950
 with fork drill for you to create 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.750
 underneath the mass né 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.640
 sometimes it greenhouse because it 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.760
 has so far here will automatically go 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.519
 be all the mass 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.569
 the button of ours but is ready to people 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:58.180
 will take to the oven 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.180
 the bottom is 460 degrees 20 minutes 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.760
 after 20 minutes and then we go to a 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.760
 day our mass 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:21.330
 She's good, she's at the point, she's not golden. 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:22.920
 on the sides and white with 10 8 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.280
 while our dough in front goes 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:32.100
 make the filling I find it super simple it's just 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:44.250
 add all ingredients and 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:49.260
 mix with the flu and finally let's go 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:53.030
 believe in our thang long done it 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.030
 so let's not mix with our was 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.030
 Good here has no secret automatically 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.580
 it's ready, it 's just really mixing 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.590
 all ingredients developing well 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.740
 I'm not guinea 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.020
 she just rejects ready done that good 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.140
 so we will add in our 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.320
 our base you can see that it 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:21.040
 already wanted more consistency 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.040
 homogeneous but firm né 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.940
 the crisis will take five minutes in the 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.320
 refrigerator then let's decorate assemble 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.080
 Our niece is already cold to us. 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.430
 will finish just right for decorating 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.430
 strawberries cut in alex 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:52.730
 the ok button we're with our 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.620
 season is not fast and easy to do 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.860
 It's also a cool tip to follow 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.790
 a shampoo mc kinky season a woman 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.790
