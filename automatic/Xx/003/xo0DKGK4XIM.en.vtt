00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
the point system up there what's the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.720 
the point system up there what's the
purpose<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.590> suppose<00:02:26.070> there<00:02:26.610> could<00:02:26.640> be

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
purpose of it I suppose there could be

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.550 
purpose of it I suppose there could be
an<00:02:26.910> explanation<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.720> description<00:02:28.320> but

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
an explanation in the description but

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.560 
an explanation in the description but
the<00:02:28.739> hell<00:02:28.920> with<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.130> whoever<00:02:30.000> reads<00:02:30.300> those

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
the hell with that whoever reads those

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.140 
the hell with that whoever reads those
things<00:02:30.870> anyway<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.530> don't<00:02:32.220> have<00:02:32.430> time<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.880> read

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
things anyway I don't have time to read

about<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.480> game<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.959> just<00:02:34.080> got<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.590> play<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.100> over

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
about a game I just got to play it over

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.030 
about a game I just got to play it over
here<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.600> guess<00:02:37.050> what's<00:02:37.380> supposed<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:37.920> be

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
here is I guess what's supposed to be

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.729 
here is I guess what's supposed to be
some<00:02:38.280> sort<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.700> bakery<00:02:39.390> or<00:02:39.600> something<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.560> can

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
some sort of bakery or something you can

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.160 
some sort of bakery or something you can
get<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.130> but<00:02:41.520> there's<00:02:41.940> really<00:02:42.270> not<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.690> lot<00:02:42.810> to

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
get in but there's really not a lot to

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.530 
get in but there's really not a lot to
do<00:02:43.350> here<00:02:43.670> considering<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.910> can't<00:02:45.150> really

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
do here considering you can't really

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.840 
do here considering you can't really
take<00:02:45.900> any<00:02:46.110> food<00:02:46.470> anywhere<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.580> kind<00:02:47.790> of

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
take any food anywhere it's kind of

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.910 
take any food anywhere it's kind of
pointless<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:49.260> really<00:02:49.590> would<00:02:49.769> have<00:02:49.830> been

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
pointless and it really would have been

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.949 
pointless and it really would have been
cool<00:02:50.280> if<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.549> could<00:02:50.700> make<00:02:51.030> your<00:02:51.180> own<00:02:51.239> cake<00:02:51.690> or

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
cool if you could make your own cake or

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.800 
cool if you could make your own cake or
pastry<00:02:52.440> or<00:02:52.590> something<00:02:52.980> like<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.630> now<00:02:54.630> that

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
pastry or something like that now that

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.750 
pastry or something like that now that
would<00:02:54.989> be<00:02:55.019> fun<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.890> would<00:02:56.040> at<00:02:56.160> least<00:02:56.310> give<00:02:56.730> you

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
would be fun it would at least give you

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.780 
would be fun it would at least give you
some<00:02:56.910> reason<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.840> visit<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.230> place<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:59.549> you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
some reason to visit the place but you

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.180 
some reason to visit the place but you
