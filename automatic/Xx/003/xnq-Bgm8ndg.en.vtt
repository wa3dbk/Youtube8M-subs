00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.050 
five percent bubbling Spain down fifty
percent<00:02:12.680> but<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:12.890> think<00:02:13.130> nationally<00:02:13.640> we're

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
percent but I think nationally we're

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.640 
percent but I think nationally we're
over<00:02:14.209> valued<00:02:14.540> by<00:02:14.840> about<00:02:15.019> ten<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.530> fifteen

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
over valued by about ten to fifteen

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.650 
over valued by about ten to fifteen
percent<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:16.370> that's<00:02:16.580> that's<00:02:16.970> not<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.299> bubble

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
percent so that's that's not a bubble

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.180 
percent so that's that's not a bubble
I'd<00:02:17.780> use<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.110> analogy<00:02:18.319> of<00:02:18.590> an<00:02:18.799> overinflated

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
I'd use the analogy of an overinflated

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.460 
I'd use the analogy of an overinflated

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
but it's not going to pop but I've

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.670 
but it's not going to pop but I've
studied<00:02:23.269> bubbles<00:02:23.750> for<00:02:23.959> at<00:02:24.019> least<00:02:24.140> 30<00:02:24.410> years

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.840 
Peter and a couple of rules of thumb one
is<00:02:26.989> that<00:02:27.620> they're<00:02:27.920> always<00:02:28.100> obvious<00:02:28.700> with

is that they're always obvious with

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.400 
is that they're always obvious with
twenty-twenty<00:02:29.420> hindsight<00:02:29.450> once<00:02:30.079> it<00:02:30.230> pop

twenty-twenty hindsight once it pop

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.020 
twenty-twenty hindsight once it pop
everyone<00:02:31.010> says<00:02:31.220> well<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.519> was<00:02:31.670> clearly<00:02:31.910> a

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
everyone says well that was clearly a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.210 
everyone says well that was clearly a
bubble<00:02:32.359> but<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.930> other<00:02:33.079> factors<00:02:33.530> bubbles<00:02:34.010> can

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
bubble but the other factors bubbles can

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.530 
bubble but the other factors bubbles can
go<00:02:34.340> on<00:02:34.519> for<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.760> lot<00:02:34.970> longer<00:02:35.150> than<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.510> expect

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
go on for a lot longer than you expect

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.599 
go on for a lot longer than you expect
so<00:02:36.079> don't<00:02:36.260> be<00:02:36.380> surprised<00:02:36.739> if<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.160> year<00:02:37.340> from<00:02:37.400> now

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990

territory<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.740> reason<00:03:38.950> for<00:03:38.980> that<00:03:39.130> is

territory and the reason for that is

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.070 
territory and the reason for that is
cheap<00:03:39.550> credit<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.360> in<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.480> last<00:03:40.600> 20<00:03:40.959> years

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
cheap credit so in the last 20 years

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.740 
cheap credit so in the last 20 years
we've<00:03:41.200> seen<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.830> period<00:03:42.520> of<00:03:42.640> falling<00:03:43.480> interest

pants<00:03:48.069> have<00:03:48.160> longed<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.370> be<00:03:48.550> decrease<00:03:49.390> so<00:03:49.510> what

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
pants have longed to be decrease so what

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.820 
pants have longed to be decrease so what
that<00:03:49.690> means<00:03:49.930> is<00:03:50.050> people<00:03:50.290> can<00:03:50.410> borrow<00:03:50.590> more

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
that means is people can borrow more

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.870 
that means is people can borrow more
money<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:51.190> if<00:03:51.340> you<00:03:51.430> can<00:03:51.520> borrow<00:03:51.610> more<00:03:51.850> money

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.030 
money and if you can borrow more money
you<00:03:52.209> can<00:03:52.330> spend<00:03:52.480> more<00:03:52.810> money<00:03:52.930> so<00:03:53.410> if<00:03:53.680> we<00:03:53.830> take<00:03:53.860> a

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
you can spend more money so if we take a

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.070 
you can spend more money so if we take a
look<00:03:54.250> at<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.610> versus<00:03:55.060> income<00:03:55.870> growth

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
know i would say that there are

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.130 
know i would say that there are
certainly<00:04:00.340> evidence<00:04:00.730> of<00:04:00.880> overheated<00:04:01.720> markets

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140
