about<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.860> about<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.310> bumps<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.729> turned<00:01:59.939> to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
about the about the bumps and turned to

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.399 
about the about the bumps and turned to
how<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.630> was<00:02:00.719> gonna<00:02:00.810> play<00:02:00.930> out<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.259> race

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
how it was gonna play out in the race

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.319 
how it was gonna play out in the race
today<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.070> were<00:02:02.159> your<00:02:02.310> thoughts<00:02:02.549> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
today just what were your thoughts you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.880 
today just what were your thoughts you
don't<00:02:03.360> want<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.869> bumps<00:02:04.140> going<00:02:04.680> through

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
don't want on the bumps going through

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.370 
don't want on the bumps going through
there<00:02:05.040> today<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.810> think<00:02:06.810> after<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.350> first

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
there today I think after the first

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.109 
there today I think after the first
round<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:08.099> everybody<00:02:08.489> was<00:02:08.670> kind<00:02:09.060> of

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
round I think everybody was kind of

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.420 
round I think everybody was kind of
settled<00:02:09.509> down<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.170> bumps<00:02:10.590> but<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.310> know

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
settled down on the bumps but you know

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.830 
settled down on the bumps but you know
if<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:11.670> could<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:11.849> keep<00:02:12.150> them

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
if we could just keep them

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.570 
if we could just keep them
if<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> track<00:02:13.530> smooth<00:02:13.890> they're<00:02:14.100> gonna<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.280> lot

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
if the track smooth they're gonna a lot

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.860 
if the track smooth they're gonna a lot
of<00:02:14.700> them<00:02:14.819> are<00:02:14.910> gonna<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.420> know<00:02:15.540> complain

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
of them are gonna you know complain

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.270 
of them are gonna you know complain
about<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.170> being<00:02:16.290> too<00:02:16.410> smooth<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:17.010> doesn't

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
about it being too smooth and doesn't

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.160 
about it being too smooth and doesn't
have<00:02:17.430> enough<00:02:17.640> grip<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.180> now<00:02:18.690> there's<00:02:18.959> three

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
have enough grip and now there's three

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.420 
have enough grip and now there's three
bumps<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.560> track<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:19.800> it's<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.250> end<00:02:20.370> of

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
bumps in the track and it's the end of

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.350 
bumps in the track and it's the end of
the<00:02:20.490> world<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.569> I<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:24.060> know<00:02:24.090> I

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
the world so you I just you know I

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.330 
the world so you I just you know I
I<00:02:24.900> think<00:02:25.560> Jimmy's<00:02:25.800> probably<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.130> same<00:02:26.220> way

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
I think Jimmy's probably the same way

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.500 
I think Jimmy's probably the same way
you<00:02:26.400> used<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.610> just<00:02:26.819> go<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.060> racetrack<00:02:27.240> and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
you used to just go to the racetrack and

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.970 
you used to just go to the racetrack and
if<00:02:27.750> there<00:02:27.930> was<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.050> new<00:02:28.200> bump<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.560> came<00:02:28.740> in<00:02:28.890> and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
if there was a new bump you came in and

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.559 
if there was a new bump you came in and
you<00:02:29.040> said<00:02:29.160> hey<00:02:29.280> there's<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.520> new<00:02:29.640> bump<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.239> you

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
you said hey there's a new bump and you

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.370 
you said hey there's a new bump and you
go<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.810> work<00:02:31.380> on<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.420> so<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.840> know<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:33.959> made

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
go to work on it and so you know I made

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.100 
go to work on it and so you know I made
I<00:02:34.650> probably<00:02:35.190> made<00:02:35.430> 70%<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.360> my<00:02:36.450> passes<00:02:36.870> today

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
I probably made 70% of my passes today

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.500 
I probably made 70% of my passes today
in<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.650> tunnel<00:02:37.980> because<00:02:38.790> guys<00:02:39.150> would<00:02:39.390> get

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
in the tunnel because guys would get

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.140 
in the tunnel because guys would get
there<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.750> bounce<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:41.000> move<00:02:42.000> up<00:02:42.120> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
there and bounce and move up the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.880 
there and bounce and move up the
racetrack<00:02:42.690> or<00:02:42.720> get<00:02:43.140> loose<00:02:43.380> or<00:02:43.590> whatever<00:02:43.800> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
racetrack or get loose or whatever the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.500 
racetrack or get loose or whatever the
case<00:02:43.980> may<00:02:44.190> be<00:02:44.220> but<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.670> made<00:02:44.850> at<00:02:44.940> least<00:02:44.970> seven<00:02:45.420> or

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
case may be but I made at least seven or

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.800 
case may be but I made at least seven or
80%<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.959> my<00:02:46.050> passes<00:02:46.440> over<00:02:46.620> there<00:02:46.739> today<00:02:46.920> I

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
80% of my passes over there today I

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.150 
80% of my passes over there today I
totally<00:02:48.810> agree<00:02:49.019> it<00:02:49.320> was<00:02:49.440> an<00:02:49.530> opportunity<00:02:50.040> to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
totally agree it was an opportunity to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.670 
totally agree it was an opportunity to
work<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:50.940> your<00:02:51.120> car<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.810> an<00:02:52.230> opportunity<00:02:52.620> to

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
work on your car to an opportunity to

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.190 
work on your car to an opportunity to
pass<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.250> think<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.150> really<00:02:54.269> surprised<00:02:54.810> us<00:02:55.019> all

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
pass I think it really surprised us all

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.590 
pass I think it really surprised us all
our<00:02:55.440> first<00:02:55.620> trip<00:02:55.890> through<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.100> tunnel<00:02:56.540> it's<00:02:57.540> a

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
our first trip through the tunnel it's a

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.750 
our first trip through the tunnel it's a
hairy<00:02:57.810> corner<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.290> start<00:02:58.560> with<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.890> then<00:02:59.010> roll

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
hairy corner to start with and then roll

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.070 
hairy corner to start with and then roll
off<00:02:59.790> in<00:03:00.090> there<00:03:00.209> your<00:03:00.330> first<00:03:00.540> time<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.900> find

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
off in there your first time and find

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
off in there your first time and find
those<00:03:01.170> bumps<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.590> just<00:03:01.800> think<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.010> got

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
those bumps I just think you got

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.150 
those bumps I just think you got
everybody's<00:03:02.459> attention<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:04.080> don't<00:03:04.890> mind<00:03:05.040> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
is right now with a ending a big long

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.789 
is right now with a ending a big long
winless<00:03:18.299> week<00:03:18.630> what<00:03:19.320> do<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:19.470> think<00:03:19.680> he's

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
winless week what do you think he's

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.319 
winless week what do you think he's
feeling<00:03:20.010> right<00:03:20.280> now<00:03:20.459> not<00:03:20.670> only<00:03:20.880> because<00:03:21.150> it's

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
feeling right now not only because it's

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.539 
feeling right now not only because it's
for<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.540> smaller<00:03:21.870> team<00:03:22.140> but<00:03:22.440> ending<00:03:23.040> such<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> big

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
for a smaller team but ending such a big

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.819 
for a smaller team but ending such a big
one<00:03:23.840> yeah<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.019> size<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.410> team<00:03:25.620> doesn't

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
one yeah the size the team doesn't

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.500 
one yeah the size the team doesn't
really<00:03:26.010> matter<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.549> think<00:03:26.820> when<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.090> look<00:03:27.329> at

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
really matter I think when you look at

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
actually my question was something

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:09.920 
actually my question was something
similar<00:04:08.760> so<00:04:08.940> Jimmy<00:04:09.299> could<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:09.570> speak<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.810> that

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.349

not<00:05:12.640> any<00:05:12.880> different<00:05:13.360> than<00:05:13.690> it<00:05:13.810> has<00:05:13.960> been<00:05:14.140> for

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
not any different than it has been for

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.300 
not any different than it has been for
the<00:05:14.800> 15<00:05:15.130> years<00:05:15.340> that<00:05:15.520> we've<00:05:16.000> raced<00:05:16.420> here<00:05:17.310> you

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
the 15 years that we've raced here you

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.470 
the 15 years that we've raced here you
know<00:05:18.400> I<00:05:18.430> think<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.730> bumps<00:05:19.000> in<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:19.120> tunnel

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
know I think the bumps in the tunnel

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.240 
know I think the bumps in the tunnel
added<00:05:19.810> added<00:05:20.170> some<00:05:20.410> different<00:05:20.530> things<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:20.980> it

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
added added some different things to it

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.880 
added added some different things to it
I<00:05:21.370> think<00:05:21.450> the<00:05:22.450> restarts<00:05:22.900> were<00:05:23.020> crazy<00:05:23.290> so<00:05:23.470> you

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
I think the restarts were crazy so you

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.800 
I think the restarts were crazy so you
know<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.460> don't<00:05:24.550> I<00:05:24.730> don't<00:05:24.790> know<00:05:25.060> that<00:05:25.090> that<00:05:25.600> the

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
know I don't I don't know that that the

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.440 
know I don't I don't know that that the
the<00:05:26.200> rules<00:05:26.560> package<00:05:26.800> is<00:05:27.160> really<00:05:27.700> out<00:05:28.030> I<00:05:28.240> think

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
the rules package is really out I think

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.700 
the rules package is really out I think
everybody's<00:05:28.810> really<00:05:28.990> blown<00:05:29.290> it<00:05:29.320> out<00:05:29.590> of

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
everybody's really blown it out of

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.130 
everybody's really blown it out of
proportion<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:30.460> really<00:05:30.940> when<00:05:31.690> you<00:05:31.780> look<00:05:31.810> back

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
proportion and really when you look back

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.720 
proportion and really when you look back
at<00:05:32.290> things<00:05:32.500> and<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:32.800> look<00:05:32.950> how<00:05:33.100> things<00:05:33.400> work

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
at things and you look how things work

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.460 
at things and you look how things work
it's<00:05:34.000> not<00:05:34.150> a<00:05:34.210> lot<00:05:34.540> different<00:05:34.570> than<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:35.110> has

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
it's not a lot different than it has

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.590 
it's not a lot different than it has
been<00:05:35.800> so<00:05:36.100> you<00:05:36.160> just<00:05:36.430> for<00:05:37.060> whatever<00:05:37.180> reason

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600

Earnhardt spun out so that always makes

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.900 
Earnhardt spun out so that always makes
it<00:06:01.000> interesting<00:06:02.310> it's<00:06:03.310> just<00:06:03.490> like<00:06:03.610> the<00:06:03.730> pass

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
it interesting it's just like the pass

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.940 
it interesting it's just like the pass
in<00:06:04.090> the<00:06:04.180> grass<00:06:04.360> there<00:06:04.900> was<00:06:04.990> no<00:06:05.110> past<00:06:05.320> I<00:06:05.680> don't

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
in the grass there was no past I don't

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.880 
in the grass there was no past I don't
understand

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
understand

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.990 
understand
the<00:06:08.890> only<00:06:09.040> other<00:06:09.220> thing<00:06:09.370> to<00:06:09.400> add<00:06:09.490> I<00:06:09.610> think<00:06:09.730> the

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
the only other thing to add I think the

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.920 
the only other thing to add I think the
tracks<00:06:10.270> coming<00:06:10.570> around<00:06:10.870> here<00:06:11.160> we're<00:06:12.160> seeing

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
tracks coming around here we're seeing

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.440 
tracks coming around here we're seeing
lane<00:06:13.930> widen<00:06:14.410> out<00:06:14.530> there<00:06:15.460> was<00:06:15.550> an<00:06:16.000> outside

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
lane widen out there was an outside

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.920 
lane widen out there was an outside
groove<00:06:16.990> that<00:06:17.170> worked<00:06:17.410> and<00:06:18.190> one<00:06:18.780> didn't<00:06:19.780> have

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
groove that worked and one didn't have

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.020 
groove that worked and one didn't have
to<00:06:20.080> run<00:06:20.260> the<00:06:20.410> bottom<00:06:20.710> and<00:06:20.890> three<00:06:21.100> on<00:06:21.340> restarts

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
to run the bottom and three on restarts

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.840 
to run the bottom and three on restarts
the<00:06:22.120> second<00:06:22.750> Lane<00:06:22.870> was<00:06:23.020> working<00:06:23.410> so<00:06:23.560> I<00:06:23.590> think

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
the second Lane was working so I think

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.850 
the second Lane was working so I think
what<00:06:24.850> the<00:06:25.330> track<00:06:25.570> did<00:06:25.840> and<00:06:26.080> the<00:06:26.230> type<00:06:26.710> of

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
what the track did and the type of

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.830 
what the track did and the type of
asphalt<00:06:27.010> they<00:06:27.370> put<00:06:27.580> down<00:06:27.760> I<00:06:27.790> think<00:06:28.000> the<00:06:28.570> next

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
asphalt they put down I think the next

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.590 
asphalt they put down I think the next
year<00:06:29.590> or<00:06:29.620> two<00:06:29.710> will<00:06:30.670> actually<00:06:31.090> start<00:06:31.270> widening

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
year or two will actually start widening

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.830 
year or two will actually start widening
out<00:06:31.720> the<00:06:31.810> racetrack<00:06:32.140> especially<00:06:32.500> in<00:06:32.560> one

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
out the racetrack especially in one

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.030 
out the racetrack especially in one
