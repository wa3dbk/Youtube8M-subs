season this board first off looks
freaking<00:00:17.400> awesome<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.690> deer<00:00:19.050> who's

freaking awesome you have a deer who's
gone<00:00:19.560> hunting<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.270> way<00:00:21.390> cool

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
gone hunting it's just a way cool

gone hunting it's just a way cool
graphic<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.439> then<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.010> graphic<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.490> laid

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
graphic and then the graphic is laid

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.000 
graphic and then the graphic is laid
onto<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.090> wood<00:00:24.420> top<00:00:24.750> sheet<00:00:25.050> it's<00:00:25.380> real<00:00:25.710> wood

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
onto a wood top sheet it's real wood

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.310 
onto a wood top sheet it's real wood
which<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.730> great<00:00:27.180> because<00:00:27.420> wood<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.199> really

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
which is great because wood is really

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.679 
which is great because wood is really
poppy<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.980> resilient<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.599> to

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
poppy and resilient so it's going to

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.900 
poppy and resilient so it's going to
maintain<00:00:30.869> its<00:00:31.320> pop<00:00:31.590> its<00:00:31.859> resilience<00:00:32.430> longer

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
maintain its pop its resilience longer

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.610 
maintain its pop its resilience longer
than<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> man-made<00:00:33.570> material<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.200> wood<00:00:34.410> top

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
than a man-made material so wood top

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.030 
than a man-made material so wood top
sheet<00:00:35.149> the<00:00:36.149> bottom<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> board<00:00:36.840> also<00:00:37.649> with

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
sheet the bottom of the board also with

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.130 
sheet the bottom of the board also with
a<00:00:38.129> great<00:00:38.340> logo<00:00:38.610> die<00:00:39.300> cut<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:39.809> that's<00:00:39.899> really

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
a great logo die cut so that's really

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.860 
a great logo die cut so that's really
neat<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:41.149> going<00:00:42.149> through<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> features<00:00:42.660> of

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
neat and going through the features of

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.470 
neat and going through the features of
the<00:00:43.020> board<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.980> has<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> radius<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.329> flat

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the board it has a radius to flat

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.479 
the board it has a radius to flat
millicent<00:00:46.260> L<00:00:46.440> which<00:00:46.620> means<00:00:46.890> instead<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
millicent L which means instead of a

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.180 
millicent L which means instead of a
constant<00:00:47.940> curve<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.710> raised<00:00:49.920> right

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
constant curve you have one raised right

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.189 
constant curve you have one raised right
here<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.579> then<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> flattens<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.480> that

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
here and then the flattens out that

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.380 
here and then the flattens out that
extra<00:00:52.649> long<00:00:52.860> flat<00:00:53.309> nose<00:00:53.550> until<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
extra long flat nose until it's going to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.150 
extra long flat nose until it's going to
give<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.660> some<00:00:54.840> lift<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.350> flow<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> deep

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
give you some lift and flow in the deep

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.959 
give you some lift and flow in the deep
snow<00:00:56.960> stay<00:00:57.960> above<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.410> cruddy<00:00:58.739> snow<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.399> also

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
snow stay above the cruddy snow and also

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.790 
snow stay above the cruddy snow and also
give<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.210> another<00:01:00.359> surface<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:00.989> presses<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
give you another surface for presses and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.850 
give you another surface for presses and
make<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.280> really<00:01:02.430> fun<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.940> jiffy<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:04.530> sport

is<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> great<00:01:05.100> all-around<00:01:05.760> board<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
is a great all-around board and the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.340 
is a great all-around board and the
reason<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.310> camber<00:01:08.729> profile<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:10.110> has

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
reason is the camber profile it has

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.800 
reason is the camber profile it has
camber<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.100> between<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> feet<00:01:11.880> from<00:01:12.240> here<00:01:12.570> to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
camber in between the feet from here to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.380 
camber in between the feet from here to
here<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.320> between<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.830> bindings<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
here in between the bindings and that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.320 
here in between the bindings and that
camber<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.960> gonna<00:01:16.140> help<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.380> walk<00:01:16.619> into<00:01:16.830> rails

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
camber is gonna help you walk into rails

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.880 
camber is gonna help you walk into rails
power<00:01:18.330> through<00:01:18.659> your<00:01:18.780> turns<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.320> then<00:01:19.740> also

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
power through your turns and then also

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.920

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
load that camera in the middle the edges

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.140 
load that camera in the middle the edges
of<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> boards<00:01:28.140> rise<00:01:28.650> up<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.729> nose<00:01:29.909> and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
of the boards rise up and the nose and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.550 
of the boards rise up and the nose and
the<00:01:30.210> tail<00:01:30.360> become<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> reverse<00:01:31.229> camber

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the tail become a reverse camber

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.380 
the tail become a reverse camber
snowboard<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.220> can't<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.549> camber<00:01:33.180> in

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
snowboard so you can't have camber in

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.300 
snowboard so you can't have camber in
between<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> feet<00:01:34.020> reverse<00:01:34.680> camber<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
between the feet reverse camber on the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.399 
between the feet reverse camber on the
nose<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.670> tell<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.090> reverse<00:01:36.720> camber<00:01:37.020> again

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
nose and tell that reverse camber again

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.749 
nose and tell that reverse camber again
is<00:01:37.500> gonna<00:01:37.650> help<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.920> flow<00:01:38.159> through<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.520> snow

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
feel that people love in reverse camber

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.460 
feel that people love in reverse camber
snowboards<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.720> really<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.110> kind<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
snowboards so it really is kind of the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.139 
snowboards so it really is kind of the
best<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.890> both<00:01:46.950> worlds<00:01:47.159> here

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
