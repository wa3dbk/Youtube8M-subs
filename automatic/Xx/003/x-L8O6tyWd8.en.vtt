 O 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.229
 one of the most disputed finals of expoinel 2010 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:11.820
 so it was the man does not have to punish first sight that fence tracks 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.429
 matrices and a whole were offered from the pregÃ£o animals that combine fertility 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.839
 even with firmness to Ceal one night quite concurred the movement 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.019
 was more than 3 million reais 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.060
 with an average of 153 thousand but in what can be made official by the association cmb 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.519
 of the creators of Brazil's nelore a guarantee that the promoters do not open 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.200
 hand then I think it's very important for all of us. 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.450
 creators 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.330
 we are in the middle of 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.840
 this elitist cattle 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.810
 if genetics is with each passing day renewing itself 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.780
 it is very important to be inside all 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.850
 demands of the market and I think that the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.270
 the auction all our work every day improve more nei not within the 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.600
 expoinel also has a whole differential 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.990
 I have no doubt that here I 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.300
 it's the center 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.440
 Headlines come back to me because of this. 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.000
 I think I work 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.710
 however good it may be 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.710
 anywhere here how to disclose 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 goal is to reach all creators faster then 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.370
 We are very pleased to be here. 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.979
 one of the highlights of the night 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.580
 was launched fear in recovering 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.410
 50% of the animal was bought for 504 thousand reais by farm three 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.540
 companions attentive the most concurred in the auction was the offer of 50% of brussels 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.080
 tries to mark the agricultural rhyme 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.380
 paid 700 thousand reais to become a partner of this proven matriarch 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.430
 the auction and vice versa had a turnover 24% higher than the edition 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.860
 of last year, which confirms the optimism of the creators in relation to the market 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.489
 of elite billion 'now in 2010 we started with a year 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.200
 different from the other years we had 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.399
 some recommendations that 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.379
 now says in a market with excellent matrix death of the animals of lane then 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.489
 the market happened in a different way but it was very important to think 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.519
 which will add up for the next few years to continue in the same beat of the same 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.579
 way it's always been our best here is very strong and about 20 so the 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.979
 people have to work every day more to have quality and every day we are
