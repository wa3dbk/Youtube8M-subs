sleeves the color is optional but of

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.990 
sleeves the color is optional but of
course<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.260> Reds<00:00:46.920> keeps<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> theme<00:00:47.760> and

I can hear the non slavers yelling no I

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.700

don't<00:00:50.789> sleep<00:00:51.000> my<00:00:51.210> games<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.079> role<00:00:52.379> games

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
don't sleep my games but for role games

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.319 
don't sleep my games but for role games
I<00:00:52.920> think<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.309> important<00:00:53.820> because<00:00:53.940> if<00:00:54.210> you

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
I think it's important because if you

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.569 
I think it's important because if you
Nick<00:00:54.539> one<00:00:54.780> card<00:00:55.079> then<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.710> fixate<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.460> at

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
Nick one card then you fixate on it at

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.549 
Nick one card then you fixate on it at
least<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.899> kind<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.170> ruins<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
least I do and that kind of ruins the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.709 
least I do and that kind of ruins the
experience<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:59.190> me<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.699> think<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.539> should

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
experience with me so I think you should

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.930 
experience with me so I think you should
sleeve<00:01:00.989> these<00:01:01.199> rope<00:01:01.440> cars<00:01:01.890> especially<00:01:02.100> if

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
sleeve these rope cars especially if

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.810 
sleeve these rope cars especially if
it's<00:01:03.750> only<00:01:03.899> 16<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.369> extremely

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it's only 16 and this is extremely

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.200 
it's only 16 and this is extremely
optional<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> clear<00:01:06.659> penny<00:01:06.930> sleeve<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.619> the
