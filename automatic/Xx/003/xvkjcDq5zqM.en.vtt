performance<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.780> key<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.140> game<00:00:52.500> played

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
performance is the key to game played

performance is the key to game played
that's<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.690> key<00:00:54.780> strengths<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.260> our

that's one of the key strengths of our

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.080 
that's one of the key strengths of our
system<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.190> actually<00:00:56.399> see<00:00:56.730> all<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
system we can actually see all the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.400 
system we can actually see all the
subtle<00:00:57.390> features<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.960> animation

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
subtle features that animation

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.479 
subtle features that animation
traditional<00:00:59.010> ones<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.370> can't<00:00:59.719> do<00:01:01.190> call<00:01:02.190> felt

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
traditional ones just can't do call felt

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.719 
traditional ones just can't do call felt
traffic<00:01:03.210> what<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.320> got<00:01:04.500> what's<00:01:05.309> really

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
traffic what do we got what's really

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.770 
traffic what do we got what's really
acting<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.570> scene<00:01:07.040> in<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.369> two<00:01:08.939> parts<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
acting a scene in in two parts the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780 
acting a scene in in two parts the
motion<00:01:10.140> capture<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.710> then<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.369> motion

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
motion capture and then the motion

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.810 
motion capture and then the motion
scanning<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:13.380> motion<00:01:13.680> capture<00:01:14.010> captures<00:01:14.700> all

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
scanning the motion capture captures all

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.490 
scanning the motion capture captures all
the<00:01:14.850> body<00:01:15.090> movements<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.750> where<00:01:15.990> people<00:01:16.320> look

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the body movements and where people look

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.950 
the body movements and where people look
so<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.920> gives<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.220> all<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.549> eyelines

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
so it gives you all of the eyelines

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.520 
so it gives you all of the eyelines
regulator<00:01:18.960> valve<00:01:19.369> good<00:01:20.369> fine<00:01:20.750> then<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:22.110> can

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
regulator valve good fine then we can

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.140 
regulator valve good fine then we can
move<00:01:22.770> over<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.159> studio<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.670> where<00:01:23.820> an

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
move over to this studio and where an

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.300 
move over to this studio and where an
actor<00:01:24.479> typically<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.500> make<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
actor typically going to make up in the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.950 
actor typically going to make up in the
morning<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.880> then<00:01:26.939> had<00:01:27.270> their<00:01:27.479> hair<00:01:27.659> done<00:01:27.810> in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
morning and then had their hair done in

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440 
morning and then had their hair done in
1940's<00:01:28.590> hairstyle<00:01:29.040> then<00:01:29.820> they<00:01:30.000> come<00:01:30.210> into<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
1940's hairstyle then they come into a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.940 
1940's hairstyle then they come into a
room<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.720> sit<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.140> seat<00:01:31.320> behind<00:01:31.350> me<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
room and sit in the seat behind me and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.580 
room and sit in the seat behind me and
what<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.759> rig<00:01:33.119> does<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.479> capture<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> volume

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
what the rig does is capture a volume

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.460 
what the rig does is capture a volume
around<00:01:34.860> them<00:01:35.180> you've<00:01:36.180> got<00:01:36.360> cameras<00:01:36.869> not<00:01:37.170> only

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
around them you've got cameras not only

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.249 
around them you've got cameras not only
around<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.700> also<00:01:38.850> looking<00:01:39.630> upward<00:01:40.020> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
around but also looking upward and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.570 
around but also looking upward and
downward<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:41.009> well<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.579> any<00:01:41.909> kind<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.270> move

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
downward as well so any kind of move

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.430 
downward as well so any kind of move
is<00:01:42.970> going<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.540> cut<00:01:43.960> out<00:01:44.080> some<00:01:44.290> of<00:01:44.380> the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
is going to cut out some of the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.430 
is going to cut out some of the
information<00:01:45.690> they<00:01:46.690> delivered<00:01:47.110> their<00:01:47.200> lines

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
information they delivered their lines

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.620 
information they delivered their lines
and<00:01:47.740> as<00:01:47.890> they<00:01:48.160> talk<00:01:48.370> they<00:01:48.610> get<00:01:48.790> processed<00:01:49.510> and

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
and as they talk they get processed and

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.100 
and as they talk they get processed and
turned<00:01:49.690> in<00:01:49.960> 3d<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:51.060> action<00:01:52.060> so<00:01:52.870> the<00:01:52.990> guys

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
turned in 3d and action so the guys

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.390 
turned in 3d and action so the guys

names that I've been seeing doing the

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.040 
names that I've been seeing doing the
repairs<00:01:54.760> on<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.000> heaters<00:01:55.300> they're<00:01:55.840> fully

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
repairs on the heaters they're fully
