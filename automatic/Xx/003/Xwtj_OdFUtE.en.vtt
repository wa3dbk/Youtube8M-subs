00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello everyone 

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:08.440
 It is a good of world rubber market Thank you for table tennis wisdom bag this time 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:14.590
 Today's theme is here 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:17.980
 I will try to go about the lower rotation magic serve This serve is a Chinese player 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:21.830
 That was under rotation serve you are using 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.890
 The ball hitting face of the child of 回 転 回 転 opens 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:31.220
 It's a bit hard to see 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:36.980
 Hiding of that serve a little is difficult to see the moment when the cut I have not the 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:41.820
 Deadly serve the amount of rotation of the rotation is saying do not know at all that was not Kira cut 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:47.430
 Inspection and because such will be under rotation serve Choi and was of Buchigire clean it was with the knuckle 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:51.290
 Occurs phenomenon of this is said and do not know at all that was to score near you 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.290
 It becomes the lower rotation magic serve 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.460
 ph 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.970
 Putsu 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:38.229
 First of all before going into the procedure is the biggest advantage of this rotating Magic Serve that it is 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:42.189
 One of the big selling things about the shake hand is that they can serve without changing the way they hold it. 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:46.429
 Hold the racket with five fingers in it under rotation Saab is 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:51.829
 Line grabbed with two fingers when that ordinary society Saab Toka lateral rotation Saab 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:57.530
 There are a lot of people trying to cut, but Car Rotation Magic Serve has all five fingers of Shake 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:58.429
 This service is exactly the same as how to hold the rally during the match and how to hold the rally during the game. 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.240
 Because 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:06.360
 In short, it is easy to shift the third ball attack faster 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:11.400
 Using the cut out difference of the rotating Magic Serve that made it easy to hit the third ball 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:16.410
 The third ball without a slight gap where the receiver floated for a moment without knowing the change 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:21.390
 Also quite this the Tteyuu is likely to hit third pitch in can be Rutteyuu events 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:27.500
 I think that whether a highly practical Saab of course how to hold the pen of time as well as the people of the pen 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.500
 Of course it doesn't matter if you put it in and shake it with two fingers . 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:46.500
 ph 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:51.150
 We will immediately went towards the steps procedure is done with the feeling to go with the three Dema stuck 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.270
 First you first thing in the attitude of the lower rotary magic Saab 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:59.640
 The first posture is a racket 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:02.250
 Keep the angle of the racket at the time of taking out the lower rotation serve 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.020
 Please be this kind of ordinary noodle 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.720
 Specially open with the racket face up 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.580
 Involving 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.410
 I don't feel like I 'm sorry I 'm about to put out the rotation that was normal for each other 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.620
 Angle 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:26.230
 The first step with the racket pointing up 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:27.810
 This fore surface at the moment the second in turn raising the toss of procedure 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.760
 Twist 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:36.000
 Twisting at the moment this is raising the toss steps second is because the racket 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.170
 Please try to do it alone until here 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.940
 Raise the toss, raise the boil toss , twist the toss up 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.540
 It is I feel it 's twisting to raise the toss twisting raise the toss twisting raise the toss here 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.830
 And the wolf 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.850
 Lay the fore-face behind 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.910
 The moment I open it for an instant 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.940
 Please do it up there with a racket 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.940
 I think I'm there is an effect that causes to understand the difficulty of the moment to cut 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:16.660
 ph 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:20.350
 I would like to open the moment to hit the impact, so when trying to do so 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:27.610
 No longer can the amount of rotation of the judgment by behind 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:28.960
 I 'm staring at the procedure here finally finally turn up from here with this toss raised and twisted 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.400
 Saab 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:38.420
 Twisting at the moment you raise it 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:43.540
 Just use different things like cut off the rotation you just left and put it out without rotation 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:47.900
 Because even the state that turned back at the corner of the racket has already entered 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:51.800
 House which is rubbed with the fore in I is not seen is this is confusing 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.600
 So I do not know expire or have expired under rotation This is used in fine Chinese top players 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.130
 The amount of rotation of the rotation that serve you are 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.139
 And Naa's hand alone with this that or fell with a thud to only was poking If you do not know at all 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:05.410
 Or with or flew me tailored Byun 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.410
 It will serve as a feeling that I can not understand it anymore 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.900
 ph 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:32.139
 This image is sharp still calf racket is that it is a state in which fore eyes are directed to the back 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:34.310
 I don't understand why you're out of it 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.330
 Is it broken? 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.330
 It is difficult to understand 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:47.310
 Most appear unlikely to be the hitting surface of the rotation to the lower rotation magic Saab true 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:52.740
 Do not know exactly the month not a clean has expired is not Kira cut of Saab 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:58.200
 And the place where the other party put together A place where I got a bit jealous I just got floating and finished with the third ball 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:06:03.490
 Easy to grip very than that service also was considered also that third pitch 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:07.949
 Well has become a practical Serve because it is under rotation Saab are also using Chinese players 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.949
 Thank you for trying if you like 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:22.689
