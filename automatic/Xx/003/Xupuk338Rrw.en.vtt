so<00:00:48.690> easy<00:00:49.050> for<00:00:49.410> me<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.590> remember<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.430> size-wise

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
so easy for me to remember and size-wise

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.970 
so easy for me to remember and size-wise
you<00:00:51.210> know<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.899> choose<00:00:52.110> any<00:00:52.379> size<00:00:52.680> you
