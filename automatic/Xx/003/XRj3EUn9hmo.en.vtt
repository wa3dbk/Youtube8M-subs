opposed<00:00:23.300> to<00:00:23.450> our<00:00:23.540> previous<00:00:23.720> z<00:00:24.050> drive<00:00:24.290> we've

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
opposed to our previous z drive we've

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.429 
opposed to our previous z drive we've
really<00:00:24.800> changed<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:25.520> design<00:00:25.580> a<00:00:25.910> lot<00:00:26.180> here

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
really changed the design a lot here

really changed the design a lot here
some<00:00:27.439> really<00:00:27.619> cool<00:00:27.859> design<00:00:28.010> elements<00:00:28.640> we<00:00:28.730> have

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
some really cool design elements we have

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.450 
some really cool design elements we have
a<00:00:28.910> new<00:00:29.660> heatsink<00:00:29.900> that<00:00:30.230> we've<00:00:30.350> integrated<00:00:30.560> of

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
a new heatsink that we've integrated of

excited for this one you can see we've

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.810 
excited for this one you can see we've
done<00:01:13.790> a<00:01:13.820> lot<00:01:13.909> as<00:01:14.390> far<00:01:14.570> as<00:01:15.020> changing<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:15.920> making

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
done a lot as far as changing and making

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.910 
done a lot as far as changing and making
this<00:01:17.120> product<00:01:17.570> a<00:01:17.690> better<00:01:18.200> overall<00:01:18.590> we're

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
this product a better overall we're

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.410 
this product a better overall we're
using<00:01:19.040> super<00:01:19.460> cap<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:20.060> increase<00:01:20.300> the

reliability of the product should in the
unlikely<00:01:22.760> event<00:01:23.000> your<00:01:23.480> system<00:01:23.810> shut<00:01:24.020> down

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
unlikely event your system shut down

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.550 
unlikely event your system shut down
super<00:01:24.590> capital<00:01:24.980> out<00:01:25.190> to<00:01:25.340> complete<00:01:25.520> a<00:01:25.700> right<00:01:26.560> so

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
super capital out to complete a right so

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.700 
super capital out to complete a right so
a<00:01:27.920> little<00:01:28.520> extra<00:01:28.760> capacitor<00:01:29.710> that's

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
a little extra capacitor that's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.170 
a little extra capacitor that's
basically<00:01:31.040> what<00:01:31.220> super<00:01:31.460> cap<00:01:31.640> is<00:01:31.790> it's<00:01:32.120> a

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
basically what super cap is it's a

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.790 
basically what super cap is it's a
capacitor<00:01:32.660> that<00:01:32.840> will<00:01:32.990> allow<00:01:33.230> the<00:01:33.290> drive<00:01:33.620> do

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
capacitor that will allow the drive do

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.680 
capacitor that will allow the drive do
not<00:01:33.920> fully<00:01:34.160> power<00:01:34.430> down<00:01:34.700> in<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.150> event<00:01:35.420> of<00:01:35.540> a

not fully power down in the event of a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.060 
not fully power down in the event of a
kit<00:01:35.900> you<00:01:36.050> know<00:01:36.170> your<00:01:36.320> system<00:01:36.650> powering<00:01:36.890> down

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
kit you know your system powering down

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.500 
kit you know your system powering down
will<00:01:37.640> give<00:01:37.760> you<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:38.270> know<00:01:38.300> a<00:01:38.420> couple

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
will give you you know a couple

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.149 
will give you you know a couple
milliseconds<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.320> finish<00:01:39.650> that<00:01:39.770> rewrite

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
milliseconds to finish that rewrite

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.610 
milliseconds to finish that rewrite
operation<00:01:40.760> got<00:01:40.940> you<00:01:41.120> so<00:01:41.630> just<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.260> little<00:01:42.290> bit

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
operation got you so just a little bit

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.510 
operation got you so just a little bit
of<00:01:42.770> extra<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.700> know<00:01:43.820> safety<00:01:44.420> there<00:01:45.520> and

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
of extra you know safety there and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.370 
of extra you know safety there and
really<00:01:47.120> this<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:47.420> another<00:01:47.840> thing<00:01:47.960> is<00:01:48.140> if<00:01:48.170> you

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
really this is another thing is if you
