guide explains how the series of

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.849 
guide explains how the series of
glaciers<00:00:06.540> that<00:00:06.569> form<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.140> lakes<00:00:07.350> also

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
glaciers that form the lakes also

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.759 
glaciers that form the lakes also
dragged<00:00:08.220> with<00:00:08.429> them<00:00:08.760> stones<00:00:09.510> from<00:00:10.230> as<00:00:10.440> far

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
dragged with them stones from as far

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.910 
dragged with them stones from as far
away<00:00:10.980> as<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.700> Arctic<00:00:12.150> Circle<00:00:12.559> it<00:00:13.559> says

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
away as the Arctic Circle it says

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.160 
away as the Arctic Circle it says
because<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.670> glacial<00:00:15.150> transport<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.960> rock

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
because of glacial transport of rock

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.439 
because of glacial transport of rock
from<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.590> Canadian<00:00:17.070> Shield<00:00:17.279> Lake<00:00:17.970> Michigan

from the Canadian Shield Lake Michigan

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.179 
from the Canadian Shield Lake Michigan
and<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.720> other<00:00:18.869> Great<00:00:19.140> Lakes<00:00:19.380> have<00:00:19.949> more

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
and the other Great Lakes have more

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.160 
and the other Great Lakes have more
varieties<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.970> color<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.359> rocks<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:22.020> their

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
varieties and color of rocks on their

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.599 
varieties and color of rocks on their
beaches<00:00:22.350> than<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.769> are<00:00:22.890> likely<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.279> find

anywhere else on earth
I<00:00:25.580> thought<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.730> would<00:00:26.849> be<00:00:26.970> interesting<00:00:27.119> to

I thought it would be interesting to

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.120 
I thought it would be interesting to
take<00:00:27.689> all<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.019> rocks<00:00:28.230> I've<00:00:28.439> collected<00:00:28.680> along

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
take all the rocks I've collected along

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the shores of Lake Michigan and to put

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.930 
the shores of Lake Michigan and to put
them<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> map<00:00:31.460> indicating<00:00:32.460> where<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> found

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
them on a map indicating where I found

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
stones come into the picture those are

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.669 
stones come into the picture those are
actually<00:02:07.920> not<00:02:08.899> native<00:02:09.899> stones<00:02:10.170> but<00:02:10.410> they're

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
actually not native stones but they're

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.540 
actually not native stones but they're
tumbled<00:02:11.520> slag<00:02:12.120> from<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.870> refi

so<00:02:19.110> you'll<00:02:19.290> find<00:02:19.530> those<00:02:19.680> along<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> lakeshore

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
so you'll find those along the lakeshore

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.460 
so you'll find those along the lakeshore
anyplace<00:02:20.850> there<00:02:21.150> was<00:02:21.300> or<00:02:21.600> still<00:02:21.960> is<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> a
