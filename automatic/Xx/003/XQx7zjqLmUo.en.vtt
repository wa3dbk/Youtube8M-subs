00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
 but condemned with the mission 93 high 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.300
 noon 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.279
 through the transmission we do for 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.720
 the team crash if it 's in the last 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.090
 mission that we do for these policemen 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.249
 corrupt people who were always 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.769
 asking for favors so that they leave 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:17.060
 clean and eliminating people that to them 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.610
 it did not suit them because they have 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.190
 information from them then remember 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.140
 the call that made us see you and for 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.730
 that we give them the documents of 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.230
 wish with all the records that 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.390
 contains surely a lot of information 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.590
 of them well then the delivery has 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.680
 The moment of delivery has arrived 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.679
 come and in that frank temple to a hit 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.230
 quite strong hernandez saying that 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:41.030
 you are the guy who is blowing you 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.850
 you're the bloody snitch you're the one 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.159
 has sold us and all that then already 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.339
 He has left dying then tells 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:53.589
 car that fits in hole and will not stop 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:56.989
 to why only only with follow 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:00.010
 then it is simply going to go to the 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.960
 police station and they are going to see there 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.820
 then supposedly also has 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.470
 it's time to nail jones and 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.810
 then it is supposedly going to 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.740
 die and then in this kinematics 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.960
 we see like this 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.659
 is finishing a hole 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.850
 for hernandez and also supposedly 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.290
 for the same yes because he supposedly 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.290
 he will also die 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.780
 in those and jay will want to talk a little 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.790
 saying reflexiona polanski is not 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.369
 using trains and how do you see the background 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.070
 Hernandez is like reacting a little 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.340
 if he is reacting and wants to hit him 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.320
 but the other pig gives him a bullet and falls 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.509
 in hole and it dies then now it 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.369
 see this pig escape and we have to 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.979
 chase it if we're going to grab this 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.840
 soft and we are going to crash his car yes 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.570
 because if not after giving a 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.759
 very great perception then since it 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.539
 star here let's get it out of the car 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.630
 if we are going to take it out and now we are going to 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.880
 run over if in that way we're going to 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.530
 avoid that there is a great persecution 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.479
 that will not only take many 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.979
 minutes ok then since it's 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.580
 dying 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.820
 polanski and how do you realize 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.250
 he is totally helpless and delivered 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.470
 even dying four 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.020
 commandments have left then dies 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.430
 cabro then that way we have mission 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.370
 overcome yes and damn do it and now 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:33.020
 they fear and are free without hernandez and without 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.760
 queues curious truth in short if I continue with 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.860
 the popular video and hitting that is 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.560
 that we're going to receive a flame like that 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.530
 call that is important there are 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.120
 let's answer 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.120
 and this voice is a nervous voice if already 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.280
 you know who it is who rosenberg if 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.930
 telling us I was a little 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.319
 good a little worried if not 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.790
 pretty worried yes and it 's in 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.290
 problems and wants us to go to 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.489
 visit her nearby but call her well 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.020
 then she unlocks a mission 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.489
 more for casino caligula biennale 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.080
 favorite does not feel video been of 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.300
 france 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.010
 remember to visit my new channel winstar 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.170
 tis network where it would be going up 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.760
 missions of other games the link you're going 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.330
 to be able to find in the description of 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.330
 this video 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.040
 if you could not intercept it does a 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.570
 increase in what is in the cottage this 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.070
 guy is always going to hit those 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.690
 signs and when I 'm turning around here 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.250
 then it 's time to take advantage of it 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.660
 then let's get it out of the car we're going to 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.880
 do the same modality of doing a 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.950
 moment and we are going to run over him 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.990
 shooting him is useless because that 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.750
 guy is pretty tough if only 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.790
 we have to run over him yes, but yes 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.730
 we have to grab a bit of instance 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.300
 If you can not make him suffer and now if you already 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.730
 you were good then you see the same 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.390
 cinematic where he is already dying and 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.260
 all that and being the same cocky guy 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.330
 and a lifelong bastard serving 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.970
 the same as you saw actions very well 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.260
 then then remember always 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.330
 intercept it like that and take advantage of that 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.360
 moment of that collides with the sign for 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.800
 that you do not do a big chase and 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.420
 cut the time that exceeds this mission 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.420
 well we seven videos and you'll see
