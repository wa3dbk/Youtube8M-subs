on<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.240> little<00:02:21.480> fish<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.260> there's<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.590> great

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
on the little fish so there's this great

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.790 
on the little fish so there's this great

big cycle that continues onwards this is

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.460 
big cycle that continues onwards this is
a<00:02:25.830> marvelous<00:02:26.640> kind<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.660> natural

fertilization<00:02:29.160> it's<00:02:29.520> like<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> great<00:02:30.000> big

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
fertilization it's like a great big

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.809 
fertilization it's like a great big
battery<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.960> every<00:02:31.860> year<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.430> case<00:02:32.610> of

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
year on the Fraser that big battery gets

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.300 
year on the Fraser that big battery gets
juiced<00:02:39.060> up<00:02:39.270> again<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.620> ecosystem

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
juiced up again and the ecosystem

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.430 
juiced up again and the ecosystem
flourishes<00:02:41.819> at<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.569> same<00:02:42.780> time<00:02:43.020> given<00:02:43.319> its

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.400 
under great development pressure things
like<00:02:47.340> urbanization<00:02:48.209> industrial<00:02:48.840> development

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
like urbanization industrial development

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.830 
like urbanization industrial development
agricultural<00:02:50.160> expansion<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:51.270> there's<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.540> real

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840
