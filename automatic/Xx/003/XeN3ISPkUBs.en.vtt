00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
you know like if he's his lackluster

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.370

performance<00:02:02.369> today<00:02:02.909> though<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:03.750> very<00:02:04.259> I

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
performance today though but like very I

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.990 
performance today though but like very I
like<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:05.100> lot<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.579> his<00:02:05.759> best<00:02:05.939> performances

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
like a lot of his best performances

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.880 
like a lot of his best performances
there<00:02:06.570> when<00:02:06.719> he<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:06.960> doesn't<00:02:07.380> care<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.649> I

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
there when he just doesn't care so I

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.190 
there when he just doesn't care so I
think<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:08.399> more<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.819> isn't<00:02:09.179> his<00:02:09.330> acting<00:02:09.899> it's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
think it's more it isn't his acting it's

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.350 
think it's more it isn't his acting it's
almost<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.500> he<00:02:10.619> brought<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.860> character<00:02:11.459> his

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
almost like he brought a character his

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.130 
almost like he brought a character his
character

would do a terrible job any be like fire

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.449 
would do a terrible job any be like fire
me<00:02:33.630> because<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.709> already<00:02:34.830> signed<00:02:35.070> an<00:02:35.250> exclusive

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
me because I already signed an exclusive

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.540 
me because I already signed an exclusive
contract<00:02:35.850> boom<00:02:36.780> gold<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.980> think<00:02:38.370> we<00:02:38.520> have

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
contract boom gold I think we have

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.710 
contract boom gold I think we have
different<00:02:38.820> opinions<00:02:39.239> on<00:02:39.600> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
different opinions on the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.949 
different opinions on the
characterization<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.709> Tyrion<00:02:41.130> Lannister<00:02:41.959> but

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
characterization of Tyrion Lannister but

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.449 
characterization of Tyrion Lannister but
if<00:02:43.020> he<00:02:43.110> doesn't<00:02:43.319> care<00:02:43.590> about<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.069> think<00:02:44.130> he's

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
if he doesn't care about it I think he's

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.090 
if he doesn't care about it I think he's
gonna<00:02:45.150> care<00:02:45.480> uh<00:02:45.750> yeah<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.080> mean<00:02:46.290> sure<00:02:46.860> they

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
gonna care uh yeah I mean sure they

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.199 
gonna care uh yeah I mean sure they
could<00:02:47.220> have<00:02:47.310> just<00:02:47.340> given<00:02:47.520> him<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.820> check<00:02:48.030> and

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
could have just given him a check and

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.790 
could have just given him a check and
said<00:02:48.390> do<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.600> not<00:02:49.080> giving<00:02:49.320> him<00:02:49.380> any<00:02:49.530> direction

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
said do it not giving him any direction

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.040 
said do it not giving him any direction
I<00:02:50.160> do<00:02:50.220> think<00:02:50.640> there<00:02:50.970> was<00:02:51.150> lack<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.600> direction

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
I do think there was lack of direction

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.720 
I do think there was lack of direction
because<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:52.650> really<00:02:52.920> sounds<00:02:53.370> like<00:02:53.459> he<00:02:53.610> has

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
because it it really sounds like he has

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.460 
because it it really sounds like he has
no<00:02:54.090> idea<00:02:54.120> what<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.720> hell<00:02:54.870> he's<00:02:55.050> talking<00:02:55.080> about

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
no idea what the hell he's talking about

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.280 
no idea what the hell he's talking about
never<00:02:56.070> heard<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.489> big-time<00:02:56.850> well<00:02:57.480> because

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
never heard of a big-time well because

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.050 
never heard of a big-time well because
don't<00:02:58.560> lure<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.100> its<00:02:59.250> own<00:02:59.400> world<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.000> all

don't lure in its own world and all

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.570 
don't lure in its own world and all
these<00:03:00.209> different<00:03:00.890> terms<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:02.160> don't<00:03:02.370> really

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
these different terms that don't really

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.640 
these different terms that don't really
make<00:03:02.820> sense<00:03:03.090> out<00:03:03.269> of<00:03:03.330> context<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.350> pure
