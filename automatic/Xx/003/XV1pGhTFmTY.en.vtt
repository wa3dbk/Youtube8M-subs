tube amp or something like that although
we're<00:00:31.710> not<00:00:31.800> really<00:00:32.009> drawing<00:00:32.309> power<00:00:32.579> from<00:00:33.000> it

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
we're not really drawing power from it

out of that tube and add some warmth to
the<00:00:37.950> acoustic<00:00:38.399> guitar<00:00:38.430> kind<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.510> what

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the acoustic guitar kind of like what

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.750 
the acoustic guitar kind of like what
they<00:00:39.750> do<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> recording<00:00:40.500> studio<00:00:40.530> with<00:00:41.219> an

they will tend to run that track through

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.029 
they will tend to run that track through
a<00:00:47.100> tube<00:00:47.670> preamp<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:49.110> warm<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.559> make<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.829> all

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
a tube preamp to warm it up make it all

sound<00:00:52.890> great<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> record<00:00:53.730> we're<00:00:53.879> just

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
sound great on the record we're just

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.729 
sound great on the record we're just
trying<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> guitar<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
trying to do that in the guitar on the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.529 
trying to do that in the guitar on the
stage<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.340> live<00:00:56.550> setting<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.270> really

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
stage in a live setting and it's really

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.029 
stage in a live setting and it's really
easy<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> do

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
easy to do

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.799 
easy to do
right<00:00:59.579> now<00:00:59.699> I've<00:00:59.850> got<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.120> tube<00:01:00.359> completely

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
right now I've got the tube completely

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.090 
right now I've got the tube completely
off<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> great<00:01:01.829> thing<00:01:02.010> about

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
off and that's the great thing about

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.539 
off and that's the great thing about
this<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.670> my<00:01:02.789> preamp<00:01:03.239> controls<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.040> can

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
this on my preamp controls I can I can

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.390 
this on my preamp controls I can I can
dial<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.600> tube<00:01:06.840> completely<00:01:07.590> down<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.890> zero

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
dial the tube completely down to zero

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.210 
dial the tube completely down to zero
and<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.720> mix<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:11.189> just

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
and not have it in the mix or I can just

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.850 
and not have it in the mix or I can just
bring<00:01:11.580> up<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:12.360> much<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.840> tube<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.590> want

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
bring up as much of that tube as I want

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.620 
bring up as much of that tube as I want
and<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> more<00:01:14.310> tube<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.880> bring<00:01:15.240> into<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
and the more tube that I bring into the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.050 
and the more tube that I bring into the
mix<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.770> warmer<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.460> fuzzy<00:01:17.729> or<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
mix the warmer and the fuzzy or the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
mix the warmer and the fuzzy or the
guitar<00:01:18.180> gets<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:18.990> depending<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.950> style<00:01:20.189> of

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
guitar gets so depending on the style of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.859 
guitar gets so depending on the style of
playing<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.090> you're<00:01:21.299> doing<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:21.780> you're

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
playing that you're doing if you're

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.899 
playing that you're doing if you're
doing<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.110> lot<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.290> heavy<00:01:22.470> strumming<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.759> may

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
doing a lot of heavy strumming you may

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.550 
doing a lot of heavy strumming you may
not<00:01:24.090> need<00:01:24.299> as<00:01:24.479> much<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.840> tube<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.470> if

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
not need as much of that tube but if

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.260 
not need as much of that tube but if
you're<00:01:25.710> doing<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.979> nice<00:01:26.189> soft<00:01:26.520> fingerstyle

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
you're doing a nice soft fingerstyle

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.590 
you're doing a nice soft fingerstyle
technique<00:01:27.619> I<00:01:28.700> find<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.880> more<00:01:30.060> tube<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
technique I find the more tube the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.630 
technique I find the more tube the
better<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.890> warms<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.369> nice

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
better and that really warms it up nice

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.580 
better and that really warms it up nice
so<00:01:32.970> let's<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.659> kind<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.930> take<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> look<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
so let's just kind of take a look at the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
so let's just kind of take a look at the
preamp<00:01:34.979> we've<00:01:35.100> got<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> built-in<00:01:35.670> tuner<00:01:36.119> which

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
preamp we've got a built-in tuner which

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.170 
preamp we've got a built-in tuner which
is<00:01:36.450> great<00:01:37.070> if<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.159> hit<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> button<00:01:38.579> once<00:01:39.000> it

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
is great if you hit the button once it

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.050 
is great if you hit the button once it
turns<00:01:39.360> into<00:01:39.570> neuron<00:01:40.220> if<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.310> hit<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> tuner

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
turns into neuron if I hit the tuner

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.569 
turns into neuron if I hit the tuner
button<00:01:42.329> again<00:01:42.689> my<00:01:43.530> tuner<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> mutes

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
button again my tuner is on but it mutes

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.520 
button again my tuner is on but it mutes
