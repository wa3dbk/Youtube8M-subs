00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
figured I'd have all three of them kind

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.189 
figured I'd have all three of them kind
of<00:00:15.150> next<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.389> each<00:00:15.480> other<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.870> guys<00:00:16.020> can

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
of next to each other so you guys can

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.740 
of next to each other so you guys can
kind<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.440> see<00:00:16.820> what<00:00:17.820> they<00:00:17.970> look<00:00:18.000> like<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.570> mean

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
kind of see what they look like I mean

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.960 
kind of see what they look like I mean
it's<00:00:19.500> actually<00:00:19.680> pretty<00:00:20.070> pretty<00:00:20.580> close<00:00:20.820> i

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
it's actually pretty pretty close i

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.400 
it's actually pretty pretty close i
actually<00:00:21.240> thought<00:00:21.359> these<00:00:21.510> were<00:00:21.660> i<00:00:21.689> would<00:00:22.320> have

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
actually thought these were i would have

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.570 
actually thought these were i would have
considered<00:00:22.650> these<00:00:22.859> black<00:00:23.100> grapes<00:00:23.340> from<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
considered these black grapes from the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.439 
considered these black grapes from the
beginning<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:23.910> because<00:00:24.119> they<00:00:24.210> are<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
beginning just because they are the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.660 
beginning just because they are the
fives<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.050> they<00:00:25.800> are<00:00:25.920> kind<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.400> reverse

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
fives and they are kind of the reverse

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.800 
fives and they are kind of the reverse
colors<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.500> the<00:00:28.970> other<00:00:29.970> shoes<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:30.420> really

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
colors of the other shoes but really

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.930 
colors of the other shoes but really
these<00:00:30.990> actually<00:00:31.380> are<00:00:31.489> maybe<00:00:32.489> I'm<00:00:32.579> trying<00:00:32.850> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
these actually are maybe I'm trying to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.240 
these actually are maybe I'm trying to
do<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.329> like<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:34.829> see<00:00:35.100> this

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
do this like this so you can see this

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.340 
do this like this so you can see this
next<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.700> each<00:00:35.760> other<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.690> really<00:00:36.870> are<00:00:37.110> like

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
next to each other they really are like

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.889 
next to each other they really are like
the<00:00:37.530> Aqua<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.610> mean<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.360> same<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:39.809> of

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
the Aqua is I mean the same kind of

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.700 
the Aqua is I mean the same kind of
gradient<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.420> aqua<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.660> grape<00:00:43.260> color<00:00:43.530> way

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
gradient of aqua in grape color way

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.580 
gradient of aqua in grape color way
through<00:00:44.670> here<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.120> Colin<00:00:46.020> Lockwood's<00:00:46.379> call

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
through here so Colin Lockwood's call

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.560 
through here so Colin Lockwood's call
them<00:00:46.710> grapes<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.309> think<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.969> would<00:00:48.059> probably<00:00:48.329> be

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
them grapes I think it would probably be

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.840 
them grapes I think it would probably be
okay<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.260> call<00:00:49.379> them<00:00:49.530> both<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:49.950> obviously<00:00:50.760> you

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
okay to call them both but obviously you

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.340 
okay to call them both but obviously you
can<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.270> mean<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:51.960> why

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
can see that I mean this is really why

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.900 
can see that I mean this is really why
they<00:00:52.469> call<00:00:52.620> them<00:00:52.710> grapes<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.219> because<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.550> this

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
they call them grapes is because of this

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.150 
they call them grapes is because of this
and<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.210> I'm<00:00:54.600> curious<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.500> know<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.890> don't

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.200 
and this I'm curious you know I don't
even<00:00:56.250> know<00:00:56.430> when<00:00:56.610> they<00:00:56.730> acquired<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> name

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
even know when they acquired the name

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.279 
even know when they acquired the name
grape<00:00:57.539> versus<00:00:58.199> aqua<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.969> why<00:01:00.079> they<00:01:01.079> weren't

pretty cool it might actually pretty
nice<00:02:55.690> if<00:02:55.930> they<00:02:56.020> did<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.200> reverse<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:57.070> these<00:02:57.390> if

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
here would be read it might be kind of

here would be read it might be kind of
cool<00:03:54.459> i<00:03:54.730> think<00:03:55.570> would<00:03:55.630> be<00:03:55.780> rad<00:03:55.989> but<00:03:56.230> i<00:03:56.260> just<00:03:56.530> do

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
cool i think would be rad but i just do

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.750 
cool i think would be rad but i just do
it<00:03:56.800> sucks<00:03:57.070> because<00:03:57.190> i<00:03:57.310> don't<00:03:57.430> want<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.610> lose

it sucks because i don't want to lose
those<00:03:57.910> metallic<00:03:58.450> so<00:03:58.690> i<00:03:58.720> might<00:03:58.900> actually<00:03:59.050> just

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
those metallic so i might actually just

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.140 
those metallic so i might actually just
maybe<00:04:00.160> eventually<00:04:00.489> just<00:04:00.700> try<00:04:00.850> to<00:04:00.910> find<00:04:01.090> a

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150

material<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:53.310> in<00:04:54.310> my<00:04:54.460> opinion<00:04:54.610> this<00:04:55.090> material

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
material and in my opinion this material

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.590 
material and in my opinion this material
is<00:04:55.660> superior<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.080> this<00:04:56.290> one<00:04:57.300> you<00:04:58.300> guys<00:04:58.450> might

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
is superior to this one you guys might

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.490 
is superior to this one you guys might
have<00:04:58.630> a<00:04:58.720> different<00:04:58.870> opinion<00:04:59.080> but<00:04:59.260> that's<00:04:59.410> what

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
have a different opinion but that's what

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.680 
have a different opinion but that's what
I<00:04:59.560> think<00:04:59.740> anyway<00:04:59.890> this<00:05:00.730> is<00:05:00.940> feels<00:05:01.120> thinner<00:05:01.480> and

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
I think anyway this is feels thinner and

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.450 
I think anyway this is feels thinner and
cheaper<00:05:01.960> this<00:05:02.080> feels<00:05:02.320> more<00:05:02.620> realistic<00:05:03.280> and

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
cheaper this feels more realistic and

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.150 
cheaper this feels more realistic and
and<00:05:04.240> just<00:05:04.480> like<00:05:04.690> a<00:05:04.720> higher<00:05:04.930> quality<00:05:05.140> grade<00:05:05.560> so

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
and just like a higher quality grade so

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.760 
and just like a higher quality grade so
that<00:05:06.430> is<00:05:06.550> kind<00:05:06.730> of<00:05:06.820> what<00:05:06.940> it<00:05:07.060> is<00:05:07.180> anyway<00:05:07.770> that's

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
that is kind of what it is anyway that's

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.930 
that is kind of what it is anyway that's
about<00:05:09.040> all<00:05:09.070> I<00:05:09.190> got<00:05:09.430> for<00:05:09.550> you<00:05:09.610> guys<00:05:09.760> i<00:05:09.790> just
