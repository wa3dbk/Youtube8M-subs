00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
between the curl pieces of hair and then

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.479 
between the curl pieces of hair and then
the<00:02:44.450> street<00:02:44.690> DC<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.799> I'm<00:02:45.890> going<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.069> go<00:02:46.190> with<00:02:46.220> my

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
second section and this is going to be

00:02:48.349 --> 00:03:01.140 
second section and this is going to be
right<00:02:48.560> about<00:02:48.680> about<00:02:49.430> my<00:02:49.610> eyebrows

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
exact same thing this time probably take

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.700 
exact same thing this time probably take
about<00:03:14.030> three<00:03:14.480> pieces<00:03:14.720> of<00:03:14.900> hair<00:03:15.200> on<00:03:15.290> each<00:03:15.440> side

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
about three pieces of hair on each side

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:25.449 
about three pieces of hair on each side
and<00:03:22.900> if<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:24.050> have<00:03:24.170> layers<00:03:24.500> in<00:03:24.920> your<00:03:25.040> hair<00:03:25.250> make

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
and if you have layers in your hair make

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.110 
and if you have layers in your hair make
sure<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:25.790> do<00:03:26.270> each<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:27.200> layer<00:03:27.440> like<00:03:27.980> try<00:03:28.940> and

distinguish<00:03:29.510> between<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.870> layers<00:03:30.050> so<00:03:30.410> that

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
distinguish between the layers so that

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.710 
distinguish between the layers so that
they're<00:03:30.920> curled<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.970> say<00:03:32.180> here<00:03:32.390> stuff
