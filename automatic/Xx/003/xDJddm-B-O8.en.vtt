00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.080
 so if you follow me on facebook he 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.660
 some time ago I published some photos 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.350
 a bin that was manufactured by a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.680
 carpentry which is in the Vosges 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:23.070
 and so you asked me to do a 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.080
 standing tank according to the plans that I 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.760
 sent them and he sent me that 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.590
 the package that just received 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.230
 here we are going to do the assembly together and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.969
 we will discover a little the manufacture of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.690
 the carpentry well I finished 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.590
 unpack the package and that's it 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.270
 gives in terms of wood then first 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.640
 view there was no plan of joint 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.190
 game by cons there are parts are 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.270
 numbered so I'll see a little bit 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.190
 that it gives to the assembly 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.930
 first observation is also the quality 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.649
 wood then me it's the first time 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.809
 that I use the resified wood and 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.660
 it's really beautiful wood 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.420
 it is already one and planed that you can 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.689
 you can not get it by buying 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.880
 the boards at brico depot 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.240
 super planing with cuts really 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.970
 to be born really beautiful is really 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.869
 good wood 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.189
 so I'm going to attack now 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.450
 the assembly has also 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.250
 concerning the packaging but they did not 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.710
 do not hesitate 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.530
 it was really well protected so no 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.939
 hesitated to put paper bubble wrap 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.920
 bubble cartons the cartons I'm going 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:35.610
 able to reuse them and paper 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:38.009
 Waste bubble here I finished 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.500
 to assemble the structure so nothing 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.230
 well complicated actually it's about 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.270
 match letters 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.610
 so the same direction plan get there very 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.640
 well see for example here at the level of 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.680
 this assembly and to the letter j 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.060
 corresponds to do with the other letter j 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.680
 on another piece of which I live from 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.510
 actually find the letters that are going 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.840
 together 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.320
 same here case because on the legs of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.120
 strength 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.880
 here on the middle of the middle actually 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:14.550
 so here are some traits for the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:18.660
 first and for the second so here we go 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:23.820
 I am a fairly simple assembly levis 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.810
 also are marked see on then all 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.950
 in small so that it was not going to 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.920
 find marc not just done there these 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.450
 numbers there we will see them more so there is 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.880
 large medium and small 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.010
 screw then for sleepers here actually 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.150
 see there is a jet for the big vi 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:43.440
 is for example for the strut 6 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.840
 6 1 m for medium bis and there will be 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.670
 a p on the berries here for small 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.709
 screw for the boards so nothing 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.380
 especially it seems quite easily 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.060
 alone 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.190
 of course it will be easier if 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.550
 you are 2 we put everything alone is done 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.970
 very well 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.920
 so now I'm going to finish 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.920
 to assemble the bottom and the sides 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.350
 gold for ease I you 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:18.110
 advises from before JC the sides of m 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.840
 the bottom so actually the boards they 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.890
 are numbered 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.210
 So there I liked I put the 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.510
 numbers the other way to not one 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.770
 see them and just place them all 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.540
 simply are not life so it's a 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:38.690
 little slipped for before is kept on 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.200
 the sides then for the same sides 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.590
 principle 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:48.500
 see there are numbers I was asking 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.910
 still on the other models that 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.350
 the numberings its review because 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.230
 it's true that logical in fact as he 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.350
 must begin what sense box 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.020
 so we have easier it's not good 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.090
 before then pointing in his logic of 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:07.490
 start a two three good that's 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:11.920
 small details so similar start 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:14.239
 also so rather speak side yard 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.870
 because see there is a side that is going 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.060
 come 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.620
 cover the slice so better 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.050
 start with the course sides rather than 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:27.110
 to have to nest after the sides course 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:30.440
 between the two boards that overflows so 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:40.490
 same and it would be nice to number in 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:42.739
 starting from 6 1 1 2 3 not without this and 4 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.969
 5 6 for that side 

00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:48.569
 but hey that will be details that 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:53.129
 will be reviewed on other models I 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:56.149
 will discuss with the carpenter 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:05:00.169
 be more logical in the assembly 

00:04:56.149 --> 00:05:03.739
 good I finish life is my side 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:06.479
 here I finished assembling the tray 

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:09.599
 count two good hours for 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:13.649
 the assembly it can go faster if 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:16.159
 you're two it's pretty good he 

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:19.649
 there is a real there is no difficulty 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:22.229
 in the bins you will be able to 

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:24.269
 order this woodwork hair will do 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.669
 so so they provide when 

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:29.550
 even a plan where I will do it myself to 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.379
 this plan the good even if it's simple 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.639
 it's nice to have support 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:38.519
 visual for to be assisted in the 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.920
 montage I think it's the least 

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:42.500
 things 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.790
 and I will also make sure that they 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:49.130
 provide something to fill the trap 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.960
 for the worm elevator because 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:56.900
 that that is not going to want 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:00.620
 connect his tray to the holy wolf installed 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.940
 so the pili of two barriers so I 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.740
 ask them who also provide 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.740
 what to cap the bottom of the tray 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.050
 this is for the assembly of this tray and 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:15.020
 who I remind you is in wood 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:18.350
 rÃ©tifiÃ© so it's a beautiful wood so 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.060
 who has been treated a donation to a 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.970
 treatment but that was heated so 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:26.570
 there is rather moisture in it and so 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:30.700
 that they have to go back resists and 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.700
 sustainable there soon
