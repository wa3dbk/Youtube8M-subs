00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.230
 that was too simple somehow I was there 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.450
 even a little bit amplifier or 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.550
 Well, I'll say it's up there 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.960
 the whole course open 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.309
 We really do not like to recommend it 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.619
 What matters to us is the family 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.010
 your deceased would like you to be yes 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.600
 a double case, a special case 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.789
 they live well and then have a good life 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.590
 They are a very component and me 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.880
 do not know maybe they do 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.910
 but let two ears on the bag 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.710
 below recess for clowns school that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.850
 would be something 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.890
 So I thought she was just like her 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.230
 So in beeskow schneider have played 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.680
 I'll laugh at you there are 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.629
 actually synonymous videos of or dvds 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.670
 yes there is a dvd is something to it 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.559
 Is it possible that I will 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.899
 By mistake, not everything revolves around you 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.820
 this is my funeral if you are 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.420
 you can sell many dvds 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.239
 Up to you 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.590
 I just answered sorry 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.800
 Mr pastewka did not want to be rude 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.850
 but if you son because the brisko 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.390
 has played schneider that was already 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.340
 great that here also space burial 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.320
 offer yes we do that since one 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.330
 year is now very happy 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.810
 especially if it is something more original 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.810
 should 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.430
 in that case your urn would be with you 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.110
 a carrier rocket of one 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.720
 European graduation base in the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.600
 orbit shot 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.390
 im serious you would not believe like that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.270
 perhaps often taken the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.790
 also with a living person no that works 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.990
 Of course not very funny class would come 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.740
 is a big help 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.540
 but it would still be all my why 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.040
 my a telescope now has always 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.970
 ask only because he is too lazy time 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.810
 to pour flowers 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.030
 how about one 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.430
 urn burial yes there we have a lot 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.470
 beautiful models in the next room I want 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:56.490
 not be burned why nothing 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:58.229
 cost and I just had a normal 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.890
 serving with 50 or ordered but this 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.720

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.670
 I counted again 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.670
 it can not be I always do three 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.869
 kellen with every 50 yes I think so 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.819
 All this can happen 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.810
 people over fact we are only 14 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.930
 You can do it yourself again 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.930
