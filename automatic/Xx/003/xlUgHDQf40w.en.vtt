00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.070 

so<00:00:02.820> we're<00:00:02.970> talking<00:00:03.240> today<00:00:03.389> about<00:00:03.480> how<00:00:03.840> things

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
so we're talking today about how things

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.019 
so we're talking today about how things
get<00:00:04.290> in<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:04.620> out<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.799> cells<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.490> one<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:05.940> the

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
get in and out of cells and one of the

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.430 
get in and out of cells and one of the
ways<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.390> they<00:00:06.540> can<00:00:06.569> move<00:00:06.930> in<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.200> out<00:00:07.230> is

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
ways that they can move in and out is

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.770 
ways that they can move in and out is
bulk<00:00:07.799> flow<00:00:08.130> they<00:00:08.309> can<00:00:08.490> move<00:00:08.639> out<00:00:09.510> by

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
bulk flow they can move out by

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.839 
bulk flow they can move out by
exocytosis<00:00:10.110> or<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:10.830> by<00:00:10.980> endocytosis<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:12.389> XL

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
exocytosis or in by endocytosis so XL

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.330 
exocytosis or in by endocytosis so XL
means<00:00:14.849> moving<00:00:15.240> things<00:00:15.480> out<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.170> cell<00:00:16.859> so

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
means moving things out of the cell so

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.920 
means moving things out of the cell so
you<00:00:17.400> can<00:00:17.520> see<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> vesicle<00:00:18.060> here<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> transport

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
you can see a vesicle here a transport

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.160 
you can see a vesicle here a transport
vesicle<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:20.000> here's<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.180> lipid<00:00:21.660> bilayer<00:00:21.990> of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
vesicle and here's the lipid bilayer of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.230 
vesicle and here's the lipid bilayer of
the<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.920> cell<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.490> cell<00:00:23.670> membrane<00:00:23.699> or

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
the of the cell so the cell membrane or

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.380 
the of the cell so the cell membrane or
the<00:00:24.420> plasma<00:00:25.140> membrane<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.390> transport

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the plasma membrane and the transport

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.939 
the plasma membrane and the transport
vesicle<00:00:27.840> maybe<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.170> came<00:00:28.320> from<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.619> Golgi

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
vesicle maybe it came from the Golgi

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.529 
vesicle maybe it came from the Golgi
body<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.369> something<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:29.880> coming<00:00:30.150> over<00:00:30.359> here

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
body or something it's coming over here

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.600 
body or something it's coming over here
and<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.750> fusing<00:00:31.199> with<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:32.369> cell<00:00:32.579> membrane

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
and it's fusing with the cell membrane

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.540 
and it's fusing with the cell membrane
and<00:00:33.260> it's<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.559> little<00:00:34.800> sack<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.399> can

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and it's just a little sack and you can

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.069 
and it's just a little sack and you can
see<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.820> cut<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.300> half<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.870> show<00:00:37.020> you

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
see it cut in half here to show you

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.790 
see it cut in half here to show you
what's<00:00:37.290> inside<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.730> fused<00:00:39.800> with

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
what's inside and here it's fused with

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.500 
what's inside and here it's fused with
the<00:00:40.860> cell<00:00:41.129> membrane<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.489> actually<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.120> part

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the cell membrane and actually this part

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.180 
the cell membrane and actually this part
now<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.719> going<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.079> become<00:00:43.350> part<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.860> cell

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
now is going to become part of the cell

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.369 
now is going to become part of the cell
membrane<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.570> think<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:46.969> oops<00:00:48.379> exit

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
membrane so if you think of oops exit

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.160 
membrane so if you think of oops exit
come<00:00:49.710> back<00:00:49.969> if<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.120> think<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.390> an<00:00:51.510> exit<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
come back if you think of an exit for a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.130 
come back if you think of an exit for a
building<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.910> then<00:00:53.910> hopefully<00:00:54.270> exocytosis

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
building and then hopefully exocytosis

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.389 
building and then hopefully exocytosis
will<00:00:55.860> make<00:00:56.010> sense<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.710> molecules<00:00:59.219> are

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
will make sense to you so molecules are

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.509 
will make sense to you so molecules are
moved<00:00:59.670> out<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.109> cell<00:01:01.320> by<00:01:02.480> vesicles<00:01:03.480> that

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
moved out of the cell by vesicles that

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:12.050 
moved out of the cell by vesicles that
fuse<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.790> plasma<00:01:05.939> membrane<00:01:10.880> this<00:01:11.880> is

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
fuse with the plasma membrane this is

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.350 
fuse with the plasma membrane this is
how<00:01:12.210> many<00:01:12.380> hormones<00:01:13.380> are<00:01:13.860> secreted<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.520> how

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
how many hormones are secreted and how

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.149 
how many hormones are secreted and how
nerve<00:01:15.930> cells<00:01:16.259> communicate<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.920> each<00:01:16.950> other

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
nerve cells communicate with each other

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.490 
nerve cells communicate with each other
so<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.390> would<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.229> would<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
so if this would if this would be a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.780 
so if this would if this would be a
nerve<00:01:19.710> cell<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:20.130> example<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.549> would<00:01:20.640> have

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
nerve cell for example it would have

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.280 
nerve cell for example it would have
neurotransmitters<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.689> here<00:01:21.960> maybe

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
neurotransmitters in here maybe

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.469 
neurotransmitters in here maybe
serotonin<00:01:23.040> or<00:01:23.220> dopamine<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
serotonin or dopamine or one of the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.480 
serotonin or dopamine or one of the
other<00:01:24.630> 50<00:01:24.990> neurotransmitters<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.400> would

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
other 50 neurotransmitters and it would

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.420 
other 50 neurotransmitters and it would
be<00:01:26.610> good<00:01:26.780> excuse<00:01:27.780> me<00:01:27.979> it<00:01:28.979> would<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.159> coming

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
be good excuse me it would be coming

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.469 
be good excuse me it would be coming
over<00:01:29.520> here<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:29.909> releasing<00:01:30.329> its

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
over here and releasing its

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.090 
over here and releasing its
neurotransmitters<00:01:31.259> into<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> tiny<00:01:31.829> little

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
neurotransmitters into the tiny little

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.859 
neurotransmitters into the tiny little
space<00:01:32.340> between<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:32.939> neuron<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.360> another<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
space between one neuron and another and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.230 
space between one neuron and another and
the<00:01:34.619> other<00:01:34.920> neuron<00:01:35.250> would<00:01:35.430> pick<00:01:35.670> these<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:35.880> and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the other neuron would pick these up and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.920 
the other neuron would pick these up and
say<00:01:36.390> oops<00:01:36.570> I'd<00:01:36.810> better<00:01:36.990> fire<00:01:37.290> or<00:01:37.590> not<00:01:38.009> fire

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
say oops I'd better fire or not fire

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.080 
say oops I'd better fire or not fire
here's<00:01:39.930> an<00:01:40.140> electron<00:01:40.740> micrograph<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.820> shows

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
here's an electron micrograph that shows

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780 
here's an electron micrograph that shows
um<00:01:42.470> exocytosis<00:01:43.470> happening<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.280> right<00:01:44.640> after

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
um exocytosis happening on right after

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.160 
um exocytosis happening on right after
fusion<00:01:45.119> with<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.420> plasma<00:01:45.570> membrane<00:01:45.750> so

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
fusion with the plasma membrane so

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.080 
fusion with the plasma membrane so
here's<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> plasma<00:01:46.799> membrane<00:01:47.130> now<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.030> is

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
here's the plasma membrane now this is

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.700 
here's the plasma membrane now this is
part<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.540> plasma<00:01:48.689> membrane<00:01:48.899> but<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> second

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
part of the plasma membrane but a second

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.830 
part of the plasma membrane but a second
ago<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.040> was<00:01:50.189> part<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.579> vesicle<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.210> here's

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
ago it was part of a vesicle and here's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.780 
ago it was part of a vesicle and here's
a<00:01:51.899> bunch<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.200> stuff<00:01:52.409> being<00:01:52.680> sent<00:01:53.399> out<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
a bunch of stuff being sent out of the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.690 
a bunch of stuff being sent out of the
cell<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:55.439> here's<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.710> way<00:01:55.890> cool<00:01:56.189> exocytosis

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
cell so here's a way cool exocytosis

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.130 
cell so here's a way cool exocytosis
video<00:01:57.979> whoa<00:01:59.149> that<00:02:00.149> was<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.509> cool<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
video whoa that was so cool we have to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.359 
video whoa that was so cool we have to
watch<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.409> again<00:02:01.500> ready<00:02:02.420> whoa<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.619> let's<00:02:08.220> see

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
watch it again ready whoa so let's see

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.180 
watch it again ready whoa so let's see
inside<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> cell<00:02:09.119> outside<00:02:10.080> so

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
inside the cell outside so

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.280 
inside the cell outside so
and<00:02:13.950> anyway<00:02:14.950> pictures<00:02:15.640> more<00:02:16.030> pictures<00:02:16.390> so

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
and anyway pictures more pictures so

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.470 
and anyway pictures more pictures so
here's<00:02:17.740> oh<00:02:18.100> we're<00:02:18.760> doing<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.000> back<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.330> which

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
here's oh we're doing the back of which

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.870 
here's oh we're doing the back of which
one<00:02:19.720> now<00:02:19.930> endo<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.800> all<00:02:20.980> means<00:02:21.160> inside<00:02:21.580> so

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
one now endo and all means inside so

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.320 
one now endo and all means inside so
endocytosis<00:02:22.480> means<00:02:23.230> moving<00:02:23.590> stuff<00:02:23.800> in<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.330> so

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
endocytosis means moving stuff in and so

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.640 
endocytosis means moving stuff in and so
here's<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.690> bunch<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.990> stuff<00:02:26.050> that's<00:02:26.410> going<00:02:26.590> to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
here's a bunch of stuff that's going to

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.710 
here's a bunch of stuff that's going to
come<00:02:26.800> into<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.100> cell<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:28.240> see<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.540> cell

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
come into the cell you can see the cell

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.840 
come into the cell you can see the cell
membrane<00:02:28.750> or<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.470> plasma<00:02:29.770> membrane

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
membrane or the plasma membrane

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.460 
membrane or the plasma membrane
invaginate<00:02:30.850> amines<00:02:31.330> coming<00:02:31.810> inside<00:02:32.230> like

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
invaginate amines coming inside like

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.520 
invaginate amines coming inside like
that<00:02:32.620> here<00:02:33.550> it's<00:02:33.820> almost<00:02:34.090> fused<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.260> here

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
that here it's almost fused and here

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.530 
that here it's almost fused and here
it's<00:02:35.650> totally<00:02:35.830> fused<00:02:36.250> now<00:02:36.520> this<00:02:36.820> part<00:02:37.120> was<00:02:37.300> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
it's totally fused now this part was the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.300 
it's totally fused now this part was the
cell<00:02:37.750> membrane<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:38.110> minute<00:02:38.320> ago<00:02:38.410> but<00:02:39.040> now<00:02:39.160> it's

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
cell membrane a minute ago but now it's

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.070 
cell membrane a minute ago but now it's
a<00:02:39.370> vesicle<00:02:39.670> inside<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.270> cell<00:02:42.690> there<00:02:43.690> are<00:02:43.900> two

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
a vesicle inside the cell there are two

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.080 
a vesicle inside the cell there are two
major<00:02:44.260> types<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.740> endocytosis<00:02:45.130> there<00:02:45.850> is

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
major types of endocytosis there is

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.380 
major types of endocytosis there is
pinocytosis<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:47.590> phagocytosis<00:02:48.520> this<00:02:49.150> is<00:02:49.270> the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
pinocytosis and phagocytosis this is the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.760 
pinocytosis and phagocytosis this is the
one<00:02:49.510> we'll<00:02:49.660> be<00:02:49.750> talking<00:02:49.930> about<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.260> lot<00:02:50.440> more

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
one we'll be talking about a lot more

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.710 
one we'll be talking about a lot more
but<00:02:51.610> anyway<00:02:52.030> we'll<00:02:52.180> define<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.600> both

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
but anyway we'll define the both

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.870 
but anyway we'll define the both
pinocytosis<00:02:53.140> means<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:53.980> drink<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.730> brings

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
pinocytosis means to drink so it brings

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.850 
pinocytosis means to drink so it brings
in<00:02:55.090> liquids<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:56.110> stuff<00:02:56.320> dissolved<00:02:56.740> in

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
in liquids and the stuff dissolved in

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.940 
in liquids and the stuff dissolved in
the<00:02:56.950> liquids<00:02:58.020> phagocytosis<00:02:59.020> vago<00:02:59.620> meaning<00:02:59.860> to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
the liquids phagocytosis vago meaning to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.880 
the liquids phagocytosis vago meaning to
eat<00:03:00.100> that<00:03:01.090> brings<00:03:01.330> in<00:03:01.480> solid<00:03:01.930> stuff<00:03:02.140> so<00:03:02.500> solid

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
eat that brings in solid stuff so solid

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.680 
eat that brings in solid stuff so solid
materials<00:03:03.340> like<00:03:03.520> bacteria<00:03:03.910> or<00:03:04.330> if<00:03:04.480> you're<00:03:04.600> an

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
materials like bacteria or if you're an

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.540 
materials like bacteria or if you're an
amoeba<00:03:05.020> it<00:03:05.200> would<00:03:05.290> bring<00:03:05.410> in<00:03:05.560> food<00:03:05.830> if<00:03:06.370> your

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
amoeba it would bring in food if your

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.360 
amoeba it would bring in food if your
white<00:03:06.760> blood<00:03:06.880> cell<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.330> will<00:03:07.360> bring<00:03:07.570> in

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
white blood cell it will bring in

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.010 
white blood cell it will bring in
phagocytosis<00:03:09.370> will<00:03:10.120> be<00:03:10.300> what<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.870> white

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
phagocytosis will be what the white

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.110 
phagocytosis will be what the white
blood<00:03:11.200> cell<00:03:11.410> uses<00:03:11.860> to<00:03:12.010> bring<00:03:12.160> in<00:03:12.250> bacteria<00:03:12.880> or

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
blood cell uses to bring in bacteria or

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.390 
blood cell uses to bring in bacteria or
cells<00:03:13.630> infected<00:03:13.840> with<00:03:14.290> viruses<00:03:14.770> or<00:03:15.010> cancer

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
cells infected with viruses or cancer

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.750 
cells infected with viruses or cancer
cells<00:03:15.670> or<00:03:15.940> whatever<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.620> pinocytosis<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.730> a

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
cells or whatever so pinocytosis is a

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.060 
cells or whatever so pinocytosis is a
type<00:03:19.000> of<00:03:19.030> endocytosis<00:03:19.900> bringing<00:03:20.620> stuff<00:03:20.830> in

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
type of endocytosis bringing stuff in

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.100 
type of endocytosis bringing stuff in
and<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:21.550> this<00:03:21.670> is<00:03:21.820> just<00:03:21.970> dissolve<00:03:22.330> stuff<00:03:22.660> it's

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
and so this is just dissolve stuff it's

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.780 
and so this is just dissolve stuff it's
almost<00:03:23.350> like<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.680> cell<00:03:23.890> taking<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.459> drink

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
almost like the cell taking a drink

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.080 
almost like the cell taking a drink
bringing<00:03:25.300> in<00:03:25.420> liquids<00:03:26.520> so<00:03:27.520> molecules<00:03:28.000> are

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
bringing in liquids so molecules are

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.729 
bringing in liquids so molecules are
taken<00:03:28.390> into<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.720> cell<00:03:29.260> by<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.500> vesicle<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:32.620> the

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
taken into the cell by a vesicle so the

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.440 
taken into the cell by a vesicle so the
cell<00:03:32.920> forms<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.400> invagination<00:03:34.180> and

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
cell forms and invagination and

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.210 
cell forms and invagination and
dissolved<00:03:35.080> materials<00:03:35.530> are<00:03:35.650> brought<00:03:35.800> into<00:03:36.010> the

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
dissolved materials are brought into the

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.970 
dissolved materials are brought into the
cell<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.640> so<00:03:37.480> another<00:03:38.050> really<00:03:38.350> fantastic

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
cell and so another really fantastic

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.199 
cell and so another really fantastic
video<00:03:39.130> we'll<00:03:39.430> have<00:03:39.550> to<00:03:39.640> watch<00:03:39.790> this<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:40.090> few

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
video we'll have to watch this a few

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.940 
video we'll have to watch this a few
times<00:03:40.270> look<00:03:41.230> at<00:03:41.380> that<00:03:41.530> stuff<00:03:41.860> coming<00:03:42.130> in<00:03:43.950> cool

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
times look at that stuff coming in cool

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.390 
times look at that stuff coming in cool
stuff<00:03:45.400> here's<00:03:46.330> an<00:03:46.680> example<00:03:47.680> of<00:03:48.010> pinocytosis

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
stuff here's an example of pinocytosis

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.100 
stuff here's an example of pinocytosis
here's<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.300> picture<00:03:49.570> of<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.930> actually

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
here's a picture of it actually

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.780 
here's a picture of it actually
happening<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:50.830> look<00:03:51.040> at<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.280> vesicles

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
happening and look at the vesicles

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.310 
happening and look at the vesicles
coming<00:03:52.390> into<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.720> cell<00:03:54.930> phagocytosis<00:03:55.930> is

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
coming into the cell phagocytosis is

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.080 
coming into the cell phagocytosis is
another<00:03:56.650> type<00:03:56.860> of<00:03:56.890> endocytosis<00:03:57.340> this<00:03:57.910> time

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
another type of endocytosis this time

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.460 
another type of endocytosis this time
you're<00:03:58.239> bringing<00:03:58.510> in<00:03:58.630> solid<00:03:59.019> stuff<00:03:59.230> like

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
you're bringing in solid stuff like

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.070 
you're bringing in solid stuff like
bacteria<00:03:59.860> or<00:04:00.280> something<00:04:01.000> else<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.450> so<00:04:01.750> you're

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
bacteria or something else and so you're

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.199 
bacteria or something else and so you're
making<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:02.860> pseudopod<00:04:03.130> here<00:04:03.730> which<00:04:03.910> is<00:04:04.030> like<00:04:04.180> a

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
making a pseudopod here which is like a

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.850 
making a pseudopod here which is like a
little<00:04:04.510> faults<00:04:04.720> foot<00:04:05.110> coming<00:04:05.440> up<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.650> around

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
little faults foot coming up and around

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.770 
little faults foot coming up and around
the<00:04:06.010> bacterium<00:04:06.580> and<00:04:06.790> look<00:04:07.060> it's<00:04:07.209> almost<00:04:07.540> in

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
the bacterium and look it's almost in

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.500 
the bacterium and look it's almost in
and<00:04:08.019> wow<00:04:08.170> now<00:04:08.470> it's<00:04:08.620> in<00:04:08.800> do<00:04:09.760> you<00:04:09.850> remember<00:04:10.150> what

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
and wow now it's in do you remember what

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.479 
and wow now it's in do you remember what
your<00:04:11.170> white<00:04:11.410> blood<00:04:11.560> cell<00:04:11.830> would<00:04:12.010> do<00:04:12.220> with<00:04:12.400> this

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
your white blood cell would do with this

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.479 
your white blood cell would do with this
now<00:04:12.700> if<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:14.019> said<00:04:14.260> bring<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.560> lysosome<00:04:14.890> over<00:04:15.340> to

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
now if you said bring a lysosome over to

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.940 
now if you said bring a lysosome over to
fuse<00:04:15.760> with<00:04:15.790> it<00:04:16.060> then<00:04:16.380> congratulations<00:04:17.380> good

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
fuse with it then congratulations good

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.340 
fuse with it then congratulations good
