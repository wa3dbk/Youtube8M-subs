or<00:01:48.119> anything<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.899> think<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.829> is

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
or anything so I think that that is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.370 
or anything so I think that that is
because<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.390> vitamins<00:01:51.810> they're<00:01:51.990> super

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
so when I felt it I was not expecting it

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.139

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
really good and it's not thick but it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.540 
really good and it's not thick but it

off I'll show you a picture right here

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.160 
off I'll show you a picture right here
that's<00:03:38.850> about<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.239> link<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.690> got<00:03:39.870> cut<00:03:40.140> off

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
that's about the link that I got cut off

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.160 
that's about the link that I got cut off
and<00:03:41.989> so<00:03:42.989> yeah<00:03:43.320> I'm<00:03:44.130> not<00:03:44.730> quite<00:03:45.209> sure<00:03:45.239> how<00:03:45.900> long

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
and so yeah I'm not quite sure how long

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.250 
and so yeah I'm not quite sure how long
my<00:03:46.350> hair<00:03:46.380> was<00:03:46.769> before<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.580> trim<00:03:47.880> but<00:03:48.690> when<00:03:49.230> I

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
my hair was before the trim but when I

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.720 
my hair was before the trim but when I
came<00:03:49.650> back<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:50.250> measured

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
came back and measured

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.630 
came back and measured
after<00:03:51.060> my<00:03:51.180> first<00:03:51.450> bottle<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:52.260> think<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.459> it

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
after my first bottle I think that it

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.490 
after my first bottle I think that it
was<00:03:53.730> about<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.180> same<00:03:54.420> length<00:03:54.750> because<00:03:54.989> I

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
was about the same length because I

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.710 
was about the same length because I
started<00:03:56.069> out<00:03:56.250> at<00:03:56.430> eleven<00:03:56.819> point<00:03:57.060> five<00:03:57.269> inches

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
started out at eleven point five inches

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.710 
started out at eleven point five inches
and<00:03:57.959> now<00:03:58.260> my<00:03:59.010> hair<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.280> at<00:03:59.640> ten<00:04:00.150> point<00:04:00.450> five

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
and now my hair is at ten point five

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.830 
and now my hair is at ten point five
inches<00:04:01.110> so<00:04:01.739> about<00:04:02.400> an<00:04:02.819> inch<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.269> a<00:04:03.299> half<00:04:03.330> two

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
inches so about an inch and a half two

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.600 
inches so about an inch and a half two
inches<00:04:03.870> maybe<00:04:04.379> my<00:04:04.620> hair<00:04:04.799> grew<00:04:04.980> maybe<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.310> half

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
inches maybe my hair grew maybe a half

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.949 
inches maybe my hair grew maybe a half
an<00:04:05.760> inch<00:04:06.799> but<00:04:07.799> I'll<00:04:07.950> show<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.220> my<00:04:08.959> length
