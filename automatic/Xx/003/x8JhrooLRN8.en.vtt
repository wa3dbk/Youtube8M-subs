00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
very small lineup and I felt hey now is

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.120 
very small lineup and I felt hey now is
a<00:00:32.730> great<00:00:33.030> time<00:00:33.150> to<00:00:33.480> try<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.990> attempt<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.530> had

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
a great time to try and attempt this had

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.830 
a great time to try and attempt this had
no<00:00:35.370> idea<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.730> was<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.090> do<00:00:36.240> it<00:00:36.360> until<00:00:36.510> about

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
no idea I was going to do it until about

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.479 
no idea I was going to do it until about
a<00:00:37.170> little<00:00:37.590> bit<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.980> first<00:00:38.190> quarter

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
a little bit in the first quarter

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.470 
a little bit in the first quarter
because<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:38.940> see<00:00:39.060> right<00:00:39.090> there<00:00:39.390> I'm

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480

because you can see right there I'm
scoring<00:00:39.720> with<00:00:39.900> MJ<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.040> decided<00:00:41.550> if<00:00:42.150> he's

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
scoring with MJ but I decided if he's

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.210 
scoring with MJ but I decided if he's
only<00:00:42.690> gonna<00:00:42.900> use<00:00:42.989> Perkins<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.860> he's<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.160> to

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
only gonna use Perkins and he's going to

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.790 
only gonna use Perkins and he's going to
use<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.400> baka<00:00:44.760> at<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> center<00:00:45.329> sometimes<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.140> can

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
use a baka at the center sometimes I can

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.229 
use a baka at the center sometimes I can
try<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.040> put<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.520> work<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:48.000> Wilt

jump<00:03:17.680> shots<00:03:17.950> but<00:03:18.700> he<00:03:18.940> definitely<00:03:19.150> wasn't<00:03:19.480> a

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
jump shots but he definitely wasn't a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.690 
jump shots but he definitely wasn't a
jump<00:03:19.990> shooter<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.560> his<00:03:20.590> free<00:03:21.220> throws<00:03:21.520> are

jump shooter and his free throws are
definitely<00:03:22.120> tough<00:03:22.360> to<00:03:22.570> figure<00:03:22.750> out<00:03:23.050> in<00:03:23.260> this

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
definitely tough to figure out in this

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.500 
definitely tough to figure out in this
game<00:03:23.650> if<00:03:23.950> you<00:03:24.400> don't<00:03:24.610> get<00:03:24.700> an<00:03:24.850> A<00:03:25.030> you're<00:03:25.300> pretty
