00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.650
 I have been laid before, but from this sound studio information of the new Sumabra 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:15.639
 I would like to tell you, so I would like to thank you 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.330
 All screens are under development 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.330
 Please note 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.470
 However, if it is a mere ranking, it will be an oversized position such as hundreds of thousands of yen in the world now 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.170
 Sisters 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:35.110
 Not interesting 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:41.830
 So do not do the ranking, such as in battle, but clearly such as the score of 1-person play 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.850
 I would like to devise something in the elements decided by the notification 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.670
 play 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.829
 Extreme one-man aim 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.990
 Repeat self-destruction 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:58.050
 It referee seafood snow that does not matter intentional or not crab 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:01:04.820
 I would like to do something devised the elements that are decided to do what quack of Raka 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.820
 There is score competition in another play one person play on the net 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:17.880
 The time that can not be connected will increase as the number of times increases 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:22.640
 In addition, please be aware that you will be subject to penalty even if you call it in vain 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.640
 I just want to introduce the battle character 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:32.220
 There will also be assist figures to assist fighters 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:36.330
 Here too, it is an aspect of the all-star game, so I would like to include it as much as possible 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.040
 It does not do rankings definitive in such matchups since 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:46.710
 The sounded name is displayed 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.710
 The player who made a nuisance is laid in front of me, but from this sound studio 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.220
 Please cooperate for the construction of a comfortable competition environment 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.409
