the<00:00:10.890> performance<00:00:11.370> mode<00:00:11.640> is<00:00:11.910> designed<00:00:12.300> for

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
the performance mode is designed for

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.830 
the performance mode is designed for
using<00:00:12.930> your<00:00:13.080> profiler<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.920> live<00:00:14.370> situations

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
using your profiler in live situations

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.779 
using your profiler in live situations
it<00:00:15.840> allows<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.500> organize<00:00:16.950> your<00:00:16.980> live<00:00:17.430> set

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
it allows you to organize your live set

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.220 
it allows you to organize your live set
into<00:00:19.070> 125<00:00:20.090> performances<00:00:21.090> each<00:00:21.570> performance

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
into 125 performances each performance

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.009 
into 125 performances each performance
can<00:00:22.650> host<00:00:22.860> five<00:00:23.280> different<00:00:23.789> rigs<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.300> what<00:00:24.840> we

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
can host five different rigs in what we

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.859 
can host five different rigs in what we
call<00:00:25.230> slots<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:26.099> very<00:00:26.730> common<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.269> practical

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
call slots a very common and practical

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.079 
call slots a very common and practical
approach<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:29.189> create<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.609> separate

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.089 
approach is to create a separate

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.390 
approach is to create a separate
performance<00:00:30.720> for<00:00:31.109> every<00:00:31.439> song<00:00:31.679> which<00:00:32.130> gives

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
performance for every song which gives

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.310 
performance for every song which gives
you<00:00:32.550> up<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.940> five<00:00:33.150> different<00:00:33.390> rigs<00:00:33.810> for<00:00:34.170> each

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
you up to five different rigs for each
