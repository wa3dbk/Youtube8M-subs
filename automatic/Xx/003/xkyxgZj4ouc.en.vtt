00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
TV diesel year 2000 and I've done half

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.290 
TV diesel year 2000 and I've done half
the<00:00:09.750> work<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.590> get<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.830> turbo<00:00:11.280> out<00:00:11.519> which<00:00:12.150> is

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
the work to get the turbo out which is

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.230 
the work to get the turbo out which is
attached<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.960> exhaust<00:00:13.019> manifold<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.240> you

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
attached to the exhaust manifold and you

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.450 
attached to the exhaust manifold and you
can<00:00:15.420> see<00:00:15.660> there's<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.960> lot<00:00:16.109> more<00:00:16.379> room<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.190> work

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
can see there's a lot more room to work

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.240 
can see there's a lot more room to work
in<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> bay<00:00:18.180> now<00:00:18.529> so<00:00:19.529> if<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:19.859> talk<00:00:20.039> you

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
in the bay now so if I just talk you

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.950 
in the bay now so if I just talk you
through<00:00:20.430> what<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.699> did<00:00:20.789> first<00:00:21.210> first<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.840> all

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
through what I did first first of all

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.279 
through what I did first first of all
remove<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> airbox<00:00:23.269> is<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.420> UK<00:00:24.779> model<00:00:25.170> so

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
remove the airbox is a UK model so

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.800 
remove the airbox is a UK model so
everything's<00:00:25.619> probably<00:00:26.269> on<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> other<00:00:27.510> side

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
everything's probably on the other side

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.999 
everything's probably on the other side
so<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.380> airbox<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.949> removed<00:00:29.310> there

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
so the airbox is removed there

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.049 
so the airbox is removed there
then<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.719> took<00:00:33.719> that's<00:00:34.200> her<00:00:34.500> bow<00:00:34.829> pipe<00:00:35.760> off

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
then I took that's her bow pipe off

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.049 
then I took that's her bow pipe off
which<00:00:36.899> was<00:00:37.050> difficult<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.620> get<00:00:37.800> out<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.370> that

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
which was difficult to get out and that

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.110 
which was difficult to get out and that
it's<00:00:39.239> attached<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.920> bottom<00:00:41.460> right<00:00:41.760> down

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
it's attached the bottom right down

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.400 
it's attached the bottom right down
there<00:00:42.500> with<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.739> jubilee<00:00:44.489> clip<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.410> that's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
there with a jubilee clip and that's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.670 
there with a jubilee clip and that's
quite<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> big<00:00:46.950> old<00:00:47.100> pipe<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.550> comes<00:00:47.700> off<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
quite a big old pipe that comes off the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.330 
quite a big old pipe that comes off the
pipes<00:00:50.180> to<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.329> airbox<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:52.649> come<00:00:52.949> off<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
pipes to the airbox have come off and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.639 
pipes to the airbox have come off and
there's<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.480> goes<00:00:54.719> there<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
there's one that goes there on the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.500 
there's one that goes there on the
intercooler<00:00:56.870> it's<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.140> jubilee<00:00:58.530> clip<00:00:59.510> and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
intercooler it's just a jubilee clip and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.740 
intercooler it's just a jubilee clip and
the<00:01:00.629> other<00:01:00.870> one<00:01:02.030> goes<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.300> top<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the other one goes to the top of the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.600 
the other one goes to the top of the
turbo<00:01:04.820> which<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.210> down<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.510> there<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.680> that's

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
turbo which is down in there and that's

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.240 
turbo which is down in there and that's
a<00:01:08.760> jubilee<00:01:09.240> clip<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.659> well

it<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:16.790> then<00:02:17.569> down<00:02:17.870> here<00:02:17.900> we<00:02:18.769> turn<00:02:19.069> around<00:02:20.230> you

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
it and then down here we turn around you

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.670 
it and then down here we turn around you
can<00:02:21.500> see<00:02:22.420> I've<00:02:23.420> done<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.810> same<00:02:24.019> again<00:02:24.349> here

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
can see I've done the same again here

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.949 
can see I've done the same again here
put<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.040> bag<00:02:25.340> over<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.599> ends<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.430> vacuum

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
put a bag over the ends of the vacuum

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.990 
put a bag over the ends of the vacuum
pipe<00:02:29.959> stop<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.349> dirt<00:02:30.560> getting<00:02:30.799> his<00:02:31.040> quiet<00:02:31.400> and

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
pipe stop the dirt getting his quiet and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.270 
pipe stop the dirt getting his quiet and
then<00:02:32.090> tuck<00:02:32.299> that<00:02:32.420> out<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.750> way<00:02:33.280> underneath

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
then tuck that out the way underneath

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.600 
then tuck that out the way underneath
there<00:02:34.700> that's<00:02:35.410> right<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:37.040> it's<00:02:37.220> quite<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.459> lot

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
there that's right so it's quite a lot

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.180 
there that's right so it's quite a lot
of<00:02:37.640> room<00:02:37.819> to<00:02:38.060> move<00:02:38.209> in<00:02:38.480> there<00:02:38.660> now<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:42.190> the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
of room to move in there now the the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.630 
of room to move in there now the the
breather<00:02:43.519> catch<00:02:43.910> tank<00:02:44.390> was<00:02:44.930> attached<00:02:45.470> here<00:02:46.400> to

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
breather catch tank was attached here to

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.569 
breather catch tank was attached here to
this<00:02:46.760> loose<00:02:47.260> fitting<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:49.040> breather<00:02:49.280> tank

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
this loose fitting and the breather tank

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.610 
this loose fitting and the breather tank
is<00:02:49.700> black<00:02:50.000> plastic<00:02:50.390> it's<00:02:50.840> not<00:02:50.900> there<00:02:51.170> as<00:02:51.440> you

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
is black plastic it's not there as you

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.670 
is black plastic it's not there as you
can't<00:02:51.829> see<00:02:52.099> it<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.420> was<00:02:53.690> attached<00:02:54.650> to

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
can't see it and that was attached to

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.509 
can't see it and that was attached to
that<00:02:55.069> screw<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.379> screws<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.129> came<00:02:58.370> off

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
that screw and that screws that came off

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.970 
that screw and that screws that came off
quite<00:02:58.760> easily<00:02:59.530> there's<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.590> recirculating

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
quite easily there's a recirculating

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.849 
quite easily there's a recirculating
water<00:03:03.980> pipe<00:03:04.760> which<00:03:05.239> has<00:03:05.989> been<00:03:06.200> pulled<00:03:06.470> up<00:03:06.680> on

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
water pipe which has been pulled up on

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.870 
water pipe which has been pulled up on
the<00:03:06.889> top<00:03:07.190> there<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:09.430> you'll<00:03:10.430> see<00:03:10.639> where<00:03:10.850> it

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
the top there and you'll see where it

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.550 
the top there and you'll see where it
goes<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.569> other<00:03:11.690> end<00:03:11.989> it's<00:03:12.470> still

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
goes to the other end it's still

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.449 
goes to the other end it's still
attached<00:03:13.120> go<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.420> water<00:03:14.600> tank<00:03:15.459> just

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
attached go to the water tank just

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.229 
attached go to the water tank just
around<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.819> corner<00:03:17.120> there<00:03:17.739> so<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:20.150> only

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
around the corner there so the only

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.660 
around the corner there so the only
other<00:03:20.389> poets<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:20.989> have<00:03:21.079> come<00:03:21.319> off<00:03:21.560> are<00:03:22.069> the

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
other poets that have come off are the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.729 
other poets that have come off are the
breather<00:03:23.000> pipe<00:03:23.389> here<00:03:23.750> which<00:03:23.930> goes<00:03:24.170> from<00:03:24.530> the

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
breather pipe here which goes from the

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.180 
breather pipe here which goes from the
rocker<00:03:25.639> box<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.900> catch<00:03:27.440> tank<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:28.010> black

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
rocker box to the catch tank the black

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.039 
rocker box to the catch tank the black
catch<00:03:28.459> tank<00:03:28.819> which<00:03:29.389> catches<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:30.109> oil<00:03:30.919> fumes

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
catch tank which catches the oil fumes

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.210 
catch tank which catches the oil fumes
recirculates<00:03:33.049> the<00:03:33.200> fumes<00:03:33.560> back<00:03:33.829> in<00:03:34.010> but

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
recirculates the fumes back in but

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.409 
recirculates the fumes back in but
catches<00:03:34.579> here<00:03:34.730> so<00:03:34.910> I'll<00:03:35.000> strip<00:03:35.239> that<00:03:35.359> down

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
catches here so I'll strip that down

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.699 
catches here so I'll strip that down
later<00:03:35.780> it's<00:03:36.109> probably<00:03:36.500> got<00:03:37.220> oil<00:03:37.459> in<00:03:37.609> it<00:03:37.760> and

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
later it's probably got oil in it and

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.870 
later it's probably got oil in it and
the<00:03:39.709> next<00:03:39.980> stage<00:03:41.230> is<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.290> take<00:03:42.799> the<00:03:43.639> heat

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
the next stage is to take the heat

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.659 
the next stage is to take the heat
shield<00:03:44.780> off<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:47.169> there's<00:03:48.169> the<00:03:48.590> first<00:03:49.099> bolt<00:03:49.489> for

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
shield off so there's the first bolt for

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.479 
shield off so there's the first bolt for
the<00:03:49.730> heat<00:03:49.910> shield<00:03:50.209> and<00:03:50.560> our<00:03:51.560> stuff<00:03:51.889> the<00:03:52.040> camera

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
the heat shield and our stuff the camera

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.370 
the heat shield and our stuff the camera
in<00:03:52.730> there<00:03:52.940> but<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.120> probably<00:03:53.419> won't<00:03:53.660> see<00:03:53.840> it

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
in there but you probably won't see it

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.059 
in there but you probably won't see it
cuz<00:03:54.590> it's<00:03:54.739> bright<00:03:55.130> down<00:03:55.459> inside<00:03:56.470> there<00:03:57.470> and

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
cuz it's bright down inside there and

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.020 
cuz it's bright down inside there and
there's<00:03:58.459> another<00:03:58.849> bolt<00:03:59.299> so<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:00.440> heat<00:04:00.650> shield

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
there's another bolt so that heat shield

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.470 
there's another bolt so that heat shield
through<00:04:02.030> there<00:04:02.389> and<00:04:03.489> then<00:04:04.489> there's<00:04:04.730> one<00:04:05.060> more

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
through there and then there's one more

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.780 
through there and then there's one more
I<00:04:05.840> point<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.859> camera<00:04:07.069> down<00:04:07.220> you<00:04:07.489> probably<00:04:07.700> on

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
I point the camera down you probably on

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.030 
I point the camera down you probably on
see<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.150> it's<00:04:08.959> down<00:04:09.230> to<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.590> left<00:04:09.799> of<00:04:09.980> the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
see it it's down to the left of the

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.480 
see it it's down to the left of the
turbo<00:04:10.519> pipe<00:04:11.200> right<00:04:12.200> down<00:04:12.409> the<00:04:12.560> bottom<00:04:12.890> there

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
turbo pipe right down the bottom there

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.970 
turbo pipe right down the bottom there
I'll<00:04:13.640> put<00:04:13.850> a<00:04:13.880> bit<00:04:14.030> of<00:04:14.410> penetrating<00:04:15.410> fluid<00:04:15.680> on

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
I'll put a bit of penetrating fluid on

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.650 
I'll put a bit of penetrating fluid on
there<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:18.440> loosens<00:04:18.920> them<00:04:19.100> up<00:04:19.250> then<00:04:20.000> when

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
there so it loosens them up then when

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.050 
there so it loosens them up then when
the<00:04:20.780> shields<00:04:21.380> off<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:22.310> next<00:04:22.580> stage<00:04:22.790> would<00:04:23.000> be

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
the shields off the next stage would be

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.470 
the shields off the next stage would be
to<00:04:23.390> get<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:24.280> air<00:04:25.280> manifold<00:04:25.940> off<00:04:26.150> which<00:04:26.360> is

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
to get the air manifold off which is

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.860 
to get the air manifold off which is
this<00:04:26.600> big<00:04:26.840> aluminium<00:04:27.620> thing<00:04:27.920> here<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:29.630> do

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
this big aluminium thing here and to do

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.550 
this big aluminium thing here and to do
that

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
that

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.340 
that
it's<00:04:31.010> just<00:04:31.340> straightforward<00:04:31.610> with<00:04:32.240> nuts<00:04:33.170> and

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
it's just straightforward with nuts and

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.190 
it's just straightforward with nuts and
bolts<00:04:33.770> you<00:04:34.370> see<00:04:34.640> a<00:04:34.670> couple<00:04:35.120> under<00:04:35.480> there<00:04:35.690> the

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
bolts you see a couple under there the

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.960 
bolts you see a couple under there the
one<00:04:36.350> on<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.590> left<00:04:36.800> is<00:04:36.950> for<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.280> air<00:04:37.400> manifold

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
one on the left is for the air manifold

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.960 
one on the left is for the air manifold
the<00:04:38.390> one<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.630> right<00:04:38.780> is<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.320> exhaust

out<00:04:47.380> there's<00:04:48.380> four<00:04:48.710> bolts<00:04:48.920> on<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.640> top<00:04:49.670> there

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
out there's four bolts on the top there

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.960 
out there's four bolts on the top there
that's<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.630> feed<00:04:51.620> into<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.280> air<00:04:52.400> manifold

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
that's the feed into the air manifold

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.030 
that's the feed into the air manifold
and<00:04:54.670> there's<00:04:55.670> another<00:04:56.260> bolt<00:04:57.260> there<00:04:57.590> probably

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
and there's another bolt there probably

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.800 
and there's another bolt there probably
one<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.220> other<00:04:58.430> side<00:04:58.700> and<00:04:59.030> then<00:04:59.360> it's<00:04:59.540> just<00:04:59.690> a

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
one the other side and then it's just a

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.110

look<00:05:46.460> at<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:46.760> turbo<00:05:47.000> cause<00:05:47.420> you<00:05:47.480> can<00:05:47.600> actually

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
look at the turbo cause you can actually

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.060 
look at the turbo cause you can actually
see<00:05:48.170> it<00:05:48.260> now<00:05:48.380> and<00:05:48.440> that's<00:05:48.530> what<00:05:48.740> I'm<00:05:48.830> taking

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
see it now and that's what I'm taking

see it now and that's what I'm taking
out<00:05:49.430> it's<00:05:49.820> right<00:05:50.210> down<00:05:50.600> inside<00:05:50.840> the<00:05:51.260> engine

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
out it's right down inside the engine

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.170 
out it's right down inside the engine
there<00:05:51.830> underneath<00:05:52.540> -<00:05:53.540> to<00:05:53.720> the<00:05:53.810> manifold<00:05:54.610> so<00:05:55.610> if

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
there underneath - to the manifold so if

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.430 
there underneath - to the manifold so if
I<00:05:56.330> come<00:05:56.690> out<00:05:56.900> now<00:05:57.250> and<00:05:58.250> switch<00:05:58.790> to<00:05:59.440> long

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
I come out now and switch to long

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:08.420 
I come out now and switch to long
distance

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430
