because we stayed at home during that

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.060 
because we stayed at home during that

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
time in a decade I actually saw us make

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.920 
time in a decade I actually saw us make

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
a plan you know execute it and then

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.570 
a plan you know execute it and then
actually<00:00:28.199> have<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.619> pay<00:00:28.769> off<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.220> was<00:00:29.279> so

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
actually have it pay off and it was so

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.460 
actually have it pay off and it was so

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
fulfilling to see that happen and then

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.590 
fulfilling to see that happen and then

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
abilities because not only is he driving

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.100 
abilities because not only is he driving
down<00:02:05.390> something<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.509> potentially<00:02:06.600> flip

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
down something that potentially flip

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.040 
down something that potentially flip
over<00:02:07.729> just<00:02:08.729> himself<00:02:09.090> he's<00:02:09.300> got<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.810> know<00:02:09.869> he's

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
