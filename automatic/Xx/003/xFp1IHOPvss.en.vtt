00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
placement games and after that you're

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.950

put<00:00:11.490> into<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.700> division<00:00:12.059> after<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.690> put<00:00:12.840> new

based solely off your win-loss ratio the
only<00:00:17.130> thing<00:00:17.310> I'm<00:00:17.430> not<00:00:17.460> really<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.850> fan<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.119> is

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
only thing I'm not really a fan of is

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.240 
only thing I'm not really a fan of is
how<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.570> game<00:00:18.779> places<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.410> into<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> division

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
how the game places you into a division

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.890 
how the game places you into a division
for<00:00:20.490> example<00:00:20.550> my<00:00:20.939> friend<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.359> played<00:00:21.660> and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
for example my friend and I played and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900 
for example my friend and I played and
won<00:00:22.080> all<00:00:22.109> 10<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.590> our<00:00:22.740> placement<00:00:22.949> games<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.550> I

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
won all 10 of our placement games and I

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.609 
won all 10 of our placement games and I
was<00:00:24.090> placed<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.420> gold<00:00:24.660> but<00:00:24.869> he<00:00:25.140> was<00:00:25.289> placed<00:00:25.500> in

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
was placed in gold but he was placed in

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.259 
was placed in gold but he was placed in
onyx<00:00:25.890> now<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.310> only<00:00:26.550> logical<00:00:26.970> reason<00:00:27.240> for

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
onyx now the only logical reason for

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.000 
onyx now the only logical reason for
this<00:00:27.510> happening<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.140> your<00:00:28.289> k/d<00:00:28.470> must<00:00:28.830> be

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
this happening is that your k/d must be

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.410 
this happening is that your k/d must be
heavily<00:00:29.279> weighted<00:00:29.580> during<00:00:30.029> your<00:00:30.210> 10

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
heavily weighted during your 10

heavily weighted during your 10
placement<00:00:30.869> games<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.529> frustrating<00:00:31.710> for

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
placement games this is frustrating for

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.810 
placement games this is frustrating for
a<00:00:32.130> few<00:00:32.340> reasons

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
a few reasons

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.729 
a few reasons
one<00:00:33.030> it's<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.480> team<00:00:33.660> effort<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.050> stats<00:00:34.440> don't

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
one it's a team effort and stats don't

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.290 
one it's a team effort and stats don't
often<00:00:34.950> account<00:00:35.399> for<00:00:35.579> everything<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.030> two

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
often account for everything and two

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.209 
often account for everything and two

performance promotes baiting teammates
and<00:00:41.340> ultimately<00:00:41.790> negates<00:00:42.180> teamwork<00:00:42.600> granted

this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.350> only<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.680> beta<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.460> had<00:00:44.550> to

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
this is only a beta but I really had to

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.440 
this is only a beta but I really had to
get<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.820> off<00:00:44.879> my<00:00:45.000> chest

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
get that off my chest

the<00:00:45.570> gameplay<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.050> other<00:00:46.200> hand<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.469> pretty

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the gameplay on the other hand is pretty

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.650 
the gameplay on the other hand is pretty
smooth<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.190> UI<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.520> clean<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> maps<00:00:48.480> are

next<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.250> want<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> talk<00:01:14.610> about<00:01:14.850> gun<00:01:15.090> balance<00:01:15.509> I

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
next I want to talk about gun balance I

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.359 
next I want to talk about gun balance I
like<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> fact<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.470> picking<00:01:16.890> up<00:01:17.009> almost

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
like the fact that picking up almost

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280 
like the fact that picking up almost
every<00:01:17.729> weapon<00:01:17.880> now<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.360> viable<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
every weapon now is viable because it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.990 
every weapon now is viable because it
wasn't<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.950> past<00:01:20.159> Halo<00:01:20.400> games<00:01:20.640> for

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.620 
were screwing around because the kill

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
increased however in my opinion the AR

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.109 
increased however in my opinion the AR

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
I don't really care if they decrease the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.230 
I don't really care if they decrease the
damage<00:01:37.590> or<00:01:37.979> increase<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.579> bullet<00:01:38.790> spread<00:01:38.970> but

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
damage or increase the bullet spread but

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.609 
damage or increase the bullet spread but
something<00:01:39.630> definitely<00:01:40.049> needs<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.350> change
