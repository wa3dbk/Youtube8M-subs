00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
100 stones but then it will be next as

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.750 
100 stones but then it will be next as
you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.210> see<00:01:06.450> here<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.900> says<00:01:06.930> full<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.189> i<00:01:08.610> also

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
speed during the spin actually slows

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.730 
speed during the spin actually slows
down<00:04:47.060> okay<00:04:48.060> take<00:04:48.630> a<00:04:48.660> look<00:04:50.480> that<00:04:51.480> damage<00:04:51.960> nice

ma'am nice all animation is improved
it's<00:04:59.370> really<00:04:59.550> nice<00:04:59.850> like<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.680> spin<00:05:01.680> get

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
it's really nice like the spin get

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.100 
it's really nice like the spin get
spirals<00:05:03.300> like<00:05:03.870> upwards<00:05:04.380> now<00:05:05.570> and<00:05:06.570> followed<00:05:06.930> by

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
spirals like upwards now and followed by

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.430 
spirals like upwards now and followed by
the<00:05:07.170> smashing<00:05:07.890> hit<00:05:08.340> on<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.640> last<00:05:08.880> ten<00:05:09.290> on<00:05:10.290> the

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
the smashing hit on the last ten on the

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.730 
the smashing hit on the last ten on the
after<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.160> last<00:05:11.340> bin<00:05:12.440> beautiful<00:05:13.440> let's<00:05:13.650> uh

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
after the last bin beautiful let's uh

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.490 
after the last bin beautiful let's uh
maybe<00:05:16.740> let's<00:05:16.920> test<00:05:17.460> it<00:05:17.580> out<00:05:17.700> on<00:05:18.380> some<00:05:19.380> other

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
maybe let's test it out on some other

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.790 
maybe let's test it out on some other
modes

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.300 

let's<00:05:25.430> do<00:05:25.699> this<00:05:28.389> see<00:05:29.389> if<00:05:29.569> I<00:05:29.659> can<00:05:30.069> break<00:05:31.069> the

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
let's do this see if I can break the

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:42.879 
let's do this see if I can break the
kill<00:05:31.580> record<00:05:36.759> wow<00:05:37.759> look<00:05:38.419> at<00:05:38.509> that<00:05:41.650> nice<00:05:42.650> nice

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
kill record wow look at that nice nice

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.290 
kill record wow look at that nice nice
nice

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.399 

the<00:05:48.870> move<00:05:49.199> speed<00:05:49.590> is<00:05:49.740> decreased<00:05:50.340> but<00:05:50.639> the

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
the move speed is decreased but the

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:56.420 
the move speed is decreased but the
damage<00:05:52.409> is<00:05:52.440> increased<00:05:53.099> by<00:05:53.460> a<00:05:53.669> lot<00:05:53.970> so<00:05:55.430> really

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
damage is increased by a lot so really

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.700 
damage is increased by a lot so really
nice<00:05:56.849> I<00:05:57.150> mean<00:05:57.479> with<00:05:57.780> this<00:05:57.960> crate<00:05:58.229> early<00:05:58.560> you

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
nice I mean with this crate early you

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.950 
nice I mean with this crate early you
can<00:05:58.919> still<00:05:59.250> have<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.789> mobility<00:06:00.240> that<00:06:00.810> you

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
can still have the mobility that you

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.290 
can still have the mobility that you
will<00:06:01.080> need<00:06:01.229> all<00:06:02.599> look<00:06:03.599> at<00:06:03.720> this<00:06:04.970> for<00:06:05.970> the<00:06:06.120> last

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
will need all look at this for the last

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.129 
will need all look at this for the last
seat<00:06:06.599> is<00:06:06.780> actually<00:06:06.930> like<00:06:07.409> three<00:06:07.979> or<00:06:08.250> four<00:06:08.280> hips

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
seat is actually like three or four hips

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:15.239 
seat is actually like three or four hips
if<00:06:10.139> you<00:06:10.289> watch<00:06:10.470> carefully

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:15.249 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:20.909 

custody<00:06:16.149> X<00:06:17.249> so<00:06:18.249> I<00:06:18.279> guess<00:06:18.639> I<00:06:19.469> probably<00:06:20.469> stop

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
custody X so I guess I probably stop

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.409 
custody X so I guess I probably stop
leveling<00:06:21.569> this<00:06:22.569> skill<00:06:22.929> up<00:06:23.199> and<00:06:24.059> I<00:06:25.059> wouldn't<00:06:25.359> be
