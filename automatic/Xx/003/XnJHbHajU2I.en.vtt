00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.480
 welcome to vargas greets you with 

00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:08.450
 taste on this occasion within the 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.839
 Basic techniques of confectionery presented 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:16.219
 How to crystallize tangerine peels 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:19.939
 orange or lemon this procedure 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:23.300
 It requires more patience than anything 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.090
 the time that we take to boil 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.520
 for three consecutive days the 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.070
 husks 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:35.090
 we started washing our citrus and 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:39.620
 be mandarin lemon or orange to squirt 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:44.870
 of water and brush once we have 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:48.920
 washing the fruits we proceed to cut them 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:52.270
 by half or in quarters and we proceed to 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.870
 remove the pulp from the fruit 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:59.530
 we will use the pulp to make juice 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.400
 in previous video I have shown how to do 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.790
 tangerine chocolates 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:10.440
 once ready the shells we put to 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:14.120
 boil water and we will serve the peel 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.120
 citrus that we are using 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:22.680
 cover and let boil for 3 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.680
 minutes 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:32.520
 after three minutes 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:35.700
 we drain the water in which the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.770
 shells and we rinsed jet 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.990
 Water 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:46.190
 we boil water again 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:50.870
 and we return to boil the husks 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:54.290
 let boil 3 more minutes 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.850
 after this time we throw 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.860
 again the water in which they served 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.070
 the shells 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.729
 we rinse with water jet and we will return 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.119
 to boil three more minutes is 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.030
 necessary to repeat this operation seven 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.120
 times to remove the bitterness of the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.790
 peel once they have boiled 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.530
 shells seven times we put in a 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:27.370
 case of copper the sugar and water and 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.580
 We carry on fire to form a syrup that 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.150
 have the temperature of 100 degrees 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.299
 centigrade when the syrup has this 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:42.160
 temperature we place the husks of the 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:45.670
 citrus and let boil 5 minutes 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.900
 moving from time to time with care 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:53.670
 to prevent the shells from breaking 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:58.590
 once they have boiled let cool 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:02.590
 for 24 hours the next day 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:07.140
 we take back to the fire and we will leave 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.140
 boil 5 more minutes 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.810
 put out the fire and let cool 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:20.530
 again for 24 hours 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:24.350
 On the third day, we boil the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.080
 shells 5 minutes 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.200
 once they have been boiled 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:34.340
 shells for the third time we let cool 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.030
 in the Caribbean and already cold we proceed to 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.020
 place them on a grid so that they 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.710
 drain 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:48.030
 in this grid the shells will dry 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:50.819
 for 24 or 48 hours 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.950
 You can use this procedure 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.090
 with orange peels like what 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.830
 we appreciate in this part of the video 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.510
 I hope this video was from his 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.510
 I liked until next time
