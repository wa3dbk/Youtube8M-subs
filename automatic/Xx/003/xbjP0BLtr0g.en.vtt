00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.100
 ae 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:09.479
 ae 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.250
 Speak there, crazy crazy. All right. 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.270
 you 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:22.210
 so here who fails the revolution and 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.099
 today only with one more video then 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.340
 Used I'm here today to give 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.590
 a not so good news, and I 'll have to 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.309
 unfortunately is landing in a series 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.309
 which I liked very much 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.989
 Let's just say it's pausing, right? I'm not. 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.809
 Canceling, I 'm pausing for some 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.489
 time the series of inequality I know 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.089
 that's too bad, because I too 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.940
 I was enjoying doing the show but I had 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:51.760
 some problems that were occurring 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.800
 as you could realize in the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.409
 first in the second and third video 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.620
 I started every time I started 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.870
 different because for now on 15 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.030
 It is not that old if you go into 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.640
 an American server it was a profile 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.380
 that entered a Brazilian server he 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.670
 create another profile but it was max 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.729
 two profiles 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.740
 now every brain that enters it that a 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.010
 new profile then it means if I 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.340
 enter god and I do not know about server 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.250
 Brazil it will create 10 profile of 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.070
 Give it so it's too bad for it there 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.460
 runs away or the guy's life and I already tried 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.040
 save the name of the Serbian already tried to save 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.230
 the server there to try to enter all the time 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.930
 but it seems that the staff it creates a 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.860
 a server then closes it sometime 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.780
 understood the only option that 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.970
 left over was trying to do in some 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.400
 services is not what it is that 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.070
 some American senators who are 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.440
 definite did not but I do not have 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:02:00.490
 a very good video card and my pink 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:02.700
 stay there, I do not know if it rains 1514 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.960
 so it gets very bad, you can not record 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.510
 unfortunately an attitude that I will have 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.050
 than to take more at least for now and 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.060
 I decided to put a series in place of the vice 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.090
 a series that many people have already 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.110
 asking what money is brain is from 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.560
 Minecraft 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.090
 So I'll do a video there and go. 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.400
 to go on the line of making 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.800
 I'll be transferring the series here and 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.280
 who does not like minecraft will have to 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.050
 liked another detonated that mw3 is not 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.300
 now I'm finishing around 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.810
 mw3 will then stay at the detonation of the 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.030
 walking dead and will be as standard 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.340
 realm brain beauty and I hope you guys 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.120
 I really like many people. 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.830
 they will like 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.450
 How long will it take for you to stay? 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.940
 to wait and see whether to launch a 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.770
 new update to see if it will 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.430
 To improve this, I do not know how it goes. 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.860
 to be 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.989
 or maybe wait for the game to launch the 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:01.420
 own mode is because to be able to get to 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.970
 playing right is actually a game 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.610
 launching the mode itself does not actually have 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.650
 a game did not even say its way 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.200
 in case it is a template of ten problems 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.780
 Well, let's see how it goes. 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.570
 Dude, I'll have the blog now. 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.489
 in that channel that revolution and then 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.700
 that end we will see if I can 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.890
 record a video of deise I do not me 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.580
 can i do the world i series that is 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.239
 a game very similar to daisy ta 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.430
 and even better than daisy she and I saw 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.290
 After I'm going to do something else 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.560
 It's up to me, my staff, that I 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.989
 enough I tried at least to achieve 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.890
 the same items is prepared same place 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:47.410
 which is not a series if you every time 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.910
 GravatÃ¡ in a part of the place nÃ© sic pra 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.040
 be a series d have to stop in one place 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.440
 and then when to start recording tanak 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.360
 where you left off and that's not the way it is. 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.510
 happening then neither was it being a 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.700
 series and offends bete was half low 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.160
 as well as views for example 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.790
 the first video he gave two thousand and 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.700
 few wince until it's good 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.970
 359 lights is given to accept 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.200
 in the second video 2 thousand and a few 20 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.350
 Great, too. 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.350
 222 beauty lights there on the third 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.479
 video of one thousand four hundred 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.750
 133 lights pon 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.570
 It seems that you have no regard for me. 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.850
 It's expensive because the videos right they already 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.830
 are big so imagine to edit 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.110
 it occupied me almost all the midday 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.210
 I could be playing a game and 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.180
 dictating the videos 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.430
 so I ask now for all the videos 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.560
 who posted personal or we will not have 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.900
 Let's go there, let's go to the Caribbean. 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.900
 because otherwise it is bad for me understand 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.750
 getting ugly because you imagine the 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.820
 face kills making the videos bet on 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.380
 Look the video goes there and closes for no 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.190
 help or disclosure how do I go 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.860
 to know if people are liking 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.740
 understood the next videos 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.530
 come on come on qa then I said 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.419
 I saw it fell a little so let's go back 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.280
 pro hair single is a series that much 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.340
 people were liking another channel, I'm going 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.050
 're making a warning and then maybe do not say 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.300
 This week I do not know if it's going to be 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.490
 week in the other I 'll start beauty 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.010
 so it's really sorry sorry there 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.370
 That's a lot said until the next video 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.370
 went
