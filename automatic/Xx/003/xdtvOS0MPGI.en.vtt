00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.910 
and I store them sideways in a big
basket<00:03:32.720> but<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.870> wasn't<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.290> functional

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
basket but that wasn't that functional

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.880 
basket but that wasn't that functional
for<00:03:35.130> me<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.900> started<00:03:36.900> running<00:03:36.989> out<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.230> space<00:03:37.560> it

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
for me I started running out of space it

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.009 
for me I started running out of space it
wasn't<00:03:38.190> covered<00:03:38.400> so<00:03:39.390> I<00:03:39.450> had<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.690> come<00:03:39.870> up<00:03:39.900> with

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
wasn't covered so I had to come up with

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.430 
wasn't covered so I had to come up with
something<00:03:40.500> else<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:41.060> in<00:03:42.060> these<00:03:42.300> boxes<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:43.110> need

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
something else and in these boxes I need

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.350 
something else and in these boxes I need
smaller<00:03:43.800> size<00:03:44.100> schools<00:03:44.459> so<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:44.700> use<00:03:44.880> about<00:03:45.030> this

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
smaller size schools so I use about this

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.570 
smaller size schools so I use about this
size<00:03:45.630> right<00:03:45.930> here<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.440> then<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:46.980> still<00:03:47.250> use<00:03:47.400> my

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
size right here and then I still use my

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.660 
size right here and then I still use my
product<00:03:48.000> packaging<00:03:49.280> another<00:03:50.280> thing<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.640> I

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
product packaging another thing that I

wrapped them I saw this video on I saw
this<00:04:43.720> on<00:04:43.930> somebody's<00:04:44.290> video<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.890> while<00:04:45.490> ago<00:04:45.760> and

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
this on somebody's video a while ago and

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.710 
this on somebody's video a while ago and
I<00:04:45.940> can't<00:04:46.180> remember<00:04:46.360> who<00:04:48.030> but<00:04:49.030> I<00:04:49.060> was<00:04:49.360> looking

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
I can't remember who but I was looking

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.230 
I can't remember who but I was looking
up<00:04:49.870> also<00:04:50.380> ways<00:04:50.920> to<00:04:51.160> store<00:04:51.370> laces<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:51.910> trim<00:04:52.060> and

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
up also ways to store laces and trim and

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.480 
up also ways to store laces and trim and
I<00:04:52.270> came<00:04:52.480> across<00:04:52.690> this<00:04:52.960> video<00:04:53.170> so<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.190> cards

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
I came across this video so the cards

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.700 
I came across this video so the cards
are<00:04:54.610> like<00:04:54.700> a<00:04:54.760> 2<00:04:55.090> by<00:04:55.300> 3<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:55.990> I<00:04:56.170> just<00:04:56.350> wrapped<00:04:56.590> the

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
are like a 2 by 3 and I just wrapped the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.790 
are like a 2 by 3 and I just wrapped the
the<00:04:57.670> eyelet<00:04:58.360> trim<00:04:58.540> on<00:04:58.750> them<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:59.170> store<00:04:59.620> them

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
the eyelet trim on them and store them

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.260 
the eyelet trim on them and store them
in<00:04:59.890> there<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:00.310> love<00:05:00.550> it<00:05:00.700> because<00:05:01.000> you<00:05:01.030> can

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
in there and I love it because you can

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.760 
in there and I love it because you can
just<00:05:01.390> pull<00:05:01.600> off<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.780> lid<00:05:02.080> and<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.380> see<00:05:02.560> all<00:05:02.740> of

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
just pull off the lid and you see all of

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.250 
just pull off the lid and you see all of
the<00:05:03.160> ones<00:05:03.340> that<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:03.580> have<00:05:03.610> I<00:05:04.150> guess<00:05:04.780> if<00:05:04.930> I<00:05:05.050> had

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
the ones that you have I guess if I had

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.050 
the ones that you have I guess if I had
more<00:05:05.500> than<00:05:05.560> what<00:05:05.950> fit<00:05:06.220> in<00:05:06.340> in<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.820> shoebox

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
more than what fit in in the shoebox

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.150 
more than what fit in in the shoebox
then<00:05:07.600> it<00:05:07.780> might<00:05:07.930> not<00:05:08.110> be<00:05:08.260> that<00:05:08.290> functional<00:05:08.950> but

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
then it might not be that functional but

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.210 
then it might not be that functional but
I<00:05:09.630> really<00:05:10.630> like<00:05:10.810> it<00:05:10.990> this<00:05:11.140> way<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:11.710> then<00:05:12.100> this

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
I really like it this way and then this

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.090 
I really like it this way and then this
one<00:05:12.430> also<00:05:12.610> holds<00:05:13.120> all<00:05:13.270> my<00:05:13.300> crocheted<00:05:13.900> ones<00:05:14.140> so

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
one also holds all my crocheted ones so

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.710 
one also holds all my crocheted ones so
same<00:05:15.340> thing<00:05:15.370> and<00:05:15.670> you<00:05:15.730> can<00:05:15.880> kind<00:05:16.090> of<00:05:16.180> see<00:05:16.390> the

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
same thing and you can kind of see the

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.070 
same thing and you can kind of see the
the<00:05:17.080> styles<00:05:17.530> of<00:05:17.680> the<00:05:17.740> laces<00:05:18.250> on<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.670> sides

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
the styles of the laces on the sides

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.010 
the styles of the laces on the sides
without<00:05:20.080> taking<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.500> lid<00:05:20.710> off<00:05:20.740> and<00:05:21.780> then<00:05:22.780> in

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
without taking the lid off and then in

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.650 
without taking the lid off and then in
this<00:05:23.230> box<00:05:23.530> here<00:05:23.920> I<00:05:24.190> store<00:05:24.490> my<00:05:24.700> specialty<00:05:25.270> vases

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
this box here I store my specialty vases

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.350 
this box here I store my specialty vases
and<00:05:25.690> trims<00:05:26.340> so<00:05:27.340> I<00:05:27.370> kind<00:05:27.700> of<00:05:27.760> altered<00:05:28.150> it<00:05:28.270> a

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
and trims so I kind of altered it a

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.700 
and trims so I kind of altered it a
little<00:05:28.630> bit<00:05:28.750> to<00:05:28.930> make<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.110> a<00:05:29.320> little<00:05:29.440> more

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
little bit to make it a little more

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.620 
little bit to make it a little more
functional<00:05:30.040> on<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:31.090> lid

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
functional on the lid

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.800 
functional on the lid
I<00:05:31.660> glued<00:05:31.960> on<00:05:32.200> some<00:05:32.530> elastic<00:05:33.460> trim<00:05:33.790> to<00:05:34.570> help

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
I glued on some elastic trim to help

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.380 
I glued on some elastic trim to help
