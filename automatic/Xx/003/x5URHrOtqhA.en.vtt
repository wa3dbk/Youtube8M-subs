drift my car while drifting essentially

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.260 
drift my car while drifting essentially
is<00:00:19.170> where<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> driver<00:00:20.130> intentionally<00:00:20.699> over

maintaining<00:00:22.949> control<00:00:23.699> basically<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.630> we're

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
maintaining control basically what we're

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.790

you<00:00:41.790> got<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.000> understand<00:00:42.329> distraction<00:00:42.840> it's

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
you got it understand distraction it's

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.600 
you got it understand distraction it's
very<00:00:43.649> important<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> keep<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> opponent

even<00:00:45.600> though<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.750> want<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> lose<00:00:46.140> that

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
even though we want to lose that

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.389 
even though we want to lose that
traction<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.770> rear<00:00:46.920> end<00:00:47.129> when<00:00:47.309> we're

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
traction in the rear end when we're

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.830 
traction in the rear end when we're
coming<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.820> corner<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.480> need<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
coming on that corner we need all the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.330 
coming on that corner we need all the
traction<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.320> get<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:50.010> these<00:00:50.070> front

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
traction you can get for these front

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.950 
traction you can get for these front
tires<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.120> turn<00:00:51.390> right<00:00:51.629> out<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.809> that

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
tires so if I can turn right out of that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.959 
tires so if I can turn right out of that
drift<00:00:52.289> now<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.280> other<00:00:53.399> thing<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.879> this

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
drift now the other thing is with this

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.299 
drift now the other thing is with this
2011<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.379> problems<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.860> computer

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
2011 we have problems like computer

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.189 
2011 we have problems like computer
components<00:00:56.789> I'm<00:00:57.570> gonna<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.899> trick<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
components I'm gonna have to trick this

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.599 
components I'm gonna have to trick this
system<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:58.949> easy<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.190> pulling<00:00:59.460> an

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
system it's not as easy as pulling an

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.520 
system it's not as easy as pulling an
e-brake<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.120> sliding<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> car<00:01:00.660> anymore<00:01:00.840> I've

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
e-brake and sliding the car anymore I've

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.810 
e-brake and sliding the car anymore I've
actually<00:01:01.739> got<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.160> what<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.340> call<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.520> feint

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
actually got to do what we call a feint

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.369 
actually got to do what we call a feint
move<00:01:03.030> under<00:01:03.629> transfer<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> weight<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.320> the

car put one way to the other in order to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.210 
car put one way to the other in order to
break<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.600> back<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.020> loose<00:01:07.260> once<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.070> do<00:01:08.130> that

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
break that back in loose once I do that

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.800 
break that back in loose once I do that
I'm<00:01:08.580> gonna<00:01:08.700> lose<00:01:08.850> throttle<00:01:09.270> control<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> get

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
I'm gonna lose throttle control to get

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.170 
I'm gonna lose throttle control to get
through<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.170> turn<00:01:10.439> power<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:12.030> first

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
through that turn power out but first

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.890 
through that turn power out but first
things<00:01:12.420> first

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
things first

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
things first
I've<00:01:13.049> got<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.350> turn<00:01:13.409> off<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> traction

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
I've got to turn off the traction

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.230 
I've got to turn off the traction
control<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.549> can<00:01:14.640> get<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.820> car<00:01:15.030> sideways

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
control so I can get this car sideways

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.560 
control so I can get this car sideways
all<00:01:15.900> right<00:01:17.090> I'm<00:01:18.090> gonna<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> little

was<00:01:44.610> able<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.850> ship<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.210> weight<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.690> get<00:01:45.810> it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
was able to ship that weight and get it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.870 
was able to ship that weight and get it
back<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.200> other<00:01:46.320> way<00:01:46.410> he's<00:01:47.190> back<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.640> broke

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
back the other way he's back in broke

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.670 
back the other way he's back in broke
leaves<00:01:48.120> no<00:01:48.390> problem<00:01:48.870> did<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.260> seem<00:01:49.440> pretty

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
leaves no problem did this seem pretty

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.390 
leaves no problem did this seem pretty
easy<00:01:49.950> right<00:01:50.250> yeah<00:01:50.790> not<00:01:51.030> bad<00:01:51.440> huh<00:01:52.440> what<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.310> you

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
easy right yeah not bad huh what do you

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.370 
easy right yeah not bad huh what do you
say<00:01:53.580> because<00:01:53.910> kind<00:01:54.120> of<00:01:54.180> up<00:01:54.360> being<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:55.260> you

say because kind of up being do you
think<00:01:55.620> you<00:01:55.980> can<00:01:56.130> actually<00:01:56.400> do<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.030> with<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
think you can actually do this with a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.999 
think you can actually do this with a
semi

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.139 

take<00:02:03.009> a<00:02:03.040> little<00:02:03.250> bit<00:02:03.340> more<00:02:03.490> skill<00:02:03.789> but<00:02:03.939> as<00:02:04.000> long

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
take a little bit more skill but as long

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.520 
take a little bit more skill but as long
as<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.329> can<00:02:04.390> get<00:02:04.509> that<00:02:04.659> back<00:02:04.869> end<00:02:05.079> loose

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
as I can get that back end loose

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.040 
as I can get that back end loose

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.560 

all<00:02:52.640> right<00:02:52.790> Garrett<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.300> was<00:02:53.390> pretty

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
all right Garrett that was pretty

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.300 
all right Garrett that was pretty
impressive<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:54.470> was<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.620> lot<00:02:54.860> tougher<00:02:55.070> than<00:02:55.250> I

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
impressive that was a lot tougher than I

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.470 
impressive that was a lot tougher than I
thought<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.610> was<00:02:55.700> gonna<00:02:55.790> be<00:02:55.880> though<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.240> could

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
thought it was gonna be though I could

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.850 
thought it was gonna be though I could
even<00:02:56.720> believe<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.020> got<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.290> thing<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:57.620> even

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
even believe you got the thing that even

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.070 
even believe you got the thing that even
remotely<00:02:58.010> start<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.940> drift<00:02:59.210> so<00:02:59.690> here<00:02:59.870> let<00:03:00.050> me

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
remotely start to drift so here let me

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.020 
remotely start to drift so here let me
ask<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.470> something<00:03:00.830> if<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.580> just<00:03:01.760> kind<00:03:01.970> of

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
ask you something if I just kind of

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.460 
ask you something if I just kind of
change<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.480> environment<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.990> little<00:03:03.230> bit<00:03:03.350> and

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
change the environment a little bit and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.350 
change the environment a little bit and
gave<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.710> a<00:03:03.770> wet<00:03:04.010> down<00:03:04.280> what<00:03:05.000> do<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.150> think<00:03:05.300> the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
gave it a wet down what do you think the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.760 
gave it a wet down what do you think the
trucks<00:03:05.570> gonna<00:03:05.780> do<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:06.050> I<00:03:06.230> think<00:03:06.320> adding<00:03:06.710> that

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
trucks gonna do that I think adding that

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.740 
trucks gonna do that I think adding that
extra<00:03:07.070> element<00:03:07.190> let<00:03:07.910> me<00:03:08.030> break<00:03:08.240> this<00:03:08.270> back-end

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
extra element let me break this back-end

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.480 
extra element let me break this back-end
loose<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.260> little<00:03:09.350> bit<00:03:09.500> easier<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:10.040> might<00:03:10.220> work

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
loose a little bit easier it might work

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:24.660 
loose a little bit easier it might work
give<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.090> shot<00:03:11.270> let's<00:03:11.870> do<00:03:12.020> it<00:03:12.140> I<00:03:12.290> rap

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.270 

as<00:03:25.150> soon<00:03:25.330> as<00:03:25.420> we<00:03:25.540> put<00:03:25.750> water<00:03:25.959> down<00:03:26.260> friction<00:03:27.160> no

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
as soon as we put water down friction no

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.979 
as soon as we put water down friction no
longer<00:03:27.580> becomes<00:03:27.880> an<00:03:28.030> issue<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.630> surface

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
longer becomes an issue the surface

longer becomes an issue the surface
tension<00:03:29.290> is<00:03:29.410> now<00:03:29.530> broke<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.489> actually

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
tension is now broke and you actually

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.490 
tension is now broke and you actually
get<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.090> axis<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.630> go<00:03:31.750> around<00:03:32.020> and<00:03:32.200> pull<00:03:32.410> the

the wheel and some of the little bit of
experience<00:03:36.910> look<00:03:37.750> what<00:03:37.930> they<00:03:38.020> can<00:03:38.170> do

water<00:03:55.930> let<00:03:56.380> me<00:03:56.470> break<00:03:56.650> that<00:03:56.680> tractions<00:03:57.250> eight

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
water let me break that tractions eight

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.670 
water let me break that tractions eight
tires<00:03:57.670> got<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.750> little<00:03:58.840> bit<00:03:59.050> more<00:03:59.140> sideways

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
tires got it a little bit more sideways

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.550 
tires got it a little bit more sideways
look<00:03:59.920> at<00:04:00.099> this<00:04:00.430> big<00:04:00.700> rig<00:04:00.940> drift<00:04:01.300> at<00:04:02.020> second

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
look at this big rig drift at second

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.020 
look at this big rig drift at second
turn<00:04:02.770> it's<00:04:03.040> out<00:04:03.190> tell<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:03.489> we<00:04:03.610> have<00:04:03.730> money

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
turn it's out tell you we have money

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.430 
turn it's out tell you we have money
over<00:04:04.300> there<00:04:04.420> with<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:04.660> crew<00:04:04.930> we<00:04:05.110> didn't<00:04:05.350> think

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
over there with the crew we didn't think

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.750 
over there with the crew we didn't think
you<00:04:05.560> were<00:04:05.620> gonna<00:04:05.739> pull<00:04:05.830> it<00:04:06.130> out<00:04:06.250> but<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.580> did

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
you were gonna pull it out but you did

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.880 
you were gonna pull it out but you did
it<00:04:06.880> yeah<00:04:07.239> I<00:04:07.540> had<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.989> try<00:04:08.350> to<00:04:08.410> power<00:04:08.620> through

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
it yeah I had to try to power through

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.229 
it yeah I had to try to power through
with<00:04:08.980> as<00:04:09.100> much<00:04:09.280> torque<00:04:09.580> as<00:04:09.670> this<00:04:09.760> big<00:04:09.970> truck

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
with as much torque as this big truck

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.360 
with as much torque as this big truck
has<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:11.080> get<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:11.350> front<00:04:11.620> end<00:04:11.830> and<00:04:12.040> started<00:04:12.310> to

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
has to get that front end and started to

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.830 
has to get that front end and started to
plow<00:04:12.580> down<00:04:12.819> but<00:04:13.030> I<00:04:13.060> was<00:04:13.209> able<00:04:13.300> to<00:04:13.420> get<00:04:13.600> it<00:04:13.720> out

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
plow down but I was able to get it out

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.180 
plow down but I was able to get it out
there<00:04:14.020> right<00:04:14.170> at<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.319> last<00:04:14.500> second<00:04:14.950> how<00:04:15.130> do

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
there right at the last second how do

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.039 
there right at the last second how do
the<00:04:15.340> tires<00:04:15.519> feel<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.209> tires<00:04:16.480> are<00:04:16.690> sticking

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
the tires feel the tires are sticking

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.599 
the tires feel the tires are sticking
the<00:04:17.109> front<00:04:17.350> tires<00:04:17.590> they<00:04:17.950> want<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.190> plow<00:04:18.370> down

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
the front tires they want to plow down

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.400 
the front tires they want to plow down
tell<00:04:19.450> you<00:04:19.510> what<00:04:19.660> if<00:04:19.750> we<00:04:19.870> made<00:04:20.019> these<00:04:20.139> things

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
tell you what if we made these things

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.950 
tell you what if we made these things
bald<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.859> that<00:04:20.950> slick<00:04:21.609> spot<00:04:21.910> we'd<00:04:22.630> be<00:04:22.720> riding

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
bald and that slick spot we'd be riding

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.420 
bald and that slick spot we'd be riding
that<00:04:23.139> thing<00:04:23.290> sideways<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.130> whole<00:04:24.280> way

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
that thing sideways the whole way

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.159 
that thing sideways the whole way
through<00:04:24.460> nice<00:04:25.180> so<00:04:25.479> basically<00:04:25.840> what<00:04:26.080> we

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
through nice so basically what we

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.330 
through nice so basically what we
learned<00:04:26.380> today<00:04:26.560> is<00:04:26.710> a<00:04:26.770> little<00:04:27.010> something

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
learned today is a little something

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.830 
learned today is a little something
about<00:04:27.400> surface<00:04:28.060> tension<00:04:28.090> because<00:04:28.630> when<00:04:28.750> you

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
about surface tension because when you

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.870 
about surface tension because when you
add<00:04:28.990> water<00:04:29.290> to<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.620> surface<00:04:29.979> and<00:04:30.340> you've<00:04:30.760> got

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
add water to a surface and you've got

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.670 
add water to a surface and you've got
wheels<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:31.479> you<00:04:31.540> got<00:04:31.690> weight<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.320> actually

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
wheels and you got weight you actually

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.020 
wheels and you got weight you actually
break<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:33.040> tension<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.520> that<00:04:33.639> was<00:04:33.729> actually

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
break the tension and that was actually

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.820 
break the tension and that was actually
allowing<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:34.690> slide<00:04:35.050> yeah

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
allowing you to slide yeah

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.140 
allowing you to slide yeah
drifting<00:04:36.190> it's<00:04:36.310> all<00:04:36.400> about<00:04:36.580> traction<00:04:36.850> all

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
drifting it's all about traction all

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.730 
drifting it's all about traction all
about<00:04:37.300> that<00:04:37.450> tension<00:04:37.810> trying<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:38.080> trying<00:04:38.650> to

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
about that tension trying to trying to

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.900 
about that tension trying to trying to
break<00:04:38.919> that<00:04:39.070> traction<00:04:39.370> coming<00:04:39.729> around

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
break that traction coming around

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.610 
break that traction coming around
there's<00:04:40.540> water<00:04:40.690> help<00:04:40.960> yeah<00:04:41.380> there's<00:04:41.560> just

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
there's water help yeah there's just

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.860 
there's water help yeah there's just
absolutely<00:04:41.919> no<00:04:42.340> reason<00:04:42.880> why<00:04:43.000> anything<00:04:43.630> this

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
absolutely no reason why anything this

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.260 
absolutely no reason why anything this
top-heavy<00:04:44.560> with<00:04:45.100> this<00:04:45.340> many<00:04:45.580> tires<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.180> this

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
top-heavy with this many tires and this

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.969 
top-heavy with this many tires and this
many<00:04:46.510> axles<00:04:47.050> should<00:04:47.350> have<00:04:47.440> ever<00:04:47.620> have<00:04:47.800> done

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
many axles should have ever have done

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.520 
many axles should have ever have done
that<00:04:48.160> well<00:04:49.000> that's<00:04:49.510> what<00:04:49.630> we<00:04:49.720> do<00:04:49.870> here<00:04:50.020> we'll

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
that well that's what we do here we'll

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.130 
that well that's what we do here we'll
see<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:50.770> next<00:04:51.010> time
