00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.350
 one of Latin America in the video 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.320
 earlier we started talking about the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.509
 tertiary structure of a protein a 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.320
 way to define the structure 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.550
 tertiary is the type of links that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.949
 they keep it stable 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.300
 the spatial conformation that is going to 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:27.359
 adopt a protein is going to stabilize 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.759
 by interactions between the chains 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.620
 laterals or the r groups of 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:38.649
 involved amino acids that form it 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.870
 let's see in this video the characteristics 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.870
 of each of these types of link 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.839
 let's start with the type link 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.839
 sulfur bridge 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.860
 this type of interaction occurs between 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.010
 Uncles groups 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.680
 of the lateral waste r of the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.680
 cisterns 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.440
 as a result of the union through 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.170
 a bridge of sulfur the set of 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.170
 two cisterns is called sixtine 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.330
 this is a kind of strong link 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.340
 and it's quite frequent in proteins 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.560
 let's now turn to what are the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.560
 electrostatic interactions 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.570
 what happen 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.990
 between groups r with charge when the load 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.920
 is the same suppose 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.990
 positive charge in both residues 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.990
 then the force is of repulsion 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.020
 On the other hand, when the load is opposite 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.140
 the force is attractive 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.989
 let's now turn to what is the link of 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.989
 hydrogen bridge type 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.060
 is defined in this way to force 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.390
 attractive that occurs between an atom 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.810
 electro negative such as oxygen 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.990
 and a hydrogen atom that is attached 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.600
 covalently mind to another electro atom 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.900
 negative as is this case that is 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.900
 joined to another oxygen the bridge of 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.120
 hydrogen results from the formation of a 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.970
 dipole force dipole 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.970
 what is called a dipole dipole 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:04.190
 with a hydrogen atom that will be 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:08.480
 attached to an oxygen or a nitrogen or a 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.250
 fluorine this type of bond can occur 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.130
 between groups of the same molecule or 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.900
 between different molecules and participate 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.900
 polar amino acids 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.400
 finally we will mention what they are 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.400
 the hydrophobic forces 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.180
 this type of interaction occurs between 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.980
 amino acids with side groups no 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.739
 polar and they make chains 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.120
 distant approaches is why in 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.040
 aqueous solution the side chains of 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.610
 non-polar amino acids are going to be grouped 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.599
 are going to tend to group well in this 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:05.680
 way using interactions such as 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:09.280
 that we saw it is possible that amino acids 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:13.600
 which form a polypeptide are 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:17.560
 approximate leading to the formation of the 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:21.220
 folded protein that will be the protein 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:25.139
 which has biological function since in 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:29.410
 this state the synthesized polypeptide 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:31.840
 from a rn messenger does not have 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:37.350
 any function is necessary its 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.350
 folding to acquire its function 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.950
 to see the continuation of this topic 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.790
 educationally I recommend that you see the 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.790
