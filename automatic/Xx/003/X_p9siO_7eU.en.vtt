 hello everyone you test lab 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.250
 Voldi Computers 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.839
 I am Vladimir Smirnov today we will continue 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.760
 testing devices unusual 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.559
 formats this time in my hands 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.969
 hybrid device from samsung 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.400
 it is equipped with a full operating room 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.180
 windows 8 system and can act as 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.760
 as a laptop and as a 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.650

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:01.590
 another hole active system 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.570
 cooling one of the two microphones here 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.040
 Located the second connector usb version 30 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.890
 button is responsible for the lock screen 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.049

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.399
 thus the number of dots per inch 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.950
 is 190 under the screen is 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.450

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.840
 let's go to the docking station 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.240
 on it we see the standard keyboard 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.860

 64-bit windows 8 single in which 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:08.129
 the screen is worth praise the colors are very juicy 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.849
 picture bright viewing angles just 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.709
 great let's move on to testing for 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.810
 start evaluating the system itself and it 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.430
 rated the laptop performance 45 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.810
 points put the minimum score for 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.230
 graphics performance 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.700
 of the table 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.849
 synthetic performance test 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.139

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.870
 determined archiving speed in 3212 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.569

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.849
 system five hundred sixty four points 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.120
 synthetic test aida 64 here is a table with 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.120
 its results 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.200
 but of course not always cal tests at 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.120
 evaluation of such a device and enough 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.210
 so we decided to play modern 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.890
 groups of world of tanks from wargaming game 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.210
 It was conducted in resolution full hd 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.770
 but with minimal graphics settings 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.970
 at the same time we received around 27 30 fps 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.940
 of course not very much but quite 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.860
 playable now test time 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.420
 battery life for this test we 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.920
 turned off all wireless interfaces 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.050
 set the screen brightness to medium 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.790
 position and launched a movie in such 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.420
 laptop mode lasted a little more 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.230
 five o'clock 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.520
 good result let's summarize 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.560
 full windows 8 on this tablet 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.480
 looks very good and if you consider 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.400
 the possibility of turning it into a laptop then 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.320
 in fact we really get two 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.480
 devices in one and this is already quite 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.480
 bargain goodbye
