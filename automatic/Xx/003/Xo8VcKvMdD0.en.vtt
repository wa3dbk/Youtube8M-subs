 and if you started with being unique 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:09.679
 I'm disappointed 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.679
 more difficulties 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:15.309
 the hamas 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.309
 when I was a teenager I tell him 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.109
 my son been killed 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:24.769
 passionate about the analysts I'm here 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.220
 in addition it slides 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.149
 for example 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.899
 bush - the extremes 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.730

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.730
 at the end of the summer is over 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.620
 I could die 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.510
 he left 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.860
 the situation is the same 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.270
 otherwise I love it 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.020
 lionel messi too 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.730

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.069
 and Canadian society 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.309
 the three companies operate thanks to his rival laurent gbagbo 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.570
 she 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.500
 I do not have my fault 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.270
 classroom 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.270
 closing these resources 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.900
 knowledge and scars 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.090
 because I could do to transform you were telling you and you and send you 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.520
 to death it's simple no no 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.520
 I will spend a lot of time 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.870
 now what I know 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.250

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.250
 the Swiss ineris 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.320
 as if everything was rigged
