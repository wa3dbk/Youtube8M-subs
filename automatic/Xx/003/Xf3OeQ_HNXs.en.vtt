00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
course if you don't have either you can

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.160 
course if you don't have either you can
always<00:00:59.850> use<00:01:00.000> your<00:01:00.329> arms<00:01:00.600> against<00:01:00.930> your<00:01:01.079> body

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.290 

sometimes<00:01:10.190> you'll<00:01:10.700> need<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:11.000> follow<00:01:11.210> the

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
sometimes you'll need to follow the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.300 
sometimes you'll need to follow the
action<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:11.930> that's<00:01:12.410> when<00:01:12.590> it's<00:01:12.710> very<00:01:12.950> hard<00:01:13.220> to

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
action and that's when it's very hard to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.670 
action and that's when it's very hard to
keep<00:01:13.460> a<00:01:13.580> steady<00:01:13.850> hand<00:01:14.380> camcorders<00:01:15.380> like<00:01:15.500> this

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
keep a steady hand camcorders like this

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.260 
keep a steady hand camcorders like this
one<00:01:15.860> have<00:01:16.010> a<00:01:16.070> technology<00:01:16.370> called<00:01:16.760> optical

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
one have a technology called optical

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.540 
one have a technology called optical
image<00:01:17.690> stabilization<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:19.100> basically

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
image stabilization that basically

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.870 
image stabilization that basically
reduces<00:01:20.210> camera<00:01:20.900> shake<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:22.010> your<00:01:22.130> shots<00:01:22.400> don't

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
reduces camera shake so your shots don't

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.260 
reduces camera shake so your shots don't
look<00:01:23.120> jumpy<00:01:23.570> plus<00:01:24.560> it's<00:01:24.980> okay<00:01:25.370> not<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:25.910> follow

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
look jumpy plus it's okay not to follow

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.290 
look jumpy plus it's okay not to follow
the<00:01:26.450> ball<00:01:26.660> or<00:01:26.840> action<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.620> whole<00:01:27.800> time<00:01:28.180> let<00:01:29.180> it

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
the ball or action the whole time let it

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.360 
the ball or action the whole time let it
get<00:01:29.420> out<00:01:29.570> of<00:01:29.810> frame<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.320> use<00:01:30.800> your<00:01:30.980> ears<00:01:31.190> to

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
get out of frame and use your ears to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.780 
get out of frame and use your ears to
determine<00:01:32.090> where<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.300> slowly<00:01:32.720> pan<00:01:33.080> to<00:01:33.290> next

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
determine where to slowly pan to next

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.980 
determine where to slowly pan to next
think<00:01:34.790> about<00:01:34.940> getting<00:01:35.180> a<00:01:35.240> variety<00:01:35.480> of<00:01:35.720> shots

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
think about getting a variety of shots

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.740 
think about getting a variety of shots
from<00:01:36.710> close<00:01:36.770> ups<00:01:37.250> of<00:01:37.370> faces<00:01:37.760> too<00:01:38.060> wide<00:01:38.330> shots

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
from close ups of faces too wide shots

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.230 
from close ups of faces too wide shots
of<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:38.990> field<00:01:39.260> and<00:01:39.440> crowd<00:01:39.710> wide<00:01:40.640> shots<00:01:40.970> allow

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
of the field and crowd wide shots allow

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.110 
of the field and crowd wide shots allow
plenty<00:01:41.540> of<00:01:41.720> room<00:01:41.990> for<00:01:42.020> action<00:01:42.620> to<00:01:42.650> take<00:01:42.950> place

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
plenty of room for action to take place

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.850 
plenty of room for action to take place
the<00:01:44.120> great<00:01:44.420> feature<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.930> have<00:01:45.080> is<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.380> wide
