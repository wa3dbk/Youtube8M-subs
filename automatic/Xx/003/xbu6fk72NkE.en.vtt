00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 attention that will send back the 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.260
 center and in the middle of the sofa here is 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.500
 just saved ladies and gentlemen the 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.570
 header to the right corner nahuelpán not what 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.480
 can you believe he just lost it 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.420
 in front of the goal the ball was where 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.580
 was to fold yes and it seemed that 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.859
 could have lifted the assistant from the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.250
 banderole at the end meets the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.080
 auction does it with the crown more or less 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.150
 how are they going to be the home runs in the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.859
 concacaf to precision that the web has 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.859
 to see if he does not forgive the arm 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.960
 from pachuca 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:58.060
 he could not answer look as good as 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.270
 he said almost the third was not going to 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.239
 forgive nahuelpán and the party is 1 to 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.490
 0 how bad the defensive line brand 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.370
 from the solos the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.350
 vision and above all michael orozco does not 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.690
 It takes time to recompose the path lost 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.720
 the mark of ariel nahuelpán follows the 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.480
 ball does not turn it to see smart you 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.250
 finally touch the boot for a 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.500
 man that is enabled and with that 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.150
 left leg ends up liquidating 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.610
 any chance for federico 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.729
 vilar the tuzos are in front of a 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.729
 force 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.530
 it just lost the unhealthy chucky 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.510
 when he told us daniela rodríguez 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.220
 that auction and now if I ask you 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.070
 daniela how this was lived because 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.070
 will follow a goal made with you 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.630
 with a lot of unaltered 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.920
 the local team were almost celebrating 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.660
 he had his hands to his head saying 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.730
 well it may not be possible but right now 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.770
 yesterday I saw the streets to which he missed a 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.550
 goal made attention here has the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.520
 return 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.070
 virar shot that attacks at 30 minutes 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.470
 was very close to the second pachuca by 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.210
 now the figure is ariel nahuelpán yes 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.770
 He has definitely played very hard to do 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.170
 the center forward has touched many 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.520
 Sometimes the ball is the fifth one in the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.530
 which has a contribution there was 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.610
 Hernandez played for guido to protest 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.630
 it took away a lot of tension here is 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.460
 stage 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.050
 again I do not know about mosquera 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.720
 neglect 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.800
 on the backs to the defenders of 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.450
 pachuca and was very close to scoring 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.610
 It seemed like it was out of place but 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.930
 It was very tight because it will come back 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.640
 that disables and when you have that 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.960
 possibility he wanted to do with the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.030
 inspect how she's showing you in the 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.460
 ball tries to do it with the instep 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.020
 shot on the right for for eights 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.930
 enabled attention to what is good in 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.660
 shot and you just lost the goal 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.820
 although the ball bounced and there's shot of 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.170
 corner ladies and gentlemen what is 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.170
 he ate in argentina h 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.410
 as it is in front it bounces 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.200
 finally on the back 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.970
 Rodriguez and has been very close to me 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.040
 missed aim attention here is the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.940
 play that is criminal 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.550
 but the criminal penal penal end end 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.680
 ladies and gentlemen there is a lack inside the 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.570
 Mosquera area on the back card 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.570
 yellow for the Colombian and capital of 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.640
 pachuca the roman team has the 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.819
 possibility of tying the match and the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.980
 Question 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.079
 the fourth official is because I want 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.969
 comes does the car pass with the chest 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.920
 wins and the mosquera moment and what 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:44.870
 hooks with the left leg ends 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.700
 to knock him down with his left leg is 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.349
 a clear criminal and what is asked 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.959
 Ruben omar Roman is because I do not take him out 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.689
 being an obvious goal opportunity 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.609
 the red card aquivaldo mosquera se 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:58.219
 is left with the yellow card for me 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:01.099
 it was without marking the penalty does not take much 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:12.739
 distance track the referee attention 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:15.019
 flowers comes tijuana arm with the 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.489
 xolos just tied it nailed in the 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.759
 angle a large p 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:24.300
 very well charged by Chilean so 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:27.210
 flowers put the one to one for us 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.850
 you do not make goals that make you say 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.620
 the football saying and at the end with this 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.319
 left leg a great power 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.539
 also placed he knows where he's going to touch 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:38.699
 the impossible ball for the rabbit pérez 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.380
 that by the reaction that it has could 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.630
 get to that ball and it's obvious the 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.169
 annoyance of diego alonso who knows that his 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.139
 team 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.819
 could control the going looking here to 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.009
 full speed of attention to the healthy 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.879
 the pass so that it does not return to 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.879
 appear and the shot 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.150
 speed through the center 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.840
 Push 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:27.700
 star the Uruguayan for pachuca 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.310
 what reading does it give to go and to the 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.040
 movement that has won the bread the 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.140
 how he manages to turn the ball over 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.960
 everything sweeping before the exit of 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.630
 federico vilar and urretaviscaya is 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.460
 Attentive at the right moment wins Núñez 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.320
 to push the ball and send it to 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.020
 background of the network and in this way pachuca 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.840
 in one of those stress lights that you 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.660
 they need in a football game that 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.880
 spark that finally reaches minute 77 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.540
 Mark the goal that has them so far 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.540
 with the
