00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.609
 give account in the title simply what 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.980
 what you add is like the double of the weapon 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.660
 what do you have, do not worry, it's not opep 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.150
 because with that weapon it does not attack simply 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.009
 is for you to look more aesthetic good 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.210

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.620

 in the one because I'm using that 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.460
 Another little thing I'm going goats 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.110

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.060
 good faces how to download first not 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.290
 we go first as a download they are going to go 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.210
 to this page that is here below the 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.230
 download link ok they are going to go here what 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.730
 The only thing they have to do is give you a 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.080
 touch from here he exposed the record or red 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.910
 and carnal where it says that aside 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.010
 have given a touch and do not leave 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.600
 you get scant this is not a view 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.640
 previous available and you get this does not 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.369
 carnal worry is all good nothing 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.229
 more he to whom download simple friends 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.270
 or if you put this ad more 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.540
 They give in download and they will ask for this 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.830
 already 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.630
 this will possibly give you in 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.940
 accept and I know that possibly you 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.800
 device will not harm anything in 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.270
 accept and well you know is a 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.430
 application is a complement like the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.010
 You have items you are going to simply 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.390
 install and then jacques in this web 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.950
 remember you have to have three options 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.590
 active that is to administer patches 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.120
 administer supplements and well this is 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.860
 the sleep mode we have to have 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.960
 these three mainly this is the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.620
 principal today I mostly know mainly 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.240
 that is that your principal is web is 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.670
 that this is the important one in the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.440
 that we have active then good no longer 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.940
 is that we have this installed in the 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.410
 complement the only thing that will add you 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.350
 that is your channel is going to add you can 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.840
 say twice each object that you have 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.340
 you can say selected you appear 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.680
 also in the left hand goes 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.940
 martín simón acatzingo no hasta vinci de 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.979
 I recommend this texture 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.630
 totally as simple as I say no 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.000
 spoil because not with these you do not attack 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.800
 with the one on the left is simply is 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.930
 one thing that to make it more aesthetic 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.430
 camping and but with two things not in fact 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.770
 if you put yourself in third person do not you 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.020
 appears but well I think it's a good 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.460
 complement I do not know that dress the net 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.950
 it does not get in your way 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.470
 it's not past spear then 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.900
 It is simply nothing you know that's something 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.760
 to install the add-on with a 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.110
 pica and then nothing if you like this video 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.910
 it was very fast but then simply 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.080
 is in what you see as how you are 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.090
 advancing with this to one of the 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.730
 add-ons dot apk that I find 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.080
 perfect as he said around the back 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.240
 that all the bikes went to 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.980
 because there are farts too sometimes though 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.750
 the mods have textures and I'm going 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.490
 I want to combine textures and I can not 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.920
 do nothing else can I have a mod with 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.900
 textures and booth is more inside if all 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.670
 were application that would be super 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.710
 luxury because no no we would not have 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.330
 problems that I do not like that I do not 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.450
 we can have three textures in the 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.040
 same blog launcher pro then it would be 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.660
 little mother that everyone is like that I think 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.970
 that is not very simple this but then 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.350
 I hope that if not then you also like it 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.580
