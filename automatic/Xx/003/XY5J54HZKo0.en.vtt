00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hi guys, in today's video I'm going 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.810
 show you some tips for 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.480
 Do you decorate your balcony? 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.849
 are simple tips but through them 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.130
 can take several ideas to give 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.500
 that upgrade on your balcony 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.140
 I really hope you like it and I 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.600
 I decorated my red color then so 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.630
 every little thing I put in had 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.189
 some red detail combined more 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.410
 to be even more beautiful there you 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.420
 choose your preferred color and make the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.340
 way you want I hope 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.660
 You can take this video 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.420
 less than 10 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.899
 sometimes you want to arrange coral or 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.800
 Give that change on your balcony. 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.989
 but you do not know how to do then it's me 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.989
 I come in this video brings easy tips and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.489
 practices and also not so expensive to 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.440
 decorate my time of most 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.550
 things I used this video myself 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.890
 had at home 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.820
 some things that I bought more than 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.890
 They were Elzinha plant I've ever 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.960
 I have not seen any videos here on the channel so 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.270
 if you want to know how it works 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.700
 watch this video and it's very simple 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.950
 do and is also much cheaper than 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.770
 that you buy a vase of flowers for 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.619
 where is China this video is with me then? 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.780
 how you can observe the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.810
 things that I would be using to decorate 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.799
 My balcony is this table. 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.500
 she comes when the chairs she is tall 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.119
 It's been a long time since I bought to buy in 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.340
 SÃ£o Paulo and I'm going to use these little things 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.740
 For the heart, I choose the decoration. 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.840
 in red then most things 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.450
 that I'll put there are all in 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.689
 details in red then it has been 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.470
 pepper stand time in the gare 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.799
 the little plant a glass pot that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.759
 board with a vase that is hanging 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.369
 on the wall 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.070
 these three flowers here also want 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.530
 hang on the wall 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.820
 these three little flower 63 alone 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.649
 little ones 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.590
 and these two big ones here and if it was me 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.370
 The same as I did have video already on the channel. 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.159
 with 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.980
 alone is the difference that these are 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:19.920
 these two are larger than those three 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.379
 are smaller neighbors but it is the same 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.489
 thing to ride has no secret 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:29.150
 and I'll also put these two 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.940
 this knife and that barbecue fork 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.319
 because with a gourmet balcony 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.790
 then I'll put this 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:42.390
 so these are the things that I'm going to 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.180
 put two large vases two eyes 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.480
 big ones 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.620
 these three little flowers hanging on the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.609
 wall 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:03:00.000
 to Taba the three small neighbors 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:03:06.750
 the red pot that other two flower 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.799
 the knife and the table then 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.780
 let's go there so personal this vision that we 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.430
 we have the balcony here with nothing then the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.200
 barbecue grill 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.799
 here has a gray sill in the shape of 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.980
 brick there is this pile with this 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.980
 cabinet 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:32.700
 There you go. Here is where I put it. 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.099
 my clothes cast normal than the bass 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:45.209
 when I'll put the clothes on 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:48.480
 This is the sight looking from the 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.410
 The balcony window there has a wall 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.260
 accident that is a company that has one side 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:04:00.269
 and here the barbecue then this view 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:03.019

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.910

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.459
