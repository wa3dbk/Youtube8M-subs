00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
very hard to chew so for smoothies I

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.990 
very hard to chew so for smoothies I
actually<00:02:58.720> like<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.320> take<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.459> leaves<00:03:00.700> off<00:03:00.940> the

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
stem and I don't include the stem in

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.640 
stem and I don't include the stem in
this<00:03:04.540> movie<00:03:04.780> so<00:03:05.709> here<00:03:06.160> I'm<00:03:06.430> just<00:03:07.470> taking<00:03:08.470> off

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
this movie so here I'm just taking off

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:25.770 
this movie so here I'm just taking off
the<00:03:09.220> leaves<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:10.660> about<00:03:11.109> two<00:03:11.470> leaves<00:03:11.859> of<00:03:12.010> kale

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.300 

if<00:03:26.780> you're<00:03:27.050> just<00:03:27.379> starting<00:03:27.620> out<00:03:27.920> with<00:03:28.040> green

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
if you're just starting out with green

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.759 
if you're just starting out with green
smoothies<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:29.030> would<00:03:29.599> suggest<00:03:29.810> just<00:03:30.170> starting

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
smoothies I would suggest just starting

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.979 
smoothies I would suggest just starting
with<00:03:30.950> some<00:03:31.190> spinach<00:03:31.640> first<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.420> maybe<00:03:32.690> adding

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
with some spinach first and maybe adding

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.530 
with some spinach first and maybe adding
in<00:03:33.290> kale<00:03:33.590> later<00:03:34.099> because<00:03:34.640> kale<00:03:34.970> has<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.239> more

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
in kale later because kale has a more

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.720 
in kale later because kale has a more
distinct<00:03:36.049> green<00:03:36.349> taste<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.860> it<00:03:36.890> where<00:03:37.549> some

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
distinct green taste to it where some

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.210 
distinct green taste to it where some
spinach<00:03:38.060> is<00:03:38.209> very<00:03:38.480> very<00:03:38.720> mild<00:03:38.959> next<00:03:39.860> we<00:03:40.010> have

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
spinach is very very mild next we have

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.820

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
yourself inside if you eat healthy food

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.340 
yourself inside if you eat healthy food
and<00:06:59.100> if<00:06:59.430> you<00:06:59.580> feel<00:06:59.820> good<00:07:00.060> about<00:07:00.120> yourself<00:07:00.840> then

and if you feel good about yourself then

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.379
