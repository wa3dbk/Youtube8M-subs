00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
have no idea but yeah the first five

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.679 
have no idea but yeah the first five
teams<00:01:28.920> are<00:01:29.159> apparently<00:01:29.490> bug<00:01:29.700> fairy<00:01:30.119> electric

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
teams are apparently bug fairy electric

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.109 
teams are apparently bug fairy electric
fighting<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.320> steel<00:01:31.590> type<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> good<00:01:32.880> mix

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
fighting and steel type so a good mix

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.910 
fighting and steel type so a good mix
there<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.689> assume<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.079> bug<00:01:34.229> bug<00:01:34.650> type

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
there so we can assume the bug bug type

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.350 
there so we can assume the bug bug type
Jim's<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.400> then<00:01:35.430> saw<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.790> second<00:01:36.180> town

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
Jim's can we then saw the second town

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.749 
Jim's can we then saw the second town

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
different this one otherwise it'll be a

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.470

bit<00:02:10.770> too<00:02:10.920> similar<00:02:11.129> really<00:02:11.459> but<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> imagine

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
bit too similar really but I imagine

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.970 
bit too similar really but I imagine
something<00:02:12.629> like<00:02:12.720> Hobart<00:02:13.410> water

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980
