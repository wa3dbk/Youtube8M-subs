00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
something is pretty simple you're just

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.229 
something is pretty simple you're just
going<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.680> put<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> phone<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.520> look<00:00:54.000> how

pretty good it looks very stylish this
case<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.270> will<00:02:06.299> consider<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> hybrid<00:02:07.170> case

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
case I will consider a hybrid case

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.839 
case I will consider a hybrid case
because<00:02:07.680> it's<00:02:07.829> using<00:02:08.160> two<00:02:08.459> different

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
because it's using two different

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.910 
because it's using two different
materials<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.479> provide<00:02:10.140> more<00:02:10.379> protection<00:02:10.410> to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
your phone but I also believe that this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.860 
your phone but I also believe that this
because<00:02:13.709> you're<00:02:13.860> also<00:02:13.980> one<00:02:14.250> piece<00:02:14.520> case

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
because you're also one piece case

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.420 
because you're also one piece case
because<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:16.350> just<00:02:16.530> feels<00:02:16.830> natural<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.280> don't

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
because it just feels natural you don't

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.010 
because it just feels natural you don't
have<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:18.030> don't<00:02:18.060> have<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.360> discomfort

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
have to you don't have that discomfort

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.160 
have to you don't have that discomfort
putting<00:02:19.590> two<00:02:19.770> things<00:02:20.100> at<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.280> same<00:02:20.370> time
