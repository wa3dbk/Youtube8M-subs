00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.710 
I'm gonna call it a trout I really
believe<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:49.939> so<00:01:50.939> what<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.210> want<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.600> is

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
believe that so what you want to do is

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.950 
believe that so what you want to do is
is<00:01:51.869> back<00:01:52.110> them<00:01:52.290> up

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
is back them up

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.109 
is back them up
you<00:01:53.200> see<00:01:53.620> what<00:01:53.740> happened<00:01:54.040> because<00:01:54.520> sometimes

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
you see what happened because sometimes

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.600 
you see what happened because sometimes
just<00:01:55.270> sometime<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.590> fish<00:01:56.950> will<00:01:57.130> pool<00:01:57.400> real

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
just sometime that fish will pool real

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.640 
just sometime that fish will pool real
quick<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.180> knot<00:01:58.869> will<00:01:59.110> hang<00:01:59.290> on<00:01:59.470> your

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
quick and that knot will hang on your

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.649 
quick and that knot will hang on your
pole<00:01:59.890> and<00:02:00.430> I've<00:02:00.549> broken<00:02:00.850> rod<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.420> way<00:02:01.570> and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
pole and I've broken rod that way and

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.750 
pole and I've broken rod that way and
that's<00:02:01.750> why<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:01.990> never<00:02:02.110> take<00:02:02.590> that<00:02:02.740> chance<00:02:03.070> so

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
that's why I never take that chance so

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.010 
that's why I never take that chance so
this<00:02:03.909> is<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.090> little<00:02:04.270> harder<00:02:04.570> but<00:02:04.690> I'm<00:02:04.840> fishing

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020

with a lot of leaders so what you have

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.070 
with a lot of leaders so what you have
to<00:02:06.250> do<00:02:06.400> is<00:02:06.520> just<00:02:06.640> back<00:02:06.850> them<00:02:07.060> up<00:02:07.180> get<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.840> pole

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
to do is just back them up get the pole

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.139
