let's say you lose muscle you lose you
lose<00:02:11.970> weight

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
lose weight

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.680

have for simplicity purposes we're going
to<00:02:27.130> just<00:02:27.400> say<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:28.270> little<00:02:28.600> muscles<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:29.170> we

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
to just say the little muscles that we

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.580 
to just say the little muscles that we
have<00:02:29.530> have<00:02:30.100> little<00:02:30.370> brains<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.590> they

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
have have little brains and they

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.620 
have have little brains and they
remember<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.700> had<00:02:33.940> muscle<00:02:34.390> and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
remember that you had muscle and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.270 
remember that you had muscle and
scientifically<00:02:37.630> for<00:02:38.020> whatever<00:02:38.200> reason<00:02:38.920> and

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
scientifically for whatever reason and

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.760 
scientifically for whatever reason and
this<00:02:40.000> has<00:02:40.240> happened<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.720> me<00:02:40.810> time<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.620> time

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
this has happened to me time and time

this has happened to me time and time
again<00:02:41.800> I<00:02:43.110> bounce<00:02:44.110> back<00:02:44.290> much<00:02:45.040> faster<00:02:45.580> when<00:02:45.820> I

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
again I bounce back much faster when I

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.260 
again I bounce back much faster when I
go<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.300> gym<00:02:46.570> I<00:02:47.100> bounce<00:02:48.100> back<00:02:48.250> way<00:02:49.030> way

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
go to the gym I bounce back way way

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.870 
go to the gym I bounce back way way
faster<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:50.320> know<00:02:50.470> get<00:02:50.740> back<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.700> my<00:02:51.820> normal

self get back to my normal strength
twice<00:02:55.630> or<00:02:55.930> three<00:02:56.260> times<00:02:56.290> as<00:02:56.980> fast<00:02:57.490> as<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:58.360> would

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
twice or three times as fast as I would

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.260 
twice or three times as fast as I would
when<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.060> just<00:03:01.330> started<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.430> positive

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
when I just started so that is positive

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.460 
when I just started so that is positive
thing<00:03:04.420> number<00:03:04.510> one<00:03:04.950> number<00:03:05.950> two<00:03:06.100> is<00:03:07.470> recovery

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
thing number one number two is recovery

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
muscle gain um we always need to

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.050 
muscle gain um we always need to
remember<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.850> certain<00:03:19.150> formula<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:21.060> about

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
remember a certain formula that about

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.110 
remember a certain formula that about
let's<00:03:22.360> say<00:03:22.570> 75<00:03:23.050> percent<00:03:23.800> of<00:03:23.950> your<00:03:24.040> gains<00:03:24.910> come

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
let's say 75 percent of your gains come

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.070 
let's say 75 percent of your gains come
from<00:03:25.330> nutrition<00:03:25.890> ten<00:03:26.890> percent<00:03:27.310> from<00:03:27.370> training

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.900 

let's<00:03:32.080> start<00:03:32.380> over

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
let's start over

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.760 
let's start over
80<00:03:33.910> percent<00:03:34.450> from<00:03:34.540> nutrition<00:03:34.930> and<00:03:35.260> we<00:03:35.560> will

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
80 percent from nutrition and we will

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.910 
80 percent from nutrition and we will
include<00:03:36.160> supplements<00:03:36.910> within<00:03:37.270> nutrition<00:03:37.920> now

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
include supplements within nutrition now

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.880 
include supplements within nutrition now
the<00:03:39.580> vital<00:03:40.030> for<00:03:40.510> gains<00:03:40.720> but<00:03:41.200> we<00:03:41.350> will<00:03:41.470> put<00:03:41.650> that

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
the vital for gains but we will put that

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:42.720 
the vital for gains but we will put that
into<00:03:42.160> there

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
into there

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.020 
into there
eighty<00:03:43.120> percent<00:03:43.240> nutrition<00:03:44.280> 10<00:03:45.280> percent<00:03:45.670> rest

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
eighty percent nutrition 10 percent rest

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.690 
eighty percent nutrition 10 percent rest
and<00:03:46.390> ten<00:03:47.170> percent<00:03:47.920> uh<00:03:49.260> training<00:03:50.430> what<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.550> do

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
and ten percent uh training what you do

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.200 
and ten percent uh training what you do
in<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:51.910> gym<00:03:51.940> so<00:03:52.810> eighty<00:03:53.530> percent<00:03:53.980> is<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.850> big

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
in the gym so eighty percent is a big

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.260 
in the gym so eighty percent is a big
component<00:03:55.600> of<00:03:55.870> course<00:03:56.670> but<00:03:57.670> sometimes

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
component of course but sometimes

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.090 
component of course but sometimes
sometimes<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:59.590> nutrition<00:04:00.160> aspect<00:04:00.580> isn't<00:04:01.330> as

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
sometimes that nutrition aspect isn't as

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.530 
sometimes that nutrition aspect isn't as
well<00:04:03.100> it's<00:04:03.280> important<00:04:03.820> but<00:04:04.060> sometimes<00:04:04.240> it

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
well it's important but sometimes it

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.120 
well it's important but sometimes it
becomes<00:04:04.840> like<00:04:05.050> seventy<00:04:05.560> percent<00:04:05.740> as

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
becomes like seventy percent as

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.160 
becomes like seventy percent as
important<00:04:06.730> for<00:04:06.880> your<00:04:06.940> gains<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.360> that<00:04:07.420> rest

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
important for your gains and that rest

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.100 
important for your gains and that rest
part<00:04:08.500> right<00:04:08.710> there<00:04:09.300> becomes<00:04:10.300> very<00:04:10.540> important

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
part right there becomes very important

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.050 
part right there becomes very important
sometimes<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.130> training<00:04:12.490> part<00:04:12.670> is<00:04:12.850> very

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
sometimes the training part is very

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.840 
sometimes the training part is very
important<00:04:13.510> all<00:04:13.660> depends<00:04:14.020> on<00:04:14.080> genetics<00:04:14.850> the

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
important all depends on genetics the

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.960 
important all depends on genetics the
way<00:04:15.970> your<00:04:16.120> body<00:04:16.299> works<00:04:16.510> some<00:04:17.080> people<00:04:17.380> have

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
way your body works some people have

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.460 
way your body works some people have
insane<00:04:18.970> genetics<00:04:19.480> that<00:04:19.690> no<00:04:19.959> matter<00:04:20.140> what<00:04:20.350> they

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
insane genetics that no matter what they

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.890 
insane genetics that no matter what they
eat<00:04:20.580> no<00:04:21.580> matter<00:04:21.790> how<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.060> train<00:04:22.479> and<00:04:22.720> no

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.670 
matter how much they rest they will get
amazing<00:04:25.330> results<00:04:25.510> how

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
amazing results how

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.219 
amazing results how
are<00:04:26.860> there<00:04:27.039> some<00:04:27.340> of<00:04:27.490> us<00:04:27.639> that<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.900> know<00:04:29.020> we
