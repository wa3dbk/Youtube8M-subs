rusia and I believe it's because of the
one<00:04:47.520> because<00:04:47.700> I<00:04:47.820> didn't<00:04:48.210> even<00:04:48.300> start<00:04:48.540> getting

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
shampoo I'm going to continue using it

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.470 
shampoo I'm going to continue using it
um<00:04:55.590> I'll<00:04:56.340> probably<00:04:56.580> try<00:04:56.820> a<00:04:56.880> different<00:04:57.300> side

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
um I'll probably try a different side

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.660 
um I'll probably try a different side
once<00:04:57.750> this<00:04:57.990> one<00:04:58.170> runs<00:04:58.410> out<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:58.860> they<00:04:59.460> do<00:04:59.520> have

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
once this one runs out and they do have

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.360 
once this one runs out and they do have
two<00:05:00.120> other<00:05:00.560> products<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.800> one<00:05:01.980> line<00:05:02.160> does

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
two other products the one line does
