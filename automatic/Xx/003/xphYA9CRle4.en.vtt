00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.639
 in this case here we are going to weave 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:18.010
 a right for you to see what it is 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.439
 the jersey stitch jersey is when 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.830
 We have rights 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:26.500
 pure right on the same side 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.230
 look here grabbed me the back point 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.439
 because because it 's easier this one does not 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.810
 I would have to do this side towards the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.960
 this is the point that he took 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.230
 grabbed thrown in the arcs that's the 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.550
 right point that I'm riding 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:48.400
 on a turn where the point is seen 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.550
 right and ours of two needles 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.230
 many we flipped the seams then to 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.000
 the time to be turning our 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:00.810
 woven the stitch looks on the opposite side 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.670
 I turned it over and here now they look backwards 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.610
 then about this stitch that we are going to 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.180
 learn what you see here is point 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.090
 jersey good these are rights but it's 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.020
 the jersey stitch look here happened the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.590
 first point this is the reverse dare 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.390
 now we are riding come back on 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:29.940
 backwards and how is good so come we are 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:34.520
 we take him out 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:41.320
 until finishing the round 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.320
 everything at this point and it 's the reverse point 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.080
 you have to try to differentiate one thing 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.950
 point and claims is attached gives this is 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.950
 the reverse point 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.830
 that is woven staying in this way and 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:01.250
 here we have two stitches in this fabric 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.770
 the stitch below is the stitch that is 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.880
 Holy clear flame and it looks just like a 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.490
 side as the other and in the part of here 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:15.140
 up we are knitting stitch of 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:19.100
 jersey that is made with only points 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.280
 for the reverse or points for the right 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.250
 when we are in the turn when we 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.110
 another fabric is looking up 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.209
 this is what will matter how we're going 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.800
 to weave the point in this case this is the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:37.280
 the right side of the right point and 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.790
 this is the side of the reverse point this 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.360
 stitch that we see up here I'm here 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.150
 it's called a jersey stitch and it's because 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.380
 we are only seeing right from this 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.290
 side and on the other side back 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.860
 the reverse point 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.049
 then let's do more laps here 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.670
 so that you can appreciate more a 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.650
 little more this jersey stitch 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.770
 look at the eight laps we have 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.720
 stitch jerseys carry this height and 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.660
 in the bottom part that we've already knitted 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.180
 the stitch of santa clara see the width 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.830
 and we are talking about 10 laps here 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.080
 has to see the stitch that we 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.270
 we are so that it gives us more our 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.819
 weaving and then of course there are different 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.160
 good textures we already learned here 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.170
 then another new stitch we are going to 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.780
 leave this tissue to have it from 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.370
 sample book so you can see 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.370
