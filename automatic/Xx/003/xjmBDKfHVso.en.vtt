00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.320
 hello today let's see the 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.880
 motorcycle checks that are done after 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.250
 sound control using the engine 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.590
 it consists of three themes that are 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.449
 commands technical elements and there makes 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.109
 rage safety accessories in every 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.910
 theme 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.100
 there are four different verifications and the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.989
 inspectors chose one by theme 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.449
 that is to say that the day of the plateau there 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.739
 has in all three Americas to perform I 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.629
 so let's start with the commands 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.909
 all I'm going to tell you and to 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.370
 repeat roughly word-for-word the day of 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:55.729
 the exam without saying too much on the other hand 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:57.170
 to avoid their subject, we left 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.180
 let's start so by the commands 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.780
 so in the orders we have the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.089
 motor I turn on the engine and I 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.550
 check the extinction of the warning lights 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.060
 that the red lights 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.860
 nice eye 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.020
 smells to the east the circuits to see 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.450
 its operation then we have 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.579
 the clutch and the accelerator so 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.259
 the accelerator I check the good 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.850
 rotation of the accelerator 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.780
 acceleration as well as deceleration 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.820
 is in play side clutch I 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.340
 check that the cable is not 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.909
 frayed and that the guard is pretty much 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.189
 about 5 mm next we have the 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.649
 direction direction I manipulate the 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.880
 voting handlebar right in order to me 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.009
 find that there is no plan to 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.130
 merging at the management level 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.929
 I visually check the tightness of the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.009
 head fork maybe fork that gets 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:52.520
 so locates here on ut superior and on 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.979
 the lower tea then we have them 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.159
 brake controls so the front brake 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.099
 I come here the liquid level of 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.349
 brake before the bubble must be full 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.970
 so it's good the guide have it right 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:06.530
 always 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.179
 then I go rice if the level of 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.250
 rear brake fluid that is located 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.590
 under saddle on the day of the exam 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.290
 we do not need to lift the saddle 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.970
 we just have to say I check the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.269
 level of the rear brake that falls under 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.269
 saddle 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.670
 so let's move on now 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.110
 the technical elements so in the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.000
 technical elements so we have the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.459
 level holding from here of which the gauge 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.740
 oil so the bike should be fine 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.300
 right to perform the level and of 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.700
 cold preference so it is 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.140
 simply simply have it 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.630
 show the day of the exam where 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.820
 situates level 2 then we have the 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.160
 transmission the transmission to that 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.170
 of the bike I 'll succeed so the 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.180
 chain tension between the two gears 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.489
 moving between the crown and the pinion 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.770
 of gearbox so I check the 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.690
 chain tension at this level there I the 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.940
 string must be between 30 and 40 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.250
 mm of deflection and I check the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.950
 lubrication so apparently it's good there 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.260
 was well trained then one to 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.459
 the automatic forward or backward it depends 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.160
 what the inspector will ask you 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.350
 to do so the tire before I 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.350
 check that there is no tear 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.940
 at the level of the flanks not tear not 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.310
 of cut off buddy blisters with it's 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.890
 not two hernias the sculptures do not 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.560
 must not be less than 1 mm and I 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.049
 check the inflation in appearance I 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.000
 then check the inflation valve which 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.049
 so is possible a live of my 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.660
 village we made him see the field of 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.370
 exams and the pressure has to be 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.310
 between two bars of two 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.860
 bars 3 then we have the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.019
 suspension so in the front I check 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.870
 there is no leakage at the 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.370
 lip seals here we do not say I 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.840
 sell spi vasco spi it's a brand 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.170
 so we insist on the fact that these 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.209
 people were going then I check so the 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.790
 rear suspension rear suspension 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.630
 which is adjustable so on five positions 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.440
 following the load of the bike a plus or 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.180
 less charged 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.180
 the position that time and 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.090
 So last theme lighting accessories 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.729
 security so we have to 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.199
 inside the lighting before I check 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.880
 the proper functioning the state to the 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.070
 cleanliness of the position light 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.370
 I check the proper functioning of 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.599
 the state and the poverty of the crossing 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.030
 I then check the smooth operation 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:40.810
 poverty and the state 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.120
 she calls the case where the bike 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.590
 I did not then do the indicators 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.540
 so two changes of direction its 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.220
 lands the flashing I'm checking so 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.370
 the front right turn signal of which 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.500
 cleanliness operation is good condition the 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.200
 left flashing same thing good 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.210
 functioning cleanliness good condition next 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.490
 so we have the rear turn signal 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.370
 left very clean functioning very 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.410
 good condition the flashing so back 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.810
 right smooth running about you are 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.310
 beautiful not being I can also check the 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.790
 braid mistakes same thing so the 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.889
 motorcycle one is equipped with the lighting then 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.930
 so back I check the good 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.350
 rear lighting operation 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.000
 as well as the plate lighting at 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.190
 cleanliness operation and bennett has 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.110
 always I then check good 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.479
 operation cleanliness and good step 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.510
 dufaux fire stop with the command 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:34.570
 before and with the command ouch 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.510
 I then check the good condition of two 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:41.830
 Mirrors well secured clean not break 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.479
