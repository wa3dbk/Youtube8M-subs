I'm hoping to replace them with some
short<00:01:06.329> LED<00:01:06.779> ones<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.259> since<00:01:07.499> it's<00:01:07.679> winter<00:01:07.740> and

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
short LED ones but since it's winter and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.749 
short LED ones but since it's winter and

the taillights integrated with flashers

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.039 
the taillights integrated with flashers
it<00:01:11.969> doesn't<00:01:12.209> make<00:01:12.270> any<00:01:12.329> difference<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.959> I

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
it doesn't make any difference if I

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.959 
it doesn't make any difference if I
don't<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.350> anything<00:01:13.590> there<00:01:13.859> other<00:01:14.729> than

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
don't want to cut those off because I

light with this right down there 12-volt

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.199 
light with this right down there 12-volt
accessory<00:01:50.030> power<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:52.520> that's<00:01:52.700> directly<00:01:53.030> with

accessory power and that's directly with
a<00:01:53.270> battery<00:01:53.479> so<00:01:53.810> it's<00:01:53.959> always<00:01:54.109> hot<00:01:54.520> regardless

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
a battery so it's always hot regardless

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.889 
a battery so it's always hot regardless

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
of the ignitions in let's take a look at

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.419 
of the ignitions in let's take a look at
all<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:04.700> LED<00:02:05.030> lights<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.920> entire<00:02:07.099> gauge

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
all the LED lights the entire gauge

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.020 
all the LED lights the entire gauge
cluster<00:02:07.909> is<00:02:08.030> led<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:09.549> have<00:02:10.549> a<00:02:10.610> couple<00:02:10.789> more

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
cluster is led I have a couple more

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.910 
cluster is led I have a couple more
brighter<00:02:11.360> bulbs<00:02:12.140> for<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.530> but<00:02:14.440> it's<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.769> only

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
brighter bulbs for it but it's it only

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.009 
brighter bulbs for it but it's it only
seems<00:02:16.220> dim<00:02:16.489> in<00:02:16.670> here<00:02:16.700> when<00:02:17.690> you're<00:02:17.810> out<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:17.930> the

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
seems dim in here when you're out on the

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.680 
seems dim in here when you're out on the
road<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:18.530> really<00:02:18.799> nice<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.010> bright<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:20.299> I

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
road it's really nice and bright so I

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.690 
road it's really nice and bright so I
might<00:02:21.319> change<00:02:21.560> my<00:02:21.680> mind<00:02:21.829> when<00:02:22.280> those<00:02:22.430> bulbs

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
might change my mind when those bulbs

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.930 
might change my mind when those bulbs
come<00:02:22.970> in<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.329> I<00:02:23.690> see<00:02:23.900> them<00:02:24.019> in<00:02:24.140> action<00:02:24.879> ok<00:02:25.879> so

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
come in and I see them in action ok so

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.729 
come in and I see them in action ok so
here<00:02:26.239> are<00:02:26.329> my<00:02:26.359> turn<00:02:26.629> signals

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.530 

with<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.890> rear<00:02:35.099> integrated

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.470 

the<00:02:40.079> right<00:02:40.290> flushmount<00:02:40.879> and<00:02:41.879> again<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.180> had<00:02:42.390> to

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the right flushmount and again I had to

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.869 
the right flushmount and again I had to
space<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.049> out<00:02:43.260> because<00:02:44.219> it<00:02:44.459> was<00:02:44.489> actually

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
space this out because it was actually

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:57.520 
space this out because it was actually
in<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.060> set<00:02:45.329> when<00:02:45.480> i<00:02:45.510> bought<00:02:45.780> it

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:06.340 

let's<00:02:58.069> go<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.459> other<00:02:58.490> way<00:03:01.959> left<00:03:02.959> side

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.480 

and<00:03:06.620> when<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:07.190> go<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.340> four<00:03:07.900> corner<00:03:09.490> LED

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
and when you go to four corner LED

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.080 
and when you go to four corner LED
flashers<00:03:11.350> you<00:03:12.350> need<00:03:12.530> you<00:03:13.190> need<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.460> install<00:03:13.850> an

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
flashers you need you need to install an

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.440 
flashers you need you need to install an
electronic<00:03:14.720> turn<00:03:14.960> signal<00:03:15.380> relay<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:16.450> you

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
electronic turn signal relay and you

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.800 
electronic turn signal relay and you
also<00:03:17.570> need<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:17.960> do<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> diode<00:03:18.740> mod<00:03:19.810> otherwise

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
also need to do a diode mod otherwise

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.010 
also need to do a diode mod otherwise
your<00:03:21.680> indicator<00:03:22.160> flasher<00:03:22.670> won't<00:03:22.880> flash<00:03:23.570> and

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
your indicator flasher won't flash and

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.090 
your indicator flasher won't flash and
then<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.520> fronts<00:03:25.910> will<00:03:26.900> both<00:03:27.080> flash<00:03:27.440> at

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
then the the fronts will both flash at

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.560 
then the the fronts will both flash at
the<00:03:28.280> same<00:03:28.520> time<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:28.970> you'll<00:03:29.060> get<00:03:29.150> some<00:03:29.360> funky

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
the same time and you'll get some funky

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.360 
the same time and you'll get some funky
stuff<00:03:29.720> going<00:03:30.170> on<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.410> back<00:03:30.560> too<00:03:30.830> so<00:03:31.760> oh<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:34.130> also

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
stuff going on the back too so oh I also

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.290 
stuff going on the back too so oh I also
installed<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:38.920> brake<00:03:39.920> light<00:03:40.160> flasher<00:03:40.730> let's

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
installed a brake light flasher let's

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.200 
installed a brake light flasher let's
see<00:03:41.420> if<00:03:41.510> i<00:03:41.630> can<00:03:41.810> get<00:03:41.990> this<00:03:42.820> get<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.030> little

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
see if i can get this get you a little

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:50.290 
see if i can get this get you a little
off-center<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:44.810> it's<00:03:45.200> not<00:03:45.350> blinding<00:03:48.520> and<00:03:49.520> it's

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
off-center so it's not blinding and it's

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.560 
off-center so it's not blinding and it's
got<00:03:50.480> a<00:03:50.510> delay<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.710> if<00:03:52.700> i<00:03:52.880> hit<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.060> brake<00:03:53.360> light

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
got a delay so if i hit the brake light

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.490 
got a delay so if i hit the brake light
immediately<00:03:54.130> or<00:03:55.130> within<00:03:55.760> about<00:03:56.660> 20<00:03:57.080> seconds

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
immediately or within about 20 seconds

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.380 
immediately or within about 20 seconds
of<00:03:57.680> breaking<00:03:58.160> it's<00:03:58.700> not<00:03:58.910> going<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.150> flash

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
of breaking it's not going to flash

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.250 
of breaking it's not going to flash
again<00:03:59.750> you<00:04:00.520> have<00:04:01.520> to<00:04:01.670> give<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:01.910> a<00:04:01.970> delay<00:04:02.270> but

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
again you have to give it a delay but

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.770 
again you have to give it a delay but
one<00:04:03.380> of<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.530> things<00:04:03.590> i<00:04:03.860> like<00:04:03.980> about<00:04:04.040> this

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
one of the things i like about this

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.960 
one of the things i like about this
brake<00:04:05.780> light<00:04:05.990> is<00:04:06.260> it<00:04:07.190> actually<00:04:07.340> has<00:04:07.700> dedicated

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
brake light is it actually has dedicated

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.570 
brake light is it actually has dedicated
leds<00:04:08.810> right<00:04:09.170> in<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.380> middle<00:04:09.590> for<00:04:10.310> when<00:04:10.460> you're

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
leds right in the middle for when you're

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.300 
leds right in the middle for when you're
breaking<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.960> only<00:04:12.110> light<00:04:12.380> up<00:04:12.590> when<00:04:13.190> you're

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
breaking that only light up when you're

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.860 
breaking that only light up when you're
breaking<00:04:13.670> so<00:04:14.450> it<00:04:14.540> looks<00:04:14.690> completely

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
breaking so it looks completely

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.420 
breaking so it looks completely
different<00:04:15.350> from<00:04:15.680> just<00:04:15.800> being<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.190> running

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
different from just being the running

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.960 
different from just being the running
light<00:04:17.380> kind<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:18.500> nice<00:04:21.640> it's<00:04:22.640> one<00:04:22.820> of<00:04:22.850> the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
light kind of nice it's one of the

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.550 
light kind of nice it's one of the
deciding<00:04:23.270> factors<00:04:23.390> that<00:04:23.990> made<00:04:24.200> me<00:04:24.320> buy<00:04:24.500> it

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
deciding factors that made me buy it

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.380 
deciding factors that made me buy it
actually<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.220> wasn't<00:04:25.430> going<00:04:25.610> to<00:04:25.670> do<00:04:25.820> in<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.030> LED

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
actually I wasn't going to do in the LED
