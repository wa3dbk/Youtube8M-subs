00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.259

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.450
 to say news things because the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.560
 we have here in tournaments please 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.940
 good to talk about kelly clarkson 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.859
 that has recently been promoted 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.300
 on your twitter about your new 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.010
 record work does not stop 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.720
 ask the fans obviously how it goes 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.490
 to sound good what is the color that 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.390
 has prepared as a first single is 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.949
 asking about this new 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.359
 record work and per hundred has 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.399
 pronounced that the chrono are saying 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.120
 that the sound of this record is going to be pop 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.590
 mixed with air and be rock country and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:44.190
 of is it so we can expect something 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:46.200
 quite successful and we can expect something 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.940
 pretty good at least that fusion to me 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.289
 I find it so interesting if it's true 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.750
 that I do not like the mint council of 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.980
 kelly clarkson the side up of the song 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.690
 of great successes I did not like at all 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.690
 and I hope to have songs 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:04.170
 I get bored 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.670
 if in pop rock you are sublime and 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.390
 since you have also shown who is 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.740
 very good so 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.050
 with these genres that are the ones that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.400
 they like me the first 5 you know what is 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.190
 a coloring one of those masculine 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.540
 that we all adore according to her and she has 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.979
 pronounced a little saying that it is 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.380
 a singer with whom he has already collaborated 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.390
 previously somehow it has not 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.050
 said that vocally not in some way 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.970
 has collaborated the letters of the discs 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.020
 etcetera I have been studying and one of 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.780
 the singers with whom he has collaborated 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.880
 in the book action is Jason villain who 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.740
 it's a country star there's a 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.420
 america so it could be this the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.240
 coloring of the new initial album and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.460
 carson and has also given two clues and 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.950
 that does not get that how it will be titled 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.899
 new single has said 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.090
 the pieces heart tests and test 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.390
 of life I think that there can be 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.270
 tender heart and byd drive by the heart 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.770
 beats by red then be modeling 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.880
 it is not rumored if it has been 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.679
 recorded a song called 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.929
 heart beats are so very 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.000
 probably that's going to be the title of 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.369
 first single of the new kelly record 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.950
 clarkson heart beats are in collaboration 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.690
 with still do not know if it is Jason auden 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.640
 or we have to stop a little longer to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.780
 I would love to know it, as I said 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.780
 let him go with him 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.280
 and I think that quite successful that is 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.170
 starting to fall a little bit that those two 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.090
 last albums of great hits and 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.500
 then the Christmas record did not have 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.420
 too much success so I think he 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.940
 it does a pretty powerful correlation 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.069
 to resurface let's hope it keeps sounding 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.170
 as fabulous as ever and also 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.330
 comments every written a hashtag that 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.879
 says the next episode is being rumored 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.950
 as a disc title I do not think so 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.340
 true the next episode sounds like wing 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.810
 It is not very used anymore I do not like that it reads 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.640
 so good we hope more 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.250
 information on Katy's new album 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.690
 hudson coloring the date of 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.370
 release of this first single in 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.319
 correlation with the male artist who 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.610
 it's a mystery to even comment here 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.590
 below that you think all this data 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.420
