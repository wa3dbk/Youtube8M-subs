shaped into the ball make sure there's

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.290 
shaped into the ball make sure there's
um<00:00:57.330> no<00:00:58.200> cracks<00:00:58.740> because<00:00:59.160> cracks<00:00:59.640> do<00:00:59.940> really

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
affect the shape of the jelly bean like

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.279 
affect the shape of the jelly bean like
one<00:01:02.880> time<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.210> tried<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.450> make<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.750> jelly<00:01:04.049> bean

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:04.289 
one time I tried to make a jelly bean

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:05.959 
one time I tried to make a jelly bean
with<00:01:04.469> the<00:01:04.559> crack<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.039> like<00:01:05.219> crack<00:01:05.579> right<00:01:05.820> in

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:05.969 
with the crack in it like crack right in

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:10.639 
with the crack in it like crack right in
half<00:01:06.149> so<00:01:06.829> it's<00:01:07.829> not<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.009> good<00:01:09.229> any<00:01:10.229> once<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
half so it's not that good any once you

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:11.959 
half so it's not that good any once you
do<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.799> you're<00:01:11.100> gonna<00:01:11.189> roll<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.609> out<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:11.969 
do that you're gonna roll it out and

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.450 
do that you're gonna roll it out and
make<00:01:12.210> sure<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.600> ends<00:01:12.869> are<00:01:12.960> still<00:01:13.229> rounded<00:01:13.770> so

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
make sure the ends are still rounded so

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.760 
make sure the ends are still rounded so
after<00:01:14.999> like<00:01:15.179> each<00:01:15.420> little<00:01:15.810> roll<00:01:16.140> round<00:01:16.469> off

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
after like each little roll round off

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.739 
after like each little roll round off
the<00:01:16.799> edges<00:01:17.039> because<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.729> don't<00:01:17.969> want<00:01:18.090> them<00:01:18.450> to

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:18.749 
the edges because you don't want them to

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:22.010 
the edges because you don't want them to
look<00:01:18.929> like<00:01:19.109> they're<00:01:19.289> separated<00:01:20.030> like<00:01:21.030> like

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
look like they're separated like like

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.309 
look like they're separated like like
this<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.499> don't<00:01:22.619> want<00:01:22.829> it<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.130> look<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.340> this

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
so anyway round off the edges and i'll

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.510 
so anyway round off the edges and i'll
show<00:01:28.469> you<00:01:28.530> when<00:01:28.829> i<00:01:28.889> have<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.280> rolled<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:32.340> once

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
show you when i have it rolled so once

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.709 
show you when i have it rolled so once
you<00:01:32.639> have<00:01:32.670> something<00:01:33.149> that<00:01:33.329> looks<00:01:33.359> like<00:01:33.600> this

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:35.999 
you should be able to start on your

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:40.219 
you should be able to start on your
jelly<00:01:36.240> bean<00:01:38.060> sorry<00:01:39.060> about<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.329> anyway<00:01:39.990> once

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
jelly bean sorry about that anyway once

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.359 
jelly bean sorry about that anyway once
you<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.560> something<00:01:40.889> that<00:01:41.039> looks<00:01:41.069> like<00:01:41.280> this

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
you're going to do is find the middle of

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.609 
you're going to do is find the middle of
jelly<00:01:47.189> bean<00:01:47.429> and<00:01:47.670> either<00:01:48.030> use<00:01:48.420> your<00:01:48.899> pinky<00:01:49.380> or

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
jelly bean and either use your pinky or

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.840 
jelly bean and either use your pinky or
your<00:01:49.979> index<00:01:50.369> finger<00:01:50.810> push<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:53.270> curl<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.389> up

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
your index finger push in and curl it up

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.319 
your index finger push in and curl it up
you<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.179> run<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.109> a<00:01:58.139> bit<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:01.969> then<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.119> have

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
you can run it a bit and then you have

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.969 
you can run it a bit and then you have
your<00:02:03.359> jelly<00:02:03.810> bean<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.319> a<00:02:04.380> really<00:02:04.529> simple

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
your jelly bean so it's a really simple

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.600
