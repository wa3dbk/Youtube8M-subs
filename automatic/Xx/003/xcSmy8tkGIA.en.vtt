 our live user speaks to you or our 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.600

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.789
 to the bios of our pc to be able 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.010
 boot from a disk or the usb to 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.949

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.420
 small teams here I am 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.309
 showing some images of how it 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.530
 must see our bios to be able 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.950
 boot with our dvd flip or usb 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.600
 now we start our 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.900
 eusebio so waiting for it to start alone 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.320
 once windows 8.1 has been booted 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.240
 we follow these steps 1 install now is 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.729
 the first step will show a screen 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.090
 where you only need to click 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.009

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.030
 msj 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.350

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.690
 this step you select how you 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.659
 is going to install windows there are two 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.520
 possible options update in this 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.280
 case the files and the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.409
 custom user settings 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.590
 is the optimal way since the 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.600
 installation from scratch recommended 5 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.880
 where to install windows 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.310
 step where it is necessary to choose the disk 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.500
 If there is more than one in the team and 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.990
 partition where to install is also 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.330
 possible to delete a partition create a 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.110
 in case the disk is virgin and 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.690
 format it 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.880
 finally formatting just use it 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.590
 for an installation from scratch gives a 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.910
 click on next to start the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.830
 installation process 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.620
 when the computer finishes it restarts 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.810
 again 6 in the third stage the 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.520
 installation program will ask if 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.310
 use the quick configuration or 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.990
 customize it manually 7 by 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.510
