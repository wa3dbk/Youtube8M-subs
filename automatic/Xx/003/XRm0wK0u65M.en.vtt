I<00:02:11.409> can<00:02:11.920> do<00:02:12.069> that<00:02:12.220> as<00:02:12.400> well<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:13.200> then<00:02:14.200> let's<00:02:14.440> go

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
I can do that as well and then let's go

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.970 
I can do that as well and then let's go
ahead<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:15.159> take<00:02:15.700> another<00:02:15.970> bead<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.980> we'll

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
drop that down in there and you could

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.830 
drop that down in there and you could
just<00:02:20.560> continue<00:02:21.129> to<00:02:21.430> do<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:21.849> until<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.599> had

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
just continue to do this until you had
