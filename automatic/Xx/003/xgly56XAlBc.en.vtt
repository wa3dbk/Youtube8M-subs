probably shouldn't be playing a game and
basically<00:00:51.699> it's<00:00:52.270> sort<00:00:52.480> of<00:00:52.539> like<00:00:52.600> king<00:00:52.840> of<00:00:52.930> the

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
basically it's sort of like king of the

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.310 
basically it's sort of like king of the
hill<00:00:53.140> from<00:00:53.289> Halo<00:00:53.649> 3<00:00:53.680> I<00:00:54.690> there's<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.899> corner

you yes only the person in the corner
ken<00:01:33.820> sniper<00:01:34.240> mmm<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.320> throwing<00:01:35.590> knife<00:01:35.710> is

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
ken sniper mmm the throwing knife is

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.590 
ken sniper mmm the throwing knife is
obviously<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.310> best<00:01:36.400> option<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.240> are

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
obviously the best option and are

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.410 
obviously the best option and are
similar<00:01:38.050> can<00:01:38.260> use<00:01:38.440> all<00:01:38.590> three<00:01:38.800> and<00:01:39.300> you<00:01:40.300> know

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
similar can use all three and you know

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.390 
similar can use all three and you know
the<00:01:40.540> idea<00:01:40.690> is<00:01:40.930> to<00:01:41.020> keep<00:01:41.230> the<00:01:41.470> action<00:01:42.130> fast

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
the idea is to keep the action fast

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.760 
the idea is to keep the action fast
paced<00:01:42.820> so<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:44.050> know<00:01:44.140> that's<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.530> point<00:01:44.680> of

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
paced so you know that's the point of

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.980 
paced so you know that's the point of
the<00:01:44.860> tactical<00:01:45.280> insertions<00:01:45.820> ome<00:01:46.540> scorn<00:01:46.870> and

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
the tactical insertions ome scorn and

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.900 
the tactical insertions ome scorn and
sort<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.260> like<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.410> general<00:01:47.890> vicinity<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.670> the

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
sort of like a general vicinity to the

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.640 
sort of like a general vicinity to the
corner<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.510> you<00:01:49.570> know<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.320> just<00:01:50.380> keeps

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
corner and you know it just keeps

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.650 
corner and you know it just keeps
everything<00:01:50.920> fast<00:01:51.220> pace<00:01:51.400> especially<00:01:51.550> with<00:01:51.970> low

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
everything fast pace especially with low

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.540 
everything fast pace especially with low
player<00:01:52.930> games<00:01:53.290> like<00:01:53.890> there's<00:01:54.100> only<00:01:54.220> cool

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
player games like there's only cool

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.010 
player games like there's only cool
right<00:01:54.760> now<00:01:54.910> in<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.120> game<00:01:55.300> and<00:01:55.480> if<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:55.660> had<00:01:55.780> ten

right now in the game and if you had ten

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.930 
right now in the game and if you had ten
you<00:01:56.290> know<00:01:56.380> maybe<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:56.740> would<00:01:57.040> not<00:01:57.430> even<00:01:57.490> need

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
you know maybe you would not even need

this is one of the things that the ti um
we<00:02:25.240> created<00:02:25.690> kind<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.930> like<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.050> square<00:02:26.620> box

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
we created kind of like a square box

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.250 
we created kind of like a square box
almost<00:02:27.640> going<00:02:27.970> from<00:02:28.270> like<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.630> ladder<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:29.140> get

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
almost going from like the ladder to get

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.120 
almost going from like the ladder to get
up<00:02:29.320> on<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.850> left<00:02:31.030> here<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.860> where<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:33.010> know

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
up on the left here to where you know

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.680 
up on the left here to where you know
right<00:02:33.310> now<00:02:33.400> I'm<00:02:33.520> at<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:33.790> box<00:02:34.060> corner<00:02:34.540> that's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
right now I'm at this box corner that's

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.960 
right now I'm at this box corner that's
an<00:02:34.840> hour<00:02:34.960> boundary<00:02:35.860> line<00:02:36.040> over<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.670> cup

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
an hour boundary line over to the cup

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.030 
an hour boundary line over to the cup
was<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.660> cave<00:02:37.930> underground<00:02:38.230> area<00:02:38.710> on<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.890> life
