00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
talking about how to plant vegetables in

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.570 
talking about how to plant vegetables in
clay<00:00:12.360> soil<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:13.590> I'm<00:00:13.889> just<00:00:14.099> going<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.309> give<00:00:14.460> you

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
clay soil so I'm just going to give you

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.870 
clay soil so I'm just going to give you
a<00:00:14.610> few<00:00:14.820> examples<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.389> what<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.719> do<00:00:15.870> basically

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
a few examples of what to do basically

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.000 
a few examples of what to do basically
you<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:17.910> want<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.510> reboot<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.500> soil<00:00:19.740> make

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
you just want to reboot the soil make

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.040 
you just want to reboot the soil make
sure<00:00:20.130> has<00:00:20.279> enough<00:00:20.490> nutrients<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.510> make

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
sure has enough nutrients in it and make

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.410 
sure has enough nutrients in it and make
sure<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.160> got<00:00:23.400> good<00:00:23.730> enough<00:00:23.880> drainage

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
sure that it's got good enough drainage

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.509 
sure that it's got good enough drainage
because<00:00:24.660> clay<00:00:25.080> can<00:00:25.289> be<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.619> hard<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.039> compact

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
because clay can be so hard and compact

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.300 
because clay can be so hard and compact
that<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> plants<00:00:27.449> don't<00:00:27.510> actually<00:00:27.750> have

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
that the plants don't actually have

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.040 
that the plants don't actually have
enough<00:00:29.310> room<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.550> drain<00:00:30.029> off<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.300> water<00:00:30.570> which

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
enough room to drain off the water which

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.749 
enough room to drain off the water which
is<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> constant<00:00:31.830> cycle<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.219> plants<00:00:32.550> need<00:00:32.730> to

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
is a constant cycle that plants need to

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.049 
is a constant cycle that plants need to
stay<00:00:33.149> healthy<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:35.040> lighten<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.460> clay<00:00:35.730> soil

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
stay healthy so to lighten up clay soil

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.080 
stay healthy so to lighten up clay soil
you<00:00:36.510> want<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.809> take<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> spade<00:00:37.350> or<00:00:37.380> shovel<00:00:38.090> and

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
you're going to loosen all of the soil

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:50.389 
you're going to loosen all of the soil
in<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.239> area<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.390> want<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.629> plant<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.160> once

you've loosened it all you want to take
a<00:00:52.170> healthy<00:00:52.800> healthy<00:00:53.039> serving<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.750> compost

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.959 

compost<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.140> only<00:00:58.530> will<00:00:58.890> lighten<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.460> but

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
compost not only will lighten it up but

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.630 
compost not only will lighten it up but
it'll<00:01:00.059> also<00:01:00.300> add<00:01:00.920> much-needed<00:01:01.920> nutrients<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
it'll also add much-needed nutrients to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.570 
it'll also add much-needed nutrients to
the<00:01:02.670> soil<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:04.939> will<00:01:05.939> also<00:01:06.119> use<00:01:06.450> peat<00:01:06.780> moss

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
the soil and will also use peat moss

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.120 
the soil and will also use peat moss
which<00:01:08.580> also<00:01:09.570> lighten<00:01:09.930> soil<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.470> X<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
which also lighten soil and X is a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.820 
which also lighten soil and X is a
fertilizer<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.810> see<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.590> very

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
fertilizer as you can see it's very

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.429 
fertilizer as you can see it's very
light<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.340> fluffy<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.119> flaky<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.290> will

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
light and fluffy and flaky so this will

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.590 
light and fluffy and flaky so this will
really<00:01:16.590> lighten<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.280> soil<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.759> make<00:01:18.330> sure

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
really lighten up the soil and make sure

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.499 
really lighten up the soil and make sure
that<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.259> plants<00:01:19.770> will<00:01:20.430> allow<00:01:20.880> enough<00:01:21.240> room

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
that the plants will allow enough room

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.330 
that the plants will allow enough room
for<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.810> root<00:01:21.960> systems<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.560> grow<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
for the root systems to grow and the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.940 
for the root systems to grow and the
water<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.729> drain<00:01:23.909> off<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.619> really<00:01:25.770> about

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
water to drain off so it's really about

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.070 
water to drain off so it's really about
boosting<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.060> soil<00:01:27.330> you're<00:01:27.540> working<00:01:27.900> with

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
boosting the soil you're working with

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.170 
boosting the soil you're working with
when<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> comes<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.009> clay<00:01:29.220> soil<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.820> you'll

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
when it comes to clay soil and you'll

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.850 
when it comes to clay soil and you'll
just<00:01:30.329> want<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> give<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.840> real<00:01:31.350> hearty

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
just want to give that a real hearty

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.120 
just want to give that a real hearty
mixing<00:01:32.310> making<00:01:33.150> sure<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.509> get<00:01:33.780> down<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.950> know

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
mixing making sure you get down you know

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.550 
mixing making sure you get down you know
my<00:01:35.610> spade<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.240> all<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.630> way<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.960> so

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
my spade is going all the way in so

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.590 
my spade is going all the way in so
that's<00:01:37.680> about<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.040> good<00:01:38.250> four<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.030> six<00:01:39.240> inches

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
that's about a good four to six inches

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.280 
that's about a good four to six inches
so<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.890> root<00:01:41.070> systems<00:01:41.720> can<00:01:42.720> really<00:01:43.049> get<00:01:43.200> in

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
so the root systems can really get in

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.520 
so the root systems can really get in
there<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.619> whatever<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.950> want<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.159> plant<00:01:45.530> now

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
there to whatever you want to plant now

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.990 
there to whatever you want to plant now
if<00:01:46.860> you're<00:01:47.009> working<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.340> clay<00:01:47.460> soil<00:01:47.759> want<00:01:47.939> to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
if you're working with clay soil want to

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.399 
if you're working with clay soil want to
do<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.240> process<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.259> entire<00:01:49.710> bed<00:01:51.409> before

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
do this process to the entire bed before

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.319 
do this process to the entire bed before
you<00:01:52.740> plant<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.310> then<00:01:53.790> whatever<00:01:54.060> you're
