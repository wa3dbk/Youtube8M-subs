00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
pylon just I stand on the edge so you

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.749 
pylon just I stand on the edge so you
can<00:01:53.960> just<00:01:54.140> about<00:01:54.350> see<00:01:54.410> his<00:01:54.740> hair<00:01:55.010> right<00:01:55.400> here

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
and like what should happen

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.870 
and like what should happen
we<00:01:59.030> should<00:01:59.270> shew<00:01:59.540> him<00:01:59.869> he<00:02:00.170> should<00:02:01.130> respond

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
we should shew him he should respond

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.570 
we should shew him he should respond
where<00:02:02.210> you<00:02:02.750> killed<00:02:03.020> him<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:03.830> basically<00:02:04.280> it's

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
where you killed him so basically it's

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.249 
where you killed him so basically it's
fastener<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.150> him<00:02:05.420> pone<00:02:05.660> attached<00:02:05.960> going

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
fastener and him pone attached going

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.190 
fastener and him pone attached going
surging<00:02:06.710> down<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:08.330> think<00:02:08.750> it's<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:08.990> best

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
surging down and I think it's the best

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.170 
surging down and I think it's the best
way<00:02:09.410> for<00:02:09.440> split<00:02:09.890> screen<00:02:10.130> for<00:02:10.340> leveling<00:02:10.700> up<00:02:10.910> so

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
way for split screen for leveling up so

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.480 
way for split screen for leveling up so
here<00:02:11.570> you<00:02:11.660> go

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
here you go

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.699 
here you go
now<00:02:13.490> you<00:02:13.550> should<00:02:13.760> respond<00:02:14.180> back<00:02:14.390> see<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:15.560> just

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
now you should respond back see it just

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.330 
now you should respond back see it just
gets<00:02:16.010> your<00:02:16.190> kid<00:02:16.430> was<00:02:16.550> really<00:02:17.030> far<00:02:18.010> now<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.040> would

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
gets your kid was really far now I would

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.460 
gets your kid was really far now I would
recommend<00:02:20.150> using<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.690> first<00:02:20.900> or<00:02:21.080> even<00:02:21.110> faster

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
recommend using the first or even faster

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.750 
recommend using the first or even faster
player<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.160> that's<00:02:23.030> faster<00:02:23.959> at<00:02:24.800> respawning<00:02:25.519> so

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
player to that's faster at respawning so

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.720 
player to that's faster at respawning so
and<00:02:26.000> reason<00:02:26.800> just<00:02:27.800> got<00:02:28.130> purpose<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:29.180> think<00:02:30.730> yes

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
and reason just got purpose I think yes
