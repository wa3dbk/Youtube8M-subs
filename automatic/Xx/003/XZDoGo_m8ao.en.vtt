quite patient with a different take
downs<00:04:14.440> like<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:14.890> but<00:04:15.520> you<00:04:15.550> can<00:04:15.790> be<00:04:15.910> more

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
downs like you but you can be more

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.599 
downs like you but you can be more
aggressive<00:04:16.299> that's<00:04:16.720> totally<00:04:17.109> your<00:04:17.260> choice

let's<00:04:18.609> try<00:04:18.760> more<00:04:19.000> aggressive<00:04:19.419> take<00:04:19.660> down<00:04:19.870> here

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
let's try more aggressive take down here

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.539 
let's try more aggressive take down here
there's<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.410> few<00:04:20.590> less<00:04:20.709> of<00:04:20.859> them<00:04:20.950> around<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:21.489> I

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
there's a few less of them around so I

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.280 
there's a few less of them around so I
can<00:04:21.609> be<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:21.910> little<00:04:22.120> bit<00:04:22.300> more<00:04:22.510> confident<00:04:23.169> in

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
can be a little bit more confident in

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.440 
can be a little bit more confident in
the<00:04:23.919> different<00:04:24.220> tactics<00:04:24.610> i'll<00:04:24.760> use<00:04:25.030> so<00:04:25.360> i'll

you can see the bat icon above his head

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.680 
you can see the bat icon above his head
signifiers<00:04:33.669> he's<00:04:33.940> in<00:04:34.060> range<00:04:34.210> for<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.540> glide

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
signifiers he's in range for the glide

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.810 
signifiers he's in range for the glide
kick<00:04:35.020> I'll<00:04:35.950> just<00:04:36.160> check<00:04:36.310> no<00:04:36.460> one<00:04:36.550> else<00:04:36.669> is

around and then i can drop down look

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.170 
around and then i can drop down look
into<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.630> ground<00:04:41.669> that'll<00:04:42.669> only<00:04:42.760> standing

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
into the ground that'll only standing

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.580 
into the ground that'll only standing
for<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.360> while<00:04:43.510> so<00:04:43.720> i<00:04:43.780> need<00:04:43.930> to<00:04:43.960> move<00:04:44.229> up<00:04:44.440> and

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
for a while so i need to move up and

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.190 
for a while so i need to move up and
finish<00:04:44.860> him<00:04:44.979> off<00:04:45.330> and<00:04:46.330> then<00:04:46.419> again<00:04:46.750> grapple

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
finish him off and then again grapple

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.170 
finish him off and then again grapple
back<00:04:47.380> up<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:47.830> out<00:04:47.950> because<00:04:48.639> that's<00:04:48.820> a<00:04:48.940> very

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
back up and out because that's a very

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.730 
back up and out because that's a very
noisy<00:04:49.419> take<00:04:49.840> down<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.169> glide<00:04:50.350> think<00:04:50.620> it's

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
noisy take down the glide think it's

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.260 
noisy take down the glide think it's
going<00:04:50.889> to<00:04:50.950> attract<00:04:51.190> people<00:04:51.550> very<00:04:51.790> quickly<00:04:51.880> to

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
going to attract people very quickly to

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.210 
going to attract people very quickly to
it<00:04:52.570> so<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:52.930> is<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.050> dangerous<00:04:53.290> tactic<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:53.979> use

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
it so it is a dangerous tactic to use

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.040 
it so it is a dangerous tactic to use
but<00:04:54.370> it's<00:04:54.520> also<00:04:54.639> a<00:04:54.760> very<00:04:55.000> effective<00:04:55.360> tactic<00:04:55.930> to

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
but it's also a very effective tactic to

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.050 
but it's also a very effective tactic to
you<00:04:59.160> so<00:05:00.160> now<00:05:00.190> we're<00:05:00.460> down<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:00.639> just<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:01.030> couple

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
of henchmen laughing and when they

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.159 
of henchmen laughing and when they
realize<00:05:03.850> that<00:05:03.880> you'll<00:05:04.300> see<00:05:04.479> their<00:05:04.690> behavior

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
realize that you'll see their behavior

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:06.780 
realize that you'll see their behavior
starts<00:05:05.500> to<00:05:05.590> change<00:05:05.800> as<00:05:06.040> well<00:05:06.190> as<00:05:06.370> they<00:05:06.520> become

more and more terrified so again joke is
all<00:05:09.850> during<00:05:10.030> his<00:05:10.120> henchmen<00:05:10.540> around<00:05:10.770> but

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
all during his henchmen around but

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
you'll see that they start to become

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.670 
you'll see that they start to become
more<00:05:13.600> and<00:05:13.720> more<00:05:13.780> nervous<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.320> follow<00:05:14.500> his

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
more and more nervous to follow his

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.130 
more and more nervous to follow his
orders<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:16.180> henchmen<00:05:16.539> there's<00:05:16.720> gone<00:05:16.900> up<00:05:17.020> but

orders the henchmen there's gone up but
the<00:05:17.260> second<00:05:17.590> henchman<00:05:17.919> isn't<00:05:18.130> so<00:05:18.280> keen<00:05:18.520> to

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
the second henchman isn't so keen to

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.670 
the second henchman isn't so keen to
follow<00:05:18.910> behind<00:05:19.090> him<00:05:19.479> and<00:05:19.930> this<00:05:20.229> again<00:05:20.500> it's
