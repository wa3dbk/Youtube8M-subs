00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
can think of I don't know if maybe this

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.160 
can think of I don't know if maybe this
this<00:02:30.910> might<00:02:31.150> have<00:02:31.270> anything<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.750> do<00:02:31.840> with<00:02:31.990> it

see this is all separated and whatnot I
don't<00:02:35.320> know<00:02:35.410> if<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.680> has<00:02:35.890> anything<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.340> do

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
don't know if that has anything to do

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.360 
don't know if that has anything to do
with<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.730> or<00:02:36.910> not<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:40.709> one<00:02:41.709> more<00:02:41.920> thing<00:02:41.950> is

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
with it or not but one more thing is

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.229 
with it or not but one more thing is
that<00:02:42.580> while<00:02:42.880> back<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.480> heard<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:44.050> small<00:02:44.830> beep

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
come from one of these capacitors here

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.150 
come from one of these capacitors here
well<00:02:50.320> know<00:02:50.500> if<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.770> could<00:02:50.890> have<00:02:51.010> been<00:02:51.100> a

one I mean you know I was spent a month
or<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.050> trying<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.590> fix<00:03:43.830> this<00:03:43.950> thing<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:45.590> I

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
seat clamp heatsink stuff could have

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.840
