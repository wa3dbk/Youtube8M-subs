00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.140
 I hope you are good family 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.339
 business friends loves loves 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.049
 health me it's going nickel 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.519
 I have great pleasure today from you 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.170
 find for episode 2 of everything 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.610
 know about origin so I know I put 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.349
 a little bit of time out but 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.240
 you do not know I have a life next to them 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.890
 the recovery back to school and so it's 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.779
 it was a bit long but I hope 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.189
 that you will be happy to have this 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.500
 episode so here we'll start everything 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.750
 immediately with the robots then the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.430
 robots it's very simple it allows you 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.080
 to be able to build the wind stick 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.789
 and you will be able to go to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.820
 inside for what they call it 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.260
 will be one of the two feet of the robot the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.130
 Most of the time there will be at least one 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.020
 both feet but it can happen 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.590
 that there are none that will be 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.850
 illuminated 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.500
 so once it will be illuminated you 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.899
 will need great fingerprint management 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.399
 thirteen below his sole and you 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.079
 can you teleport blood soo 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.640
 lee rocard damage then where you 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.020
 can take a room or activate the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.680
 radio for music etc 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.989
 and after about fifteen seconds 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.809
 you will undergo a sequence of purging yourself 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.120
 will be automatically evicted so you 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.440
 do not suffer any damage here is so 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.010
 that was for robots then for 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.329
 music 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.500
 so I made two videos for them 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.210
 music one for the front john 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.409
 sevenfold and one for the most way 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.510
 classic so I wanted to apologize 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.220
 because I realized everything at 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.000
 the hour as music with a meteorite 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.729
 so what am I trying to do 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.990
 show now I had posted it without 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.520
 command paris and I had no 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.380
 comment to remind me 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.400
 so I'm completely sorry for everything 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.479
 If it's you that's it not 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.439
 does not look at all I leave you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.439
 listen to just a small excerpt 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.799
 so that was the first 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.299
 music so effective with the 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.950
 green meteorites then the second so 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.380
 it's the same I make a video I 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.090
 does not explain in detail because ben 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.469
 already know it's already on my channel but 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.700
 it's just to remember there it will be 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.130
 with the red raj so we will have a 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.990
 in the robot near the church a meadow 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.170
 Paka punch and the last will be 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.729
 to argas so you have for me it's the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.959
 better the one of havas john paul julhÃ¨s 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.959
 also listen to a small excerpt 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.180
 and that's it now so I'm you 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.110
 was talking about elementary sticks so yes 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.480
 I guess you know now 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.970
 that there are elementary sticks then 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.060
 I'm going to show you the 4 bat have 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.170
 improved their damage their efficiency and 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.690
 so that's where you see the stick the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.400
 powder then I will not risk you 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.680
 do tutorials how to build them 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.209
 and that's because I would be afraid to say 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.560
 nonsense especially about the cds 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.090
 because I do not know all the sports 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.850
 on the other hand I'm going to lead in the end 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.739
 of video so there you see the tear of the 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.970
 wine forgive the wind stick that create 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.290
 tornadoes and more huge and just 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.120
 my favorite is this one here is the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.590
 good ice time so I said I 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.540
 send you on a video of zambia 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.100
 factory who lost early really very 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.890
 complete how to build the sticks and 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.569
 improve them so here and I just I 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.130
 shows you their different 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.730
 abilities once they are 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.500
 improved just I tell you quickly 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.989
 the young sticks is built with the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.269
 euro coins the fire stick with in 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.750
 killing a panzer robot by activating the 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.930
 generator 6 and killing by destroying 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.280
 a plane in the sky the ice stick 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.820
 built with four pieces unearthed 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.410
 and the electric baton is built with 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.340
 pieces of time that finally it takes 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.370
 go get through tanks so 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.510
 this is the drone of maxis then the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.269
 dong as well if I had made a talk a 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.920
 video will get the improved mg 8 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.329
 so to build it's very simple 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.799
 should you go to spawn 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.510
 this piece will always be there then the 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.600
 second piece will be in this sector more 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.400
 or less is always in the top 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.900
 level same place pretty much so 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.579
 that's the same place third place 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.109
 find at the top of the punch package she can 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.130
 Also found in the basement but I 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.090
 tell you it's really always in the 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.070
 same sector once you 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.540
 crafter you can take it 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.070
 only after a while he will have to 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.350
 go recharge voice if he could not 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.829
 they will not have any battery any more 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.730
 simply 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.709
 so we all know 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.510
 the utility of the dropt 2 maxis in particular 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.819
 as for the shots it will also allow 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.799
 to have the 8 mg thus improved the big 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.629
 collider like jelly in the 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.069
 video but what people that a little 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.230
 little less is that it also allows 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.769
 of real but your teammates so there 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.659
 as you see 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:18.440
 I had launched rome world of maxis he 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:21.739
 value resuscitate my teammate in 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.250
 simply him red tang in not 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.930
 a place of small glow refreshing 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.000
 here I do not know how to describe 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.950
 so that's always it is that you can 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.450
 revived thanks to the drones of maxis so 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.110
 that cat people know it a little bit 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.510
 less so that's what is episode of 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.370
 to know everything about origin is already finished 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.510
 I hope I have been clear enough 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.210
 I was trying to be fast at the same time 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.390
 and little that at all times and when it's 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.730
 quite accurate and concise so I was turning 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.530
 still to apologize for the episode where 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.610
 how to activate the secret music the 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.290
 first tell me that I posted the 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.490
 bad video I'm not at all 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.410
 happy I'm really going to do how 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.580
 you have nothing but I'm sorry for 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.720
 now I will leave like that but 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.170
 you should have told me in the 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.820
 comments 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.000
 it's not serious or even a small peak of my 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.530
 share this good word excuse we will say so 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.060
 so here I leave you on the intro of 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.440
 so the cdc went to really see the tutorial 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.760
 to build and improve the sticks 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.300
 from the factory I tell you to very 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.920
 soon it was vauxois worse this 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.720
 video call you then look at that of 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.750
 our other partners with sky profit 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.550
 ngp killer 59 taskiller against 25 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.530
 you are just area where everyone 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.510
 like that t bomb factory we 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.280
 represent the cdc the community of 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.800
 strings and we only have one word 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.610
 of order respects in laye
