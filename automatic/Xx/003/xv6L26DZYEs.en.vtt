animation is known as rotoscoping this

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:35.930 
animation is known as rotoscoping this
method<00:00:34.410> involves<00:00:34.980> first<00:00:35.219> taking<00:00:35.760> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
method involves first taking a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.660 
method involves first taking a
photograph<00:00:36.179> of<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.839> person<00:00:37.019> and<00:00:37.679> then<00:00:38.280> tracing

photograph of a person and then tracing
their<00:00:38.999> movements<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.409> advantage<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.280> this

their movements the advantage of this

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:43.639 
their movements the advantage of this
technique<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.929> can<00:00:43.170> recreate

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
technique is that you can recreate

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.130 
technique is that you can recreate
characters<00:00:44.489> movements<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.269> an<00:00:45.510> incredibly

realistic way while at the same time

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.430 
realistic way while at the same time
retaining<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.460> look<00:00:50.609> of<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.819> drawing<00:00:51.089> I<00:00:51.449> think

retaining the look of a drawing I think

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.410 
retaining the look of a drawing I think
this<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.769> the<00:00:52.920> most<00:00:53.100> significant<00:00:53.909> advantage

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
this is the most significant advantage

this is the most significant advantage
of<00:00:54.809> utilizing<00:00:55.319> this<00:00:55.620> technique<00:00:56.100> let's<00:00:56.969> follow

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
of utilizing this technique let's follow

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.540 
of utilizing this technique let's follow
the<00:00:57.659> process<00:00:58.229> of<00:00:58.530> creating<00:00:58.979> one<00:00:59.339> of<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the process of creating one of the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.289 
the process of creating one of the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the characters in the game so you take

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.859 
the characters in the game so you take

the game and what their personality is
like<00:02:11.190> then<00:02:12.060> we'll<00:02:12.270> get<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> actor<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.959> perform

upload to a computer and start working
on<00:02:32.580> them<00:02:32.819> from<00:02:33.150> there<00:02:33.420> we'll<00:02:34.140> select<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:35.010> best

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
on them from there we'll select the best

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.729 
on them from there we'll select the best
movements<00:02:35.970> from<00:02:36.239> each<00:02:36.450> sequence<00:02:37.110> and

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
movements from each sequence and

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.160 
movements from each sequence and
basically<00:02:38.190> clip<00:02:38.700> them<00:02:38.910> out<00:02:39.090> that's<00:02:39.989> the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
basically clip them out that's the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.890 
basically clip them out that's the
general<00:02:40.650> idea<00:02:40.800> after<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.880> it's<00:02:42.510> time<00:02:42.840> to

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
general idea after that it's time to

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.479 
general idea after that it's time to
trace<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.650> characters<00:02:45.260> as<00:02:46.260> we<00:02:47.190> go<00:02:47.340> about

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
trace the characters as we go about

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.300 
trace the characters as we go about
creating<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.450> characters<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.590> first<00:02:49.920> task

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
creating the characters the first task

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.140 
creating the characters the first task
is<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.700> sketch<00:02:51.330> in<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.780> line<00:02:51.989> drawings<00:02:52.910> we<00:02:53.910> do

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
is to sketch in the line drawings we do

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.660 
is to sketch in the line drawings we do
this<00:02:54.390> by<00:02:54.630> tracing<00:02:55.050> around<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.799> image<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.430> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
this by tracing around the image of the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.140 
this by tracing around the image of the
model<00:02:57.440> but<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.590> idea<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.069> not<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.549> trace<00:02:59.910> the

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
model but the idea is not to trace the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.199 
model but the idea is not to trace the
model<00:03:00.450> perfectly<00:03:01.220> instead<00:03:02.220> we<00:03:02.459> draw<00:03:02.760> rough

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
model perfectly instead we draw rough

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.430 
model perfectly instead we draw rough
lines<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.930> add<00:03:04.560> dynamic<00:03:05.040> touches<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:06.440> think

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
lines and add dynamic touches I think

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.199 
lines and add dynamic touches I think
the<00:03:07.560> style<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.280> best<00:03:08.310> match<00:03:08.880> for<00:03:09.180> a

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
the style is the best match for a

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.259 
the style is the best match for a
hard-boiled<00:03:09.660> world<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.709> game<00:03:11.209> this<00:03:12.209> is

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
hard-boiled world of the game this is

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.240 
hard-boiled world of the game this is
the<00:03:12.450> most<00:03:12.780> distinctive<00:03:13.470> feature<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:13.980> the

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
the most distinctive feature of the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.240 
the most distinctive feature of the
style<00:03:14.549> of<00:03:14.730> drawing<00:03:15.000> used<00:03:15.600> in<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.900> game<00:03:16.250> the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
style of drawing used in the game the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.550 
style of drawing used in the game the
next<00:03:17.640> step<00:03:17.880> when<00:03:18.420> creating<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.170> character

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
next step when creating the character

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.770 
next step when creating the character
images<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.549> addition<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.360> number<00:03:21.660> of

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
images is the addition of a number of

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.690 
images is the addition of a number of
oblique<00:03:22.109> lines<00:03:22.470> on<00:03:22.799> top<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.340> initial

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
oblique lines on top of the initial

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.780 
oblique lines on top of the initial
traced<00:03:24.269> image<00:03:24.920> this<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:26.100> done<00:03:26.340> at<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.549> same

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
traced image this is done at the same

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.090 
traced image this is done at the same
time<00:03:27.209> as<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.959> character<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.530> made<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:28.950> look

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
time as the character is made to look

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.289 
time as the character is made to look
more<00:03:29.340> three-dimensional<00:03:30.380> as<00:03:31.910> there<00:03:32.910> isn't<00:03:33.060> a

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
more three-dimensional as there isn't a

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.840 
more three-dimensional as there isn't a
fixed<00:03:33.720> number<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:34.109> those<00:03:34.380> oblique<00:03:34.920> lines<00:03:35.190> they

with those I've drawn I think that the
