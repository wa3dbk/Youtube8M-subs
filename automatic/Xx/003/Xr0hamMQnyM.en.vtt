00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
went for the system that hobbyking had

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.250 
went for the system that hobbyking had
but<00:00:31.050> why<00:00:31.619> was<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.070> wrong<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.940> time<00:00:33.140> let<00:00:34.140> me

show you something okay this is the
system<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.260> i<00:00:37.890> got<00:00:38.100> from<00:00:38.340> hobbyking<00:00:38.760> about

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
system that i got from hobbyking about

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.209 
system that i got from hobbyking about
two<00:00:39.840> systems<00:00:41.000> one<00:00:42.000> system<00:00:42.960> with<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> nine-inch

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
two systems one system with a nine-inch

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.139 
two systems one system with a nine-inch
props<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:46.170> other<00:00:46.350> one<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:46.890> 10<00:00:47.250> because

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
props and the other one with 10 because

props and the other one with 10 because
I<00:00:48.390> was<00:00:48.600> thinking<00:00:49.260> about<00:00:49.350> using<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:51.050> ass

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
I was thinking about using it on my ass

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.020 
I was thinking about using it on my ass
back<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:53.100> bigger<00:00:53.789> EPP<00:00:54.360> plane<00:00:54.600> okay<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> here

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
back the bigger EPP plane okay so here

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.510 
back the bigger EPP plane okay so here
you<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.449> shaft<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> blades

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you have the shaft you have the blades

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.000 
you have the shaft you have the blades
and<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.510> motor<00:01:00.750> with<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.590> hollow

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and you have the motor with a hollow

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.350 
and you have the motor with a hollow
shaft<00:01:04.129> one<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> funny<00:01:05.700> things<00:01:05.790> with<00:01:06.210> this

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
shaft one of the funny things with this

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.310 
shaft one of the funny things with this
motor<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.850> if<00:01:08.850> you're<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.810> connect

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
motor is that if you're going to connect

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.490 
motor is that if you're going to connect
the<00:01:10.409> plates<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.750> mounting<00:01:13.080> plate<00:01:13.110> on

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the plates the the mounting plate on

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.740 
the plates the the mounting plate on
this<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.580> motor<00:01:14.820> will<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.299> standing

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
this one the motor will be standing

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.380 
this one the motor will be standing
inside<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> plane<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.100> what<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> did<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.790> just

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
inside the plane so what I did I just

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.810 
inside the plane so what I did I just
loosen<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.380> set<00:01:19.680> screws<00:01:20.299> or<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.960> pushed<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
loosen the set screws or and pushed the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
loosen the set screws or and pushed the
shaft<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.900> other<00:01:25.080> way<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:27.090> mount<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
shaft the other way so I can mount the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.460 
shaft the other way so I can mount the
shaft<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:32.299> wait<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:34.140> side<00:01:35.659> nothing<00:01:36.659> hard

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
shaft and wait on this side nothing hard

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.600 
shaft and wait on this side nothing hard
to<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.740> actually<00:01:38.509> anyway<00:01:40.250> everything<00:01:41.250> was<00:01:41.400> set

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
to do actually anyway everything was set

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.370 
to do actually anyway everything was set
up<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:42.360> even<00:01:42.840> bought<00:01:43.079> esc<00:01:43.950> with<00:01:44.450> with<00:01:45.450> Governor

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
up I even bought esc with with Governor

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.310 
up I even bought esc with with Governor
mode<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:48.090> could<00:01:48.360> be<00:01:48.509> easier<00:01:49.079> for<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
mode so that it could be easier for the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.130 
mode so that it could be easier for the
motor<00:01:49.530> working<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.759> variable<00:01:51.720> pitches

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
motor working on the variable pitches

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.069 
motor working on the variable pitches
and<00:01:53.180> I<00:01:54.950> was<00:01:55.950> sitting<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> floor<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.299> kept

the motor and except from cutting my

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.950 
the motor and except from cutting my
planing<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:52.370> this<00:02:53.370> shaft<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:54.180> disappeared

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
planing to this shaft just disappeared

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.820 
planing to this shaft just disappeared
but<00:02:55.680> wait<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> second<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:58.320> funny<00:02:58.560> thing<00:02:58.650> is

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
that I've been looking all round for it

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.130 
that I've been looking all round for it
I<00:03:01.590> couldn't<00:03:01.980> find<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.460> at<00:03:02.640> all<00:03:02.880> at<00:03:03.330> any<00:03:03.780> places

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
I couldn't find it at all at any places

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.910 
I couldn't find it at all at any places
so<00:03:04.980> when<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:05.610> came<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.910> work<00:03:06.210> today<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.800> talked<00:03:07.800> to

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
so when I came to work today I talked to

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.980 
so when I came to work today I talked to
my<00:03:08.010> girlfriend<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.760> told<00:03:09.060> her<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.210> there's

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
my girlfriend and told her that there's

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.260 
my girlfriend and told her that there's
some<00:03:10.290> parts<00:03:10.650> missing<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.370> if<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.700> find<00:03:12.000> them

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
some parts missing so if you find them

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.440 
some parts missing so if you find them
just<00:03:12.990> put<00:03:13.230> him<00:03:13.320> on<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.500> table<00:03:13.650> or<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:14.940> I

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
just put him on the table or so on and I

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.530

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
guess they're up in the attic or down in

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.140 
guess they're up in the attic or down in
the<00:03:18.780> cellar<00:03:19.020> because<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:20.250> was<00:03:20.490> quite<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.850> big
