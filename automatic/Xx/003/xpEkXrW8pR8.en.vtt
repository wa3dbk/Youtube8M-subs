00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.539
 Hi, I rose today to freedom in dressage round piece of natural horsemanship 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.640
 Department of History 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:32.239
 Rabbit You or I will show you the act of pulling the dummy. 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:37.400
 It's these gypsies that you can work with today . 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:41.260
 It will weigh about 11 years old eat off when you last take any video 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.260
 Seated like this. 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:53.989
 It's only one thing to tell the owner of the land when he lands in a strange land . 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.270
 I am very sensitive when I pass , I do not believe in love, 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.780
 It was obvious. 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.450
 But a good thing for ten days before the show in Cannes 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.880
 It has improved a lot. 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:10.510
 It's not perfect in the cover-up yet , but I 'll show you a demonstration. 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.510
 Thank you 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.579
 Inside the cotton pens, the hooking mother's workout focuses on the trainer at first 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.179
 It is for pulling 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:30.829
 Cooking is a good word learned to accept trainer 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:30.829
 It will gain confidence that you can say the first step is joryeong of natural horsemanship 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:39.150
 Because free-form fossils are a duty to obtain without strings 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:43.470
 The connection between the horse and the trainer is important. When you want to turn or stop the horse 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:47.760
 Also give advice to this trainer who did not put a string on it. 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.720
 Autonomy When you want to change direction or stop the horse when cutting, 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:56.670
 I must sympathize with the pull , not the concession 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.530
 As you have just seen, the trainer can step back and allow the horse to come in. 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.540
 It is. 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.830
 A horse that is ready to accept a two- year anniversary is easy to turn inward 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.690
 Help 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.009
 But many worry about a late or distracted mind is outward when you want to change the direction 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.239
 Run away 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:19.830
 It is very disrespectful for horses to turn their hips to people, 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:22.380
 It can be dangerous, so if you put it outside, 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.940
 We need to turn around 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:30.630
 I think walking sandals kicked frantically called energy end fit the boyeodo 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:35.160
 They are sensitive to body language and tongue sounds. 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:38.519
 I go in the direction of the hands pods Also, I quickly to the desired speed 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:42.930
 Giving means respecting the trainer. 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.080
 I can easily do things like 8-body exercise that I can not wear a string 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.080
 There is 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:03:01.410
 The above specifications or getting respect is the horse's foot from left to right 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:06.030
 It's the first step in getting respect for the two trainees moving as they want 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.970
 And now the autonomous species fossils feel the trainer moving his feet on the horse 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.980
 It is a very good species to be able to 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:16.560
 If you can not change the direction and speed of the horse without mixing it and stop it, 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.489
 I do not think I deserve it. 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.970
 Forcing a horse that is not ready to respect a trainer 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.970
 It's done. 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.330
 2 Freedom of the fossil learned correctly when you stop the trainer 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.190
 I will concentrate. 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.660
 If you keep doing it steadily every day, the trainer will go where you are going , 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.340
 It will not 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:43.870
 Focusing on the trainer and standing quietly next to it is uncompressed 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.409
 I realize it's a way. 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:52.950
 House says that when I press on my hind legs, 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:58.280
 I'm turning to the side where I am and I'm being trained to walk forward. 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.280
 This is the result of a movement that draws attention to the horse . 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:08.900
 The Hungarian is a place where you want to be near the trainer when you are sanctioned. 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.900
 It's a tongue that makes a horse that does not fight. 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.980
 Use another word to pull it again or do it 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.980
 I'll explain. 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:27.969
 The word that comes to me now, according to whether aid is starting a second day of pro les innings 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:32.919
 It was a player. 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:37.330
 He's good, baby , but he's too rough. 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:41.830
 I became very difficult and started to work with me again from the beginning of my mind. 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.169
 Busy to run away as soon as you release on the chin that is distracting and does not like people 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.610
 The horse. 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:53.009
 I did not catch my camera, but I tried to change the direction 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.009
 I'll give you the pressure and turn it back in its original direction. 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:06.690
 And this time frills change the direction you want to go into self alone 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.690
 Moving without instructions from the trainer gives pressure and shoots 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:18.660
 If you put pressure on the fence to stick to the inside, do not do it. 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:22.760
 Waving your head and making a bright facial expression is also a slow free trade fossil 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:27.710
 If you train, it's something you have to fix. 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:33.160
 It is a rejection of the trainer to put the ear back and shake his head 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.160
 I mean , I was not ready to accept a trainer as a leader . 

00:05:36.299 --> 00:05:44.189
 But just like dropping your head 

00:05:40.049 --> 00:05:46.999
 As bukjung action because it was a liberation from oppression, such as turning the moment 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:46.999
 It gives praise 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:06:02.009
 In the end, being with people is the most comfortable 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:05.960
 When you realize that you are not under pressure, you accept people as leaders. 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.960
 I will follow you without coffee and laces. 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:14.700
 A word that has not gone through the law of nature magic 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:21.320
 Wild doors that have never been treated by humans take a little longer 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:21.320
 It's a very smart word that makes you look worse even though it's only two days away.
