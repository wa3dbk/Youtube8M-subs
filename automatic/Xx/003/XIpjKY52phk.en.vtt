00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.160

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:46.740

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.580
 tell me my mood unfortunately 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:08.820
 hit a little monotony kills 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.770
 a little text is incomprehensible perhaps in 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.360
 There is something interesting in the text 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.450
 allowing such an eternal 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.670
 I did not understand a single word and 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.940
 monotony of music 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.130
 forced to say no no me too 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.260
 I say no, absolutely uninteresting songs 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.380
 harmonically on perk absolutely no 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.300
 a perfect goal is shown and mood 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.550
 no, I did not feel that 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.500
 I have not touched anything at all 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.920
 you can pour show I'll cry 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.880
 and here I will touch absolutely nothing 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:44.319
 say no i just know rita long ago she 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.170
 songwriter of a large number of songs 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:53.209
 much songs well on more like say a 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:56.060
 adequate for the genre and i'm sure i 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.610
 sure this retina face is just that 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.080
 she decided as an individual today 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:05.690
 perform because it is she 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.840
 but this is according to the rules superproject 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.580
 the main stage when the voices of the jury 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.650
 split two by two 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.900
 we must turn to mentors 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.450
 maybe they will save you and you will pass 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.250
 next one of you gentlemen producers 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:24.830
 I want to speak I know that this is a girl 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:30.830
 from meladze bone factory 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:32.570
 and here she is talented I know her 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.340
 she is talented by work and a girl 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:41.930
 I think we should just skip 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.910
 next and then decide that is just 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.750
 give a chance to go further and then decided 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.750
 who does she get to
