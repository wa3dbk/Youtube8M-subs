it's very important which end is up
because<00:04:34.470> we're<00:04:34.740> taking<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.280> section<00:04:36.210> of

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
because we're taking a section of

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.189 
because we're taking a section of
geologic<00:04:37.199> history<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.919> we<00:04:38.789> are<00:04:39.150> trying<00:04:39.900> to

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
geologic history and we are trying to

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.879 
geologic history and we are trying to
piece<00:04:40.889> history<00:04:41.400> back<00:04:41.639> together<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:42.360> it's

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
piece history back together so it's

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.830 
piece history back together so it's
chronologically<00:04:44.180> important<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:45.570> know<00:04:45.690> which

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
chronologically important you know which

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.980 
chronologically important you know which
end<00:04:46.020> is<00:04:46.169> up<00:04:49.639> right<00:04:50.639> now<00:04:50.820> Shanta<00:04:51.210> was<00:04:51.360> tapping

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
end is up right now Shanta was tapping

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.529 
end is up right now Shanta was tapping
to<00:04:52.080> see<00:04:52.289> where<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.039> sediment<00:04:53.460> surface<00:04:54.150> was

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
to see where the sediment surface was

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.990 
to see where the sediment surface was
and<00:04:54.900> she<00:04:55.530> is<00:04:55.620> really<00:04:55.919> seeing<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.430> water<00:04:56.610> above

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
and she is really seeing the water above

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.969 
and she is really seeing the water above
the<00:04:57.240> set<00:04:57.419> of<00:04:57.479> the<00:04:57.630> surface<00:04:57.960> in<00:04:58.080> order<00:04:58.169> to<00:04:58.349> be

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
the set of the surface in order to be

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.200 
the set of the surface in order to be
able<00:04:59.039> to<00:04:59.159> cut<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.430> core<00:04:59.699> without<00:05:00.000> any<00:05:00.659> danger

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
able to cut the core without any danger

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.520 
able to cut the core without any danger
because<00:05:03.210> those<00:05:03.449> cores<00:05:03.870> get<00:05:04.110> really<00:05:04.380> heavy

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
because those cores get really heavy

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.379 
because those cores get really heavy
especially<00:05:05.130> when<00:05:05.430> they're<00:05:05.550> saturated<00:05:06.270> like

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
especially when they're saturated like

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:12.129 
especially when they're saturated like
that<00:05:10.070> she<00:05:11.070> didn't<00:05:11.370> have<00:05:11.400> a<00:05:11.490> pipe<00:05:11.699> cutter

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
that she didn't have a pipe cutter

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.260 
that she didn't have a pipe cutter
plumbers<00:05:13.139> use<00:05:13.289> those<00:05:13.470> things<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:13.979> lot<00:05:14.220> -<00:05:14.970> it's

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
plumbers use those things a lot - it's

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.029 
plumbers use those things a lot - it's
just<00:05:15.389> a<00:05:15.570> cleaner<00:05:15.810> cut<00:05:15.870> straight<00:05:16.530> cut<00:05:16.740> and<00:05:16.770> it's

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
just a cleaner cut straight cut and it's

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.540 
just a cleaner cut straight cut and it's
faster<00:05:17.550> than<00:05:17.699> hacksaw

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
faster than hacksaw

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.040 
faster than hacksaw
so<00:05:20.550> here<00:05:20.909> we<00:05:21.000> are<00:05:21.150> cutting<00:05:21.360> again<00:05:21.690> right<00:05:21.930> at

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
so here we are cutting again right at

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.540 
so here we are cutting again right at
the<00:05:22.139> sediment<00:05:22.530> surface<00:05:22.650> that<00:05:23.070> first<00:05:23.310> that

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
the sediment surface that first that

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.640 
the sediment surface that first that
initial<00:05:23.880> cut<00:05:24.060> was<00:05:24.270> just<00:05:24.690> an<00:05:25.199> estimation

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
initial cut was just an estimation

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.320 
initial cut was just an estimation
because<00:05:26.280> we<00:05:26.430> didn't<00:05:26.729> really<00:05:26.940> know<00:05:27.090> where<00:05:27.240> the

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
because we didn't really know where the

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.339 
because we didn't really know where the
sediment<00:05:27.719> surface<00:05:27.840> was<00:05:29.599> getting<00:05:30.599> rid<00:05:30.780> of<00:05:30.810> as

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
sediment surface was getting rid of as

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.310 
sediment surface was getting rid of as
much<00:05:31.740> void<00:05:32.250> in<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:32.669> core<00:05:33.449> as<00:05:33.539> possible<00:05:34.110> and

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
much void in the core as possible and

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.010 
much void in the core as possible and
you'll<00:05:35.099> see<00:05:35.310> a<00:05:35.340> stuffing<00:05:35.699> in<00:05:36.180> this<00:05:36.570> case<00:05:36.750> paper

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
you'll see a stuffing in this case paper

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.260 
you'll see a stuffing in this case paper
towels<00:05:37.320> in<00:05:38.130> order<00:05:38.430> to<00:05:38.639> keep<00:05:38.969> the<00:05:39.120> sediment

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
towels in order to keep the sediment

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.110 
towels in order to keep the sediment
from<00:05:39.650> moving<00:05:40.650> around<00:05:40.860> well<00:05:41.520> it's<00:05:41.669> in<00:05:41.759> the<00:05:41.849> core

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
from moving around well it's in the core

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.719 
from moving around well it's in the core
that<00:05:44.509> is<00:05:45.509> a<00:05:45.599> very<00:05:45.930> very<00:05:46.199> very<00:05:46.560> heavy<00:05:46.860> sediment

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
that is a very very very heavy sediment

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.540 
that is a very very very heavy sediment
core<00:05:48.029> right<00:05:48.240> there<00:05:48.449> you'd<00:05:49.110> be<00:05:49.289> surprised<00:05:49.740> it

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
core right there you'd be surprised it

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.679 
core right there you'd be surprised it
looks<00:05:50.789> like<00:05:50.969> a<00:05:51.000> toothpick

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:51.689 
looks like a toothpick

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:53.719 
looks like a toothpick
but<00:05:51.779> it's<00:05:51.929> very<00:05:52.799> heavy<00:05:53.069> to<00:05:53.219> take<00:05:53.249> these<00:05:53.549> people

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
but it's very heavy to take these people

once the core is brought back to the lab
it<00:06:08.699> will<00:06:08.849> be<00:06:08.969> cut<00:06:09.179> into<00:06:09.360> meter<00:06:09.629> sections<00:06:10.169> and
