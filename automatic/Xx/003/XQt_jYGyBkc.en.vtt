in<00:00:00.089> this<00:00:00.240> video<00:00:00.420> we're<00:00:00.750> going<00:00:00.840> to<00:00:00.900> teach<00:00:01.110> you

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:01.140 
in this video we're going to teach you

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.629 
in this video we're going to teach you
all<00:00:01.290> about<00:00:01.469> lens<00:00:01.890> compression<00:00:02.370> and<00:00:02.520> we're

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
all about lens compression and we're

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:03.740 
all about lens compression and we're
going<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.820> do<00:00:02.939> it<00:00:03.060> in<00:00:03.179> less<00:00:03.360> than<00:00:03.510> three

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
going to do it in less than three

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.300 
going to do it in less than three
minutes

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:10.310 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.980 

many<00:00:10.940> of<00:00:11.060> you<00:00:11.120> have<00:00:11.300> heard<00:00:11.540> of<00:00:11.780> lens

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
many of you have heard of lens

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.360 
many of you have heard of lens
compression<00:00:12.530> but<00:00:12.710> did<00:00:12.800> you<00:00:12.890> know<00:00:12.980> that<00:00:13.010> lens

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
compression but did you know that lens

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.220 
compression but did you know that lens
compression<00:00:13.970> is<00:00:14.090> actually<00:00:14.630> a<00:00:14.660> type<00:00:14.930> of<00:00:14.960> lens

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
compression is actually a type of lens

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.350 
compression is actually a type of lens
distortion<00:00:15.830> that's<00:00:16.340> right<00:00:16.550> lens<00:00:16.820> compression

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
distortion that's right lens compression

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.609 
distortion that's right lens compression
is<00:00:17.480> essentially<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:17.990> phenomenon<00:00:18.440> of

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
is essentially the phenomenon of

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.260 
is essentially the phenomenon of
background<00:00:19.070> elements<00:00:19.490> appearing<00:00:19.880> much

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
background elements appearing much

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.940 
background elements appearing much
closer<00:00:20.720> and<00:00:21.020> much<00:00:21.140> larger<00:00:21.650> than<00:00:21.830> they

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
closer and much larger than they

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.980 
closer and much larger than they
actually<00:00:22.340> are<00:00:22.430> in<00:00:22.460> real<00:00:22.700> life<00:00:22.910> hence<00:00:23.630> it<00:00:23.840> is<00:00:23.869> a

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
actually are in real life hence it is a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.050 
actually are in real life hence it is a
type<00:00:24.290> of<00:00:24.320> lens<00:00:24.590> distortion<00:00:25.130> but<00:00:25.610> that<00:00:25.760> doesn't

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
type of lens distortion but that doesn't

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.909 
type of lens distortion but that doesn't
mean<00:00:26.210> that<00:00:26.360> it's<00:00:26.540> bad<00:00:26.599> and<00:00:26.990> in<00:00:27.110> fact<00:00:27.380> we<00:00:27.680> use

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
mean that it's bad and in fact we use

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.620 
mean that it's bad and in fact we use
lens<00:00:28.250> compression<00:00:28.669> oftentimes<00:00:29.119> to<00:00:29.300> create

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
lens compression oftentimes to create

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.150 
lens compression oftentimes to create
awesome<00:00:29.779> compositions<00:00:30.680> that<00:00:30.740> really

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
awesome compositions that really

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.980 
awesome compositions that really
wouldn't<00:00:31.490> be<00:00:31.610> possible<00:00:32.000> otherwise<00:00:32.150> let<00:00:32.930> me

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:32.990 
wouldn't be possible otherwise let me

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.660 
wouldn't be possible otherwise let me
show<00:00:33.110> you<00:00:33.170> exactly<00:00:33.410> what<00:00:34.010> I<00:00:34.040> mean<00:00:34.250> now<00:00:34.430> here<00:00:34.579> we

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
show you exactly what I mean now here we

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.430 
show you exactly what I mean now here we
have<00:00:34.700> a<00:00:34.820> lineup<00:00:35.120> of<00:00:35.390> prime<00:00:35.660> lenses<00:00:36.050> starting

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
have a lineup of prime lenses starting

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.520 
have a lineup of prime lenses starting

series to compare a whole host of
different<00:00:48.260> lenses<00:00:48.560> we<00:00:49.250> took<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.610> exact<00:00:50.060> same

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
different lenses we took the exact same

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.330 
different lenses we took the exact same
photo<00:00:50.660> or<00:00:50.960> nearly<00:00:51.470> the<00:00:51.560> same<00:00:51.710> photo<00:00:51.950> with<00:00:52.130> all

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
of these different lenses while moving

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.080 
of these different lenses while moving
the<00:00:54.230> camera<00:00:54.500> back<00:00:54.890> each<00:00:55.190> time<00:00:55.580> in<00:00:55.850> order<00:00:55.940> to

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
the camera back each time in order to

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.580 
the camera back each time in order to
keep<00:00:56.240> our<00:00:56.360> composition<00:00:56.990> and<00:00:57.140> subject

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
keep our composition and subject

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.230 
keep our composition and subject
relatively<00:00:58.310> the<00:00:58.370> same<00:00:58.460> from<00:00:58.880> image<00:00:59.090> to<00:00:59.120> image

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
relatively the same from image to image

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.940 
relatively the same from image to image
so<00:00:59.960> let's<00:01:00.110> show<00:01:00.230> you<00:01:00.290> what<00:01:00.470> the<00:01:00.560> first<00:01:00.770> shot

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
so let's show you what the first shot

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.980 
so let's show you what the first shot
looked<00:01:01.220> like<00:01:01.430> on<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.880> 24<00:01:02.330> millimeter<00:01:02.510> Prime

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
looked like on the 24 millimeter Prime

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.140 
looked like on the 24 millimeter Prime
notice<00:01:03.680> how<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:03.860> branches<00:01:04.369> appear<00:01:04.699> to<00:01:04.790> extend

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
notice how the branches appear to extend

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.730 
notice how the branches appear to extend
far<00:01:05.479> into<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:05.869> trunk<00:01:06.110> which<00:01:06.290> appears<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:06.650> be

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
far into the trunk which appears to be

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.590 
far into the trunk which appears to be
really<00:01:07.100> far<00:01:07.310> back<00:01:07.549> from<00:01:07.880> where<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.299> model<00:01:08.570> is

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
really far back from where the model is

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.780 
really far back from where the model is
positioned<00:01:09.110> now<00:01:09.710> let's<00:01:09.979> move<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.189> the<00:01:10.310> 35

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
positioned now let's move to the 35

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.249 
positioned now let's move to the 35
millimeter<00:01:11.000> now<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.600> trunk<00:01:11.960> suddenly

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
millimeter now the trunk suddenly

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.780 
millimeter now the trunk suddenly
appears<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.650> shift<00:01:12.920> forward<00:01:13.220> a<00:01:13.340> bit<00:01:13.490> as<00:01:13.610> well

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
appears to shift forward a bit as well

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.819 
appears to shift forward a bit as well
as<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.030> branches<00:01:14.420> in<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:14.630> background<00:01:15.079> moving

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
as the branches in the background moving

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:17.109 
as the branches in the background moving
to<00:01:15.920> 50<00:01:16.189> million<00:01:16.340> as<00:01:16.490> we<00:01:16.549> can<00:01:16.700> see<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:16.939> shift

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
to 50 million as we can see it shift

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.090 
to 50 million as we can see it shift
again<00:01:17.509> changing<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.380> composition<00:01:18.530> once

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
again changing the composition once

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.130 
again changing the composition once
again<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.700> 85<00:01:20.179> millimeters<00:01:20.659> notice<00:01:21.020> how<00:01:21.109> our

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
again to 85 millimeters notice how our

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.929 
again to 85 millimeters notice how our
model<00:01:21.530> is<00:01:21.799> roughly<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.219> same<00:01:22.399> size<00:01:22.670> in<00:01:22.850> the

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
model is roughly the same size in the

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.239 
model is roughly the same size in the
frame<00:01:22.969> yet<00:01:23.810> compositionally<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.770> background

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:25.249 
frame yet compositionally the background

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:27.459 
frame yet compositionally the background
elements<00:01:25.429> appear<00:01:25.999> far<00:01:26.210> closer<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.899> look

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
elements appear far closer and look

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:28.450 
elements appear far closer and look
quite<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:27.740> bit<00:01:27.920> different

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
quite a bit different

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.709 
quite a bit different
let's<00:01:28.729> move<00:01:28.909> again<00:01:29.179> to<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.450> hunter

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
let's move again to the hunter

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.719 
let's move again to the hunter
millimeter<00:01:30.109> and<00:01:30.319> then<00:01:30.679> again<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.219> 200

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
millimeter and then again to the 200

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.489 
millimeter and then again to the 200
millimeter<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.179> then<00:01:32.479> again<00:01:32.689> finally<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.380> the

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
millimeter and then again finally to the

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
elements such as the branches appear far

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.899 
elements such as the branches appear far
larger<00:01:42.560> than<00:01:42.770> they<00:01:43.009> are<00:01:43.039> in<00:01:43.249> reality<00:01:43.670> as<00:01:43.789> we

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
larger than they are in reality as we

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.700 
larger than they are in reality as we
step<00:01:44.149> up<00:01:44.179> with<00:01:44.600> each<00:01:44.840> lenses<00:01:45.200> focal<00:01:45.530> length

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
step up with each lenses focal length

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.989 
step up with each lenses focal length
now<00:01:45.979> just<00:01:46.189> for<00:01:46.280> fun<00:01:46.310> let's<00:01:46.460> go<00:01:46.700> ahead<00:01:46.819> and

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999 
now just for fun let's go ahead and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:48.760 
now just for fun let's go ahead and
watch<00:01:47.179> it<00:01:47.210> at<00:01:47.539> a<00:01:47.569> quicker<00:01:47.869> speed<00:01:48.229> as<00:01:48.439> we<00:01:48.590> move

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
watch it at a quicker speed as we move

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.010 
watch it at a quicker speed as we move
from<00:01:48.920> image<00:01:49.219> to<00:01:49.249> image<00:01:49.420> pretty<00:01:50.420> cool<00:01:50.600> right

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
from image to image pretty cool right

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.629 
from image to image pretty cool right
so<00:01:51.439> now<00:01:51.619> that<00:01:51.679> you<00:01:51.889> know<00:01:51.920> what<00:01:52.399> lens

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:52.639 
so now that you know what lens

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:54.190 
so now that you know what lens
compression<00:01:53.119> is<00:01:53.270> how<00:01:53.630> can<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:53.840> use<00:01:53.929> it<00:01:54.049> in

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
compression is how can you use it in

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.260 
compression is how can you use it in
your<00:01:54.289> images<00:01:54.829> well<00:01:55.369> oftentimes<00:01:55.729> we<00:01:56.119> use

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
your images well oftentimes we use

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.699 
your images well oftentimes we use
telephoto<00:01:56.719> lenses<00:01:57.049> for<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.319> compression

much<00:02:10.160> closer<00:02:10.490> to<00:02:10.729> our<00:02:10.759> subjects<00:02:11.330> in<00:02:11.450> fact<00:02:11.660> it

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
much closer to our subjects in fact it

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.270 
much closer to our subjects in fact it
looks<00:02:11.959> like<00:02:12.080> it's<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.260> behind<00:02:12.709> our<00:02:12.860> subjects

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280
