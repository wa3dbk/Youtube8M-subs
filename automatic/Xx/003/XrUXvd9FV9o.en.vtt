sensor Canon body which one would I

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.830 
sensor Canon body which one would I
choose<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> three<00:00:38.100> choices<00:00:38.309> were<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.969> 17

choose and the three choices were a 17
to<00:00:39.989> 40<00:00:40.350> that's<00:00:40.590> an<00:00:40.710> f4<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.430> an<00:00:41.550> L<00:00:41.700> lens<00:00:41.989> a<00:00:43.160> 24

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
to 40 that's an f4 it's an L lens a 24

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.490 
to 40 that's an f4 it's an L lens a 24
to<00:00:44.760> 105<00:00:45.180> that's<00:00:45.450> also<00:00:45.780> an<00:00:45.840> L<00:00:45.989> ends<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.379> that

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
to 105 that's also an L ends but that

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.010 
to 105 that's also an L ends but that
one<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.820> with<00:00:47.820> image<00:00:48.120> stabilization<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.870> it's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
one is with image stabilization and it's

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.340 
one is with image stabilization and it's
also<00:00:49.170> f4<00:00:49.620> or<00:00:49.800> 28<00:00:50.700> millimeter<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.899> canons

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
also f4 or 28 millimeter and in canons

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.170 
also f4 or 28 millimeter and in canons
lineup<00:00:52.379> they're<00:00:52.770> actually<00:00:53.190> 228<00:00:53.699> millimeters

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
lineup they're actually 228 millimeters

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.479 
lineup they're actually 228 millimeters
that<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.170> right<00:00:55.230> now<00:00:55.500> there's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
that I can think of right now there's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.779 
that I can think of right now there's
the<00:00:56.670> 28<00:00:57.420> millimeter<00:00:57.870> F<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:59.190> point<00:00:59.489> eight<00:00:59.609> and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the 28 millimeter F one point eight and

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.330 
the 28 millimeter F one point eight and
there's<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.359> 28<00:01:00.840> millimeter<00:01:01.020> F<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:01.829> F<00:01:02.309> two

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
there's a 28 millimeter F one F two

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.660 
there's a 28 millimeter F one F two
point<00:01:03.149> eight<00:01:03.239> with<00:01:03.570> image<00:01:03.840> stabilization<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.880 

those<00:01:08.670> are<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.210> know<00:01:09.299> three<00:01:10.110> great<00:01:10.590> lens

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
those are you know three great lens

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.730 
those are you know three great lens
options<00:01:11.570> but<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.780> were<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:12.990> choose<00:01:13.290> one<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
options but if I were to choose one on a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.010 
options but if I were to choose one on a
crop<00:01:14.130> sensor<00:01:14.340> camera<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:15.060> would<00:01:15.150> definitely

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
crop sensor camera I would definitely

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.969 
crop sensor camera I would definitely
get<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> 24<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.979> 105<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.380> there<00:01:19.740> are<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> few

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
get the 24 to 105 and there are a few

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:20.780 
get the 24 to 105 and there are a few
reasons<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
reasons for that

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.060 
reasons for that
so<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.509> 17<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.020> 40<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.409> great<00:01:22.619> lens<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.009> I've

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
so the 17 to 40 is a great lens and I've

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.830 
so the 17 to 40 is a great lens and I've
talked<00:01:23.280> about<00:01:23.520> before<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:24.060> fact<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.689> was

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
talked about before in fact it was

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.130 
talked about before in fact it was
probably<00:01:25.020> my<00:01:25.290> favorite<00:01:25.560> Canon<00:01:26.189> lens<00:01:27.110> but<00:01:28.110> I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
probably my favorite Canon lens but I

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.569 
probably my favorite Canon lens but I
was<00:01:28.320> using<00:01:28.500> full-frame<00:01:28.890> camera<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:29.430> using

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
was using full-frame camera I was using

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.090 
was using full-frame camera I was using
5d<00:01:30.030> mark<00:01:30.240> ii<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:31.170> was<00:01:31.259> probably<00:01:31.439> my<00:01:31.680> most

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
5d mark ii and it was probably my most

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.819 
5d mark ii and it was probably my most
used<00:01:32.490> lens<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.090> when<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.049> comes<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> crop

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
used lens so when it comes to a crop

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.609 
used lens so when it comes to a crop
sensor<00:01:35.130> camera<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:36.180> 17<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.720> 40<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.200> pretty

the<00:01:48.450> long<00:01:48.630> end<00:01:48.899> when<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.439> 18<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.890> 55<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.460> F<00:01:50.659> 5.6

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
the long end when the 18 to 55 is F 5.6

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.100 
the long end when the 18 to 55 is F 5.6
you<00:01:52.439> only<00:01:52.590> get<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:52.799> stop<00:01:53.220> more<00:01:53.490> than<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.210> 17

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
you only get one stop more than the 17

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.889 
you only get one stop more than the 17
to<00:01:55.259> 40<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.850> kit<00:01:57.090> lens<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.450> usually<00:01:57.780> has

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
to 40 and the kit lens it usually has

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.780 
to 40 and the kit lens it usually has
image<00:01:58.200> stabilization<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> is

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
image stabilization if you have the is

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.350 
image stabilization if you have the is
version<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.560> there's<00:02:01.770> not<00:02:02.070> too<00:02:02.460> much<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
version so there's not too much of a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.569 
version so there's not too much of a
difference<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.930> terms<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.439> those<00:02:04.619> things<00:02:04.950> now

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
difference in terms of those things now

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.459 
difference in terms of those things now
the<00:02:05.640> 17<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.210> 40<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.509> definitely<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> be

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
the 17 to 40 is definitely going to be

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.889 
the 17 to 40 is definitely going to be
sharper<00:02:07.860> you're<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.910> getting<00:02:09.720> nice

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
sharper you're going to be getting nice

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.930 
sharper you're going to be getting nice
results<00:02:10.349> with<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.860> you're<00:02:11.430> going<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.819> get

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
results with it and you're going to get

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.320 
results with it and you're going to get
that<00:02:12.120> L

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
that L

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.930 
that L
LLNS<00:02:13.960> l-series<00:02:14.500> build<00:02:14.950> quality<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.670> you

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
LLNS l-series build quality that you

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.150 
LLNS l-series build quality that you
know<00:02:16.030> goes<00:02:16.450> with<00:02:16.690> all<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.990> L<00:02:17.380> Series<00:02:17.590> lenses

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
know goes with all the L Series lenses

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.040 
know goes with all the L Series lenses
and<00:02:18.310> that's<00:02:18.670> all<00:02:18.910> great<00:02:19.120> but<00:02:19.240> if<00:02:19.690> you're<00:02:19.870> going

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
and that's all great but if you're going

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.380 
and that's all great but if you're going
if<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.470> have<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.800> kit<00:02:20.980> lens<00:02:21.010> already<00:02:21.490> I<00:02:21.730> don't

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
if you have the kit lens already I don't

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.840 
if you have the kit lens already I don't
think<00:02:22.690> I'd<00:02:22.900> upgrade<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.010> 17<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.550> 40

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
think I'd upgrade to the 17 to 40

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.310 
think I'd upgrade to the 17 to 40
because<00:02:24.970> again<00:02:25.480> you're<00:02:25.660> losing<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.550> extra

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
because again you're losing that extra

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.360 
because again you're losing that extra
versatility<00:02:29.320> in<00:02:29.440> terms<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.860> focal<00:02:30.220> range

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
versatility in terms of the focal range

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.000 
versatility in terms of the focal range
and<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:31.270> also<00:02:31.590> lose<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.770> image

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
and you also lose the image

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.460 
and you also lose the image
stabilization<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:33.940> if<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.510> have<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.810> if<00:02:35.110> you

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
stabilization so if you have the if you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.990 
stabilization so if you have the if you
have<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.680> kit<00:02:35.860> lens<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.220> definitely<00:02:36.790> keep<00:02:36.940> that

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
have the kit lens I definitely keep that

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.330 
have the kit lens I definitely keep that
kit<00:02:37.390> lens<00:02:37.570> so<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.470> other<00:02:38.560> two<00:02:38.770> choices<00:02:39.160> are

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
kit lens so the other two choices are

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.730 
kit lens so the other two choices are
the<00:02:39.520> 24<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.090> 105<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.930> 28<00:02:41.350> millimeter<00:02:42.390> and

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
the 24 to 105 and the 28 millimeter and

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.300 
the 24 to 105 and the 28 millimeter and
the<00:02:44.910> 24<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.330> 105<00:02:46.720> is<00:02:46.930> also<00:02:47.560> great<00:02:47.770> lens<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.100> also

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
the 24 to 105 is also great lens I also

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.850 
the 24 to 105 is also great lens I also
used<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.700> have<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:49.060> lens<00:02:49.350> but<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.380> sold<00:02:50.650> that

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
used to have that lens but I sold that

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.910 
used to have that lens but I sold that
before<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:51.820> sold<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.180> 17<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.600> 40<00:02:52.900> but<00:02:53.500> if<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.770> were

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
before I sold the 17 to 40 but if I were

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.880 
before I sold the 17 to 40 but if I were
choosing<00:02:54.370> between<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:55.000> 1740<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.200> 24<00:02:56.770> to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
choosing between the 1740 and the 24 to

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.430 
choosing between the 1740 and the 24 to
105<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.400> definitely<00:02:58.030> go<00:02:58.209> for<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.450> 2400<00:02:58.990> 105

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
105 I definitely go for the 2400 105

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.150 
105 I definitely go for the 2400 105
because<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.520> extra<00:03:01.680> focal<00:03:02.680> range<00:03:02.860> you

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
because of that extra focal range you

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.870 
because of that extra focal range you
get<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.340> really<00:03:03.700> nice<00:03:04.000> focal<00:03:04.420> range<00:03:05.880> which

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
get a really nice focal range which

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.670 
get a really nice focal range which
which<00:03:07.240> goes<00:03:07.450> for<00:03:07.630> from<00:03:07.990> 24<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.620> 105<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.450> and

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
which goes for from 24 to 105 and and

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.199 
which goes for from 24 to 105 and and
you<00:03:11.680> know<00:03:11.770> that's<00:03:11.950> that's<00:03:12.190> really<00:03:12.520> huge<00:03:12.910> in

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
you know that's that's really huge in

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.140 
you know that's that's really huge in
the<00:03:14.080> with<00:03:14.500> crop<00:03:14.860> sensor<00:03:15.190> cameras<00:03:15.550> especially

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
the with crop sensor cameras especially

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.750 
the with crop sensor cameras especially
if<00:03:16.209> you're<00:03:16.330> going<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.630> keep<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:17.459> keep<00:03:18.459> that

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
if you're going to keep that keep that

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.520 
if you're going to keep that keep that
kit<00:03:19.269> lens<00:03:19.450> with<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.050> can<00:03:20.260> use<00:03:20.290> that

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
kit lens with you so you can use that

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.259 
kit lens with you so you can use that
kit<00:03:20.769> lens<00:03:20.920> for<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.190> wider<00:03:21.370> stuff<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:21.910> then

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
you can use the 24 to 105 for the longer

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.580 
you can use the 24 to 105 for the longer
stuff<00:03:25.360> or<00:03:25.600> you're<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:25.989> know<00:03:26.110> as<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.350> more

stuff or you're you know as a more
general-purpose<00:03:27.010> lens<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.600> 24<00:03:29.110> to<00:03:29.350> 105<00:03:29.769> is<00:03:30.070> an

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
general-purpose lens the 24 to 105 is an

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.870 
general-purpose lens the 24 to 105 is an
f4<00:03:30.700> lens<00:03:30.730> so<00:03:31.209> it's<00:03:31.810> going<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.140> give<00:03:32.290> you<00:03:32.880> again

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
f4 lens so it's going to give you again

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.790 
f4 lens so it's going to give you again
that<00:03:34.030> extra<00:03:34.450> stop<00:03:34.660> on<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.930> long<00:03:35.110> end<00:03:35.320> but<00:03:35.650> it

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
that extra stop on the long end but it

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.320 
that extra stop on the long end but it
also<00:03:35.920> gives<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.640> know<00:03:36.730> nice<00:03:36.970> image

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
also gives you you know nice image

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.970 
also gives you you know nice image
stabilization<00:03:37.720> for<00:03:38.410> when<00:03:38.530> you're<00:03:38.680> doing

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
stabilization for when you're doing

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.740 
stabilization for when you're doing
video<00:03:39.190> or<00:03:39.640> for<00:03:39.880> when<00:03:39.970> you're<00:03:40.150> doing<00:03:40.330> handheld

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
video or for when you're doing handheld

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.479 
video or for when you're doing handheld
in<00:03:41.019> lower<00:03:41.410> light<00:03:41.620> situations<00:03:42.190> when<00:03:42.370> you

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
in lower light situations when you

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.550 
in lower light situations when you
really<00:03:42.760> need<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:43.030> stop<00:03:43.269> down<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.750> shutter

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
really need to stop down that shutter

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.060 
really need to stop down that shutter
speed<00:03:44.890> so<00:03:45.430> it's<00:03:45.550> a<00:03:45.640> really<00:03:46.230> really<00:03:47.230> great<00:03:47.320> lens

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
speed so it's a really really great lens

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.290 
speed so it's a really really great lens
option<00:03:48.489> especially<00:03:48.880> when<00:03:49.000> you're<00:03:49.090> going<00:03:49.209> to

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
option especially when you're going to

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.750 
option especially when you're going to
keep<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:49.660> kit<00:03:49.930> lens<00:03:50.140> with<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.730> I

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
keep that kit lens with you so I

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.990 
keep that kit lens with you so I
definitely<00:03:52.030> choose<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.570> 24<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:53.739> 105<00:03:54.190> over<00:03:54.880> um

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
definitely choose the 24 to 105 over um

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.860 
definitely choose the 24 to 105 over um
over<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:59.370> 17<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.459> 40<00:04:00.700> any<00:04:00.910> day<00:04:01.150> now<00:04:01.420> there's

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
over the 17 to 40 any day now there's

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.650 
over the 17 to 40 any day now there's
that<00:04:02.019> 28<00:04:02.650> millimeter<00:04:03.160> which<00:04:03.400> is<00:04:03.610> a<00:04:04.150> very

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
that 28 millimeter which is a very

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.110 
that 28 millimeter which is a very
interesting<00:04:05.250> lens<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.459> put<00:04:06.670> into<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:06.970> mix

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
interesting lens to put into the mix

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.420 
interesting lens to put into the mix
because<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.989> 28<00:04:08.470> millimeter<00:04:08.860> even<00:04:09.220> though<00:04:09.310> it

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
because the 28 millimeter even though it

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.430 
because the 28 millimeter even though it
gives<00:04:09.820> you<00:04:09.910> kind<00:04:10.060> of<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:10.239> wide<00:04:10.930> field<00:04:11.290> of

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
gives you kind of that wide field of

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.979 
gives you kind of that wide field of
view<00:04:11.590> from<00:04:11.799> that<00:04:11.920> 28<00:04:12.670> millimeter<00:04:13.060> in<00:04:13.420> terms<00:04:13.810> of

photography even portraiture you know
it's<00:04:55.930> cut<00:04:56.199> it's<00:04:56.379> it<00:04:56.860> will<00:04:57.009> give<00:04:57.129> you<00:04:57.219> the

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
in terms of field of view it's a nice

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.920 
in terms of field of view it's a nice
working<00:05:00.729> distance<00:05:01.229> shoot<00:05:02.229> people<00:05:02.620> with<00:05:02.650> and

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
working distance shoot people with and

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.450 
working distance shoot people with and
overall<00:05:04.930> it's<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.110> great<00:05:05.349> great<00:05:05.800> lens<00:05:06.009> the<00:05:06.250> only

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
overall it's a great great lens the only

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.059 
overall it's a great great lens the only
problem<00:05:06.819> is<00:05:06.969> it's<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.270> prime<00:05:07.539> so<00:05:07.810> it<00:05:08.139> takes<00:05:08.860> away

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.069 
problem is it's a prime so it takes away

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:11.700 
problem is it's a prime so it takes away
that<00:05:09.099> versatility<00:05:09.879> that<00:05:10.150> a<00:05:10.509> zoom<00:05:10.840> lens<00:05:11.050> gives

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
that versatility that a zoom lens gives

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.230 
that versatility that a zoom lens gives
you<00:05:11.860> especially<00:05:12.129> when<00:05:12.400> you<00:05:12.610> you<00:05:13.090> know<00:05:13.120> you

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
you especially when you you know you

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.629 
you especially when you you know you
only<00:05:13.569> have<00:05:13.779> a<00:05:13.930> 44<00:05:14.469> millimeter<00:05:14.860> I<00:05:15.069> think<00:05:15.550> I

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
only have a 44 millimeter I think I

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.100 
only have a 44 millimeter I think I
could<00:05:15.819> live<00:05:15.939> with<00:05:16.090> something<00:05:16.569> that's<00:05:16.960> like<00:05:17.080> a

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
could live with something that's like a

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.429 
could live with something that's like a
44<00:05:17.620> equivalent<00:05:18.839> you<00:05:19.839> know<00:05:19.930> for<00:05:20.110> a<00:05:20.139> long<00:05:20.259> time

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:20.439 
44 equivalent you know for a long time

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:21.749 
44 equivalent you know for a long time
that<00:05:20.620> could<00:05:20.740> be<00:05:20.860> my<00:05:20.979> only<00:05:21.219> lens<00:05:21.400> but<00:05:21.550> some

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
that could be my only lens but some

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.610 
that could be my only lens but some
people<00:05:22.060> won't<00:05:22.210> really<00:05:22.810> like<00:05:23.080> that<00:05:23.229> focal

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
people won't really like that focal

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.059 
people won't really like that focal
length<00:05:23.770> so<00:05:23.860> a<00:05:24.159> zoom<00:05:24.610> lens<00:05:24.789> might<00:05:25.120> be<00:05:25.300> better<00:05:25.449> so

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:26.069 
length so a zoom lens might be better so

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.249 
length so a zoom lens might be better so
in<00:05:27.069> terms<00:05:27.279> of<00:05:27.460> hierarchy<00:05:27.870> for<00:05:28.870> those<00:05:29.020> three
