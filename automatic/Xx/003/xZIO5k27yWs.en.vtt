scripture<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:21.099> interpret<00:03:21.579> itself<00:03:21.959> so<00:03:22.959> I<00:03:22.989> can

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
scripture to interpret itself so I can

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.110 
scripture to interpret itself so I can
what<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:23.680> would<00:03:23.859> do<00:03:24.040> is<00:03:24.190> I'd<00:03:24.340> write<00:03:24.579> down<00:03:24.790> John

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120

what I would do is I'd write down John
3:16<00:03:26.019> and<00:03:26.049> what<00:03:26.889> I<00:03:26.919> think<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.340> means<00:03:27.370> for<00:03:27.700> the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
3:16 and what I think it means for the

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.220 
3:16 and what I think it means for the
word<00:03:27.910> believes<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.540> do<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:28.780> same<00:03:28.989> thing

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
word believes and I do the same thing

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.740 
word believes and I do the same thing
for<00:03:29.349> John<00:03:29.590> 3:15<00:03:30.069> and<00:03:30.549> then<00:03:31.150> I'd<00:03:31.239> write<00:03:31.450> down

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
for John 3:15 and then I'd write down

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.280 
for John 3:15 and then I'd write down
each<00:03:32.049> of<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.349> verses<00:03:32.859> that<00:03:33.720> are<00:03:34.720> interesting

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
each of the verses that are interesting

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.960 
each of the verses that are interesting
and<00:03:35.440> relevant<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:35.980> really<00:03:36.190> makes<00:03:36.400> sense<00:03:36.790> for

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
and relevant that really makes sense for

everything that we need so this is what

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.260 
everything that we need so this is what
the<00:04:30.800> verse<00:04:30.979> is<00:04:31.160> speaking<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.759> and<00:04:31.940> then<00:04:32.030> if<00:04:32.120> we

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
the verse is speaking to and then if we

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.290 
the verse is speaking to and then if we
believe<00:04:32.660> in<00:04:33.320> him<00:04:33.380> we<00:04:34.160> can<00:04:34.340> truly<00:04:34.520> be<00:04:34.729> justified
