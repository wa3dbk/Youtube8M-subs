00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.940 
really I'm bothered by the fact that so
many<00:02:33.750> people<00:02:34.280> live<00:02:35.280> their<00:02:35.459> lives<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.950> things

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
many people live their lives and things

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.240 
many people live their lives and things
never<00:02:38.190> get<00:02:39.319> that<00:02:40.319> things<00:02:40.590> don't<00:02:40.769> change<00:02:41.069> that

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
never get that things don't change that

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.140 
never get that things don't change that
much<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:42.290> think<00:02:43.290> that's<00:02:43.410> sad<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:44.030> like<00:02:45.030> about

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
much I think that's sad like like about

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.470 
much I think that's sad like like about
moving<00:02:46.069> most<00:02:47.069> of<00:02:47.280> my<00:02:47.400> friends<00:02:47.430> aren't<00:02:48.090> going

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
moving most of my friends aren't going

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.680 
moving most of my friends aren't going
to<00:02:48.660> leave<00:02:48.810> West<00:02:49.140> Virginia<00:02:50.239> because<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.420> family

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
to leave West Virginia because of family

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.890 
to leave West Virginia because of family
stuff<00:02:52.110> like<00:02:52.620> because<00:02:53.040> because<00:02:53.489> maybe<00:02:53.900> their

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
stuff like because because maybe their

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.300 
stuff like because because maybe their
parents<00:02:55.049> don't<00:02:55.349> want<00:02:55.380> them<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.860> or<00:02:55.890> they're

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
parents don't want them to or they're

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.470 
parents don't want them to or they're
afraid<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:58.130> be<00:02:59.130> away<00:02:59.340> from<00:02:59.370> their<00:02:59.790> families

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
afraid to be away from their families

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.800 
afraid to be away from their families
and<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.260> know<00:03:01.380> not<00:03:02.190> have<00:03:02.459> somebody<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:02.970> be

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
and you know not have somebody to be

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.270 
and you know not have somebody to be
there<00:03:03.989> for<00:03:04.260> them<00:03:04.380> when<00:03:04.410> they're<00:03:04.709> in<00:03:05.010> trouble

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
there for them when they're in trouble

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.449 
there for them when they're in trouble
and<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.700> think<00:03:05.910> that's<00:03:06.060> sad<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.569> should<00:03:07.459> know

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
and I think that's sad you should know

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.710 
and I think that's sad you should know
it's<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.790> mean<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.030> good<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.360> have<00:03:09.480> something

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
it's I mean it's good to have something

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.199 
it's I mean it's good to have something
to<00:03:09.900> fall<00:03:10.049> back<00:03:10.110> on<00:03:10.440> but<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.769> should<00:03:10.950> really<00:03:11.209> be

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
to fall back on but you should really be

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.680 
to fall back on but you should really be
your<00:03:12.390> own<00:03:12.569> safety<00:03:12.930> net<00:03:13.790> these<00:03:14.790> people<00:03:15.299> or

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
your own safety net these people or

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.129 
your own safety net these people or

and they're perfectly content to stay

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.710 
and they're perfectly content to stay
here<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.579> don't<00:03:27.150> know<00:03:27.329> why<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.450> bothers

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
here and I don't know why that bothers

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.160 
here and I don't know why that bothers
me<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.260> much<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:29.459> just<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:30.030> seems<00:03:30.389> like<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:30.959> many

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
me so much it just it seems like so many

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.289 
me so much it just it seems like so many
of<00:03:31.290> them<00:03:31.410> know<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:31.980> very<00:03:32.010> little<00:03:32.430> about<00:03:33.030> other

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
of them know so very little about other

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.900 
of them know so very little about other
 that's<00:03:33.840> going<00:03:34.049> on<00:03:34.230> maybe<00:03:35.010> maybe<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.549> don't

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
 that's going on maybe maybe I don't

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.370 
 that's going on maybe maybe I don't
want<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.239> be<00:03:36.329> stuck<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.959> that's<00:03:37.139> why<00:03:37.319> it

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
want to be stuck and that's why it

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.809 
want to be stuck and that's why it
bothers<00:03:37.650> me<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.859> see<00:03:37.980> other<00:03:38.220> people<00:03:38.549> stuck

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
bothers me to see other people stuck

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.099 
bothers me to see other people stuck
because<00:03:39.060> I'm<00:03:39.299> afraid<00:03:39.510> it's<00:03:39.630> gonna<00:03:39.720> happen<00:03:39.959> to

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
because I'm afraid it's gonna happen to

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.050 
because I'm afraid it's gonna happen to
me<00:03:40.230> hop<00:03:41.100> in<00:03:41.250> my<00:03:41.340> mom<00:03:41.540> mom's<00:03:42.540> perfectly<00:03:43.049> happy

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
me hop in my mom mom's perfectly happy

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.640 
me hop in my mom mom's perfectly happy
she's<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> wife<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.660> she<00:03:46.260> doesn't<00:03:46.470> really<00:03:46.560> have

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
she's a wife and she doesn't really have

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.809 
she's a wife and she doesn't really have
a<00:03:46.769> job<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.220> don't<00:03:47.370> think<00:03:47.459> she<00:03:47.609> really<00:03:47.790> likes

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
a job and I don't think she really likes

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.150 
a job and I don't think she really likes
to<00:03:48.180> work<00:03:48.299> so<00:03:49.079> I<00:03:49.109> think<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.620> kind<00:03:50.040> of

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
to work so I think that that kind of

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.360 
to work so I think that that kind of
makes<00:03:50.370> sense<00:03:50.549> for<00:03:50.819> her<00:03:50.970> but<00:03:51.950> she<00:03:52.950> doesn't<00:03:53.190> do

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
makes sense for her but she doesn't do

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.759 
makes sense for her but she doesn't do
anything<00:03:53.819> she<00:03:54.269> doesn't<00:03:54.450> go<00:03:54.720> anywhere<00:03:54.989> she

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
anything she doesn't go anywhere she

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:56.990 
anything she doesn't go anywhere she
doesn't<00:03:55.950> really<00:03:56.010> have<00:03:56.280> any<00:03:56.400> friends<00:03:56.430> she

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
doesn't really have any friends she

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.640 
doesn't really have any friends she
doesn't<00:03:57.209> have<00:03:57.299> any<00:03:57.569> guy<00:03:57.840> friend<00:03:58.200> she's<00:03:58.500> not

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
doesn't have any guy friend she's not

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.770 
doesn't have any guy friend she's not
allowed<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:01.290> she<00:04:02.130> didn't<00:04:02.510> she<00:04:03.510> didn't<00:04:03.720> know

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
allowed and she didn't she didn't know

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.210 
allowed and she didn't she didn't know
