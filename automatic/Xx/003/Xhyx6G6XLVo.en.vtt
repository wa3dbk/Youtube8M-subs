00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.880
 you consider but there are questions that the track of the eta all 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.360
 the big ones I'm glad there is a connection between the melancholy of thought 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.409
 so sadness 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:17.619
 First 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.800
 certainty 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.759
 on what we have tried to understand has spoken a lot in a quintÃ© to 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:24.909
 millions 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:27.319
 secondly 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.319
 bankruptcy not be a great creator 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.420
 it's important for me 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.560
 the great creator eluded something else 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.000
 and thirdly of course 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.340
 do not know if even after a lifetime of work 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.300
 the tiny nose to the trend is illusory the hard desire to last as 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.800
 safe and the ua 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.670
 and what he will have anything 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.240
 who is still waiting for some survival 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.460
 jose 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.770
 do not believe it right now 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.660
 not knowing it 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.610
 there is certainly 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.520
 some sadness 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.410
 and that adds to that 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.840
 I estimate but that's another interview 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.330
 I feel that the crisis in the testament of the Jewish people 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.370
 becomes more and more serious 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.280
 for my five children 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.290
 I am very scared 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.650
 and that 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.860
 to be happy while remaining convinced of that 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.770
 that would be I think 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.930
 irresponsible 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.970
 then I can be wrong 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.780
 then finish with an anecdote 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.800
 because m other awful word war size if you're too silly to 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.240
 think years tells a terrible story 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.270
 for example it's terrible m 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.510
 and that's his antisemitic remark by the way was quick to move to 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.510
 the hatch 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.530
 god announces who is normal will bar pole pretty 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.079
 this time 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.290
 the beginning will be definitive to tashkent the water 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:15.239
 this time 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.379
 in ten days 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.349
 the saas beads not 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.459
 we reunite family 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.729
 we pray to the virgin for the earth what her wheels 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.729
 because these returns of course there 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:34.219
 but he is great protestant the president of the association undertake 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.659
 we settle our competitors 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.859
 we pay the operetta 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.519
 we put our books in safe shooting and if we can and then 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.499
 we gather our families our time so the will of god 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.609
 the rabbi of the world ten days 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.169
 but it's more than enough to teach this priest under the water 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.739
 this is the method by which I live 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.039
 the kyodo press breathe under the water 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.099
 there are still four thousand years we breathe underwater 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:11.819
 perhaps 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.819
 many we will continue but I do not wish 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.169
 I know it 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:18.709
 the breath becomes cut
