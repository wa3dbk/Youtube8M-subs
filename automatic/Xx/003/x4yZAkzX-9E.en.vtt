00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
of the car I already took it up you can

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.130 
of the car I already took it up you can
see<00:01:09.150> what<00:01:09.299> I'm<00:01:09.390> talking<00:01:09.780> about<00:01:09.810> here<00:01:12.140> that's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
see what I'm talking about here that's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.950 
see what I'm talking about here that's
the<00:01:13.439> one<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.950> BS<00:01:17.659> b-2s<00:01:18.689> -<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:20.340> runs<00:01:20.960> along

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the one the BS b-2s - and it runs along

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.130 
the one the BS b-2s - and it runs along
this<00:01:22.920> path<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:24.180> which<00:01:24.960> has<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> cover<00:01:27.140> cover

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
this path here which has a cover cover

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.910 
this path here which has a cover cover
you<00:01:28.439> take<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.860> cover<00:01:29.100> out<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:31.710> harness

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
you take that cover out and the harness

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.820 
you take that cover out and the harness
runs<00:01:33.439> up<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.680> here

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
runs up to here

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.510 
runs up to here
so<00:01:36.700> from<00:01:36.880> here<00:01:37.140> runs<00:01:38.140> over<00:01:38.440> here<00:01:40.380> into<00:01:41.380> there

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
so from here runs over here into there

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.930 
so from here runs over here into there
that's<00:01:42.520> it

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
that's it

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.220 
that's it
and<00:01:43.230> the<00:01:44.230> way<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.440> test<00:01:44.800> it<00:01:45.070> is<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.750> found<00:01:47.140> this

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
and the way you test it is I found this

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.340 
and the way you test it is I found this
on<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.470> forum<00:01:47.710> is<00:01:48.040> 300<00:01:48.520> thanks<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:49.510> lot<00:01:49.660> guys

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
on the forum is 300 thanks a lot guys

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.880 
on the forum is 300 thanks a lot guys
for<00:01:50.670> giving<00:01:51.670> me<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.060> measurement<00:01:52.570> now<00:01:52.890> yeah

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
for giving me the measurement now yeah

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.170 
for giving me the measurement now yeah
ba<00:01:54.100> o<00:01:54.540> meter<00:01:55.540> set<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.140> ohms<00:01:56.670> test<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.910> black

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
ba o meter set it to ohms test to black

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.960 
ba o meter set it to ohms test to black
leads<00:02:00.270> find<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.360> two<00:02:01.540> black<00:02:01.810> leads<00:02:02.080> out<00:02:02.290> here

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
leads find the two black leads out here

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.650 
leads find the two black leads out here
it's<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.180> top<00:02:04.390> two<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:09.820> I'm<00:02:10.149> testing<00:02:10.600> it

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
it's the top two and this I'm testing it

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.380 
it's the top two and this I'm testing it
cold<00:02:10.960> so<00:02:11.380> there's<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.430> difference<00:02:12.850> if<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.150> test

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
cold so there's a difference if you test

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.920 
cold so there's a difference if you test
it<00:02:13.540> when<00:02:13.660> it's<00:02:13.840> hot<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:15.100> show<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.520> 13<00:02:16.060> ohm<00:02:16.270> 13

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
it when it's hot and I show in 13 ohm 13

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.790 
it when it's hot and I show in 13 ohm 13
point<00:02:17.140> 5<00:02:17.350> ohms<00:02:17.700> not<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.820> bad<00:02:19.000> one<00:02:19.270> is<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:20.530> bad

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
point 5 ohms not the bad one is a bad

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:30.390 
point 5 ohms not the bad one is a bad
one<00:02:24.150> same<00:02:25.150> two<00:02:25.360> black<00:02:25.600> leads

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.690 

show<00:02:30.940> me<00:02:31.239> zero<00:02:31.569> ohms

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.839 

okay<00:02:37.510> no<00:02:38.260> that's<00:02:38.470> bad<00:02:38.920> put<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:39.580> back<00:02:39.670> together

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
okay no that's bad put it back together

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.220 
okay no that's bad put it back together
and<00:02:40.260> that's<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.410> thank<00:02:42.099> you
