for<00:00:25.590> splitting<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.980> randomly<00:00:26.279> at<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> end<00:00:26.730> I

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
for splitting it randomly at the end I

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.670 
for splitting it randomly at the end I
wasn't<00:00:27.480> planning<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.810> do<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.470> video

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
wasn't planning to do that but the video

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.200 
wasn't planning to do that but the video
is<00:00:28.740> getting<00:00:29.010> over<00:00:29.160> 10<00:00:29.340> minutes<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> figured

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
is getting over 10 minutes so I figured

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.589 
is getting over 10 minutes so I figured
you<00:00:30.240> know<00:00:30.390> what

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
you know what

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.179 
you know what
I<00:00:30.779> don't<00:00:31.140> want<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.320> bore<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.470> guys<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.980> we'll

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
I don't want to bore you guys so we'll

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.799 
I don't want to bore you guys so we'll
split<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.460> into<00:00:32.550> two<00:00:32.730> parts<00:00:32.910> let's<00:00:33.630> go<00:00:33.750> ahead

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
split it into two parts let's go ahead

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.420 
split it into two parts let's go ahead
and<00:00:33.960> get<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> first<00:00:34.350> one<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:34.890> we're

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
and get to the first one here we're

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.900 
and get to the first one here we're
starting<00:00:35.760> off<00:00:35.880> with<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.390> woo<00:00:37.230> bat<00:00:37.550> we<00:00:38.550> also<00:00:38.670> have

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
starting off with a woo bat we also have

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.290 
starting off with a woo bat we also have
a<00:00:39.090> froakie<00:00:39.870> once<00:00:40.410> again<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.399> sets<00:00:41.610> down<00:00:41.969> here

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
a froakie once again the sets down here

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.520 
a froakie once again the sets down here
it<00:00:42.480> could<00:00:42.629> be<00:00:42.690> from<00:00:42.930> anything<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.379> could<00:00:43.469> be

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
it could be from anything it could be

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.340 
it could be from anything it could be
Gen<00:00:43.829> 1<00:00:44.010> all<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.489> way<00:00:44.520> up<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.879> Gen<00:00:45.090> 6<00:00:45.360> we've<00:00:46.079> seen

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
Gen 1 all the way up to Gen 6 we've seen

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.110 
Gen 1 all the way up to Gen 6 we've seen
I<00:00:46.559> think<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.800> saw<00:00:46.950> all<00:00:47.100> 6<00:00:47.340> generations<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
I think we saw all 6 generations in the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.479 
I think we saw all 6 generations in the
last<00:00:48.300> video<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.870> pretty<00:00:49.620> wide<00:00:49.920> arrangement<00:00:50.399> of

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
last video so pretty wide arrangement of

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.819 
last video so pretty wide arrangement of
things<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> base<00:00:51.629> set<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.140> gold<00:00:52.530> Dean

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
things we have a base set to gold Dean

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.689 
things we have a base set to gold Dean
we<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> zarua<00:00:55.039> sometimes<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.160> do<00:00:56.219> call<00:00:56.550> out

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
we have a zarua sometimes I do call out

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.310 
we have a zarua sometimes I do call out
what's<00:00:56.910> said<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.210> actually<00:00:57.539> from<00:00:57.809> but

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
what's said it's actually from but

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.990 
what's said it's actually from but
sometimes<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:58.920> don't<00:00:59.100> know<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.789> am

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
sometimes I just don't know I I am

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.430 
sometimes I just don't know I I am
trying<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> learn<00:01:00.359> more<00:01:00.570> about<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.870> sets<00:01:01.109> but

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
trying to learn more about the sets but

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.410 
trying to learn more about the sets but
I<00:01:01.620> don't<00:01:02.160> really<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.430> every<00:01:02.850> single<00:01:03.180> set

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
I don't really have every single set

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.690 
I don't really have every single set
memorizers<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.199> think<00:01:04.409> over<00:01:04.619> 50<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.070> them<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
memorizers I think over 50 of them but a

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.550 
memorizers I think over 50 of them but a

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
sell one more pack to go and let's see

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.950 
sell one more pack to go and let's see
what<00:06:26.570> we<00:06:26.660> got

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
what we got

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.470 
what we got
OOP<00:06:27.230> last<00:06:28.160> time<00:06:28.370> every<00:06:28.730> single<00:06:28.850> holographic

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:29.480 
OOP last time every single holographic

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.180 
OOP last time every single holographic
had<00:06:29.660> a<00:06:29.690> sleeve<00:06:30.020> on<00:06:30.140> it<00:06:30.200> that<00:06:30.530> one<00:06:30.680> has<00:06:30.800> a<00:06:30.830> sleeve

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
had a sleeve on it that one has a sleeve

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.640 
had a sleeve on it that one has a sleeve
so<00:06:31.400> this<00:06:31.580> might<00:06:31.880> just<00:06:31.910> be<00:06:32.210> a<00:06:32.300> holographic<00:06:32.780> all

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
so this might just be a holographic all

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.900 
so this might just be a holographic all
right<00:06:33.980> we<00:06:34.190> have<00:06:34.310> an<00:06:34.490> Ursaring<00:06:35.800> potion
