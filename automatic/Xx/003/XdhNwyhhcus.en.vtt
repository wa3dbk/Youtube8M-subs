will<00:02:21.580> get<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.760> main<00:02:22.970> device<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.540> course

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
will get to the main device of course

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.910 
will get to the main device of course
we've<00:02:23.870> got<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.110> instructions<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.860> I'll

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
probably read those here for this device

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.270 
probably read those here for this device
and<00:02:28.900> this<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.230> local<00:02:30.680> ampere<00:02:31.010> this<00:02:31.160> is

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
and this is the local ampere this is

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.130 
and this is the local ampere this is
actually<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:32.380> clamp<00:02:35.050> that<00:02:36.050> allows<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:37.250> to

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
actually the clamp that allows you to

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.979 
actually the clamp that allows you to
tighten<00:02:39.140> this<00:02:39.349> down<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.980> your<00:02:40.010> desk<00:02:40.670> or<00:02:40.989> to
