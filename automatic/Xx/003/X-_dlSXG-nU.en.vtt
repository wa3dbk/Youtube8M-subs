00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.370
 hello everyone not so long ago it came to me 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.530
 letter from the manufacturer of the arc yes it is 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.490
 so this is called ailments like me 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.530
 previously assumed 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.839
 and they offered me a review of one of 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.950
 test samples of your smartphone 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.750
 doogee wise something about this smartphone here 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.849
 Here is what his packaging looks like 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.829
 as you already understood I did not give up 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.470
 to take this smartphone to the test 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.750
 the parcel arrived straight from the office will 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.059
 same from the decline however the manager asked 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.739
 link to tinydeal links all 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.670
 leave in the description can go 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.039
 look 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.230
 its official price is 119 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.059
 dollars at the moment well someone 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.710
 more expensive someone might be cheaper as 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.390
 many times my subscribers were interested 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.370
 This smartphone is a lot 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.870
 there were questions on it and on this 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.519
 to the manufacturer also because 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.710
 produce remarkable in that 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.359
 makes very budget smart phones when 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.399
 this offers very good 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.949
 specifications are exactly the same 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.260
 happened jiva ride a hundred about it 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.890
 improved version of g white 100 as possible 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.530
 to guess 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.510
 This smartphone is interesting because for 120 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.030
 roughly speaking dollars he offers us 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.960
 hd screen 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.120
 13 megapixel main camera and 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.570
 8 megapixel front camera and new 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.160
 64-bit mtk 6735 processor 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.380
 inside the box I already guessed it 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.270
 I opened everything looked at the tester from me 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.850
 It happened about him very clearly and the first 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.650
 impression so it will be not only 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.090
 unpacking but also so preliminary 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.990
 view bundled among other things 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.320
 there is a quick start extra 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.300
 plenochka on the screen with wiped kai and here 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.570
 such is the headset here 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.700
 branded arc charging with 1 amp output 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.530
 and usb cable to connect it 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.210
 personal computer headphones 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.400
 also tested the headphones just 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.410
 disgusting nothing quality is it 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.600
 some kind of rape but 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.310
 smartphone pretty curious in 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.980
 first that he comes bundled immediately 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.380
 he comes with a bumper com so probably if 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.080
 you watched my review on tekkyl smartphone 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.120
 t6 pro he had the same bumper 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.130
 but there was a terrible quality 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.350
 literally a week later me just 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.880
 it was impossible for them to fall apart 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.390
 I think I will use it here 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.030
 the situation is about the same to this 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.230
 Yes, I personally have no confidence in me 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.300
 all the time it seems like some sort of 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.430
 basement production though me all 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.810
 convince the opposite to actually 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.150
 Chinese manufacturers now 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.000
 far from the basements they are all located 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.100
 in chic offices they have their own everywhere 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.959
 conveyor line everything is produced by 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.570
 standards with quality control and with 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.280
 By all matters, however, tuji is one of 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.680
 those manufacturers who reduce the price 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.630
 not because we overpay there for 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.190
 brand or something else but they just 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.350
 use rather substandard 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.360
 materials in their smartphones are therefore not 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.489
 the fact that this smartphone will live with you 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.550
 more than a year and absolutely not a fact that 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.110
 This battery will actually be on 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.580
 2200 milliampere hours as stated Duma 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.320
 if there will be a thousand real 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.720
 eight hundred will already be good under the back 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.360
 a cover two slots under a sim card 1 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.430
 and a full-size 1st mikruha 1 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.280
 Of course, we have support on 2 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.769
 only 2g and micro sd card slot 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.530
 it also has a 13 megapixel 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.390
 main camera with flash and of course 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.030
 same specifications on the cover is written what 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.010
 network smartphone supports and buttons 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.810
 volume rocker and button 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.660
 power on and unlock is located 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.130
 directly on the lid itself so 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.750
 if u cover somewhere you lose 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.610
 lose all the buttons on top of us 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.130
 there is a three and a half connector for 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.620
 headphone and micro usb bottom only 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.790
 hole for the microphone, and perhaps all well 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:37.329
 and the most pleasant part of course 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:40.000
 display 5 inch ip spgs 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.680
 Of course the chip display is that he 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.660
 made by two and a half wild 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.850
 technology ie its protective glass 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.560
 it does not end abruptly as if she were leaving 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.560
 here on the side of the display itself is pasted 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.690
 plenochka from the factory no oleophobic 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.269
 coverage here of course there is no bottom under 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.000
 screen home menu button and back 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.769
 no backlight and here all the necessary 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.959
 sensors and front camera naturally 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.940
 the speaker speaks something about 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.130
 the smartphone is pretty hard for now 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.780
 Works very smartly look 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.480
 please, well, there is really nothing 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.880
 I absolutely do not slow him down 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.280
 use and if tested cameras 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.489
 but she makes very noisy shots 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.620
 13 mega pixel sony sensor here 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.600
 most likely with interpolation well 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.060
 will be if there are real 8 megapixels 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.280
 the rest of the frontalk interpolation is also 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.350
 makes a lot of noise but for a state employee 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.000
 the camera is quite a normal main 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.980
 I consider the problem a smartphone after all 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.410
 most likely there will be batteries because and 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.080
 not only that 2200 milliampere hours for 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.340
 5 inch screen is quite small 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.650
 plus the actual battery 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.600
 performed on the basement facilities 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.820
 Chinese what is she like for now 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.400
 it's not clear how you already guessed 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.560
 brand and to this smartphone in particular 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.020
 I will be very critical if 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.870
 I'm not satisfied with something I most likely 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.970
 I will crush him by the way by assembling monolith 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.530
 but there is some creak here rather 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.180
 all this is just the buttons themselves creak 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.270
 who can be useful at all 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.520
 smartphone often people ask tell me 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.490
 small compact small smartphone 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.530
 with lt support and not necessarily for games 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.780
 and for such people this smartphone is quite 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.700
 may come test games see 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.620
 what is common for yourself necessarily 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.630
 I will do a battery test 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.370
 if you want to get some 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.660
 additional information before anyone else 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.669
 be sure to join the group in 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.100
 contact there is already some information 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.060
 and if I forget necessarily remind 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.650
 me about it if you are strong 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.530
 all are interested in this 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.180
 we look tests are made of this camera 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:39.970
 Thank you all for your attention 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.780
