screwed then clicking but this is really
nice<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:52.370> probably<00:00:53.370> my<00:00:53.520> favorite<00:00:54.000> when

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
nice one probably my favorite when

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.470 
nice one probably my favorite when
activating<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.199> criticals<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:57.030> what<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.270> does

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
activating of criticals so what it does

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.510 
activating of criticals so what it does
and<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.020> war<00:00:58.230> PDP<00:00:58.739> see<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:58.980> there<00:00:59.160> anyone<00:01:00.050> and

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
and the war PDP see is there anyone and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.750 
and the war PDP see is there anyone and
what<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> basically<00:01:02.670> does<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:05.010> gonna

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
what it basically does is it's gonna

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.960 
what it basically does is it's gonna
even<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.600> click<00:01:06.960> next<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.680> someone<00:01:07.970> it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
even if you click next to someone it

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.580 
even if you click next to someone it
will<00:01:09.229> automatically<00:01:10.400> hit<00:01:11.400> him<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:13.409> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
will automatically hit him so that's a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.810 
will automatically hit him so that's a
really<00:01:13.619> nice<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.420> helps<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.820> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
really nice one it really helps and and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.940 
really nice one it really helps and and
yeah<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.970> criticals<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.270> i<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.450> said<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.380> I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
yeah so criticals as i just said it I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.240 
yeah so criticals as i just said it I
think<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.490> did<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.590> increases<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.619> damage

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
think I just did it increases the damage

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.370 
think I just did it increases the damage
because<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.180> know<00:01:27.330> when<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.600> jump<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.229> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
because you know when you jump and you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.160 
because you know when you jump and you
hit<00:01:28.560> someone<00:01:28.829> or<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.299> hit<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.689> mod<00:01:30.930> like

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
hit someone or if you hit the mod like

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.649 
hit someone or if you hit the mod like
this<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> critical<00:01:32.430> shot<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:33.509> it

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
this you get a critical shot here it

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.810 
this you get a critical shot here it
makes<00:01:33.900> them<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.770> critical<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.640> that's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
makes them all be critical so that's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.260 
makes them all be critical so that's
really<00:01:36.030> nice<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:37.130> then<00:01:38.130> there's<00:01:38.490> force<00:01:38.880> field

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
really nice and then there's force field

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.990 
really nice and then there's force field
which<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.600> also<00:01:40.530> really<00:01:41.009> important<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:41.759> you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
which is also really important but you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.260 
which is also really important but you
can<00:01:42.180> get<00:01:42.299> pantry<00:01:42.750> us<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.710> player<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.090> can
