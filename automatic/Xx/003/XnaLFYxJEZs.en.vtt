so<00:00:02.169> here<00:00:02.800> we<00:00:02.979> have<00:00:03.279> four<00:00:04.140> pistons<00:00:05.140> and

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:05.319 
so here we have four pistons and

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.550 
so here we have four pistons and

every<00:00:15.490> day<00:00:16.620> what<00:00:17.620> we<00:00:17.770> did<00:00:18.010> here<00:00:18.490> is<00:00:18.550> we<00:00:18.790> took

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
every day what we did here is we took

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.840 
every day what we did here is we took
Fulvia<00:00:23.340> Pistons<00:00:24.340> which<00:00:24.820> as<00:00:25.210> you<00:00:25.780> can<00:00:25.810> see<00:00:26.850> has

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
Fulvia Pistons which as you can see has

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.720 
Fulvia Pistons which as you can see has
a<00:00:28.199> sloped<00:00:29.199> dome<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:31.510> match<00:00:31.750> the<00:00:32.190> the<00:00:33.190> incline

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
a sloped dome to match the the incline

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.720 
a sloped dome to match the the incline
of<00:00:34.059> narrow-angle<00:00:34.989> V<00:00:35.499> for<00:00:35.769> that<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.370> Aprilia

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
of narrow-angle V for that the Aprilia

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.139 
of narrow-angle V for that the Aprilia
has<00:00:37.120> with<00:00:37.899> a<00:00:39.420> more<00:00:40.420> modern<00:00:41.339> dome<00:00:42.339> design<00:00:42.850> as

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
has with a more modern dome design as

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.969 
has with a more modern dome design as
opposed<00:00:43.510> to<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:45.100> original<00:00:45.609> piston<00:00:46.800> which<00:00:47.800> is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:47.979 
opposed to the original piston which is

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:55.639 
opposed to the original piston which is
just<00:00:48.249> a<00:00:48.370> plain<00:00:50.039> dome<00:00:51.039> you<00:00:51.519> know<00:00:52.089> it's<00:00:52.359> a<00:00:52.449> fully

is a four ring design piston with four
millimeter<00:01:25.119> rings<00:01:25.600> you<00:01:26.079> know<00:01:26.200> there's<00:01:26.409> lots

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
millimeter rings you know there's lots

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.219

of friction lots and lots and lots of

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.319 
of friction lots and lots and lots of
friction<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:29.909> unfortunately<00:01:30.909> this<00:01:31.090> poor

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
friction and unfortunately this poor

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.980 
friction and unfortunately this poor
piston<00:01:31.719> would<00:01:31.780> put<00:01:32.020> in<00:01:32.140> with<00:01:32.350> with

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
piston would put in with with

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.300 
piston would put in with with
insufficient<00:01:34.990> tolerance<00:01:35.500> even<00:01:35.679> though<00:01:35.950> it

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
insufficient tolerance even though it

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.219 
insufficient tolerance even though it
had<00:01:36.460> very<00:01:36.729> little<00:01:37.060> miles<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.719> it<00:01:37.780> was<00:01:37.869> a<00:01:37.899> new

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
had very little miles and it was a new

didn't<00:01:43.329> last<00:01:43.479> long

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.649 

yeah<00:01:47.020> because<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.429> pin<00:01:48.700> it's<00:01:49.299> quite<00:01:49.630> a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
yeah because of the the pin it's quite a

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:56.249 
yeah because of the the pin it's quite a
bit<00:01:49.960> larger<00:01:50.560> which<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:52.920> pushed<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
bit larger which we pushed the the

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.520 
bit larger which we pushed the the
connecting<00:01:56.859> rod<00:01:57.069> down<00:01:57.340> from<00:01:58.179> a<00:01:58.229> 20<00:01:59.229> millimeter

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
pin to a 19 millimeter pin it's almost

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.060 
pin to a 19 millimeter pin it's almost
identical<00:02:05.200> in<00:02:05.829> weight<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:08.350> be<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.979> original

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
identical in weight to be the original

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.650 
identical in weight to be the original
piston<00:02:10.890> plus<00:02:11.890> or<00:02:12.070> minus<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.400> few<00:02:12.640> grams

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
with a lot less friction of course

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.850 
with a lot less friction of course
because<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:16.780> ring<00:02:16.990> design<00:02:17.410> marine

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
because of the the ring design marine

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:31.910 
because of the the ring design marine
package<00:02:19.740> what<00:02:20.740> we<00:02:20.860> also<00:02:21.040> did<00:02:23.850> if<00:02:24.850> there<00:02:25.480> was

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.980 

any<00:02:32.920> case<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:34.570> we<00:02:37.530> we<00:02:38.530> line<00:02:38.770> board<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.990> the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
any case is we we line board the the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.200 
any case is we we line board the the
shell<00:02:41.620> bearings<00:02:42.100> well<00:02:42.430> if<00:02:42.700> not<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.030> shell

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
shell bearings well if not the shell

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.850 
shell bearings well if not the shell
bearings<00:02:43.570> but<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.810> Babbitt<00:02:44.140> Barrington<00:02:44.620> and

bearings but the Babbitt Barrington and

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.640 
bearings but the Babbitt Barrington and
then<00:02:45.100> place<00:02:45.640> shell<00:02:46.060> bearings<00:02:46.510> inside<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
then place shell bearings inside the the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.330 
then place shell bearings inside the the
Babbitt<00:02:51.040> holder<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:52.540> that<00:02:52.570> now<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.930> if<00:02:53.710> the

in<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.490> new<00:02:57.640> bearing<00:02:58.140> likewise<00:02:59.140> for<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.710> the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
in a new bearing likewise for the the

in a new bearing likewise for the the
main<00:03:00.610> bearings<00:03:02.070> we<00:03:03.070> used<00:03:03.400> shell<00:03:04.330> bearing<00:03:04.780> also

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
main bearings we used shell bearing also

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.770 
main bearings we used shell bearing also
line<00:03:05.920> boring<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.490> engine<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.090> as<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.660> can

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
line boring the engine and as you can

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:17.040 
line boring the engine and as you can
see<00:03:07.840> here<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.720> shiny<00:03:14.430> bronze<00:03:15.430> has<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.450> bearing

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
see here the shiny bronze has a bearing

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.480 
see here the shiny bronze has a bearing
that<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.740> original<00:03:17.890> Babbitt

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
that this is the original Babbitt

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.710 
that this is the original Babbitt
bearing<00:03:18.850> that<00:03:19.060> was<00:03:19.530> line<00:03:20.530> board<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:21.190> accept

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
bearing that was line board to accept
