University since the end of June and got
back<00:00:47.600> on<00:00:48.010> tenth<00:00:49.010> of<00:00:49.100> September<00:00:49.610> well<00:00:50.480> the

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
back on tenth of September well the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.420 
back on tenth of September well the
purpose<00:00:50.900> was<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.080> survey<00:00:51.530> some<00:00:51.770> forests<00:00:52.280> out

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
purpose was to survey some forests out

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.150 
purpose was to survey some forests out
there<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.790> forest<00:00:53.120> in<00:00:53.360> Kamchatka<00:00:54.050> a

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
there the forest in Kamchatka a

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.930 
there the forest in Kamchatka a
fantastic<00:00:55.160> because<00:00:55.280> they're<00:00:55.550> generally

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
fantastic because they're generally

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.360 
fantastic because they're generally
untouched<00:00:56.390> by<00:00:56.660> humans<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:57.410> you<00:00:58.100> get<00:00:58.250> these

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
untouched by humans and you get these

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.640 
untouched by humans and you get these
vast<00:00:58.700> expanses<00:00:59.480> covered<00:00:59.840> in<00:00:59.960> trees<00:01:00.200> and<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:00.530> we

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
vast expanses covered in trees and so we

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.830 
vast expanses covered in trees and so we
were<00:01:00.739> trying<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.100> look<00:01:01.280> at<00:01:01.460> natural<00:01:02.210> forest

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
were trying to look at natural forest

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.020 
were trying to look at natural forest
processes<00:01:03.530> in<00:01:03.650> an<00:01:03.770> area<00:01:03.980> where<00:01:04.309> we<00:01:04.580> could<00:01:04.760> rely

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
processes in an area where we could rely

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.150 
processes in an area where we could rely
upon<00:01:05.180> them<00:01:05.479> not<00:01:05.630> having<00:01:05.660> been<00:01:06.110> damaged<00:01:06.950> too

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
upon them not having been damaged too

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.430 
upon them not having been damaged too
greatly<00:01:07.430> for<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.479> greater<00:01:08.750> part<00:01:09.020> of<00:01:09.170> it<00:01:09.320> we

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
greatly for the greater part of it we

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.080 
greatly for the greater part of it we
were<00:01:09.590> staying<00:01:09.890> out<00:01:10.130> in<00:01:10.160> the<00:01:10.340> forest<00:01:10.580> camping

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
were staying out in the forest camping

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.960 
were staying out in the forest camping
and<00:01:11.600> every<00:01:12.290> day<00:01:12.320> we've<00:01:12.649> head<00:01:13.130> out<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.460> go<00:01:13.850> and

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
and every day we've head out and go and

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.180 
and every day we've head out and go and
measure<00:01:14.060> trees<00:01:14.420> but<00:01:15.050> what<00:01:15.170> we<00:01:15.290> do<00:01:15.500> with<00:01:15.740> be<00:01:15.979> to

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
measure trees but what we do with be to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.180 
measure trees but what we do with be to
set<00:01:16.430> out<00:01:16.640> a<00:01:17.030> grid<00:01:17.840> of<00:01:17.899> poles<00:01:18.320> at<00:01:18.740> 10<00:01:18.979> meter

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
set out a grid of poles at 10 meter

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.490 
set out a grid of poles at 10 meter
intervals<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:20.090> we'd<00:01:20.509> use<00:01:20.660> those<00:01:20.899> poles<00:01:21.170> to

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
intervals and we'd use those poles to

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.240 
intervals and we'd use those poles to
map<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.950> forest<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:23.860> setting<00:01:24.860> out<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:24.979> poles

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
map the forest so setting out the poles

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.160 
map the forest so setting out the poles
itself<00:01:25.759> takes<00:01:26.000> a<00:01:26.210> good<00:01:26.360> day's<00:01:26.570> work<00:01:26.600> with

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
itself takes a good day's work with

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.350 
itself takes a good day's work with
compasses<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:27.770> with<00:01:28.310> trying<00:01:28.910> to<00:01:29.030> get

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
compasses and with trying to get

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.660 
compasses and with trying to get
everything<00:01:29.630> aligned<00:01:30.050> and<00:01:30.290> then<00:01:31.009> several<00:01:31.460> days

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
everything aligned and then several days

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.100 
everything aligned and then several days
would<00:01:31.910> be<00:01:31.940> spent<00:01:32.240> mapping<00:01:32.840> all<00:01:32.960> the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
would be spent mapping all the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.889 
would be spent mapping all the
individual<00:01:33.619> trees<00:01:34.060> at<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.180> same<00:01:35.390> time<00:01:35.660> we'd

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.770 
flowers and also for some other time we
were<00:01:57.950> joined<00:01:58.190> by<00:01:58.310> an<00:01:58.550> ornithologist<00:01:58.970> who<00:01:59.479> took

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
were joined by an ornithologist who took

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.870 
were joined by an ornithologist who took
pictures<00:02:00.200> of<00:02:00.319> and<00:02:00.560> collected<00:02:01.280> records<00:02:01.610> of<00:02:01.789> the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
pictures of and collected records of the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.910 
pictures of and collected records of the
birds<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.270> were<00:02:02.479> around<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.869> plots<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:03.860> we

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
birds that were around the plots so we

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.529 
birds that were around the plots so we
got<00:02:04.069> to<00:02:04.220> learn<00:02:04.340> quite<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.729> lot<00:02:04.880> about<00:02:05.149> what<00:02:05.390> was

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
got to learn quite a lot about what was

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.389 
got to learn quite a lot about what was
going<00:02:05.599> on<00:02:05.929> in<00:02:06.170> each<00:02:06.649> of<00:02:06.860> these<00:02:06.950> patches<00:02:07.190> of

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
going on in each of these patches of

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.219 
going on in each of these patches of
forest<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.880> we<00:02:08.030> studied<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.509> mix<00:02:09.050> of

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
forest that we studied the mix of

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.800 
forest that we studied the mix of
species<00:02:09.740> is<00:02:10.240> unusual<00:02:11.240> in<00:02:11.360> fact<00:02:11.540> there's<00:02:11.720> no

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
species is unusual in fact there's no

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.540 
species is unusual in fact there's no
forest<00:02:12.230> quite<00:02:12.620> like<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.980> Kamchatka<00:02:13.459> and

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
forest quite like the Kamchatka and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.190 
forest quite like the Kamchatka and
forests<00:02:13.970> as<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.240> know<00:02:14.300> anywhere<00:02:14.750> else<00:02:14.990> in<00:02:15.170> the

forests as I know anywhere else in the
world<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.709> also<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:17.060> fact<00:02:17.240> that<00:02:17.360> there's<00:02:17.599> so

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
world and also the fact that there's so

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.270 
world and also the fact that there's so
few<00:02:17.780> people<00:02:18.020> there<00:02:18.500> means<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:18.950> can<00:02:19.099> rely

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
few people there means that you can rely

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.670 
few people there means that you can rely
upon<00:02:19.580> them<00:02:19.940> being<00:02:20.180> natural<00:02:20.900> old-growth

age this is data box that we collected
now<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.030> doesn't<00:02:29.390> look<00:02:29.420> particularly

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
impressive that we went away for three

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.990 
impressive that we went away for three
months<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:34.040> is<00:02:34.220> what<00:02:34.340> came<00:02:34.370> back<00:02:34.790> but

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
months and this is what came back but

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.449 
months and this is what came back but
this<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.300> gold<00:02:35.599> dust<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.290> all<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.370> way

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
this is gold dust and all the way

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.280 
this is gold dust and all the way
through<00:02:37.760> this<00:02:38.650> we<00:02:39.650> have<00:02:39.800> records<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:41.290> these

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
through this we have records of these

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.900 
through this we have records of these
are<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.560> positions<00:02:42.800> of<00:02:43.190> trees<00:02:43.460> within<00:02:43.730> the

are the positions of trees within the
plots<00:02:44.350> we<00:02:45.350> also<00:02:45.500> have<00:02:45.800> information<00:02:46.250> about<00:02:46.760> the

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
were present in the understory well

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.759 
were present in the understory well
hopefully<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.730> intend<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.510> get<00:03:00.599> a<00:03:00.659> few<00:03:00.930> academic

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
hopefully I intend to get a few academic

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.770 
hopefully I intend to get a few academic
papers<00:03:01.799> published<00:03:02.489> out<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.819> this<00:03:02.939> which

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
papers published out of this which

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.809 
papers published out of this which
should<00:03:04.049> give<00:03:04.739> us<00:03:04.769> some<00:03:04.889> insights<00:03:05.340> into<00:03:05.549> how

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
should give us some insights into how

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.099 
should give us some insights into how
these<00:03:06.000> forests<00:03:06.420> are<00:03:06.510> structured<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.079> how

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
these forests are structured and how

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.009 
these forests are structured and how
everything<00:03:07.439> fits<00:03:07.709> together<00:03:07.969> but<00:03:08.969> this<00:03:09.750> phase

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
everything fits together but this phase

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.140 
everything fits together but this phase
is<00:03:10.049> actually<00:03:11.040> more<00:03:11.340> time<00:03:11.609> consuming<00:03:11.760> than

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
is actually more time consuming than

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.599 
is actually more time consuming than
many<00:03:12.989> people<00:03:13.079> realize<00:03:13.379> there's<00:03:14.099> going<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.579> be

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
many people realize there's going to be

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.699 
many people realize there's going to be
at<00:03:15.180> least<00:03:15.239> six<00:03:15.689> months<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.139> enter<00:03:16.409> it<00:03:16.560> to

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
at least six months to enter it to

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.470 
at least six months to enter it to
analyze<00:03:17.099> it<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.459> write<00:03:17.609> the<00:03:17.760> papers<00:03:18.120> it'll<00:03:18.359> be

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
analyze it to write the papers it'll be

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.110 
analyze it to write the papers it'll be
a<00:03:18.510> year<00:03:18.569> before<00:03:19.040> anything<00:03:20.040> seen<00:03:20.250> in<00:03:20.400> print<00:03:20.639> we

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
a year before anything seen in print we

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.970 
a year before anything seen in print we
collected<00:03:21.510> quite<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:21.720> few<00:03:21.989> biological<00:03:22.560> samples

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
collected quite a few biological samples

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.099 
collected quite a few biological samples
we<00:03:23.310> collected<00:03:23.340> soil<00:03:23.939> from<00:03:24.209> all<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:24.510> plots<00:03:24.720> and

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
we collected soil from all the plots and

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.420 
we collected soil from all the plots and
actually<00:03:25.439> we've<00:03:25.560> got<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.739> student<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.400> lab

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
actually we've got a student in the lab

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.789 
actually we've got a student in the lab
already<00:03:26.730> who's<00:03:27.209> analyzing<00:03:28.169> the<00:03:28.260> soils<00:03:28.590> and

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
already who's analyzing the soils and

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.289 
already who's analyzing the soils and
trying<00:03:29.069> to<00:03:29.189> understand<00:03:30.060> what<00:03:30.209> the

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
trying to understand what the

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.059 
trying to understand what the
differences<00:03:30.780> are<00:03:30.840> between<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.590> different

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
differences are between the different

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.759 
differences are between the different
forest<00:03:32.370> types<00:03:32.579> in<00:03:32.819> those<00:03:33.329> terms<00:03:33.629> these<00:03:34.560> are

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
forest types in those terms these are

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.530 
forest types in those terms these are
soil<00:03:35.189> samples<00:03:35.669> that<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:35.849> collected<00:03:36.299> while<00:03:36.480> I

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
soil samples that I collected while I

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.720 
soil samples that I collected while I
was<00:03:36.780> out<00:03:36.930> in<00:03:37.109> Russia<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.590> are<00:03:38.400> now<00:03:38.519> being

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
was out in Russia that are now being

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.140 
was out in Russia that are now being
analyzed<00:03:39.329> in<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.629> laboratory<00:03:40.969> how<00:03:41.969> can<00:03:42.120> you

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
analyzed in the laboratory how can you

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.640 
analyzed in the laboratory how can you
tell<00:03:42.239> what's<00:03:42.510> what<00:03:42.659> because<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.019> labeled<00:03:43.530> each

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
tell what's what because I labeled each

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.830 
tell what's what because I labeled each
one<00:03:43.950> with<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.669> plot<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.180> was<00:03:45.269> collected<00:03:45.750> in

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
one with the plot it was collected in

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.210 
going on on the ground in the plots is
that<00:04:08.609> you<00:04:08.699> take<00:04:08.909> a<00:04:09.209> soil<00:04:09.840> cover<00:04:10.199> which<00:04:10.470> looks

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
that you take a soil cover which looks

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.860 
that you take a soil cover which looks
like<00:04:11.310> two<00:04:11.760> pieces<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:12.209> pipe<00:04:12.389> welded<00:04:12.750> together

then got lost on their way back to find
me<00:05:46.290> not<00:05:47.010> sure<00:05:47.190> how<00:05:47.310> that<00:05:47.460> was<00:05:47.580> possible<00:05:47.640> it<00:05:48.180> was

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
me not sure how that was possible it was

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.610 
me not sure how that was possible it was
a<00:05:48.330> clear<00:05:48.630> slope<00:05:48.930> and<00:05:49.140> it<00:05:49.200> was<00:05:49.320> only<00:05:49.470> a<00:05:49.590> few

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
a clear slope and it was only a few

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.890 
a clear slope and it was only a few
hundred<00:05:49.890> metres<00:05:50.340> away<00:05:50.460> but<00:05:51.300> it<00:05:51.420> meant<00:05:51.540> we<00:05:51.690> lost

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
hundred metres away but it meant we lost

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.570 
hundred metres away but it meant we lost
quite<00:05:52.140> a<00:05:52.200> lot<00:05:52.320> of<00:05:52.440> time<00:05:52.770> before<00:05:52.980> we<00:05:53.220> managed<00:05:53.460> to

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
quite a lot of time before we managed to

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.630 
quite a lot of time before we managed to
move<00:05:53.700> the<00:05:53.880> stakes<00:05:54.150> up<00:05:54.390> and<00:05:54.600> then<00:05:55.590> get<00:05:55.920> them<00:05:56.100> set

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
move the stakes up and then get them set

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.760 
move the stakes up and then get them set
up<00:05:56.850> the<00:05:57.690> lines<00:05:57.930> had<00:05:58.110> to<00:05:58.230> go<00:05:58.350> through<00:05:58.530> several

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
up the lines had to go through several

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.830 
up the lines had to go through several
dense<00:05:59.130> patches<00:05:59.430> of<00:05:59.640> mountain<00:06:00.120> pine<00:06:00.360> all<00:06:00.720> of

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
dense patches of mountain pine all of

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.710 
dense patches of mountain pine all of
which<00:06:00.960> added<00:06:01.290> to<00:06:01.320> the<00:06:01.530> chore<00:06:02.100> of<00:06:02.130> it<00:06:02.450> so<00:06:03.450> it<00:06:03.570> was

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
which added to the chore of it so it was

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.690 
which added to the chore of it so it was
past<00:06:04.290> seven<00:06:04.650> o'clock<00:06:04.890> before<00:06:05.070> we<00:06:05.340> finished

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
past seven o'clock before we finished

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.790 
past seven o'clock before we finished
and<00:06:06.030> eventually<00:06:06.570> we<00:06:06.600> sloped<00:06:07.290> back<00:06:07.560> to<00:06:07.710> the

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
and eventually we sloped back to the

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.640 
and eventually we sloped back to the
card<00:06:08.010> on<00:06:08.190> to<00:06:08.430> sleep
