00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.020
 Janosch's dream lesson 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.700
 Fiderallala, Fiderallala, Fiderallalala 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.000
 Törömtata dualala the cricket and the mole 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.060
 Fiderallala, Fiderallala, Fidemole, Grille tatütata 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.400
 The cricket and the mole, the mole and the cricket 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.120
 Fiderallala, Fiderallala, Fideralltarütata 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:29.840
 A cricket had done nothing but complete and completed and summoned all summer 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.380
 And when winter came, she had nothing to eat 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.880
 Because she had not ordered the field so no harvest 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.120
 Had no plucked wool, so no glove 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.000
 Had not built a winter house with stove 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.000
 Then she went to the stag beetle and said: 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.780
 You are the forester in the forest, because you have an antler 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.320
 Could I temporarily stay with you for free? asked the cricket 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.020
 Only for a winter, because I forgot 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.580
 Ohhhh forgot, said the stag beetle 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.260
 To forget. Yes we know that 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.740
 Only fumble around useless the whole summer and then live on other people costs 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.120
 Mhh, no no Mariechen. It does not work 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.520
 Then the cricket went on with her little violin and came to the mouse 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.680
 The mouse lived in a dented watering can 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.440
 The mouse had accumulated so many supplies for the winter that they would have lasted for three winters 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.120
 And for two people 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.920
 Only temporarily, said the cricket 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.980
 For a winter only if you would allow it 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.680
 I forgot 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.840
 To forget! said the mouse 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.720
 Forget, yes, that's known 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:57.220
 Fiddle around all summer long and not work, then want to live on other people costs 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.880
 No, no, Mariechen. 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.480
 Unfortunately, nothing will come of it 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.160
 The cricket went on with her little violin 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:22.780
 and came to the old mole, who lived in a basement apartment. With oven 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.400
 Oh visit! cried the old mole 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.080
 Come closer, I can not see well 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.320
 I'm a bit short-sighted because I'm blind 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.440
 Comes from the black earth under the earth where I work. Never mind 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.900
 When he recognized the cricket, he was pleased 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.160
 Because he had often listened to her Gefidel in the summer 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.140
 Whoever sees bad, likes to listen when playing music 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.520
 Play something on the violin Du, said the old mole 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.980
 And the cricket fiddled and sang 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.060
 And the stove bawled 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.840
 They cooked good cabbage soup with mouse bacon 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.080
 Or two sweet peas per person 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.360
 In the evening they read together in the forest paper 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.240
 The sofa was nice and soft 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.800
 And they've never never quarreled 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.160
 So winter went by like a day 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.280
 Was a nice winter for the two 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Probably the most beautiful in her entire life
