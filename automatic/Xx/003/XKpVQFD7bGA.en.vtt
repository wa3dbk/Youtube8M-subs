00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:11.830
 warning film everyone knows what 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.830
 any mechanical lock can be opened 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.779
 the main reason for staying the same 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.089
 principle of operation and accessibility 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.269
 information about hacking locks any 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.269
 difficulties 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:38.510
 forewarned means armed like you 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:41.600
 learn after watching the movie castle 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.500
 suvaldny in it to the bolt moves with 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.410
 using the key 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.110
 free movement of bolt block 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.180
 levers they also make secret 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.820
 part of the castle 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.680
 the key has a certain combination 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.290
 which should match the combination of su 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.670
 white and release x latch if 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.970
 combinations do not match 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.000
 then the bolt will remain locked principle 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.730
 the work of the castle 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.520
 with u woops that are in contact with the key 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.570
 and below and locks the castle lock 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.460
 cylinder 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.560
 here the cylinder rotates with a key 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.800
 free rotation of the cylinder blocking 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.860
 you 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.619
 they also make up the secret part of the castle 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.020
 the key has a certain combination 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.260
 which should match the combination 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.080
 pins then appears at the cylinder 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.600
 able to rotate 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.570
 if the key combination does not match then 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.800
 the lock is locked into operation 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.560
 cylinder lock 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.160
 pins that are in contact with the key 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.380
 below and lock the lock to open 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.619
 lock lock first need key 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.930
 click on the levers then push them 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.140
 regin but to open the lock 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.869
 need to do the opposite first push 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.660
 bolt and kept it under load by 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.520
 queue up click click on each 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.960
 levers thus freeing riddike 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.170
 cylinder lock can be opened 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.170
 in the same way first applied 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.830
 force and holding the lock under load by 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.560
 queues 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.790
 pin positions are set for 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.560
 the film we have chosen the most 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.440
 common types of locks 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.570
 if you talk about all the varieties 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.299
 existing locks will have to 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.610
 repeat and still nothing new you 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.329
 don't hear it because all mechanical 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.250
 locks work on the same principle 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:38.400
 differing only designs in some 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.000
 there are levers in other pins in the third 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.250
 plate disks and so on but the principle 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.950
 work 1 he's known from deep 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.440
 antiquities and despite modern 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.890
 technology working principle mechanical 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.430
 locks 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.160
 to this day the progress has not changed 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.940
 moves only in the direction of complication but 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.670
 at the same time 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.340
 complex and master key production 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.450
 which are put on stream are sold 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.370
 they are free 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.280
 along with detailed instructions for their 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.940
 use and no secret what exactly 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.819
 demand generates supply now 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.459
 time there were very difficult locks for 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.640
 which the master keys have not yet done but 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.870
 nevertheless it is enough ways of opening 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.780
 it is possible to use for example 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.819
 liquid nitrogen it is needed in small 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.730
 quantities just to 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.610
 freeze those same blocking elements 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.410
 the lock after which becomes unimportant 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.930
 what is the armored cover 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.319
 how many billion combinations in a castle and 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.750
 what systems it is equipped with is inserted 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.349
 convolution and one stroke lock 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.790
 turns the main danger 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.519
 It is not that all locks are easy 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.829
 reveal the fact that it can today 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.709
 afford to anyone 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.250
 it is for such a desire and designed 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.720
 master key business 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.239
 professionals tend to be themselves 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.420
 provide tool ways 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:09.269
 choose depending on the situation if 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.480
 Received an order for wiretap is better 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.130
 make keys for that enough 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.160
 determine what number is listed 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.229
 every secret item 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.860
 pressing successively until clicking on 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.000
 the scale recognizes the desired number and then 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.130
 right on the spot 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.130
 an exact copy of the key is made 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.229
 cylinder lock copied by similar 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:40.349
 in the way on the prepared preparations on 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.649
 number sawed key profile all 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:45.449
 tools easily fit 

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:47.729
 intruder in your pocket today 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.779
 day produced quality reliable 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.509
 safe door 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:54.509
 but with those locks that stand on them 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:56.849
 it's just an armored gate which 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.039
 very much like crackers because she 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.999
 absorbs noise created during 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.939
 opening locks 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:06.209
 we told the whole truth about mechanical 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:07.849
 locks if you hush up the problem itself 

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:09.839
 it will not be solved by itself 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:13.409
 useless to reinvent the wheel 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:15.589
 complicating the design of locks to solve 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.719
 the problem must be returned to the roots 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:21.169
 change the very principle of work that we and 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:21.169
 made
