00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.660
 hello welcome on my head channel 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.520
 here's turn again 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.760
 for the simple taxiway we need 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.950
 first of all fresh air yoga is a kind 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.050
 puff pastry according to Turkish tradition 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.510
 you can find them in Turkish 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:51.110
 Supermarket, we need three 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:52.610
 we need leaves of them in addition 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.559
 still vegetable oil 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.360
 I also have vegetable oil here 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.430
 mixed olive oil you can do too 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.550
 but also pure vegetable oil applies 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:07.120
 corn flour salt egg yolk and yogurt her 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:17.740
 can also take city yogurt quark 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:17.740
 then vinegar cheese and parsley 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.070
 so first of all we will become the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.260
 make stuffing and the sheep's cheese 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.970
 just first with the hands 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:41.570
 crumble and then fork 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:43.890
 crush so that's already done 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.450
 Let's cut the parsley there now 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:56.910
 let's cut the rods off and on 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:58.740
 the leaves we had now so 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.310
 and the parsley the chopped 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.300
 parsley comes to the feta cheese and 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.300
 everything is mixed now 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.560
 So next we will paste 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:20.000
 made from oil and maize flour and indeed 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:24.590
 comes first is cornmeal then salt this 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.540
 is mixed first and then slowly 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.700
 to give the oil and then vinegar and 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.730
 mix everything together 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:41.510
 This results in a paste we on 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:43.640
 our dough sheets will be used that way 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.530
 Next we open our user 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.200
 all three are packed on top of each other 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.890
 We will separate first and individually 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.770
 occupy 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:59.390
 so now we feel the paste on one 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:03:01.970
 yoga and do it in the half and 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.790
 they often cut themselves in four again 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.920
 parts that are the result then 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.920
 a total of eight parts together 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.450
 so i am going to do with the next year 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.110
 we lubricate the same procedure as that 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:23.300
 the paste half on and 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:25.310
 cut in four parts again 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.320
 Now let's take two of them 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.900
 together the paste yes with the fit 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.350
 together and do the filling on the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.780
 both leaves in this one 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.170
 triangular shape these are two leaves 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:43.520
 over each other and just roll now 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.940
 like a cigar and best with it 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.260
 sticks with water to glue and on 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.530
 do the baking sheet 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.540
 We can also use the dough leaves differently 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.200
 I almost always fill it here 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.730
 filled with garlic ham and cheese 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.040
 You can also do the filling again 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.720
 take and garlic with ham 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.780
 filling ham that fits very well 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.720
 At the end we lead yolks 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.730
 and yogurt together and smear 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.730
 that already on our part 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.239
 The box will then come in the oven at 180 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.100
 Grad preheated, of course, and see 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.860
 when they are done inge 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.360
 about in 20 minutes 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.460
 if you have reached this color 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:34.280
 it's about done and they taste good 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:36.710
 really delicious and cross who so little 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.630

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.669
 want and what special is this 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.560
