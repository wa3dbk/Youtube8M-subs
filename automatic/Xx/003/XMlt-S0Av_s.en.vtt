what<00:00:00.210> if<00:00:00.299> I<00:00:00.420> told<00:00:00.480> you<00:00:00.870> that<00:00:00.989> everything<00:00:01.770> in

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
what if I told you that everything in

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.789 
what if I told you that everything in
the<00:00:02.100> universe<00:00:02.129> made<00:00:02.909> music<00:00:03.389> even<00:00:03.780> stars<00:00:04.259> and

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
the universe made music even stars and

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.920 
the universe made music even stars and
then<00:00:05.220> also<00:00:05.520> promised<00:00:06.270> you<00:00:06.420> that<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:06.690> wasn't

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
then also promised you that I wasn't

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.870

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.790 
high on anything Anthony here for dnews
and<00:00:15.330> there's<00:00:15.540> always<00:00:15.809> been<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.320> feeling

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
and there's always been this feeling

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.529

they<00:01:51.750> actually<00:01:52.229> found<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.560> choir<00:01:52.829> singers

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
they actually found that choir singers

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.460 
they actually found that choir singers
are<00:01:53.610> more<00:01:53.939> likely<00:01:54.179> to<00:01:54.329> have<00:01:54.539> a<00:01:54.569> variation<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.380> a

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
are more likely to have a variation on a

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.649 
are more likely to have a variation on a
particular<00:01:56.039> gene<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.670> they<00:01:56.880> were<00:01:56.939> made<00:01:57.330> to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
particular gene like they were made to

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.809 
particular gene like they were made to
be<00:01:57.840> singers<00:01:58.470> and<00:01:58.709> maybe<00:01:58.890> trees<00:01:59.189> are<00:01:59.520> made<00:01:59.729> to

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
be singers and maybe trees are made to

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.669 
be singers and maybe trees are made to
be<00:01:59.939> pianos<00:02:00.390> because<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.049> German<00:02:01.380> artist

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
be pianos because this German artist

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.380 
be pianos because this German artist
created<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.069> turntable<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.759> reads<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.149> rings

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
created a turntable that reads the rings

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.480 
created a turntable that reads the rings
on<00:02:03.689> tree<00:02:04.020> slices<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.679> converts<00:02:05.280> them<00:02:05.399> into

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
on tree slices and converts them into

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.089 
on tree slices and converts them into
piano<00:02:06.000> music<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.630> real<00:02:06.869> time<00:02:07.140> based<00:02:07.739> on<00:02:07.920> their

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
piano music in real time based on their

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:17.630 
piano music in real time based on their
thickness<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.729> growth<00:02:09.299> rates<00:02:09.660> haunting

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.010 

so<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.790> there<00:02:18.910> really<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.270> connection<00:02:19.900> between

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
so is there really a connection between

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.410 
so is there really a connection between
music<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.950> universe<00:02:21.310> well<00:02:21.550> there<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.269> an

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
music and the universe well there is an

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.759 
music and the universe well there is an
important<00:02:22.780> thing<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.019> remember<00:02:23.050> here<00:02:23.410> the

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
important thing to remember here the

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.250 
important thing to remember here the
rules<00:02:24.069> that<00:02:24.340> determine<00:02:25.090> how<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.629> raw<00:02:25.959> data

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
rules that determine how the raw data

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.860 
rules that determine how the raw data
from<00:02:26.590> these<00:02:26.680> x-rays<00:02:27.160> or<00:02:27.400> genes<00:02:27.670> or<00:02:27.940> trees<00:02:28.269> turn

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
from these x-rays or genes or trees turn

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.050 
from these x-rays or genes or trees turn
into<00:02:29.110> sound<00:02:29.410> we're<00:02:30.099> all<00:02:30.280> created<00:02:30.730> by<00:02:30.819> people

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
into sound we're all created by people

into sound we're all created by people
the<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.780> raw<00:02:31.930> patterns<00:02:32.410> are<00:02:32.560> there<00:02:32.680> but<00:02:32.920> it's

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
the the raw patterns are there but it's

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.830 
the the raw patterns are there but it's
a<00:02:33.069> human<00:02:33.400> being<00:02:33.610> who<00:02:34.090> figures<00:02:34.420> out<00:02:34.540> how<00:02:34.810> to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
a human being who figures out how to

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.540 
a human being who figures out how to
make<00:02:35.080> those<00:02:35.230> patterns<00:02:35.560> work<00:02:35.890> as<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.130> melody

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
make those patterns work as a melody

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.009 
make those patterns work as a melody
it's<00:02:36.670> still<00:02:36.849> fun<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.060> think<00:02:37.269> about<00:02:37.420> right<00:02:37.810> I

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
it's still fun to think about right I

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.750 
it's still fun to think about right I
would<00:02:38.260> love<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.500> hear<00:02:38.680> how<00:02:38.739> weather<00:02:39.190> patterns

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
would love to hear how weather patterns

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.610 
would love to hear how weather patterns
sounded<00:02:40.300> as<00:02:40.420> music<00:02:40.810> what<00:02:41.019> kind<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.200> science

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
sounded as music what kind of science

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.740 
sounded as music what kind of science
