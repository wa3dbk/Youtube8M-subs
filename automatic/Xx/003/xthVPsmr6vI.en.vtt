00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
as well and this one is in gray so that

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.690 
as well and this one is in gray so that
tells<00:01:51.180> us<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.659> maybe<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.530> motorola<00:01:53.009> logo<00:01:53.460> is

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
tells us that maybe the motorola logo is

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.080 
tells us that maybe the motorola logo is
an<00:01:53.939> accent<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.509> could<00:01:54.810> be<00:01:55.070> modified<00:01:56.070> some<00:01:57.030> of
