00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.640 
really cool about alice is physics and
physics<00:01:58.060> is<00:01:58.240> invidious<00:01:58.480> physics<00:01:59.050> technology

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
physics is invidious physics technology

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.410 
physics is invidious physics technology
that<00:02:00.160> allows<00:02:00.340> us<00:02:00.370> to<00:02:00.610> do<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.700> lot<00:02:01.030> of<00:02:01.060> really

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
that allows us to do a lot of really

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.510 
that allows us to do a lot of really
interesting<00:02:01.600> volumetric<00:02:02.380> particle<00:02:03.220> and

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
interesting volumetric particle and

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.430 
interesting volumetric particle and
physics<00:02:04.000> effects<00:02:04.330> in<00:02:04.540> a<00:02:04.600> game<00:02:04.780> on<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.110> GPU

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
physics effects in a game on the GPU

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.530 
physics effects in a game on the GPU
that<00:02:06.070> wouldn't<00:02:06.340> be<00:02:06.460> possible<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:07.120> rendered<00:02:07.420> on

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540

that wouldn't be possible it rendered on
the<00:02:07.630> CPU<00:02:07.990> now<00:02:08.920> what<00:02:09.070> I'm<00:02:09.130> going<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.280> show<00:02:09.399> you

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
the CPU now what I'm going to show you

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.400 
the CPU now what I'm going to show you
is<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.700> side-by-side<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.420> what<00:02:10.840> you're<00:02:11.020> missing

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
is a side-by-side of what you're missing

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.110 
is a side-by-side of what you're missing
