set it there really quite simple once

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.360 
set it there really quite simple once
you<00:01:53.780> get<00:01:53.990> used<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.290> him<00:01:54.470> just<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:54.800> couple<00:01:54.890> times

you get used to him just a couple times

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.000 
you get used to him just a couple times
of<00:01:55.520> doing<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:55.850> you'll<00:01:56.000> be<00:01:56.920> throwing<00:01:57.920> them

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
of doing it you'll be throwing them

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.920 
of doing it you'll be throwing them
together<00:01:58.130> like<00:01:58.580> it's<00:01:58.820> no<00:01:58.970> problem<00:01:59.240> so<00:01:59.810> we're

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
together like it's no problem so we're

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.460 
together like it's no problem so we're
here<00:02:00.110> we<00:02:00.229> got<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.410> gopher<00:02:00.800> hole<00:02:05.110> this<00:02:06.110> is<00:02:06.260> quite

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
here we got a gopher hole this is quite

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.910 
here we got a gopher hole this is quite
large

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
large

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.469 
large
a<00:02:07.070> lot<00:02:07.250> of<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.460> gopher<00:02:07.760> holes<00:02:07.970> are<00:02:08.179> smaller

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
a lot of the gopher holes are smaller

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.860 
a lot of the gopher holes are smaller
than<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:08.929> so<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:09.950> what<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.220> do<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.940> take<00:02:11.450> my<00:02:11.600> trap

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
than that so is what I do I take my trap

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.380 
than that so is what I do I take my trap
and<00:02:12.050> trowel<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:13.640> know<00:02:14.110> take<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.260> trowel<00:02:16.390> I'll

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
and trowel you know take the trowel I'll

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.330 
and trowel you know take the trowel I'll
go<00:02:17.570> in<00:02:17.750> roughly<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.650> length<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:19.010> width<00:02:19.190> of

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
go in roughly the length the width of

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.250 
go in roughly the length the width of
this<00:02:19.580> for<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.300> length<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.660> that<00:02:20.780> right<00:02:21.020> there

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
this for the length of that right there

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.710 
this for the length of that right there
and<00:02:22.070> I'll<00:02:22.220> just<00:02:22.250> round<00:02:22.670> this<00:02:22.880> out<00:02:23.120> don't<00:02:23.510> worry

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
and I'll just round this out don't worry

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.680 
and I'll just round this out don't worry
about<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.080> dirt<00:02:24.260> down<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.620> hole<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:26.450> pull<00:02:26.660> a

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
about the dirt down the hole you pull a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.260 
about the dirt down the hole you pull a
little<00:02:26.930> bit<00:02:27.020> of<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.350> out<00:02:27.640> go<00:02:28.640> slow<00:02:28.910> dig<00:02:29.090> that

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
little bit of it out go slow dig that

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.620 
little bit of it out go slow dig that
over<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.630> way<00:02:29.780> leaves<00:02:30.050> coming<00:02:30.350> over<00:02:31.540> then<00:02:32.540> you

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
over the way leaves coming over then you

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.920 
over the way leaves coming over then you
just<00:02:32.810> take<00:02:32.959> that<00:02:32.989> trap<00:02:34.570> slide<00:02:35.570> that<00:02:35.750> right

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
just take that trap slide that right

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.479 
just take that trap slide that right
down<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.320> hole<00:02:38.290> that's<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.410> little<00:02:39.560> good<00:02:39.860> this

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
down that hole that's a little good this

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.360 
down that hole that's a little good this
platform's<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.180> little<00:02:41.390> wobbly<00:02:42.280> what<00:02:43.280> I'm

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
platform's a little wobbly what I'm

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.020
