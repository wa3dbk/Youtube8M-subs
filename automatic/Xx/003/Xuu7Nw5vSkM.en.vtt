upcoming episode of NCIS tech tips where

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.299 
upcoming episode of NCIS tech tips where
we'll<00:00:04.799> be<00:00:04.890> looking<00:00:05.040> at<00:00:05.480> USB<00:00:06.480> 3.0<00:00:07.410> versus<00:00:07.890> USB

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
we'll be looking at USB 3.0 versus USB

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.230 
we'll be looking at USB 3.0 versus USB
2.0<00:00:09.000> which<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.690> here<00:00:09.990> versus<00:00:10.889> firewire<00:00:11.610> vs.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
2.0 which is here versus firewire vs.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.539 
2.0 which is here versus firewire vs.
eSATA<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.500> whole<00:00:13.679> point<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.309> to

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
eSATA so the whole point of this is to

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.210 
eSATA so the whole point of this is to
get<00:00:14.849> myself<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.450> couple<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:16.220> identical

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
get myself a couple of identical

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.939 
get myself a couple of identical
enclosures<00:00:18.000> other<00:00:18.480> than<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.260> interface<00:00:19.740> to

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
enclosures other than the interface to

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.560 
enclosures other than the interface to
the<00:00:19.980> hard<00:00:20.220> drive<00:00:20.400> get<00:00:20.760> myself<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.210> couple<00:00:21.390> of

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
the hard drive get myself a couple of

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.509 
the hard drive get myself a couple of
identical<00:00:22.050> hard<00:00:22.350> drives<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.980> then<00:00:23.490> a

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
identical hard drives and then a

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.910 
identical hard drives and then a
motherboard<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.390> features<00:00:25.109> all<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.560> these

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
motherboard that features all of these

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.189 
motherboard that features all of these
different<00:00:26.369> interfaces<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:28.050> an

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
different interfaces so that I can do an

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.470 
different interfaces so that I can do an
apples-to-apples<00:00:28.699> comparison<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.939> show<00:00:30.420> you

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
apples-to-apples comparison and show you

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.810 
apples-to-apples comparison and show you
just<00:00:30.779> how<00:00:30.929> much<00:00:31.199> speed<00:00:32.130> difference<00:00:32.550> there

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
just how much speed difference there

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.700 
just how much speed difference there
actually<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.540> between<00:00:34.020> all<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.380> these

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
actually is between all of these

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.190 
actually is between all of these
different<00:00:34.770> interfaces<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.000> are<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:37.110> know

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
different interfaces if you are you know

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.049 
different interfaces if you are you know
trying<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.530> decide<00:00:37.920> whether<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.579> worth<00:00:38.640> it

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
trying to decide whether it's worth it

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.560 
trying to decide whether it's worth it
to<00:00:39.180> spring<00:00:39.420> for<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> new<00:00:40.020> USB<00:00:40.739> 3.0<00:00:41.579> hard<00:00:42.329> drive

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
to spring for a new USB 3.0 hard drive

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.660 
to spring for a new USB 3.0 hard drive
enclosure<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.410> motherboard<00:00:43.890> or<00:00:44.280> if<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.489> want

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
enclosure and motherboard or if you want

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.549 
enclosure and motherboard or if you want
to<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:45.000> stick<00:00:45.329> with<00:00:45.450> these<00:00:45.600> SATA<00:00:45.930> or<00:00:46.140> Wow

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
to just stick with these SATA or Wow

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.200 
to just stick with these SATA or Wow
there's<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.100> lot<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.370> accessories<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:48.059> this

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
there's a lot of accessories with this

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.590 
there's a lot of accessories with this
guy<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.649> an<00:00:49.860> 8<00:00:50.070> comdata<00:00:50.600> enclosure

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
guy so this is an 8 comdata enclosure

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.270 
guy so this is an 8 comdata enclosure
and<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> actually<00:00:52.289> has<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> number<00:00:53.070> of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and it actually has a number of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.130 
and it actually has a number of
different<00:00:53.640> interfaces<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.930> is

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
different interfaces on it so this is

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.529 
different interfaces on it so this is
their<00:00:55.350> samba<00:00:55.860> quad<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.120> reason<00:00:57.420> it's

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
their samba quad and the reason it's

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.299 
their samba quad and the reason it's
called<00:00:57.600> quad<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.289> because<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> has<00:00:58.859> support

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
called quad is because it has support

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.939 
called quad is because it has support
for<00:00:59.670> eSATA<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:01.109> see<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.350> has<00:01:01.440> an<00:01:01.559> included

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
for eSATA you see it has an included

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.369 
for eSATA you see it has an included
eSATA<00:01:02.280> cable<00:01:02.520> very<00:01:02.969> nice<00:01:03.120> thank<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.510> then<00:01:04.199> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
eSATA cable very nice thank you then it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.980 
eSATA cable very nice thank you then it
has<00:01:05.510> what<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.840> one<00:01:07.549> firewire<00:01:08.600> 800<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
has what is this one firewire 800 I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.310 
has what is this one firewire 800 I
believe<00:01:10.549> ok<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.790> won't<00:01:12.479> actually<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:12.900> testing

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
believe ok I won't actually be testing

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.140 
believe ok I won't actually be testing
firewire<00:01:13.740> 800<00:01:13.979> unfortunately<00:01:14.909> because<00:01:15.060> I

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
firewire 800 unfortunately because I

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.420 
firewire 800 unfortunately because I
don't<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.479> firewire<00:01:15.960> 800<00:01:16.430> compatible

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
don't have a firewire 800 compatible

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.890 
don't have a firewire 800 compatible
motherboard<00:01:17.549> because<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.240> far<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.659> tell

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
motherboard because as far as I can tell

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.030 
motherboard because as far as I can tell
there<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:19.619> ever

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
there was like one ever

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.160 
there was like one ever
then<00:01:20.430> there's<00:01:20.640> firewire<00:01:21.060> 400<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
then there's firewire 400 so we have a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.270 
then there's firewire 400 so we have a
cable<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:22.860> well

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
cable for that as well

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.270 
cable for that as well
and<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> cable<00:01:24.810> for<00:01:25.110> USB<00:01:25.470> 2.0<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
and then we have a cable for USB 2.0 so

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.520 
and then we have a cable for USB 2.0 so
they've<00:01:27.060> included<00:01:27.299> all<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.020> cables<00:01:28.110> you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
they've included all of the cables you

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.050 
they've included all of the cables you
need<00:01:28.740> no<00:01:29.009> matter<00:01:29.159> how<00:01:29.460> you're<00:01:29.700> gonna<00:01:29.790> hook<00:01:30.000> it

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
need no matter how you're gonna hook it

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.630 
need no matter how you're gonna hook it
up<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.869> they've<00:01:31.049> also<00:01:31.470> included<00:01:32.159> two<00:01:32.369> black

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
up then they've also included two black

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.890 
up then they've also included two black
screws<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:34.189> six<00:01:35.189> other<00:01:35.759> ones<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.509> two<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.780> them

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
screws and six other ones so two of them

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.420 
screws and six other ones so two of them
are<00:01:37.020> small<00:01:37.290> three<00:01:37.710> eight<00:01:37.829> four<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.189> them<00:01:38.280> are

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
are small three eight four of them are

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.190 
are small three eight four of them are
hard<00:01:39.000> drive<00:01:39.210> these<00:01:39.360> are<00:01:39.509> hard<00:01:39.659> drive<00:01:39.840> screws

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
hard drive these are hard drive screws

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.899 
hard drive these are hard drive screws
so<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> don't<00:01:41.220> know<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> rest<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.790> them

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
so I don't know what the rest of them

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.039 
so I don't know what the rest of them
are<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.390> we'll<00:01:42.509> get<00:01:42.659> into<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.899> later

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
are for but we'll get into that later

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.090 
are for but we'll get into that later
then<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.790> manual<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.500> English

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
then we have a manual so this is English

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.980

like that package content system

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.359 
like that package content system
requirements<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.469> pause<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.130> read

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
requirements you can pause it and read

this<00:01:59.520> if<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.820> really<00:02:00.060> want<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.530> ok<00:02:01.530> then<00:02:01.860> we

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
this if you really want to ok then we

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.980 
this if you really want to ok then we
have<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.579> stand<00:02:02.939> for<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> bottom<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.750> we'll

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
have a stand for the bottom so we'll

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.959 
have a stand for the bottom so we'll
show<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.590> after<00:02:04.740> then<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> power

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
show that after then we have a power

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.570 
show that after then we have a power
cord<00:02:06.200> which<00:02:07.200> plugs<00:02:07.500> into<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:08.009> back<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.220> this

cord which plugs into the back of this
power<00:02:08.879> brick<00:02:09.830> which<00:02:10.830> then<00:02:11.069> plugs<00:02:11.370> into<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
power brick which then plugs into the

back of the hard drive

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.940 
back of the hard drive
like<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.690> it's<00:02:13.900> quite<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.080> large<00:02:14.350> power<00:02:14.680> brick

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
like that it's quite a large power brick

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.580 
like that it's quite a large power brick
but<00:02:15.130> I'd<00:02:15.490> rather<00:02:15.730> see<00:02:16.090> one<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.540> says<00:02:16.870> all<00:02:17.440> has

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
but I'd rather see one that says all has

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.680 
but I'd rather see one that says all has
a<00:02:17.620> dedicated<00:02:18.100> cord<00:02:18.520> so<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.240> doesn't<00:02:19.510> sit

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
a dedicated cord so that it doesn't sit

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.980 
a dedicated cord so that it doesn't sit
and<00:02:19.810> take<00:02:19.960> up<00:02:20.110> two<00:02:20.290> slots<00:02:20.440> on<00:02:20.800> my<00:02:21.040> my<00:02:21.640> power<00:02:21.820> bar

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.980 

here<00:02:25.990> is<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.830> Samba<00:02:27.190> quad<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.420> can<00:02:28.780> see

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
here is the Samba quad so you can see

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.310 
here is the Samba quad so you can see
right<00:02:29.500> off<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.710> bat<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:30.370> full<00:02:30.910> of

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
right off the bat it is full of

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.260 
right off the bat it is full of
interfaces<00:02:32.320> so<00:02:32.860> here<00:02:33.070> is<00:02:33.160> USB<00:02:33.430> 2.0

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
interfaces so here is USB 2.0

here's firewire 400 firewire 800

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
firewire 800 again eSATA and then power

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.950 
firewire 800 again eSATA and then power
then<00:02:41.530> we've<00:02:41.680> got<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:42.130> power<00:02:42.490> switch<00:02:42.880> here<00:02:43.420> as

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
then we've got a power switch here as

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.720 
then we've got a power switch here as
well<00:02:44.320> as<00:02:44.560> oh<00:02:44.770> this<00:02:44.980> explains<00:02:45.400> what<00:02:45.580> those

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
well as oh this explains what those

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.430 
well as oh this explains what those
other<00:02:45.880> two<00:02:46.120> black<00:02:46.330> screws<00:02:46.630> are<00:02:46.780> for<00:02:46.960> a<00:02:47.200> comm

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
other two black screws are for a comm

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.710 
other two black screws are for a comm
beta<00:02:47.650> has<00:02:47.830> installed<00:02:48.130> only<00:02:48.340> two<00:02:48.640> screws<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.300> I

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
beta has installed only two screws and I

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.510 
beta has installed only two screws and I
guess<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.140> is<00:02:50.320> enough<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.860> hold<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:51.280> in<00:02:51.400> place

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
guess that is enough to hold it in place

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.580 
guess that is enough to hold it in place
anyway<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:52.090> let's<00:02:53.050> have<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.230> look<00:02:53.380> at<00:02:53.500> the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
anyway so let's have a look at the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.230 
anyway so let's have a look at the
outside<00:02:53.710> of<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.100> enclosure<00:02:54.220> unlike<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.090> one

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
outside of the enclosure unlike the one

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.750 
outside of the enclosure unlike the one
that<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.450> looked<00:02:55.720> at<00:02:55.920> just<00:02:56.920> previous<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.580> this

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
that I looked at just previous to this

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.240 
that I looked at just previous to this
this<00:02:58.090> one<00:02:58.270> has<00:02:58.480> kind<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.990> fingerprint<00:02:59.890> proof

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
this one has kind of a fingerprint proof

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.310 
this one has kind of a fingerprint proof
matte<00:03:00.970> black<00:03:01.330> coating<00:03:01.900> on<00:03:02.020> it<00:03:02.050> that<00:03:02.290> I

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
matte black coating on it that I

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.200 
matte black coating on it that I
actually<00:03:02.560> prefer<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.370> think<00:03:03.730> that's<00:03:03.940> quite

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
actually prefer I think that's quite

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.330 
actually prefer I think that's quite
nice<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:04.750> it's<00:03:05.470> also<00:03:05.620> going<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:05.920> sort<00:03:06.250> of

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
nice and it's also going to sort of

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.210 
nice and it's also going to sort of
retain<00:03:06.700> its<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.120> new<00:03:07.360> look<00:03:07.660> over<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.440> lot<00:03:08.770> longer

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
retain its a new look over a lot longer

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.010 
retain its a new look over a lot longer
period<00:03:09.550> of<00:03:09.610> time<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:09.820> think<00:03:10.210> so<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:10.720> can<00:03:10.870> see

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
period of time I think so you can see

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.450 
period of time I think so you can see
even<00:03:11.110> when<00:03:11.320> I<00:03:11.380> leave<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.620> fingerprint<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.280> kind

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
even when I leave a fingerprint it kind

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.340 
even when I leave a fingerprint it kind
of<00:03:12.520> fades<00:03:12.730> away<00:03:12.880> that's<00:03:13.240> pretty<00:03:13.480> nice<00:03:13.630> got

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
of fades away that's pretty nice got

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.750 
of fades away that's pretty nice got
their<00:03:14.530> logo<00:03:14.770> and<00:03:14.950> everything<00:03:15.490> at<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.730> front

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
their logo and everything at the front

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.010 
their logo and everything at the front
you've<00:03:16.480> got<00:03:16.510> kind<00:03:16.960> of<00:03:17.080> a<00:03:17.260> grilled<00:03:17.770> mesh<00:03:18.310> II

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
you've got kind of a grilled mesh II

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.949 
out of the back because I'm gonna be
installing<00:03:33.670> hard<00:03:34.180> drives<00:03:34.420> in<00:03:34.570> these<00:03:34.690> things

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
installing hard drives in these things

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.440 
installing hard drives in these things
shortly<00:03:35.380> anyway<00:03:35.740> so<00:03:35.850> might<00:03:36.850> as<00:03:36.970> well<00:03:37.090> take<00:03:37.300> it

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
shortly anyway so might as well take it

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.340 
shortly anyway so might as well take it
apart<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:43.030> unlike<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.690> other<00:03:43.840> one<00:03:44.020> it's<00:03:44.170> also

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
apart so unlike the other one it's also

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.949 
apart so unlike the other one it's also
metal<00:03:44.709> inside<00:03:45.160> which<00:03:45.490> is<00:03:45.700> I<00:03:45.730> think<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.540> step<00:03:46.750> in

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
metal inside which is I think a step in

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.500 
metal inside which is I think a step in
the<00:03:47.200> right<00:03:47.500> direction<00:03:47.970> rather<00:03:48.970> than<00:03:49.300> using

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
the right direction rather than using

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.240 
the right direction rather than using
like<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.810> plastic<00:03:50.380> interior<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:50.980> mount<00:03:51.130> the

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
like a plastic interior to mount the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.550 
like a plastic interior to mount the
hard<00:03:51.459> drive<00:03:51.670> uses<00:03:52.360> a<00:03:52.390> very<00:03:52.660> similar<00:03:52.959> interface

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
hard drive uses a very similar interface

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.740 
hard drive uses a very similar interface
to<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.550> mount<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.940> hard<00:03:55.120> drive<00:03:55.330> though<00:03:55.540> you're

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
to to mount the hard drive though you're

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.660 
to to mount the hard drive though you're
just<00:03:55.780> gonna<00:03:56.080> put<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.410> drive<00:03:56.590> down<00:03:56.830> slide<00:03:57.490> it

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
just gonna put the drive down slide it

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.699 
just gonna put the drive down slide it
back<00:03:57.850> onto<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.300> SATA<00:03:58.690> interface<00:03:59.230> here<00:03:59.530> and

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
back onto the SATA interface here and

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.320 
back onto the SATA interface here and
then<00:04:00.250> you're<00:04:00.400> gonna<00:04:00.490> screw<00:04:00.850> it<00:04:00.940> in<00:04:01.030> from<00:04:01.209> the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
then you're gonna screw it in from the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.420 
then you're gonna screw it in from the
bottom<00:04:01.600> four<00:04:01.870> screws<00:04:02.230> here<00:04:02.890> you<00:04:03.040> can<00:04:03.250> see

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
bottom four screws here you can see

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.860 
bottom four screws here you can see
we've<00:04:03.610> actually<00:04:03.820> got<00:04:04.270> a<00:04:04.480> far<00:04:04.840> more

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
we've actually got a far more

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.680 
we've actually got a far more
complicated<00:04:05.440> PCB<00:04:06.310> compared<00:04:06.820> to<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.209> the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
complicated PCB compared to the the

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.780 
complicated PCB compared to the the
Samba<00:04:08.050> USB<00:04:08.560> super<00:04:08.920> speed<00:04:09.160> that<00:04:09.310> we<00:04:09.400> looked<00:04:09.610> at

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
Samba USB super speed that we looked at

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.430 
Samba USB super speed that we looked at
got<00:04:10.330> a<00:04:10.360> couple<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:10.810> chips<00:04:11.020> on<00:04:11.200> they're<00:04:11.410> not

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
got a couple of chips on they're not

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.830 
got a couple of chips on they're not
sure<00:04:11.830> what<00:04:12.070> either<00:04:12.520> of<00:04:12.820> them<00:04:12.940> does<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.570> I

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
sure what either of them does and I

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.960 
sure what either of them does and I
don't<00:04:14.230> think<00:04:14.800> it's<00:04:14.950> fair<00:04:15.130> to<00:04:15.190> expect<00:04:15.610> me<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.760> do

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
don't think it's fair to expect me to do

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.180 
don't think it's fair to expect me to do
that<00:04:16.150> right<00:04:16.419> on<00:04:16.450> right<00:04:16.959> on<00:04:17.140> camera<00:04:17.859> here

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
that right on right on camera here

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.820 
that right on right on camera here
anyway<00:04:18.520> and<00:04:18.700> then<00:04:19.239> we've<00:04:19.419> got<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.930> wires<00:04:20.410> for

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
anyway and then we've got the wires for

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.280 
anyway and then we've got the wires for
the<00:04:20.890> power<00:04:21.430> switch<00:04:21.790> which<00:04:21.820> is<00:04:22.270> here<00:04:22.900> at<00:04:23.080> the

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
the power switch which is here at the

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.600 
the power switch which is here at the
back<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:24.370> then<00:04:24.490> also<00:04:24.790> inside

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
back and then also inside

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.950 
back and then also inside
guess<00:04:25.759> I<00:04:25.879> can<00:04:26.030> show<00:04:26.180> you<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.389> bottom<00:04:26.719> where

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
guess I can show you the bottom where

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.679 
guess I can show you the bottom where
this<00:04:27.110> wire<00:04:27.319> is<00:04:27.590> taped<00:04:28.370> into<00:04:28.610> place<00:04:28.639> and<00:04:29.360> then

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:29.689 
this wire is taped into place and then

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.770 
this wire is taped into place and then
oh<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:29.930> can<00:04:30.229> also<00:04:30.349> show<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:30.680> how<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:31.030> hmm<00:04:32.030> how

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
oh I can also show you how the hmm how

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.929 
oh I can also show you how the hmm how
the<00:04:32.840> stand<00:04:33.169> at<00:04:33.409> the<00:04:33.500> bottom<00:04:33.650> works<00:04:34.009> so<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:34.639> guess

00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:34.939 
the stand at the bottom works so I guess

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:37.540 
the stand at the bottom works so I guess
you<00:04:35.090> just<00:04:35.120> slide<00:04:35.539> this<00:04:35.810> in<00:04:36.050> from<00:04:36.379> no<00:04:36.680> no<00:04:36.949> what

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
you just slide this in from no no what

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.860 
you just slide this in from no no what
I'm<00:04:37.639> guessing<00:04:37.879> you<00:04:38.120> do<00:04:38.240> is<00:04:38.419> you<00:04:38.539> turn<00:04:38.689> this

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
I'm guessing you do is you turn this

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.600 
I'm guessing you do is you turn this
around<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.500> then<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:42.159> dad<00:04:43.159> I<00:04:43.189> know<00:04:43.370> how<00:04:43.400> this

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
around and then you dad I know how this

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.240 
around and then you dad I know how this
works<00:04:43.789> but<00:04:44.270> it<00:04:44.419> goes<00:04:44.569> in<00:04:44.750> here<00:04:44.780> somehow<00:04:45.250> this

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
works but it goes in here somehow this

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.369 
works but it goes in here somehow this
slides<00:04:46.580> in<00:04:46.759> there<00:04:47.030> and<00:04:47.569> then<00:04:47.840> it's<00:04:48.229> something

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:48.379 
slides in there and then it's something

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.490 
slides in there and then it's something
to<00:04:48.710> do<00:04:48.860> with<00:04:49.150> these<00:04:50.150> holes<00:04:50.419> in<00:04:50.659> here<00:04:50.900> so<00:04:51.439> you

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
to do with these holes in here so you

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.619 
to do with these holes in here so you
screw<00:04:52.189> it<00:04:52.280> in<00:04:52.310> somehow<00:04:52.610> and<00:04:53.000> then<00:04:53.300> good<00:04:53.599> things

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:53.629 
screw it in somehow and then good things

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:55.659 
screw it in somehow and then good things
happen<00:04:54.110> so<00:04:54.560> thank<00:04:54.830> you<00:04:54.949> for<00:04:55.099> checking<00:04:55.219> out<00:04:55.490> my
