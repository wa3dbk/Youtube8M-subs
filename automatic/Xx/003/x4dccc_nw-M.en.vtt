00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.150
 or years to all guys I'm z burst 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.679
 of and welcome to this less video 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.049
 because he didn't know me, my name is 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.670
 raffaele or 15 years almost 16 and during the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.859
 free time I dedicate myself to play where 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.990
 on black ops two consoles whose game 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.699
 mainly the class iii b 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.830
 dedicates precisely to make gameplay with the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.240
 next to the field we will have to do how 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.039
 to the point my nick on youtube 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.619
 having said that, I thank you very much indeed 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.110
 all the staff they gave today 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.360
 the possibility to be here nothing 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.920
 having said that I will immediately bring you the juice of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.739
 this game play is nothing but 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.540
 a nuclear weapon played with the n 94 the rifle 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.410
 really highly recommended assault a 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.110
 all the effects 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.820
 because thanks to its precision it is the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.680
 ability to be able to take that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.719
 really wins long distance 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.489
 reach the goal of thirty 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.800
 killings without a death becomes a lot 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.149
 easy tivo then guys I care 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.920
 maybe know yours too 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.410
 picciotto among the comments if maybe even 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.359
 you have succeeded with this weapon 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.580
 said this guys will list you right away 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.189
 that the bonuses if maybe you want to try 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.740
 or a greeting a m with silencer 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.510
 quick charger while bonus of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.900
 class are just the usual ones I use 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.580
 almost for all classes or 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.290
 jackal ghost and gender this time 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.470
 let's say I didn't use inflexible 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.630
 what why if still maybe a 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.759
 someone didn't know the function 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.090
 of this bonus with the rewards of the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.829
 web type of seven system and will not come 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.840
 activated because we say they are 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.490
 a kind of support rewards therefore 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.610
 its function I said will not come 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.829
 activated said this guys is played 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.509
 on a post but a team station 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.610
 multiple for those unfamiliar with it 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.380
 I immediately explain nor anything other than that kind of 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.390
 mode that is played only at risk 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.220
 lately with a group of three then 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.049
 if maybe he could organize you with 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.049
 a good team with three young people 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.009
 players who know how to support 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.229
 it really becomes a very thing 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.540
 facilitative these are here is also 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.370
 we say to give you some considerations 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.920
 about that goal for 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.680
 in my opinion we say achieve that 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.110
 reward or 30 kills without one 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.110
 death is really a stupid thing for 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.690
 reach such a stupid dog tag 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.210
 as I call it, surely some 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.300
 old style guy gamer 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:25.010
 of mv 2 mv 3 certainly approved however 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:29.160
 the feeling of once reached 20 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.650
 25 30 killings to manage to catch 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.570
 a reward that you know how to give us are 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.000
 that stimulates that satisfaction o 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.570
 misunderstand I have achieved these 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.870
 so many almost sweaty killings 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.800
 reach a reward for later not 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.060
 we see no meaning ie not 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.880
 perhaps contributes to the outcome of the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.040
 match we can consider it almost like 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.990
 so useless though we say it can be 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.090
 also referred to as a personal record 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.680
 so maybe if we want to specify it 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.380
 this was my first nuclear 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.420
 precisely because I am not a player who 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.850
 is dedicated to doing things like this 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.280
 I do not weigh or just a company of 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.720
 kind but let's say I 'm here for 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.810
 take you in this game a little bit 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.330
 particular then said this guys 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.730
 I also wanted to talk to you about the map 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.070
 so let's say we can do nuclear 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.840
 it also depends very and exclusively 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.300
 in the map 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.090
 in my case standoff a good map 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.190
 we say open and fortunately they are 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.500
 also happened with players who do not 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.940
 They were not so strong as to 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.220
 achieve this reward 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.470
 having said that guys, I apologize if maybe 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.430
 you are seeing melino you are feeling 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.010
 the game audio of this video but for 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.930
 these times we say that my pvr 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.430
 has managed to record audio but 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.989
 fortunately for the next ones 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.340
 recordings I think they don't have to 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.049
 be problems 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.760
 I apologize if you are seeing 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.230
 this video with the shot a little 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.730
 different but let 's just say it's just me 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.780
 dropped the phone together with the 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.670
 easel 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.560
 but let's leave this part guys there 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.659
 I want to know your below among the 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.129
 comments on what you think about it 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.440
 about my considerations on 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.329
 nuclear and nothing you feel maybe with the 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.640
 next video I recommend you leave me 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.170
 plan let me know below too 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.090
 if you have succeeded you also to take 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.010
 a core with this kind of fine weapon 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.570
 boy a greeting from you burst 10 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.590
