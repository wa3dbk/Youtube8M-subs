00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.930
 indirectly to help the aggressor and 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.079
 three policemen from the state of mexico what

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:49.390
 is that we can already determine if the 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.770
 crime and what and what classification would be 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.470
 agreement with the investigations 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.110
 Carlos Casares the manager of the bar together

 with the security personnel of the place 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.610
 they allowed the jj to escape and 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.040
 destroyed evidence the evidence that 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.799
 filed the attorney general's office are 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.630
 these videos where you observe first 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.969
 a security guard 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.579
 to the bathroom after the aggression and 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:14.350
 talking radio later another 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:17.590
 that opens the doors to the aggressors 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.990
 to leave the bar and minutes later two 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.890
 employees cleaning the place that they 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.220
 they committed a consistent behavior 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.289
 in altering the crime scene so 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.750
 which can be given either the crime of 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.789
 concealment by favoring or the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.490
 crime of attempted murder 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.679
 qualified that my clients would have 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.140
 committed the very serious error of cleaning 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.250
 the crime scene in no way 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.110
 it links them to a co-participation 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.390
 home will be other responsibilities 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.590
 criminals among the detainees was the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.929
 bathroom manager 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.140
 javier ibarra colonel who according to 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.450
 his statements saw when the jj pulled out 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.390
 a black pistol and pointed to 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.289
 cabins and that the player approached his 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.369
 head and challenged him to shoot 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.079
 after fulfilling their roots the 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.119
 employees were consigned to the 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.610
 South Prison for the crime of 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.069
 concealment by favoring but 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.470
 four days later six achieved their 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.390
 freedom because the judge considered 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.870
 that it was not serious and after paying a bond 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.420
 50 thousand pesos left the prison but 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.240
 his process follows only the manager Carlos 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.180
 cázares and the three policemen were left in 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.850
 prison in his case were charged as 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.580
 partners of attempted homicide 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.100
 in the case of charly it was because 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.260
 supposedly ordered that the 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.080
 crime scene but in his statement 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.140
 He said he did it because that's what 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.010
 asked the wife of salvador cabinas 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.010
 Maria Alonso Mena 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.519
 the mind 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.470
 like this 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.720
 Casares Fernández is still in jail in 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.300
 waiting for a judge to classify his 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.110
 crime to cover up to be able to leave 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.819
 on bail so far the 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.400
 footballer savior cabins has not 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.190
 appointed before the authorities to anyone of 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.599
 direct way as his aggressor the only 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.700
 statement that you made before a 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.580
 authority was last August in 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.680
 paraguay before a judge of that country and 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.349
 officials of the pgr and the procuracy 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.480
 capitalina of mexico have been received 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.310
 photographs and you have done some 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.880
 questions that surely in justice 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.829
 Mexican low is mentioned only from 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.010
 vague memories that he is having in that 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.420
 moment but can not remember 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.739
 necessarily the faces or names 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.530
 specifically the moment of the aggression 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.030
 just remember that his wife was beaten 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.250
 and his brother in law with whom he was 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.019
 that night they also declared but 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.989
 they do not recognize the aggressor of 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.970
 footballer since according to them cabins 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.950
 I found myself alone in the bathroom and 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.950
 witnessed the moment of the attack 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.450
 according to francisco barreto aka 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.900

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.060

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.190

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.540
 I'm the shot but after his 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.040
 catch jorge balderas heron 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.500
 supposedly gave another version 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.690
 the jj indicated that the incident was raised 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.180
 when he entered the bath and met 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.550
 savior cabins and asked for permission to 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.440
 access to the toilet which motivated the 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.510
 annoyance the footballer who reacted 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.940
 aggressively verbally and 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.040
 physically when you entered the 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.260
 bathroom francisco josé barreto garcía aka 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.610
 the accountant who allegedly was that 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.490
 he shot in the head to salvador 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.350
 cabins immediately the wife of 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.800
 Salvador cabins from Paraguay 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.960
 he denied the jj's version he saw it 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.090
 will say atrocities and things that do not 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.680
 be certain and this is already in second 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.690
 flat to us already the worst happened to you 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.940
 how important is work is alive and 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.530
 is recovering is in turn the 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.229
 authorities of the attorney general's office 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.270
 justice of the federal district assure 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.639
 that of not being able to establish with clarity 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.130
 who shot against cabins not 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.420
 means that this attack is without 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.490
 punishment 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.320
 and reiterate something there there is a position 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.290
 of two people who were in the same 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.210
 place involved in an event and everything 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.060
 that there is no doubt and the most 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.070
 you can get to establish is that a 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.290
 responsibility with respective death is 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.540
 say even though there are two 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.510
 versions of events and detainees 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:54.040
 they accuse each other of not checking 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:58.690
 who shot the two will be punished 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.690
