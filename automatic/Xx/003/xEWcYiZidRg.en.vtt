fast about the advanced warfare puzzle
in<00:03:10.260> Japan<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.500> mean<00:03:10.680> I've<00:03:10.770> got<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.130> but<00:03:11.970> I

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
in Japan I mean I've got it but I

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.660 
in Japan I mean I've got it but I
wouldn't<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:12.800> upset<00:03:13.800> if<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:14.010> didn't<00:03:14.370> get<00:03:14.520> that

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
wouldn't be upset if I didn't get that

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.970 
wouldn't be upset if I didn't get that

for not pre-ordering the next one which

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.710 
for not pre-ordering the next one which

also links him of the new town one is
very<00:03:18.959> interesting<00:03:19.410> where<00:03:19.590> that'd<00:03:20.310> be<00:03:20.400> a

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
very interesting where that'd be a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.820 
very interesting where that'd be a

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
warfare and exosuit abilities so when we

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.850 
warfare and exosuit abilities so when we
read<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.870> kind<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.230> means<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.650> maybe

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
read that that kind of means that maybe

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.620 
read that that kind of means that maybe
they'll<00:03:29.130> have<00:03:29.310> multiplayer<00:03:29.910> maps<00:03:30.150> designed

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
they'll have multiplayer maps designed

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.740 
they'll have multiplayer maps designed

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
for normal Call of Duty gameplay where

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.210 
for normal Call of Duty gameplay where
it's<00:03:33.870> simply<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.320> know<00:03:34.440> you're<00:03:34.890> on<00:03:35.070> the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
it's simply you know you're on the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.160 
it's simply you know you're on the
ground<00:03:35.430> there's<00:03:35.760> no<00:03:35.820> no<00:03:36.420> mentions<00:03:36.870> of<00:03:36.959> suits

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
ground there's no no mentions of suits

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.170 
ground there's no no mentions of suits
whatever<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.890> then<00:03:38.100> there's<00:03:38.310> an<00:03:38.400> exosuit

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
whatever and then there's an exosuit

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.940 
whatever and then there's an exosuit
version<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.140> we<00:03:40.260> could<00:03:40.380> potentially<00:03:40.560> have

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
version so we could potentially have

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.760 
version so we could potentially have
maybe<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.400> playlist<00:03:41.790> or<00:03:42.180> map<00:03:42.630> variants<00:03:43.320> which

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
maybe a playlist or map variants which

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.190 
maybe a playlist or map variants which
have<00:03:44.040> exosuit<00:03:44.700> ability<00:03:45.180> suited<00:03:45.660> maps<00:03:45.900> and

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
have exosuit ability suited maps and

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.590 
have exosuit ability suited maps and
then<00:03:46.530> we<00:03:46.680> have<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:47.310> version<00:03:47.880> of<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.239> map<00:03:48.420> which

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
then we have a version of the map which

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.970 
then we have a version of the map which
is<00:03:48.630> just<00:03:48.930> normal<00:03:49.200> what<00:03:49.500> we're<00:03:49.650> used<00:03:49.890> to

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
is just normal what we're used to

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.830 
is just normal what we're used to
because<00:03:50.400> if<00:03:50.670> we<00:03:50.940> think<00:03:51.090> about<00:03:51.360> in<00:03:51.510> terms<00:03:51.690> of

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
because if we think about in terms of

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.550 
because if we think about in terms of
eSports

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
eSports

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.710 
eSports
if<00:03:52.790> sledgehammer<00:03:53.790> change<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.239> game<00:03:54.390> so<00:03:54.690> much

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
if sledgehammer change the game so much

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.140 
if sledgehammer change the game so much
that<00:03:55.200> exosuits<00:03:56.070> are<00:03:56.250> going<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.670> be<00:03:56.760> something

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
that exosuits are going to be something

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.850 
that exosuits are going to be something
which<00:03:57.330> we<00:03:57.510> are<00:03:57.690> going<00:03:58.020> to<00:03:58.080> be<00:03:58.200> using<00:03:58.350> all<00:03:58.709> the

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
which we are going to be using all the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.620 
which we are going to be using all the
time<00:03:59.070> it's<00:03:59.850> going<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.090> change<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.360> whole<00:04:00.510> of

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
time it's going to change the whole of

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.390 
time it's going to change the whole of
eSports<00:04:01.020> and<00:04:01.170> that<00:04:01.290> all<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.739> tactics<00:04:01.980> that

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
eSports and that all the tactics that

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.070 
eSports and that all the tactics that
everyone's<00:04:02.910> come<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.239> learn<00:04:03.360> for<00:04:03.630> ecology<00:04:03.959> is

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
everyone's come to learn for ecology is

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.690 
everyone's come to learn for ecology is
gonna<00:04:04.260> be<00:04:04.380> completely<00:04:04.860> changed<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.430> it's

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
gonna be completely changed and it's

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.949 
gonna be completely changed and it's
gonna<00:04:05.790> be<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:05.970> totally<00:04:06.450> different<00:04:06.480> playing

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
gonna be a totally different playing

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.500 
gonna be a totally different playing
field<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:08.070> skill<00:04:08.400> level<00:04:08.730> will<00:04:08.940> be<00:04:08.970> ironed

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
field and the skill level will be ironed

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.780 
field and the skill level will be ironed
out<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:09.870> some<00:04:10.650> people<00:04:10.920> will<00:04:11.040> be<00:04:11.160> very<00:04:11.430> good

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
out and some people will be very good

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.000 
out and some people will be very good
will<00:04:12.030> come<00:04:12.300> to<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.450> exosuit<00:04:12.930> but<00:04:13.410> it's<00:04:13.860> just

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
will come to the exosuit but it's just

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.009 
will come to the exosuit but it's just
very<00:04:14.280> very<00:04:14.610> interesting<00:04:15.060> because<00:04:15.090> with<00:04:15.900> the

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
very very interesting because with the

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.080 
very very interesting because with the
exosuit<00:04:16.620> we<00:04:17.010> have<00:04:17.130> abilities<00:04:17.669> where<00:04:17.850> we<00:04:17.940> can

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
exosuit we have abilities where we can

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.539 
exosuit we have abilities where we can
run<00:04:18.299> on<00:04:18.419> walls<00:04:18.720> we<00:04:19.350> can<00:04:19.620> jump<00:04:20.190> higher<00:04:20.519> and

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
run on walls we can jump higher and

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.490 
run on walls we can jump higher and
stuff<00:04:20.970> like<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.269> so<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.989> can<00:04:22.020> think<00:04:22.350> of<00:04:22.410> the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
stuff like that so you can think of the

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.230 
stuff like that so you can think of the
situations<00:04:23.010> where<00:04:23.190> instead<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.490> going<00:04:23.940> in<00:04:24.120> a

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
situations where instead of going in a

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.150 
situations where instead of going in a
building<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:24.840> up<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.200> stairs<00:04:25.530> you<00:04:25.950> could

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
building and up the stairs you could

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.629 
building and up the stairs you could
literally<00:04:26.520> climb<00:04:26.970> up<00:04:27.210> the

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
literally climb up the

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.309 
literally climb up the
for<00:04:27.969> a<00:04:28.000> window<00:04:28.419> to<00:04:28.479> get<00:04:28.689> to<00:04:28.780> that<00:04:28.840> second<00:04:29.229> level

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:29.319 
for a window to get to that second level

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.409 
for a window to get to that second level
rather<00:04:30.009> than<00:04:30.219> having<00:04:30.759> to<00:04:30.879> go<00:04:31.000> through<00:04:31.270> the

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
rather than having to go through the

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.360 
rather than having to go through the
door<00:04:31.569> and<00:04:31.750> up<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:32.050> stairs<00:04:32.319> so<00:04:32.560> this<00:04:33.099> could

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
door and up the stairs so this could

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.279 
door and up the stairs so this could
potentially<00:04:33.750> indicate<00:04:34.750> that<00:04:34.870> we<00:04:35.020> could<00:04:35.169> be

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
potentially indicate that we could be

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.499 
potentially indicate that we could be
getting<00:04:35.409> maps<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:36.009> are<00:04:36.069> EXO<00:04:36.669> suitability

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
getting maps that are EXO suitability

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.600 
getting maps that are EXO suitability
for<00:04:37.830> variants<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:38.979> then<00:04:39.370> they'll<00:04:39.490> be

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
for variants and then they'll be

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.330 
for variants and then they'll be
versions<00:04:40.030> which<00:04:40.349> won't<00:04:41.349> have<00:04:41.560> EXO<00:04:41.860> suits<00:04:42.099> on

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
versions which won't have EXO suits on

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.559 
versions which won't have EXO suits on
them<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:42.639> we'll<00:04:42.759> play<00:04:42.909> just<00:04:43.090> like<00:04:43.150> normal

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
them and we'll play just like normal

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.959 
them and we'll play just like normal
quality<00:04:43.719> Maps<00:04:44.169> and<00:04:44.409> this<00:04:45.069> is<00:04:45.189> also<00:04:45.310> very<00:04:45.669> very

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:45.969 
quality Maps and this is also very very

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:47.279 
quality Maps and this is also very very
interesting<00:04:46.449> when<00:04:46.599> the<00:04:46.689> last<00:04:46.870> potential

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
interesting when the last potential

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.800 
interesting when the last potential
incentive<00:04:47.710> here<00:04:47.860> is<00:04:48.009> early<00:04:48.550> access<00:04:49.270> we<00:04:49.689> were

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
incentive here is early access we were

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.770 
incentive here is early access we were
able<00:04:49.960> to<00:04:50.139> fully<00:04:50.680> play<00:04:50.979> multiplayer<00:04:51.400> 48<00:04:52.360> hours

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
able to fully play multiplayer 48 hours

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.390 
able to fully play multiplayer 48 hours
or<00:04:52.930> so<00:04:53.080> before<00:04:53.259> the<00:04:53.530> game's<00:04:53.710> official<00:04:53.979> release

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
or so before the game's official release

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.399 
or so before the game's official release
and<00:04:54.639> of<00:04:54.939> course<00:04:55.150> all<00:04:55.360> your<00:04:55.389> stats<00:04:55.810> unlocks

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
and of course all your stats unlocks

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:58.050 
and of course all your stats unlocks
would<00:04:56.770> transfer<00:04:57.250> over<00:04:57.460> once<00:04:57.759> the<00:04:57.909> game

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
would transfer over once the game

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.969 
would transfer over once the game
releases<00:04:58.509> to<00:04:58.629> the<00:04:58.719> general<00:04:59.050> market<00:04:59.289> now

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
releases to the general market now

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.499 
releases to the general market now
something<00:05:00.370> like<00:05:00.460> this<00:05:00.580> has<00:05:00.789> never<00:05:01.180> been<00:05:01.330> done

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
something like this has never been done

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.749 
something like this has never been done
before<00:05:01.990> for<00:05:02.020> Call<00:05:02.319> of<00:05:02.349> Duty<00:05:02.770> I<00:05:02.889> know<00:05:02.979> that<00:05:03.370> the

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
before for Call of Duty I know that the

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.719 
before for Call of Duty I know that the
game<00:05:03.939> such<00:05:04.210> as<00:05:04.240> FIFA<00:05:04.629> they<00:05:04.930> have<00:05:05.110> early<00:05:05.319> access

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
game such as FIFA they have early access

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.369 
game such as FIFA they have early access
I'm<00:05:06.729> not<00:05:06.969> too<00:05:07.120> sure<00:05:07.300> if<00:05:07.509> the<00:05:07.689> stats<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:08.229> stuff

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
I'm not too sure if the stats and stuff

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.080 
I'm not too sure if the stats and stuff
from<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:08.860> early<00:05:09.159> access<00:05:09.310> versions<00:05:09.849> of<00:05:09.969> that

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
from the early access versions of that

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.659 
from the early access versions of that
game<00:05:10.360> move<00:05:11.169> over<00:05:11.500> but<00:05:11.620> I<00:05:11.650> know<00:05:11.770> for<00:05:12.099> other

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
game move over but I know for other

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.429 
game move over but I know for other
games<00:05:12.969> that<00:05:13.150> have<00:05:13.270> betas<00:05:13.719> incidents<00:05:14.289> like

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:14.439 
games that have betas incidents like

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.589 
games that have betas incidents like
titanfall<00:05:14.889> had<00:05:15.189> a<00:05:15.219> beta<00:05:15.490> lots<00:05:16.180> of<00:05:16.330> people

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
titanfall had a beta lots of people

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:17.939 
titanfall had a beta lots of people
ranked<00:05:16.930> up<00:05:17.050> to<00:05:17.169> the<00:05:17.259> highest<00:05:17.409> you<00:05:17.620> could<00:05:17.800> get

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
ranked up to the highest you could get

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.070 
ranked up to the highest you could get
in<00:05:18.069> that<00:05:18.279> and<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.879> snaps<00:05:19.150> didn't<00:05:19.599> transfer

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
in that and the snaps didn't transfer

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.379 
in that and the snaps didn't transfer
over<00:05:20.229> so<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.979> potential<00:05:21.279> maybe<00:05:21.729> of<00:05:22.000> an<00:05:22.090> early

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
over so the potential maybe of an early

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.899 
over so the potential maybe of an early
access<00:05:22.659> is<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:22.870> great<00:05:23.229> idea<00:05:23.469> which<00:05:24.189> is<00:05:24.370> it<00:05:24.639> will

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
access is a great idea which is it will

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.730 
access is a great idea which is it will
drive<00:05:25.270> pre-order<00:05:25.840> incentives<00:05:26.409> because<00:05:26.560> I

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
drive pre-order incentives because I

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.379 
drive pre-order incentives because I
know<00:05:26.800> I<00:05:26.949> would<00:05:27.250> love<00:05:27.430> to<00:05:27.639> get<00:05:27.759> my<00:05:27.879> hands<00:05:28.180> on<00:05:28.270> the

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
know I would love to get my hands on the

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.029 
know I would love to get my hands on the
