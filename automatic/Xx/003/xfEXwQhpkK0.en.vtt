on<00:01:10.409> my<00:01:10.650> race<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.760> think<00:01:12.000> about<00:01:12.240> 1992<00:01:13.049> when<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
on my race to think about 1992 when I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.990 
on my race to think about 1992 when I
was<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> favorite<00:01:13.950> for<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.430> race<00:01:14.670> and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
successful in that it was over overjoyed

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.330 
successful in that it was over overjoyed
by<00:02:44.190> having<00:02:45.120> actually<00:02:45.540> made<00:02:45.810> history<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.650> then

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
by having actually made history and then

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.160 
by having actually made history and then
just<00:02:47.820> having<00:02:48.270> broken<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.690> world<00:02:48.900> record

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
just having broken the world record

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.980 
just having broken the world record

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
again but having broken it by so much

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.280 
again but having broken it by so much
was<00:02:52.320> was<00:02:53.010> incredible

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290
