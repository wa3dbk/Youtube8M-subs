00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.460 

tense<00:00:45.220> this<00:00:45.460> ice<00:00:45.670> normally<00:00:46.480> come<00:00:46.660> in<00:00:46.870> two<00:00:47.200> bags

tense this ice normally come in two bags

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.860 
tense this ice normally come in two bags
one<00:00:47.980> for<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.370> flysheet<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:49.150> one<00:00:49.360> with<00:00:49.630> your

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
one for the flysheet and one with your

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.110 
one for the flysheet and one with your
poles<00:00:50.080> so<00:00:50.620> we'll<00:00:50.860> just<00:00:51.010> empty<00:00:51.400> the<00:00:51.430> poles<00:00:51.790> and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
poles so we'll just empty the poles and

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.580 
poles so we'll just empty the poles and
show<00:00:52.240> you<00:00:52.300> what<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.600> do<00:00:52.720> next<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.350> now<00:00:56.380> that

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
show you what to do next so now that

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.350 
show you what to do next so now that
we've<00:00:56.710> laid<00:00:56.860> out<00:00:57.040> all<00:00:57.220> our<00:00:57.340> poles<00:00:57.580> it's<00:00:58.180> time

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
we've laid out all our poles it's time

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.180 
we've laid out all our poles it's time
to<00:00:58.480> start<00:00:58.720> putting<00:00:59.140> them<00:00:59.320> all<00:00:59.380> together<00:00:59.500> this

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
to start putting them all together this

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.270 
to start putting them all together this
has<00:01:00.340> made<00:01:00.520> it<00:01:00.640> very<00:01:00.670> easy<00:01:00.940> because<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:03.070> have

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
has made it very easy because we have

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.700 
has made it very easy because we have
for<00:01:03.580> each<00:01:03.670> pole<00:01:04.000> attached<00:01:04.750> one<00:01:05.140> end<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.560> the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
for each pole attached one end to the

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.380 
for each pole attached one end to the
other<00:01:05.830> with<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.370> wire<00:01:06.550> in<00:01:06.700> between<00:01:06.729> here<00:01:07.180> and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
other with the wire in between here and

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.690 
other with the wire in between here and
that<00:01:07.840> makes<00:01:08.110> them<00:01:08.290> very<00:01:08.890> simple<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.550> put

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
that makes them very simple to put

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.020 
that makes them very simple to put
together

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.160 

now<00:01:13.030> think<00:01:13.210> you've<00:01:13.300> assembled<00:01:13.570> all<00:01:13.930> of<00:01:14.050> your

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
now think you've assembled all of your

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.719 
now think you've assembled all of your
poles<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:14.620> laid<00:01:14.800> them<00:01:14.950> out<00:01:15.100> what<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:15.370> would<00:01:15.580> do

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
poles and laid them out what I would do

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.570 
poles and laid them out what I would do
is<00:01:16.540> take<00:01:16.810> two<00:01:16.869> of<00:01:17.080> your<00:01:17.290> anchor<00:01:17.590> pegs<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.100> just

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
is take two of your anchor pegs and just

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.010 
is take two of your anchor pegs and just
peg<00:01:18.759> it<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.030> back<00:01:19.180> two<00:01:19.330> corners<00:01:19.540> with<00:01:19.869> them

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
peg it the back two corners with them

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.960 
peg it the back two corners with them
and<00:01:20.290> there<00:01:20.530> then<00:01:21.100> you'll<00:01:21.220> be<00:01:21.280> ready<00:01:21.400> to<00:01:21.550> insert

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
and there then you'll be ready to insert

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:30.630 
and there then you'll be ready to insert
the<00:01:22.150> ripples

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.770 

so<00:01:31.640> now<00:01:31.759> that<00:01:31.820> we've<00:01:32.030> pegged<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.390> back<00:01:32.540> of<00:01:32.689> the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
so now that we've pegged the back of the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.780 
so now that we've pegged the back of the
tent<00:01:33.020> all<00:01:33.500> we<00:01:33.680> need<00:01:33.830> to<00:01:33.860> do<00:01:34.070> is<00:01:34.310> take<00:01:34.520> one<00:01:34.670> of

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
tent all we need to do is take one of

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.300 
tent all we need to do is take one of
the<00:01:34.909> curved<00:01:35.180> roof<00:01:35.450> poles<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:36.130> pop<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.280> through

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
the curved roof poles and pop it through

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.760 
the curved roof poles and pop it through
the<00:01:37.909> rear<00:01:38.180> sleeve<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:39.259> what<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:39.409> would<00:01:39.500> say<00:01:39.680> at

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
the rear sleeve and what I would say at

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.820 
the rear sleeve and what I would say at
this<00:01:39.860> point<00:01:40.040> is<00:01:40.250> just<00:01:40.280> make<00:01:40.670> sure<00:01:40.700> that<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:42.140> if

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
this point is just make sure that and if

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.289 
this point is just make sure that and if
any<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.310> poles<00:01:43.520> are<00:01:43.670> different<00:01:44.000> lengths

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
any of the poles are different lengths

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.999 
any of the poles are different lengths
we<00:01:44.600> will<00:01:44.750> have<00:01:44.869> color-coded<00:01:45.470> them<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:45.799> just

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
we will have color-coded them so just

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.230 
we will have color-coded them so just
make<00:01:46.130> sure<00:01:46.159> that<00:01:46.430> you<00:01:46.520> get<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.759> right<00:01:46.909> colored

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
make sure that you get the right colored

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.270 
make sure that you get the right colored
pole<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.229> right<00:01:48.380> colored<00:01:48.680> sleeve<00:01:48.920> if

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
pole and the right colored sleeve if

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.460 
pole and the right colored sleeve if
there<00:01:49.520> are<00:01:49.640> different<00:01:50.030> lengths<00:01:50.630> of<00:01:50.720> poles<00:01:50.930> so

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
there are different lengths of poles so

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.730 
there are different lengths of poles so
we'll<00:01:51.560> just<00:01:51.680> show<00:01:51.799> you<00:01:51.860> what<00:01:52.039> to<00:01:52.130> do<00:01:52.250> here

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.410 

now<00:02:00.740> once<00:02:01.010> your<00:02:01.160> roof<00:02:01.310> pool<00:02:01.490> is<00:02:01.610> in<00:02:01.730> place<00:02:01.940> we

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
now once your roof pool is in place we

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.420 
now once your roof pool is in place we
just<00:02:02.450> want<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.810> take<00:02:02.990> this<00:02:03.170> towards<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.250> back

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
just want to take this towards the back

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:15.990 
just want to take this towards the back
of<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.910> tent

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.050 

no<00:02:16.990> we're<00:02:17.680> going<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.860> attach<00:02:18.130> our<00:02:18.280> side<00:02:18.520> pulls

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.250 

when<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.150> do<00:02:25.270> this<00:02:25.420> just<00:02:25.630> make<00:02:25.840> sure<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:26.020> you

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
when you do this just make sure that you

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.500 
when you do this just make sure that you
follow<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.740> curve<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.610> pull<00:02:27.820> with<00:02:28.390> the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
follow the curve of the pull with the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.490 
follow the curve of the pull with the
angle<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.410> safe<00:02:29.590> pull<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:32.110> then<00:02:32.320> what

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
angle of the safe pull and then what

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.050

ring and pin and you can see here that

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.440 
ring and pin and you can see here that
one<00:02:38.020> side<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.520> fixed<00:02:39.520> in<00:02:39.700> place<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.240> that's

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
one side is fixed in place and that's

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:50.100 
one side is fixed in place and that's
the<00:02:40.690> same<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.080> start<00:02:41.320> with

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.140 

once<00:02:51.110> that<00:02:51.290> seed<00:02:51.560> is<00:02:51.799> in<00:02:51.830> place<00:02:52.189> you<00:02:52.489> can<00:02:53.030> start

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
once that seed is in place you can start

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.569 
once that seed is in place you can start
on<00:02:53.659> the<00:02:54.110> other<00:02:54.260> side<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:55.010> what<00:02:55.129> we<00:02:55.250> want<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.459> do

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
on the other side and what we want to do

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.399 
on the other side and what we want to do
is<00:02:55.909> just<00:02:56.090> make<00:02:56.269> sure<00:02:56.329> that<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.900> adjustment

side<00:02:57.650> is<00:02:58.129> loosened<00:02:58.670> off<00:02:58.819> so<00:02:59.329> you<00:02:59.390> just<00:02:59.540> take

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
side is loosened off so you just take

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.600 
side is loosened off so you just take
the<00:02:59.810> strap<00:03:00.019> here<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.500> just<00:03:01.220> make<00:03:01.340> sure<00:03:01.370> it's

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
as loose as possible and then we can pop

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.530 
as loose as possible and then we can pop
that<00:03:04.459> one<00:03:04.610> in<00:03:04.730> there<00:03:06.879> once<00:03:07.879> the<00:03:08.030> adjustable

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
that one in there once the adjustable

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.780 
that one in there once the adjustable
side<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:08.930> in<00:03:09.079> just<00:03:09.680> make<00:03:09.920> sure<00:03:10.099> that<00:03:10.670> you

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
side is in just make sure that you

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.610 
side is in just make sure that you
tighten<00:03:11.030> that<00:03:11.299> up<00:03:11.360> like<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:15.230> know<00:03:15.379> that<00:03:15.409> the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
tighten that up like so so know that the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.009 
tighten that up like so so know that the
back<00:03:15.769> pool<00:03:16.040> is<00:03:16.280> in<00:03:16.489> place<00:03:16.909> all<00:03:17.510> we<00:03:17.659> need<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.900> do

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
back pool is in place all we need to do

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.440 
back pool is in place all we need to do
is<00:03:18.230> simply<00:03:18.590> repeat<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.129> process<00:03:19.340> for<00:03:20.180> every

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
is simply repeat the process for every

00:03:20.450 --> 00:04:03.580 
is simply repeat the process for every
riffle<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.109> safe<00:03:21.500> ball

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.900 

so<00:04:04.590> now<00:04:04.740> we're<00:04:05.040> going<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.220> lift<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.520> tent<00:04:05.730> up

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
so now we're going to lift the tent up

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.000 
so now we're going to lift the tent up
into<00:04:06.690> position<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.320> then<00:04:07.710> what<00:04:07.830> we're<00:04:07.920> going

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
into position and then what we're going

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.460 
into position and then what we're going
to<00:04:08.100> do<00:04:08.220> is<00:04:08.430> walk<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:09.030> tent<00:04:09.240> forwards<00:04:09.810> from<00:04:10.230> the

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
to do is walk the tent forwards from the

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:23.810 
to do is walk the tent forwards from the
back<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.310> front

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.740 

and<00:04:24.820> then<00:04:24.940> once<00:04:25.360> you're<00:04:25.510> in<00:04:25.570> this<00:04:25.690> position

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
and then once you're in this position

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.350 
and then once you're in this position
here<00:04:26.470> we<00:04:26.590> just<00:04:26.800> need<00:04:26.919> to<00:04:27.010> pair<00:04:27.250> go<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:28.120> front

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
here we just need to pair go the front

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.420 
here we just need to pair go the front
corners<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:32.650> know<00:04:32.800> that<00:04:32.919> we're<00:04:33.040> pegged<00:04:33.250> over

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
corners so know that we're pegged over

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.460 
corners so know that we're pegged over
the<00:04:33.520> front<00:04:33.729> of<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:33.940> tent<00:04:34.150> it's<00:04:34.900> time<00:04:35.139> to

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470
