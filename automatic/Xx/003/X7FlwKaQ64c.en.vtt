00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.910
 But maybe you already have that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.079
 times seen in it and that it is 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.149
 a cake where you have a few ingredients 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.920
 The microwave is thrown together 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.559

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.710
 werbestar world 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.040
 more 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.080
 Selling 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.310
 a bowl or a cup 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.000
 after holmes' sugar 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.359
 1 1 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.539
 la fat around 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.539
 and 14 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.650
 First, we give two to three tablespoons 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.650
 Flour in the bowl 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:50.240
 then a tablespoon of sugar 1 tablespoon 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:56.390
 cocoa and a little less than all 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.830
 teaspoon baking powder also came from the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.140
 by the way, sweeter than cacau because of that 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.140
 stand taken and an egg 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.340
 then a tablespoon of oil 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.310
 and one to two tablespoons of milk 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.400
 the whole then quite strong around so far 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.400
 a viscous mass from 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.530
 and, of course, do not try that 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.510
 Now forget the hotel and that 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.780
 you take one to two, so to speak 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.480
 tablespoon nutella as much as easy 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.200
 spoon on hands and gives it 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.819
 just below the mass of sweetness 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.180
 want or want more nutella then 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.560
 just makes her more at 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.769
 would all then that is also 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.769
 times 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.239
 we'll try if it's enough 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.590
 you can too sweet instead of 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:34.950
 you can just nutella the sugar 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.950
 or just take it from the powder 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.469
 try on 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.159
 that's what it looks like and you will 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.269
 See it's a pretty viscous one 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:50.269
 but not to the classic should 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.269
 Kaltner 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.180
 this is now in your microwave and 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.340
 at all at most 500 watts with me 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.590
 I think it was only 400 first 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.209
 minute in the micro pose if it too 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.829
 hot it burns eggcakes that is 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.310
 very important that they do not like that 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.310
 make hot 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:23.070
 it then looks easy as it by 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.449
 a minute looks like it was with me 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.039
 then too fluid and that's why I have 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.039
 the whole thing again given a minute 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.540
 I thought the cake was so good because of me 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.090
 I like it when it is nice juicy 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.720
 and so I do not have it always 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.220
 put in 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.990
 Of course you can do that 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.370
 This is what the finished cake looks like 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.040
 I hope you liked the recipe 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.490
 and will he give you feedback applies to me 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.490
 to be happy about
