00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
and as we'll see once we open it up the

and as we'll see once we open it up the
large<00:01:45.750> print<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.380> great<00:01:46.560> for<00:01:46.950> preaching<00:01:47.159> as

well so this is a brown goat skin and
this<00:01:54.030> one<00:01:54.270> rather<00:01:54.570> than<00:01:54.899> being<00:01:55.110> bound<00:01:55.470> by

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
this one rather than being bound by

this one rather than being bound by
Allen<00:01:56.729> which<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.180> New<00:01:57.299> King<00:01:57.479> James<00:01:57.509> Version

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
is this was actually bound by Youngblood

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.149 
is this was actually bound by Youngblood
in<00:02:01.829> Holland<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.899> grain<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.860> goat

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.220 
in Holland and the grain in the goat
skin<00:02:05.520> is

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
skin is

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.200

then the Bibles that I've seen that are
actually<00:02:08.540> bound<00:02:08.720> by<00:02:09.200> Allen<00:02:09.650> if<00:02:09.860> we<00:02:10.610> look<00:02:11.090> at

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
actually bound by Allen if we look at

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.150 
actually bound by Allen if we look at
the<00:02:11.300> New<00:02:11.420> King<00:02:11.660> James<00:02:11.690> again<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.710> can<00:02:12.890> see

the golden ribbons there and we'll go

the golden ribbons there and we'll go

ahead and take a closer look so as you

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.430 
ahead and take a closer look so as you

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
can see you have two embossed lines that

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.170 
can see you have two embossed lines that
run<00:02:48.620> all<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.160> way<00:02:49.190> around<00:02:49.520> the<00:02:49.640> cover<00:02:49.880> there

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.530 
run all the way around the cover there
of<00:02:50.900> course<00:02:51.230> you<00:02:51.410> have<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.980> red<00:02:52.670> under<00:02:53.270> gold

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
of course you have the red under gold

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.350 
of course you have the red under gold
edges<00:02:54.260> which<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.370> can<00:02:55.490> see<00:02:55.670> better<00:02:55.910> when<00:02:56.270> you

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
edges which you can see better when you

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.330

looking art gilt so as we look here at
the<00:03:29.630> cover<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:30.680> can<00:03:30.709> see<00:03:30.860> it's<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.459> leather

the cover you can see it's a leather

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.560

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
goat skin it's not necessarily soft it's

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.090 
goat skin it's not necessarily soft it's
got<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.560> little<00:03:39.890> heft<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.530> but<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.890> just

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
got a little heft to it but it just

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.530 
got a little heft to it but it just
feels<00:03:43.489> really<00:03:43.910> great<00:03:44.090> in<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.330> hand

especially while holding to preach you

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.510 
especially while holding to preach you
can<00:03:47.120> see<00:03:47.330> you've<00:03:47.540> got<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.830> gold<00:03:48.830> gilt<00:03:49.280> line

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
can see you've got the gold gilt line

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.340 
can see you've got the gold gilt line
running<00:03:50.150> all<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.360> way<00:03:50.390> around<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.780> edge<00:03:50.959> and

running all the way around the edge and

running all the way around the edge and
the<00:03:52.190> perimeter<00:03:52.640> is<00:03:52.820> glued<00:03:53.180> rather<00:03:53.510> than

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
the perimeter is glued rather than

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.500 
the perimeter is glued rather than
stitched<00:03:54.200> as<00:03:54.530> I<00:03:54.590> think<00:03:55.130> all<00:03:55.550> Allan<00:03:56.030> bindings

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
stitched as I think all Allan bindings

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.890 
stitched as I think all Allan bindings
are<00:03:56.780> but<00:03:57.620> it<00:03:57.860> is<00:03:58.040> very<00:03:58.310> well<00:03:58.640> executed<00:03:58.850> so<00:03:59.630> even

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
are but it is very well executed so even

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.050 
are but it is very well executed so even
on<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.110> corners<00:04:00.550> they've<00:04:01.550> done<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.760> great<00:04:02.030> job

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
on the corners they've done a great job

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.360 
on the corners they've done a great job
of<00:04:02.330> folding<00:04:02.959> it<00:04:03.140> so<00:04:03.440> it<00:04:03.590> still<00:04:03.830> looks<00:04:04.100> good

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
of folding it so it still looks good

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.670 
of folding it so it still looks good
even<00:04:04.940> though<00:04:05.150> it's<00:04:05.780> glued<00:04:06.140> rather<00:04:06.410> than

even though it's glued rather than

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
that there is a nice large print I

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.569 
that there is a nice large print I
believe<00:04:14.000> it's<00:04:14.209> around<00:04:14.329> a<00:04:14.780> 10<00:04:15.019> and<00:04:15.109> a<00:04:15.200> half<00:04:15.579> size

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
there's no line matching it still looks
