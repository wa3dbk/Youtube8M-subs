floating<00:00:14.250> trapdoor<00:00:14.940> BAM<00:00:15.540> alright<00:00:16.440> this

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.439 
floating trapdoor BAM alright this
little<00:00:16.890> tidbit<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.490> information<00:00:17.789> here<00:00:18.180> was

brought to me by mr. Eddie Rella super
awesome<00:00:21.570> some<00:00:21.840> actually<00:00:22.560> tweeted<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.400> me

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
awesome some actually tweeted it to me

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.150 
awesome some actually tweeted it to me
like<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> month<00:00:24.359> or<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.689> back<00:00:24.840> at<00:00:25.230> first<00:00:25.740> at

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
like a month or so back at first at

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.640 
like a month or so back at first at
first<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.580> was<00:00:26.789> pretty<00:00:27.000> excited<00:00:27.180> because<00:00:28.140> i<00:00:28.439> was

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
first I was pretty excited because i was

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.950 
first I was pretty excited because i was
thinking<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.400> possibilities<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.480> then

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
thinking of the possibilities and then

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.190 
thinking of the possibilities and then
whoa<00:00:31.230> well<00:00:31.790> here<00:00:32.790> my<00:00:32.940> brain<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.170> i

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
whoa well here my brain but then i

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.080 
whoa well here my brain but then i
realized<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.070> wouldn't<00:00:35.340> work<00:00:35.489> exactly<00:00:36.059> i

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
realized that it wouldn't work exactly i

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.700 
realized that it wouldn't work exactly i
was<00:00:36.360> hoping<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.960> would<00:00:37.079> work<00:00:37.260> which<00:00:37.559> is

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
was hoping that it would work which is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.500 
was hoping that it would work which is
why<00:00:37.829> i<00:00:37.860> reverted<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.399> calling<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.059> floating

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
why i reverted to calling it a floating

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.459 
why i reverted to calling it a floating
trapdoor<00:00:40.010> now<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.850> grand<00:00:42.090> scheme<00:00:42.180> of

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
trapdoor now in the grand scheme of

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.660 
trapdoor now in the grand scheme of
pointless<00:00:43.469> tutorials<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:43.980> i<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.190> from<00:00:44.489> time

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
pointless tutorials that i do from time

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.060 
pointless tutorials that i do from time
to<00:00:44.820> time<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.300> might<00:00:45.870> take<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.260> cake<00:00:46.289> maybe

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
to time this might take the cake maybe

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.580 
to time this might take the cake maybe
not<00:00:47.340> maybe<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:48.809> pretty<00:00:49.170> freaking

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
not maybe not but it's pretty freaking

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.939 
not maybe not but it's pretty freaking
close<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.190> bam<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.820> alright<00:00:51.800> what<00:00:52.800> this

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
close so bam to that alright what this

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.560 
close so bam to that alright what this
is<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.460> simple<00:00:53.879> way<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.059> make<00:00:54.329> certain

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
is it's a simple way to make certain

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.139 
is it's a simple way to make certain
things<00:00:54.960> float<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.800> would<00:00:55.980> normally<00:00:56.280> flow<00:00:56.879> in

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
things float that would normally flow in

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.270 
things float that would normally flow in
this<00:00:57.780> case<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.289> example<00:00:58.379> I'm<00:00:58.770> using<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
this case for example I'm using a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.610 
this case for example I'm using a
railroad<00:01:00.210> track<00:01:00.480> or<00:01:00.750> track<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.320> see<00:01:01.469> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
railroad track or track you see that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680 
railroad track or track you see that
even<00:01:01.920> though<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> car<00:01:02.460> passes<00:01:02.969> through<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.329> it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
even though the car passes through it it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.479 
even though the car passes through it it
doesn't<00:01:04.019> doesn't<00:01:04.350> make<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> difference<00:01:04.830> you

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
doesn't doesn't make a difference you

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.070 
doesn't doesn't make a difference you
can<00:01:05.640> accident<00:01:06.090> save<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.540> remains<00:01:06.869> at

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
can accident save and it remains at

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.899 
can accident save and it remains at
first<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:07.590> thinking<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.159> genius<00:01:08.520> I

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
first I was thinking this is genius I

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.390 
first I was thinking this is genius I
make<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> whole<00:01:09.720> rail<00:01:10.020> floating<00:01:10.710> tracks<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.189> no

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
make a whole rail floating tracks but no

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.580 
make a whole rail floating tracks but no
because<00:01:12.119> when<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> setup<00:01:12.869> one

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
because when you do the setup one

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.679 
because when you do the setup one
updates<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.310> next<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.119> doesn't<00:01:15.390> work<00:01:15.509> but

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
updates the next so it doesn't work but

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.080 
updates the next so it doesn't work but
you<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.930> alternate<00:01:16.320> actually<00:01:16.790> like<00:01:17.790> every

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
you can alternate actually like every

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.330 
you can alternate actually like every
other<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.990> don't<00:01:19.770> know<00:01:19.950> maybe<00:01:20.100> for

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
other you know I don't know maybe for

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.030 
other you know I don't know maybe for
the<00:01:20.369> looks<00:01:20.990> who<00:01:21.990> knows<00:01:22.200> who<00:01:22.619> knows<00:01:22.680> you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the looks who knows who knows you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.030 
the looks who knows who knows you
weirdos<00:01:23.460> I'm<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:25.530> can't<00:01:25.740> do<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.979> on

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
weirdos I'm so you can't do it on

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.679 
weirdos I'm so you can't do it on
powered<00:01:26.369> rails<00:01:26.610> because<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.540> some<00:01:27.659> reason

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
powered rails because for some reason

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.510 
powered rails because for some reason
they<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.140> don't<00:01:28.320> work<00:01:28.470> I'm<00:01:28.770> sure<00:01:28.950> either<00:01:29.250> way

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
they just don't work I'm sure either way

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.210 
they just don't work I'm sure either way
would<00:01:29.729> cause<00:01:30.119> an<00:01:30.270> update<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.950> wouldn't

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
would cause an update so it wouldn't

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.560 
would cause an update so it wouldn't
work<00:01:32.310> anyways<00:01:33.560> see<00:01:34.560> doesn't<00:01:35.040> work<00:01:35.329> you<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.450> do

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
work anyways see doesn't work you can do

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.420 
work anyways see doesn't work you can do
it<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.960> normal<00:01:37.439> tracks<00:01:37.710> those<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.070> guys<00:01:38.220> can

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
it with normal tracks those you guys can

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.140 
it with normal tracks those you guys can
tell<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.200> do<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.590> with

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
tell like that you can do it with

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.770 
tell like that you can do it with
carpets<00:01:42.150> carpets<00:01:42.689> maybe<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.560> carpet<00:01:44.100> ceiling

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
that I liked it for is for floating

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.370 
that I liked it for is for floating
trapdoors<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.780> thought<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.200> was<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> cool

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
trapdoors I thought that was a cool

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.929 
trapdoors I thought that was a cool
concept<00:01:58.890> because<00:01:59.399> if<00:01:59.579> you're<00:01:59.700> doing<00:01:59.880> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
concept because if you're doing a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.719 
concept because if you're doing a
trapdoor<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.689> example<00:02:01.280> let's<00:02:02.280> say<00:02:02.490> this

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
trapdoor for example let's say this

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.980 
trapdoor for example let's say this
let's<00:02:03.060> say<00:02:03.149> you're<00:02:03.240> doing<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.479> kitchen<00:02:03.869> or

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
let's say you're doing a kitchen or

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.139 
let's say you're doing a kitchen or
something<00:02:04.020> right<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> trapdoor<00:02:05.610> this

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
something right to do a trapdoor this

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.089 
something right to do a trapdoor this
always<00:02:06.450> has<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.810> there<00:02:07.530> has<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.860> block

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
always has to be there has to be a block

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.480 
always has to be there has to be a block
here<00:02:08.129> block<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.179> not<00:02:09.390> their<00:02:09.629> destination

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
here block is not their destination

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.240 
here block is not their destination
can't<00:02:10.640> just<00:02:10.820> place<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.360> on<00:02:11.810> a<00:02:11.870> just<00:02:12.770> single

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
can't just place it on a just single

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.570 
can't just place it on a just single
block<00:02:13.460> has<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.790> have<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.970> backing<00:02:14.420> block<00:02:14.690> okay

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
block has to have a backing block okay

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.060 
block has to have a backing block okay
so<00:02:16.580> with<00:02:17.480> this<00:02:17.660> setup<00:02:18.020> you're<00:02:18.440> able<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.890> do

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
so with this setup you're able to do

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.970 
so with this setup you're able to do
that<00:02:19.220> you're<00:02:19.640> able<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.910> have<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.180> floating

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
that you're able to have a floating

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.860 
that you're able to have a floating
trapdoor<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.100> sorts<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.060> what<00:02:23.600> we'll<00:02:23.690> do<00:02:23.840> is

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
trapdoor of sorts so what we'll do is

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.830 
trapdoor of sorts so what we'll do is
you<00:02:24.110> still<00:02:24.290> have<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.560> have<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.800> normal<00:02:24.950> setup

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
you still have to have the normal setup

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.940 
you still have to have the normal setup
put<00:02:26.840> your<00:02:26.960> trap<00:02:27.200> door<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:29.090> do<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:29.570> and

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
put your trap door and you do this and

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.390 
put your trap door and you do this and
then<00:02:30.950> there<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.220> go<00:02:31.310> there<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.730> go<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:33.400> around

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
then there you go there you go so around

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.890 
then there you go there you go so around
it<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.790> whatnot<00:02:35.030> doesn't<00:02:35.540> really<00:02:35.660> make<00:02:35.840> a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
it and whatnot doesn't really make a

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.540 
it and whatnot doesn't really make a
difference<00:02:36.170> underneath<00:02:36.740> it<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.070> causes<00:02:37.280> an

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
difference underneath it it causes an

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.010 
difference underneath it it causes an
update<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:38.150> if<00:02:38.210> you<00:02:38.300> wanted<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.630> have<00:02:38.780> like<00:02:38.960> a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
update so if you wanted to have like a

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.530 
update so if you wanted to have like a
little<00:02:39.200> island<00:02:39.970> let's<00:02:40.970> just<00:02:41.030> say<00:02:41.240> that<00:02:41.270> an

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
little island let's just say that an

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.830 
little island let's just say that an
island<00:02:41.750> kind<00:02:42.320> of<00:02:42.580> think<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:43.940> then<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:44.660> do

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
island kind of think to it then you do

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.150 
island kind of think to it then you do
this<00:02:46.390> look<00:02:47.390> look<00:02:47.600> look<00:02:47.900> look<00:02:48.140> uh<00:02:49.690> there<00:02:50.690> there

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
this look look look look uh there there

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.320 
this look look look look uh there there
so<00:02:52.160> now<00:02:52.280> instead<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.610> having<00:02:52.820> some<00:02:53.120> kind<00:02:53.240> of

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
so now instead of having some kind of

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.420 
so now instead of having some kind of
backing<00:02:53.720> for<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:54.410> they<00:02:54.980> could<00:02:55.130> just<00:02:55.160> be

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
backing for this they could just be

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.580 
backing for this they could just be
freestanding<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.750> know<00:02:56.870> for<00:02:57.110> decorating

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
freestanding you know for decorating

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.980 
freestanding you know for decorating
purposes<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.220> what<00:02:58.370> not<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:59.060> if<00:02:59.180> u<00:02:59.330> xn<00:02:59.690> save

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
purposes and what not and if u xn save

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.630 
purposes and what not and if u xn save
it<00:03:00.170> still<00:03:00.410> remains<00:03:00.740> even<00:03:01.040> if<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.250> was<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.460> leave

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
it still remains even if I was to leave

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.570 
it still remains even if I was to leave
this<00:03:01.820> thing<00:03:02.030> free<00:03:02.390> floating<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.100> I<00:03:04.100> accident

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
this thing free floating and I accident

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.330 
this thing free floating and I accident
save<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.000> come<00:03:05.120> back<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:06.620> would<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.190> know

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
save and come back it would you know

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.570 
save and come back it would you know
remain<00:03:08.620> but<00:03:09.620> again<00:03:09.830> just<00:03:09.860> don't<00:03:10.280> cause<00:03:10.430> an

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
remain but again just don't cause an

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.580 
remain but again just don't cause an
update<00:03:10.880> around<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.630> block<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:12.080> Tina<00:03:12.440> would

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
update around the block that Tina would

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.110 
update around the block that Tina would
make<00:03:12.770> the<00:03:12.920> most<00:03:12.950> sense<00:03:13.160> which<00:03:13.460> is<00:03:13.610> all<00:03:13.850> around

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
make the most sense which is all around

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.500 
make the most sense which is all around
it<00:03:14.360> on<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.170> hitboxes<00:03:15.650> here<00:03:16.120> but<00:03:17.120> beyond<00:03:17.360> now

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
it on the hitboxes here but beyond now

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.820 
it on the hitboxes here but beyond now
you're<00:03:17.660> good<00:03:18.220> floating<00:03:19.220> freaking<00:03:19.850> trapdoor

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
you're good floating freaking trapdoor

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.740 
you're good floating freaking trapdoor
well<00:03:21.830> then<00:03:21.950> that<00:03:22.130> is<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.340> tutorial<00:03:23.330> wise<00:03:23.480> I

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
well then that is it tutorial wise I

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.630 
well then that is it tutorial wise I
mean<00:03:23.900> this<00:03:23.990> is<00:03:24.050> it<00:03:24.320> guys<00:03:24.440> this<00:03:24.710> is<00:03:24.830> it<00:03:24.980> it's

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
mean this is it guys this is it it's

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.340 
mean this is it guys this is it it's
like<00:03:25.820> manual<00:03:26.330> pretty<00:03:26.660> much<00:03:26.840> there<00:03:27.140> so<00:03:27.290> you

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
like manual pretty much there so you

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.910 
like manual pretty much there so you
have<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.560> do<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:27.800> torch<00:03:28.280> every<00:03:28.850> single<00:03:29.180> time

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
have to do that torch every single time

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.440 
have to do that torch every single time
something<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.010> put<00:03:31.190> your<00:03:31.310> piston<00:03:31.700> nope<00:03:32.090> not

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
something you put your piston nope not

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.100 
something you put your piston nope not
there<00:03:34.270> of<00:03:35.270> course<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.570> don't<00:03:35.630> need<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.870> put<00:03:35.990> an

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
there of course you don't need to put an

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.660 
there of course you don't need to put an
actual<00:03:36.410> piston<00:03:36.830> first<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.280> that<00:03:37.400> one<00:03:37.520> just

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
actual piston first and that one just

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.790 
actual piston first and that one just
make<00:03:37.850> it<00:03:37.970> there<00:03:38.120> like<00:03:38.420> corazon<00:03:39.050> no<00:03:39.290> diagonal

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
make it there like corazon no diagonal

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.210 
make it there like corazon no diagonal
of<00:03:39.890> that<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:40.340> then<00:03:41.620> pleasure<00:03:42.620> torch<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.160> it

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
of that and then pleasure torch and it

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.730 
of that and then pleasure torch and it
causes<00:03:43.400> that<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:44.540> was<00:03:44.750> like<00:03:44.930> half<00:03:45.200> tick<00:03:45.470> pulse

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
causes that it was like half tick pulse

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.070 
causes that it was like half tick pulse
of<00:03:45.890> one<00:03:46.040> tick<00:03:46.250> pulse<00:03:46.490> pretty<00:03:47.480> freakin<00:03:47.840> fast

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
of one tick pulse pretty freakin fast
