00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:16.029
 of modern life as david broncano 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:16.029
 with david broncano be modern today 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.890
 in modern life 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.260
 thanks for the steel a classical music 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.260
 of anger to go to the swamp 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.580
 with me 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:54.400
 He has more than lord of the cottage 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:56.980
 swamp is noticing the people that we 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.340
 listening to the classic radio takes a 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:04.080
 black cap with a yellow letter that 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.080
 says animal liberation animal 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:18.940
 I did not know that I bought it not store 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.140
 of desire and I was very excited my 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.710
 girlfriend and I are beginning to be 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.790
 animal liberation vegan that is in my 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.110
 town keep doing the liberation 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.810
 animal long when they release the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.000
 heifers release vice but it's not going 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.009
 I understand, I try to do what 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.570
 best possible and me and I consider that the 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.360
 organism is more a political stance 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.710
 that a gastronomic stance does not 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.300
 I really think but it is true that 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.040
 we are starting and we are not yet 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.690
 100% vega no but we are 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.480
 in our illusion my girlfriend has 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.340
 The pagans invented the word pagans 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.520
 unless we are paid number means 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.520
 that not being 100% vegan is being normal 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.030
 is not not try we try 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.620
 reduce to the maximum and my mother is my girlfriend 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.690
 it takes it much better than I soul over 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.030
 travel is more complicated to organize 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.679
 so we try to make it the 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.490
 one hundred percent but yes that always 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:16.410
 moment we are pagans I do not want that 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.410
 It sounds postureo the last time 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.280
 santander 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:31.300
 a steak of people 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.500
 I try but I recognize that still 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.940
 I have cracks in the system 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.080
 you are always in that as well as how 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.970
 this same always you are in that tirade 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.200
 do not enter between what you want to be and what 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.670
 that in practice you are 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.709
 yes but I do not want now that this 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.940
 common sense hipster posture knows that 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.640
 I am that if things are left 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.740
 It makes me very sick I try to keep myself 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.750
 I want to say as whole as possible 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.090
 I mean, I do not know social movements 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.570
 like the grunge the indie of principle 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.310
 from the 90s the hippies the punk and all that 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.550
 people had ideas in their heads though 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.810
 a fashion but to do the fucking 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.960
 hipster have stayed with fashion only 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.150
 with that part and it 's like that facade 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.320
 and I do not want it to be things of these I 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.810
 I try to take flight more seriously 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.580
 possible I tell you I admit that I am not 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.310
 still consistent with myself at one hundred 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.660
 per hundred but yes so we tried 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.660
 I have an ethical system but the other way around 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.640
 clear not anti ethical but good 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.870
 settle for small things I do not 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.730
 I want to do the same thing that Gandhi did or 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.000
 Jesus Christ for it simply seeks 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.320
 do the opposite of what hitler did 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.320
 in a moment of current crisis 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.590
 brought about 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.930
 let's start building from there 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.010
 it will be better but without hurry 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.930
 the person who showed me the way and 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.820
 one is hitler and another and again pau 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.600
 donÃ©s the good way I think that it 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.060
 You can have a life 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.750
 just watching and doing what 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.520
 contrary to what they do, there is a 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.130
 moment when you look back and say no 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.630
 has caused no genocide nor has 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.630
 I've tried and there's cool 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.520
 Song composer 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.590
 imagine that hitler in listening to 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.590
 wagner 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.860
 in the wooden spoons that maybe 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.520
 the holocaust was not the worst 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.520
 has passed 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.409
 of the human being 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.230
 ah 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.460
 Y
