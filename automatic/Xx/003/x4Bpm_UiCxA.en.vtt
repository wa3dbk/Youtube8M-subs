but let's talk about what the choices

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.560 
but let's talk about what the choices
are<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.380> how<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.220> easy<00:00:23.430> way<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.090> do<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.390> as

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
are and how the easy way is to do it as

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.450 
are and how the easy way is to do it as
opposed<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.080> hard<00:00:25.380> way<00:00:25.590> what's<00:00:26.310> the

easiest way to make a printer wireless
the<00:00:28.529> easiest<00:00:29.010> way<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.849> buy<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.480> printer<00:00:31.080> that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
the easiest way is to buy a printer that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.040 
the easiest way is to buy a printer that
is<00:00:31.590> wireless<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.910> already<00:00:33.390> set<00:00:33.660> up<00:00:33.690> by<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
is wireless it's already set up by the

manufacturer with a wireless module in

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.740 
manufacturer with a wireless module in
it<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.960> bring<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.230> home<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.980> plug<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:39.000> you

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
it you bring it home you plug it in you

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.660 
it you bring it home you plug it in you
connects<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.440> your<00:00:40.530> network<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.280> give<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.579> a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
connects to your network you give it a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.660 
connects to your network you give it a
name<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.210> then<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.719> can<00:00:42.870> access<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.040> your

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
name and then you can access it on your

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.389 
name and then you can access it on your
home<00:00:44.940> network<00:00:44.969> from<00:00:45.780> whatever<00:00:46.649> computer<00:00:47.129> is

connected to that home network well

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.200 
connected to that home network well
let's<00:00:49.920> say<00:00:50.100> for<00:00:50.129> example<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
let's say for example you have a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.709 
let's say for example you have a
computer<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.789> it's<00:00:53.789> connected<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.390> your<00:00:54.539> home

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
computer and it's connected to your home

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.270 
computer and it's connected to your home
network<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.559> want<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> connect

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
network and then you want to connect

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.689 
network and then you want to connect
your<00:00:56.370> current<00:00:56.940> printer<00:00:58.100> wireless<00:00:59.100> how<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.489> you

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
your current printer wireless how do you

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.470 
your current printer wireless how do you
do<00:00:59.940> that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
do that

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.799 
do that
well<00:01:01.260> let's<00:01:01.530> think<00:01:01.620> about<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.489> minute

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
well let's think about this for a minute

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.820 
well let's think about this for a minute
here's<00:01:03.809> what<00:01:04.019> you're<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> need<00:01:04.650> in

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
here's what you're going to need in

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.679 
here's what you're going to need in
order<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.309> able<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.880> first<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.570> all

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
order to be able to do that first of all

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.120 
order to be able to do that first of all
you're<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> wireless

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you're going to have to have a wireless

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.700 
you're going to have to have a wireless
router<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.760> order<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.180> broadcast<00:01:09.710> wirelessly

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
router in order to broadcast wirelessly

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.880 
router in order to broadcast wirelessly
inside<00:01:11.220> your<00:01:11.460> house<00:01:11.960> here's<00:01:12.960> an<00:01:13.110> example<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.799> a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
inside your house here's an example of a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.370 
inside your house here's an example of a
wireless<00:01:14.159> router<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.810> probably<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.350> of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
wireless router this is probably one of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.649 
wireless router this is probably one of
the<00:01:16.500> most<00:01:16.680> common<00:01:17.280> routers<00:01:17.700> ever<00:01:17.909> made<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
the most common routers ever made in the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.219 
the most common routers ever made in the
United<00:01:18.990> States<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.650> Linksys<00:01:20.220> model<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
United States it's a Linksys model and

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.050 
United States it's a Linksys model and
when<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.350> plug<00:01:22.710> your<00:01:22.740> computer<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.700> your

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
when you plug your computer and your

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.450 
when you plug your computer and your
printer<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.630> anything<00:01:24.960> else<00:01:25.080> into<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.650> it

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
printer and anything else into this it

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.660 
printer and anything else into this it
will<00:01:26.640> broadcast<00:01:27.140> those<00:01:28.140> devices<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.430> a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
will broadcast those devices on to a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.090 
will broadcast those devices on to a
network<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.600> set<00:01:31.020> yourself<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.680> way

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
network if you set yourself up that way

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.120 
network if you set yourself up that way
so<00:01:32.600> how<00:01:33.600> would<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:33.960> use<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.619> connect<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
so how would we use this to connect a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.719 
so how would we use this to connect a
printer<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:36.530> broadcast<00:01:37.530> wirelessly<00:01:38.250> well

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
printer to broadcast wirelessly well

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.429 
printer to broadcast wirelessly well
here's<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> next<00:01:39.570> step<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.079> think

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
here's the next step you have to think

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.130 
here's the next step you have to think
about<00:01:40.530> your<00:01:41.490> printer<00:01:42.060> has<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.750> able<00:01:42.899> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
about your printer has to be able to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.370 
about your printer has to be able to
connect<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:44.759> back<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.600> wireless<00:01:46.140> router

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
connect to the back of a wireless router

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.310 
connect to the back of a wireless router
and<00:01:46.829> how<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:47.909> do<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.540> do<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.840> by<00:01:49.290> a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
and how do we do that we do that by a

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.380 
and how do we do that we do that by a
cable<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.430> cable<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.970> called<00:01:51.240> an

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
cable and that cable is called an

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.990

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
we're going to plug that into here and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.249 
we're going to plug that into here and
because<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.170> printer<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.829> ready<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:09.239> go<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.479> to

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
because the printer is ready to go on to

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.619 
because the printer is ready to go on to
the<00:02:10.830> network<00:02:11.129> because<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.879> has<00:02:12.209> an<00:02:12.450> Ethernet

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629

become Wireless using this router what's
going<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.320> happen<00:02:19.770> is<00:02:19.890> it's<00:02:20.070> going<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.310> go<00:02:20.490> on

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
going to happen is it's going to go on

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.040 
going to happen is it's going to go on
to<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.910> network<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.450> we're<00:02:21.630> going<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.870> give

to the network and we're going to give

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.990 
to the network and we're going to give
it<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.230> name<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.500> an<00:02:22.770> address<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.550> then<00:02:23.820> you're

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
it a name and an address and then you're

it a name and an address and then you're
going<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.210> be<00:02:24.360> able<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.720> use<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.170> printer

that case your carreer printer is going

that case your carreer printer is going
to<00:02:42.240> be<00:02:42.360> connecting<00:02:42.960> to<00:02:42.990> your<00:02:43.320> computer<00:02:43.530> by<00:02:44.070> a

USB cable most likely could be another

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040

you connect this to operate wirelessly
it's<00:02:53.970> going<00:02:54.210> to<00:02:54.270> be<00:02:54.390> very<00:02:54.570> difficult<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.440> I

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
it's going to be very difficult and I

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.130 
it's going to be very difficult and I
would<00:02:55.830> recommend<00:02:56.430> not<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.240> do<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.720> way

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
would recommend not to do it that way

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.320 
would recommend not to do it that way
but<00:02:58.590> instead<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.130> get<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.310> wireless<00:02:59.610> printer<00:02:59.880> or

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
but instead to get a wireless printer or

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.640 
but instead to get a wireless printer or
a<00:03:00.390> printer<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.320> networked<00:03:02.160> ready
