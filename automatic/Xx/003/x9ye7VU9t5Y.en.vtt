00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.640
 Hahaha 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.310
 for those people who do not know that 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.010
 is the fake is good because it is 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.320
 basically interrupting your own stream 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.800
 in such a way that the enemy does not 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.550
 interrupt and spend your switch and 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.900
 know you can return this 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.480
 punish freely because you know that the 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.220
 use now it complicates us a bit to the 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.960
 time to interrupt our project 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.660
 our own punishment if we are using 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.970
 the talent for example 500 canning and 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.890
 that this although for example you move 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.509
 you're going to keep punishing and that's what 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.000
 normally one does to make baker 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.760
 move now we will use this macro 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.520
 that will allow us to stop the castellÃ³ 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.060
 but using a skill such as fair 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.710
 play that is basically a skill 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.040
 snapshot that we can use when 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.040
 we want 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.649
 one of the sides that I use to 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.009
 keep in view what the 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.960
 switches classes of the enemies is 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.549
 a gift called interrogate what 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.000
 I recommend one hundred percent 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.829
 basically what it does is it's a bar 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.130
 as you can see here is a bar 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.960
 all interrupts all classes 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.909
 entry 13 pellets blog and so on 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.579
 then every time the enemy 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.759
 I interrupt you use your corner you have to 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.710
 appear the skill I use and the cool down 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.989
 for when I'm going to have it again 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.769
 it means that if a guard shoots you 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.970
 football for example and it goes out there you go to 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.410
 forget about you want that she can 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.000
 punish freely because I already use it 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.000
 pretty useful for pf 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.300
 when we talk about macros for focus 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:33.860
 we have an infinite number of macros 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.530
 that we can create with few of them 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.730
 for example very useful in ppp is the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:44.660
 constant command as you can observe 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:49.430
 here says we spent the command in this 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:52.430
 case for example the silence of the pj 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.079
 target focus but they are only going to 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.200
 happen if we press something if not 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:59.269
 we press wrong silence only goes 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.329
 to go to the normal target that means 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.090
 if you have for example rent in focus 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:08.329
 and you have the dps on card you can 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.840
 mute the dps or you can press high 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:15.790
 and silence the giner quite simple and 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.790
 quite useful is pp in arenas 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.010
 remember that this is also applicable 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.800
 for any kind of doing, you can 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.500
 apply it for the cold for water 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.440
 You can apply it to 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.680
 the fair flame for the morocco edu 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.020
 It also helps you for that and whatever 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.110
 whatever is the target 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.510
 you can use this macro and it will serve you 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.400
 perfectly the only thing you have to 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.280
 do is replace where it says as 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.280
 we walk by the name of the corner 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.260
 the macro software mice are pretty 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.510
 tools 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.900
 for example when we need to break 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.180
 totems when we need to want 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.460
 quickly if we have time to change 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.950
 of card or putting final focus on 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:10.569
 mouse over is very very very very useful 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.090
 and more about what it means is 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.819
 basically put the cursor over 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.180
 some component or of some topic or what 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.240
 that is and use the macro and without even 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.240
 have it on copuous cards you will be able to 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.240
 hit him 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.820
 in this case for example we have this 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.840
 mouse macro software by style plane 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:36.380
 that allows you to do with mouse or with 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.180
 this kit to break totems to make 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.970
 hurt another one also without even 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.340
 card it anyway if you want 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.139
 use any other is that either the own 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.180
 of seduction of the options very 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.070
 important the only thing you have to 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.860
 to do is change where it says was the flame 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.860
 put his name 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.430
 good and it's basically a little 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:05.599
 guide what macros are for 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:09.740
 group let's say the key macros that 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:13.400
 they will help both tve and ppp 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.160
 from here you can draw infinities in 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.590
 macro and get to do macro and micro and 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.530
 macro that you're going to run out of fingers 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.180
 because there is not really there are not many 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.229
 many frames that you can yourself 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.970
 create through this faith I hope that you 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.860
 have liked and we will see you then in the 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.860
 next video until next time 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.870
 for me every day secret
