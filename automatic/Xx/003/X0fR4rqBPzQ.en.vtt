a ton of traction and it's pretty wild

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:49.660 
a ton of traction and it's pretty wild

off like no other it's pretty much like

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.460 
off like no other it's pretty much like
you're<00:01:14.240> being<00:01:14.390> on<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.660> dirt<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:15.110> know<00:01:15.200> so

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
you're being on the dirt you know so

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.320 
you're being on the dirt you know so
much<00:01:15.530> traction<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.280> it<00:01:16.430> uh<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:17.030> know<00:01:17.150> you're

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
much traction that it uh you know you're

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.760 
much traction that it uh you know you're
reaching<00:01:17.540> speeds<00:01:17.780> up<00:01:18.080> to<00:01:18.110> 90<00:01:18.410> miles<00:01:18.590> an<00:01:18.680> hour

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
reaching speeds up to 90 miles an hour

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.560 
reaching speeds up to 90 miles an hour
like<00:01:19.040> I<00:01:19.130> said<00:01:19.370> so<00:01:19.520> it's<00:01:19.610> pretty<00:01:19.790> well<00:01:20.060> to<00:01:20.330> think

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
like I said so it's pretty well to think

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.300 
like I said so it's pretty well to think
that<00:01:21.080> you<00:01:21.170> can<00:01:21.260> grab<00:01:21.470> that<00:01:21.650> much<00:01:21.800> traction<00:01:22.070> in

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
that you can grab that much traction in

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.400 
that you can grab that much traction in

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
the launch worth we did that thing

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.700 
the launch worth we did that thing
together<00:01:31.580> in<00:01:31.940> mexico<00:01:32.360> can<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.290> see<00:01:33.500> how<00:01:33.650> the

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
together in mexico can you see how the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.530 
together in mexico can you see how the
DNA<00:01:34.100> connects<00:01:34.640> between<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:35.120> street<00:01:35.330> tires

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
DNA connects between the street tires

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.150 
DNA connects between the street tires
and<00:01:35.870> the<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.170> off-road<00:01:36.680> tires<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:37.040> run

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
and the and the off-road tires you run

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.560 
and the and the off-road tires you run
on<00:01:37.190> all<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.430> time<00:01:37.580> yeah<00:01:38.000> definitely<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.480> know

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
on all the time yeah definitely you know

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.090 
on all the time yeah definitely you know
when<00:01:38.720> we<00:01:38.840> did<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.020> deal<00:01:39.350> with<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.620> KO<00:01:39.800> too<00:01:39.950> I

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
when we did that deal with the KO too I

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.760 
when we did that deal with the KO too I
mean<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:41.240> durability<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.900> traction<00:01:42.440> whether

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
mean the durability the traction whether

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.950 
mean the durability the traction whether
it's<00:01:42.950> in<00:01:43.100> rainy<00:01:43.730> conditions<00:01:44.000> whether<00:01:44.659> it's<00:01:44.840> in

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
it's in rainy conditions whether it's in

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.830 
it's in rainy conditions whether it's in
dry<00:01:45.200> slippery<00:01:46.130> any<00:01:46.310> is<00:01:46.580> it<00:01:46.940> had<00:01:47.150> a<00:01:47.180> ton<00:01:47.480> of<00:01:47.510> grip
