00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.419 
as you can see here we can do with the
tele<00:01:55.030> poles<00:01:55.299> we<00:01:55.450> could<00:01:55.600> stick<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.079> camera

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
tele poles we could stick the camera

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.410 
tele poles we could stick the camera
platform<00:01:57.429> straight<00:01:57.909> onto<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.090> top<00:01:58.270> of<00:01:58.299> that

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
platform straight onto the top of that

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.580 
platform straight onto the top of that
that<00:01:59.259> now<00:01:59.439> gives<00:01:59.619> us<00:01:59.859> a<00:02:00.159> lot<00:02:00.819> more<00:02:00.969> height

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
that now gives us a lot more height

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.599 
that now gives us a lot more height
here's<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.709> three<00:02:02.889> difference<00:02:03.219> of<00:02:03.369> heights

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
here's the three difference of heights

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:05.069 
here's the three difference of heights
you<00:02:03.759> can<00:02:03.880> get<00:02:04.119> out<00:02:04.299> of<00:02:04.329> using<00:02:04.689> all<00:02:04.929> three

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
you can get out of using all three

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.150 
you can get out of using all three
options<00:02:05.499> so<00:02:05.619> you've<00:02:05.740> got<00:02:05.889> you<00:02:06.039> burn<00:02:06.579> 150

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
options so you've got you burn 150

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.700 
options so you've got you burn 150
you<00:02:08.370> let<00:02:08.520> your<00:02:08.610> vim<00:02:08.820> 600<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:10.350> then<00:02:10.470> we've<00:02:10.590> got

you let your vim 600 and then we've got
the<00:02:10.830> tele<00:02:11.040> pol<00:02:11.480> another<00:02:12.480> significant<00:02:13.080> change

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
the tele pol another significant change

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.560 
the tele pol another significant change
is<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.770> platform<00:02:14.220> that's<00:02:14.940> now<00:02:15.150> made<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.540> a
