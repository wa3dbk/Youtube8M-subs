00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.710 
eat so for example they'll start
recognizing<00:02:04.160> you<00:02:04.610> know<00:02:04.729> when<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.000> come<00:02:05.330> when<00:02:05.660> I

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
recognizing you know when I come when I

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.690 
recognizing you know when I come when I
come<00:02:05.899> home<00:02:06.080> you'll<00:02:06.410> recognize<00:02:06.890> places<00:02:07.580> that

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
come home you'll recognize places that

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.070 
come home you'll recognize places that
you<00:02:07.820> are<00:02:08.000> from<00:02:08.209> certain<00:02:08.479> hours<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.840> day

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
you are from certain hours of the day

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.110 
you are from certain hours of the day
for<00:02:09.560> example<00:02:10.100> you<00:02:10.190> know<00:02:10.250> typically<00:02:10.670> nighttime

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
for example you know typically nighttime

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.640 
for example you know typically nighttime
hours<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.660> oh<00:02:11.810> this<00:02:11.989> must<00:02:12.200> be<00:02:12.350> here<00:02:12.500> probably

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
hours that oh this must be here probably

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.280 
hours that oh this must be here probably
so<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.610> know<00:02:13.670> what<00:02:14.150> can<00:02:14.300> we<00:02:14.360> do<00:02:14.510> can<00:02:15.020> we<00:02:15.080> set

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
so you know what can we do can we set

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.240 
so you know what can we do can we set
the<00:02:15.440> ringer<00:02:15.680> volume<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:18.650> we<00:02:18.770> have<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.920> bunch<00:02:19.160> of

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
the ringer volume so we have a bunch of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.910 
the ringer volume so we have a bunch of
samples<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:20.150> already<00:02:20.360> pre-loaded<00:02:20.920> users

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
samples that already pre-loaded users

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.280 
samples that already pre-loaded users
also<00:02:22.100> able<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:22.640> go<00:02:22.910> ahead<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.630> create<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.959> rule

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
also able to go ahead and create a rule

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.400 
also able to go ahead and create a rule
from<00:02:24.560> scratch<00:02:24.920> or<00:02:25.220> whatever<00:02:25.489> they<00:02:25.610> were<00:02:26.320> so<00:02:27.320> we

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
from scratch or whatever they were so we

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.600 
from scratch or whatever they were so we
have<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.560> whole<00:02:27.739> bunch<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:28.010> different<00:02:28.070> triggers

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
have a whole bunch of different triggers

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.310 
have a whole bunch of different triggers
which<00:02:28.940> will<00:02:29.180> actually<00:02:29.420> trigger<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.050> smart

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
which will actually trigger the smart

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.240 
which will actually trigger the smart
action<00:02:30.680> as<00:02:31.310> well<00:02:31.580> as<00:02:31.870> bunch<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:33.019> actions<00:02:33.920> which

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
action as well as bunch of actions which

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.370 
action as well as bunch of actions which
respond<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.850> triggers<00:02:35.230> there<00:02:36.230> also

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
respond to the triggers there also

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.590 
respond to the triggers there also
they're<00:02:36.769> all<00:02:36.890> customizable<00:02:37.430> simply<00:02:38.239> on/off
