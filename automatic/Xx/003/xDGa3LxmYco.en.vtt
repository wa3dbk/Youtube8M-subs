00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.890
 hi hello youtube friends greetings to 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.230
 everyone and welcome to a new video 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.810
 tutorial this is about about a 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.540
 response to several user queries 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.669
 maybe you know to do it 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.100
 but these users who have commented to me 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.410
 on various occasions that they have 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.840
 a problem about how we know the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.670
 whatsapp as we know the whatsapp what 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.879
 does it automatically is once what 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.890
 you install he acquires automatically 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.230
 all all all auto phones 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.199
 the deliberate of directions the catch 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.720
 all that all those users who have 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.640
 guasave installed but it shows to you but 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.850
 sometimes and if you want to know that, 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.320
 he wants you do not even want to 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.720
 write him or anything or if you do not 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.460
 annoying because also as how one has 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.500
 passed with the hotmail messenger that 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.420
 they sent us chain mail that did not 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.549
 they do not help matters and issues 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.290
 that are not good for anything that you do not 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.510
 they interest nothing or if you are 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.150
 bothering by writing this thing that does not 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.340
 you are not really interested then if 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.630
 you prefer them if there are any 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.270
 solution because they have asked if there 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.100
 some solution to remove it or block 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.490
 if there is at least in the latter 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.009
 whatsapp version if there is I do not know the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.570
 previous version but on whatsapp 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.420
 we know that the whatsapp is also is 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.850
 famous serves is compatible for all the 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.520
 platform so it also serves for the 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.950
 iphone is for blackberry but 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.229
 surely the configuration comes 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.750
 being a little bit more different but it's 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.490
 that trick or that solution is variety 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.549
 for all platforms 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.590
 the mobile system platform for nothing 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.960
 Well simply yes to block them 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.659
 there was once once I block it 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.430
 although he sends you messages they are not going to 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.289
 to arrive nor do you go because there 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.329
 raised in blocking is no longer going to send 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.250
 and messages will always arrive 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.280
 When you search, the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.410
 last time before blocking the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.620
 last time you were connected or 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.810
 available before the blocking process 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.660
 well simply very easy simply 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.750
 that's how I have access to 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.430
 guasave on side on a screen of this 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.410
 android, you just go like no 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.910
 I have game if not, well, we're just going 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.489
 the menu applications within 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.019
 the downloaded applications then 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.440
 we click on them but in this 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.069
 case I have it already on the desk in 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.859
 a main screen 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.670
 we click on the application and we 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:53.299
 is going to show the contacts and we 're going to 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.650
 go to the contact that we want to block that 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:59.340
 something that we want to block 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.230
 and for example I'm going to put here a 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.069
 example as if we are going to write to a 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.999
 message and click on menu 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:12.209
 inside I look more and will prick us 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:15.299
 to know block simply we puncture 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.159
 in block says sure you want 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:22.830
 block this contact as you tell him 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:24.819
 ok her contact blocked 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.319
 definitely 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.019
 now when you squeeze 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.150
 you're not going to get there you see as you've already 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.790
 deactivated the others are activated 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.849
 as you can see and this is disabled 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.389
 the one that blocks is one way to another 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.889
 color as it was already off 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:46.079
 off you can already write you can 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:49.290
 make hard that the gala of the will not you 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.299
 No message will arrive from 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.510
 now the victorial is very simple 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.099
 I hope you solved the problem or the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.530
 concern of these users who have 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.419
 written how to block the contacts that 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.269
 they do not want to talk to them in the 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:06.569
 whatsapp any reason whatsoever they will do 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.799
 some your reasons will have they go to
