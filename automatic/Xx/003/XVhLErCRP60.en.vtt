00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
in my late teens and out of this whole

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.020 
in my late teens and out of this whole
journey<00:01:09.799> started<00:01:10.700> that<00:01:11.479> with<00:01:11.659> in<00:01:12.049> my<00:01:12.499> early

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
journey started that with in my early

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.709 
journey started that with in my early
30s<00:01:14.030> I<00:01:14.389> was<00:01:14.719> able<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.590> let<00:01:16.219> go<00:01:16.249> of<00:01:16.700> my<00:01:16.909> glasses

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
30s I was able to let go of my glasses

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.580 
30s I was able to let go of my glasses
forever<00:01:18.469> it<00:01:19.399> took<00:01:19.579> me<00:01:19.670> about<00:01:19.819> 1/2<00:01:20.420> years<00:01:20.929> until

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
forever it took me about 1/2 years until

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.699 
forever it took me about 1/2 years until
I<00:01:21.859> didn't<00:01:22.219> need<00:01:22.340> any<00:01:22.520> glasses<00:01:22.759> anymore<00:01:23.709> so

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709 
I didn't need any glasses anymore so

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.090 
I didn't need any glasses anymore so
nowadays<00:01:24.979> I<00:01:25.490> developed<00:01:26.209> a<00:01:26.299> whole<00:01:26.829> method<00:01:27.829> of

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
nowadays I developed a whole method of

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.149 
nowadays I developed a whole method of
how<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:28.819> improve<00:01:29.389> not<00:01:29.869> only<00:01:29.899> eyesight<00:01:30.799> but

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
how to improve not only eyesight but

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.910 
how to improve not only eyesight but
brain<00:01:31.999> function<00:01:32.569> because<00:01:32.869> it's<00:01:33.409> not<00:01:33.679> the<00:01:33.889> eye

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
brain function because it's not the eye

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.669 
brain function because it's not the eye
which<00:01:34.399> says<00:01:34.759> it's<00:01:35.420> actually<00:01:35.929> the<00:01:36.049> brain<00:01:36.380> all

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
which says it's actually the brain all

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.580 
which says it's actually the brain all
the<00:01:36.740> way<00:01:37.159> back<00:01:37.549> like<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.389> backbone<00:01:39.109> of<00:01:39.139> the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
the way back like the backbone of the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.139 
the way back like the backbone of the
brain<00:01:39.859> which<00:01:40.609> sees<00:01:40.939> and<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:42.619> I<00:01:42.950> helped<00:01:43.249> many

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
brain which sees and so I helped many

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.940 
brain which sees and so I helped many
many<00:01:44.359> people<00:01:44.749> around<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.139> world<00:01:45.469> to<00:01:46.310> undo<00:01:46.759> the

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
many people around the world to undo the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.859 
many people around the world to undo the
vision<00:01:48.950> symptoms

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
vision symptoms

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.730 
vision symptoms
apart<00:01:51.709> from<00:01:52.039> undoing<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:53.029> brain<00:01:53.359> eye

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
apart from undoing the brain eye

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.379 
apart from undoing the brain eye
symptoms<00:01:54.740> I<00:01:55.009> discovered<00:01:55.849> that<00:01:55.969> the<00:01:56.119> whole

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
symptoms I discovered that the whole

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:59.050 
symptoms I discovered that the whole
physical<00:01:56.719> body<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:57.590> connected<00:01:58.429> with<00:01:58.789> us<00:01:58.909> as

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
physical body is connected with us as

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.929 
physical body is connected with us as
well<00:01:59.299> so<00:01:59.329> in<00:01:59.719> nowadays<00:02:00.020> it's<00:02:00.770> an<00:02:01.009> integration

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
well so in nowadays it's an integration

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.019 
well so in nowadays it's an integration
of<00:02:02.090> brain<00:02:02.899> iron<00:02:03.469> body<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:04.130> applying<00:02:04.549> it<00:02:04.819> to

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:05.029 
of brain iron body and applying it to

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:09.330 
of brain iron body and applying it to
our<00:02:05.719> everyday<00:02:06.049> living

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.150 

in<00:02:09.550> glasses<00:02:10.209> quite<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:10.959> lot<00:02:11.230> of<00:02:11.379> the<00:02:11.500> time<00:02:11.739> I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
in glasses quite a lot of the time I

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.940 
in glasses quite a lot of the time I
needed<00:02:12.879> them<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.420> drive<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:14.379> needed<00:02:14.739> them<00:02:14.920> to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
needed them to drive I needed them to

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.290 
needed them to drive I needed them to
watch<00:02:15.430> TV<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:16.980> needed<00:02:17.980> them<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.610> see<00:02:18.970> anything

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
watch TV I needed them to see anything

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.559 
watch TV I needed them to see anything
in<00:02:19.599> the<00:02:19.750> distance<00:02:20.170> clearly<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:22.209> I<00:02:22.330> heard

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
in the distance clearly and I heard

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.250 
in the distance clearly and I heard
about<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:22.870> work<00:02:23.410> that<00:02:24.840> offered<00:02:25.840> me<00:02:26.080> the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
about this work that offered me the

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.339 
about this work that offered me the
possibility<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.040> seeing<00:02:27.549> more<00:02:27.879> clearly

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
possibility of seeing more clearly

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.220 
possibility of seeing more clearly
without<00:02:29.349> glasses<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:31.690> thought<00:02:31.930> I'd<00:02:32.080> give<00:02:32.200> it

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
without glasses so I thought I'd give it

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.670 
without glasses so I thought I'd give it
a<00:02:32.379> try

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
a try

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.199 
a try
and<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:35.290> has<00:02:35.440> proved<00:02:35.799> quite<00:02:36.610> extraordinarily

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
and it has proved quite extraordinarily

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.460 
and it has proved quite extraordinarily
effective<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:39.250> now<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:40.090> very<00:02:40.810> rarely<00:02:40.930> wear

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
effective so now I very rarely wear

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:49.080 
effective so now I very rarely wear
glasses<00:02:44.220> but<00:02:45.220> also<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:47.370> would<00:02:48.370> say<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.880> there

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.930
