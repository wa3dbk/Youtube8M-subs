it out my hair was crazy soft crazy sob
felt<00:04:37.210> like<00:04:37.360> it<00:04:37.570> had<00:04:37.600> really<00:04:37.900> gotten

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
felt like it had really gotten

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.140 
felt like it had really gotten
moisturize<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:38.919> even<00:04:39.520> though<00:04:39.639> it<00:04:39.790> has<00:04:39.940> that

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
moisturize and even though it has that

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.240 
moisturize and even though it has that
wheat<00:04:40.389> protein<00:04:40.900> in<00:04:41.020> it<00:04:41.139> like<00:04:41.590> it<00:04:41.860> did<00:04:42.130> an

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
wheat protein in it like it did an

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.250 
wheat protein in it like it did an
awesome<00:04:42.400> job<00:04:42.639> it<00:04:43.090> didn't<00:04:43.570> feel<00:04:43.630> like<00:04:43.870> those

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
awesome job it didn't feel like those

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.560 
awesome job it didn't feel like those
typical<00:04:44.740> protein<00:04:45.310> treatments<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.419> is

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
typical protein treatments and it is

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.689 
typical protein treatments and it is
pretty<00:04:46.930> far<00:04:47.229> down<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.710> list<00:04:47.949> of<00:04:48.250> ingredients

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
pretty far down the list of ingredients

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.930 
pretty far down the list of ingredients
so<00:04:49.690> if<00:04:50.139> your<00:04:50.500> protein<00:04:50.949> sensitive<00:04:51.490> this<00:04:51.760> might

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
so if your protein sensitive this might

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.760 
so if your protein sensitive this might
be<00:04:51.970> a<00:04:52.419> good<00:04:52.600> choice<00:04:52.810> for<00:04:52.870> you<00:04:53.110> because<00:04:53.440> again<00:04:53.740> I

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
why I have my pad right here I wanted to

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.800 
why I have my pad right here I wanted to
tell<00:05:09.160> you<00:05:09.220> how<00:05:09.400> much<00:05:09.520> it<00:05:09.580> was<00:05:09.910> in<00:05:10.210> case<00:05:10.660> you

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
tell you how much it was in case you

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.950 
tell you how much it was in case you
wanted<00:05:11.020> to<00:05:11.139> check<00:05:11.440> them<00:05:11.620> out<00:05:12.030> but<00:05:13.030> it's<00:05:13.630> not<00:05:13.840> on

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
wanted to check them out but it's not on

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.990 
wanted to check them out but it's not on
their<00:05:14.080> website<00:05:14.440> right<00:05:14.590> now<00:05:14.650> and<00:05:15.039> I<00:05:15.970> think

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
their website right now and I think

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.730 
their website right now and I think
maybe<00:05:16.510> they're<00:05:16.780> just<00:05:16.870> out<00:05:17.050> of<00:05:17.169> stock<00:05:17.440> I<00:05:17.650> know

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
maybe they're just out of stock I know

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.460 
maybe they're just out of stock I know
that<00:05:17.949> they<00:05:18.550> usually<00:05:18.910> carry<00:05:19.479> it<00:05:19.690> but<00:05:20.260> I<00:05:20.320> think

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
that they usually carry it but I think

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.020 
that they usually carry it but I think
they're<00:05:20.800> just<00:05:20.830> out<00:05:21.070> of<00:05:21.190> stock<00:05:21.400> maybe<00:05:21.699> because

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
they're just out of stock maybe because

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.550 
they're just out of stock maybe because
I<00:05:22.120> know<00:05:22.180> he's<00:05:22.449> done<00:05:22.600> a<00:05:22.630> few<00:05:22.870> different<00:05:23.080> events

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
I know he's done a few different events

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.430 
I know he's done a few different events
lately<00:05:24.070> and<00:05:24.570> so<00:05:25.570> he's<00:05:25.750> probably<00:05:25.930> just<00:05:26.169> out<00:05:26.320> of

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
lately and so he's probably just out of

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.260 
lately and so he's probably just out of
stock<00:05:26.620> it'll<00:05:26.830> probably<00:05:26.979> be<00:05:27.160> back<00:05:27.280> soon<00:05:27.550> anyway

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
stock it'll probably be back soon anyway

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.210 
stock it'll probably be back soon anyway
