that late game that was really cool just

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.130 
that late game that was really cool just
any<00:00:27.710> aspect<00:00:28.369> of<00:00:28.460> pros<00:00:28.939> pros<00:00:29.330> were<00:00:29.810> they<00:00:30.019> all

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
any aspect of pros pros were they all

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.890 
any aspect of pros pros were they all
floating<00:00:30.619> about<00:00:30.890> 40<00:00:31.429> to<00:00:31.550> 45<00:00:31.759> probes<00:00:32.240> yeah

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
floating about 40 to 45 probes yeah

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.799 
floating about 40 to 45 probes yeah
that's<00:00:33.740> apparently<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.370> lucky<00:00:34.670> number<00:00:34.809> yeah

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
that's apparently the lucky number yeah

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.150 
that's apparently the lucky number yeah
once<00:00:36.050> you<00:00:36.110> have<00:00:36.289> more<00:00:36.500> than<00:00:36.590> that<00:00:36.739> your<00:00:36.950> army

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
once you have more than that your army

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.060 
once you have more than that your army
becomes<00:00:37.430> weaker<00:00:37.760> mm-hmm<00:00:38.829> even<00:00:39.829> staying

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
becomes weaker mm-hmm even staying

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.299 
becomes weaker mm-hmm even staying
around<00:00:40.190> that<00:00:40.489> for<00:00:40.760> a<00:00:40.789> lot<00:00:41.030> of<00:00:41.090> of<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.649> mid-game

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
around that for a lot of of the mid-game

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.549 
around that for a lot of of the mid-game
there<00:00:43.579> if<00:00:44.480> you<00:00:44.629> make<00:00:44.780> more<00:00:44.960> probes<00:00:45.260> on<00:00:45.410> that

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
there if you make more probes on that

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.860 
there if you make more probes on that
you<00:00:45.770> lose<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.219> fight<00:00:46.420> overwhelmingly<00:00:47.420> he

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
you lose the fight overwhelmingly he

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.029 
you lose the fight overwhelmingly he
doesn't<00:00:48.109> matter<00:00:48.230> how<00:00:48.379> much<00:00:48.530> bank<00:00:48.770> you<00:00:48.890> have

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
doesn't matter how much bank you have

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.170 
doesn't matter how much bank you have
from<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.309> extra<00:00:49.550> probes<00:00:49.820> you're<00:00:50.000> gonna<00:00:50.090> lose

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
from the extra probes you're gonna lose

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.760 
from the extra probes you're gonna lose
game<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.539> he's<00:00:50.629> gonna<00:00:50.690> cannon<00:00:51.079> rush<00:00:51.260> oh<00:00:51.500> my

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770

god<00:00:52.000> this<00:00:53.000> is<00:00:53.059> a<00:00:53.149> great<00:00:53.329> map<00:00:53.480> partying<00:00:54.190> most

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
god this is a great map partying most

god this is a great map partying most
likely<00:00:55.579> gonna<00:00:55.699> make<00:00:56.300> it<00:00:56.480> on<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.870> low<00:00:57.050> ground

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
likely gonna make it on the low ground

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.959 
likely gonna make it on the low ground
here<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.890> net<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:58.519> know<00:00:58.609> what's<00:00:58.760> funny

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
here to the net you know what's funny

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.549 
here to the net you know what's funny
about<00:00:59.059> this<00:00:59.359> I<00:00:59.570> bet<00:00:59.780> out<00:00:59.899> of<00:01:00.019> all<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:00.199> practice

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
about this I bet out of all the practice

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.229 
about this I bet out of all the practice
games<00:01:00.739> these<00:01:00.920> guys<00:01:01.100> have<00:01:01.340> together<00:01:01.519> the

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
games these guys have together the

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.459 
games these guys have together the
cannon<00:01:02.570> rush<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:02.840> probably<00:01:03.079> the<00:01:03.170> one<00:01:03.289> they<00:01:03.410> do

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
cannon rush is probably the one they do

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.350 
cannon rush is probably the one they do
the<00:01:03.620> least<00:01:03.739> against<00:01:04.070> each<00:01:04.220> other<00:01:04.430> why<00:01:05.210> would

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
the least against each other why would

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.820 
the least against each other why would
they<00:01:05.449> waste<00:01:05.630> their<00:01:05.780> time<00:01:05.900> right<00:01:06.380> i<00:01:06.439> mean<00:01:06.619> they

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
they waste their time right i mean they

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.210 
they waste their time right i mean they
probably<00:01:07.130> both<00:01:08.090> would<00:01:08.390> prefer<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:08.750> just<00:01:08.810> have

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
probably both would prefer to just have

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.399 
probably both would prefer to just have
you<00:01:10.220> know<00:01:10.250> i<00:01:10.360> practice<00:01:11.360> again<00:01:11.630> these<00:01:12.200> are<00:01:12.350> the

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
you know i practice again these are the

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.630 
you know i practice again these are the
two<00:01:12.590> best<00:01:12.770> Protoss<00:01:13.159> is<00:01:13.340> in<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.490> world

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
two best Protoss is in the world

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.880 
two best Protoss is in the world
basically<00:01:13.930> they<00:01:14.930> would<00:01:15.049> probably<00:01:15.350> prefer<00:01:15.530> to

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
basically they would probably prefer to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.600 
basically they would probably prefer to
just<00:01:15.950> have<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:17.810> know<00:01:18.280> practice<00:01:19.280> against<00:01:19.490> each

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
just have you know practice against each

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.340 
just have you know practice against each
other's<00:01:19.850> standard<00:01:20.240> place<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:20.630> let's<00:01:20.840> see<00:01:21.079> if

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
other's standard place so let's see if

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.039 
other's standard place so let's see if
parting<00:01:21.979> can<00:01:22.130> catch<00:01:22.369> rain<00:01:22.790> off<00:01:23.090> guard<00:01:23.450> listen

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
parting can catch rain off guard listen

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:24.880 
parting can catch rain off guard listen
to<00:01:24.110> make<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.290> first<00:01:24.470> count<00:01:24.619> on<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.799> low

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
to make the first count on the low

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.380 
to make the first count on the low
ground<00:01:25.070> because<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.430> can<00:01:25.579> spot<00:01:25.850> or<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.299> can

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
ground because I can spot or that can

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.450 
ground because I can spot or that can
fire<00:01:26.869> up<00:01:27.110> words<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.650> then<00:01:28.100> he<00:01:28.159> can<00:01:28.280> protect

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
fire up words and then he can protect

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.609 
fire up words and then he can protect
the<00:01:28.759> second<00:01:29.119> cannon<00:01:29.329> and<00:01:29.570> rain<00:01:30.320> is<00:01:30.439> not

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
the second cannon and rain is not

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.440 
the second cannon and rain is not
scattered<00:01:31.130> for<00:01:31.280> this

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450

I like party's chances here this is a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.060 
I like party's chances here this is a
great<00:01:35.840> map<00:01:36.020> for<00:01:36.229> this<00:01:36.350> build<00:01:36.560> if<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:36.829> do<00:01:36.979> not

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
great map for this build if you do not

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.639 
great map for this build if you do not
see<00:01:37.310> this<00:01:37.460> often<00:01:37.640> times<00:01:37.880> it's<00:01:38.030> an<00:01:38.090> auto<00:01:38.270> loss

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
see this often times it's an auto loss

the first one Logan will protect the

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.719 
the first one Logan will protect the
ones<00:01:51.470> on<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.619> high<00:01:51.740> ground<00:01:51.770> which<00:01:52.399> are<00:01:52.520> also

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
ones on the high ground which are also

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.330 
ones on the high ground which are also
now<00:01:53.090> in<00:01:53.270> range<00:01:53.569> of<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.840> Nexus<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:54.380> basically

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
now in range of the Nexus so basically

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.130 
now in range of the Nexus so basically
rain<00:01:55.549> has<00:01:55.789> to<00:01:56.000> mine<00:01:56.179> for<00:01:56.210> normals<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:56.869> get<00:01:56.990> out

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
rain has to mine for normals and get out

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.779 
rain has to mine for normals and get out
of<00:01:57.289> here<00:01:57.319> that's<00:01:57.799> probably<00:01:58.369> what<00:01:58.549> he's<00:01:58.640> going

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
of here that's probably what he's going

to contest this right and parties even
blocking<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.439> Nexus<00:02:03.710> location<00:02:04.100> right<00:02:04.219> now

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
blocking the Nexus location right now

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.730

them take the Nexus what you gonna do
take<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.290> third<00:02:18.470> base<00:02:18.620> instead<00:02:18.980> looks<00:02:19.760> like

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
take the third base instead looks like

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.250 
take the third base instead looks like
that's<00:02:20.000> not<00:02:20.209> this<00:02:20.480> actually<00:02:20.900> looks<00:02:20.989> like<00:02:21.140> what

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
the third Nexus location which is so far

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.350 
the third Nexus location which is so far
away<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:27.489> running<00:02:28.489> transitioning<00:02:29.150> at<00:02:29.239> home

pretty<00:03:19.510> far<00:03:19.690> behind<00:03:19.840> like<00:03:20.770> his<00:03:20.890> work<00:03:21.040> dear

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
pretty far behind like his work dear

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.240 
pretty far behind like his work dear
researches<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.760> is<00:03:22.120> say<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:23.320> is<00:03:23.530> 20<00:03:23.950> probes

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
researches that is say it is 20 probes

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.760 
researches that is say it is 20 probes
verse<00:03:24.490> 20<00:03:24.760> probes<00:03:25.030> here<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:26.380> going<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.590> trade

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
verse 20 probes here it's going to trade

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.310 
verse 20 probes here it's going to trade
all<00:03:26.920> of<00:03:26.950> his<00:03:27.130> gas<00:03:27.310> for<00:03:27.580> minerals<00:03:27.850> here<00:03:28.320> not

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
all of his gas for minerals here not

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.170 
all of his gas for minerals here not
even<00:03:29.380> sure<00:03:29.500> if<00:03:29.740> I<00:03:29.860> agree<00:03:29.890> with<00:03:30.310> that<00:03:30.430> but<00:03:30.790> you

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
even sure if I agree with that but you

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.000 
even sure if I agree with that but you
know<00:03:31.320> yeah<00:03:32.320> I'm<00:03:32.470> wondering<00:03:32.710> about<00:03:32.770> that<00:03:32.890> too

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
know yeah I'm wondering about that too

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.320 
know yeah I'm wondering about that too
he<00:03:33.220> doesn't<00:03:33.430> have<00:03:33.520> any<00:03:33.610> gas<00:03:33.760> is<00:03:34.000> made<00:03:34.150> of<00:03:34.270> this

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
he doesn't have any gas is made of this

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.030 
he doesn't have any gas is made of this
expansion<00:03:34.750> yet<00:03:35.020> so<00:03:35.260> any<00:03:35.440> minerals<00:03:35.800> he<00:03:35.890> does

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
expansion yet so any minerals he does

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.910 
expansion yet so any minerals he does
mine<00:03:36.750> yeah<00:03:37.750> I<00:03:37.780> mean<00:03:37.870> for<00:03:38.320> those<00:03:38.590> guys<00:03:38.740> don't

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
mine yeah I mean for those guys don't

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.770 
mine yeah I mean for those guys don't
over<00:03:39.130> talking<00:03:39.340> about<00:03:39.460> if<00:03:39.550> you<00:03:39.640> hold<00:03:39.910> gas<00:03:40.390> the

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
over talking about if you hold gas the

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.970 
over talking about if you hold gas the
mine<00:03:40.990> minerals<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.410> will<00:03:41.530> just<00:03:41.620> replace<00:03:41.860> the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
mine minerals it will just replace the

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.970 
mine minerals it will just replace the
gas<00:03:42.280> your<00:03:42.760> protocol<00:03:43.120> hand<00:03:43.390> there<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:44.650> he<00:03:44.710> loses

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
gas your protocol hand there so he loses

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.800 
gas your protocol hand there so he loses
all<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.250> gas<00:03:45.400> that<00:03:45.580> he<00:03:45.670> had<00:03:45.790> mind<00:03:46.090> up<00:03:46.360> before

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
all the gas that he had mind up before

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.520 
all the gas that he had mind up before
this<00:03:48.420> what<00:03:49.420> this<00:03:49.510> parting<00:03:49.870> got<00:03:50.020> planned<00:03:50.320> here

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
this what this parting got planned here

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.350 
this what this parting got planned here
is<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.680> followed<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.280> got<00:03:51.520> to<00:03:51.610> realize<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:51.910> is

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
is a followed it got to realize that is

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.300 
is a followed it got to realize that is
working<00:03:52.720> take<00:03:53.110> his<00:03:53.290> behind<00:03:53.680> his<00:03:53.950> opponents

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
working take his behind his opponents

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.010 
working take his behind his opponents
missed<00:03:54.550> a<00:03:54.640> lot<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:54.880> mining<00:03:55.150> time<00:03:55.330> though<00:03:55.540> well

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
missed a lot of mining time though well

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.470 
missed a lot of mining time though well
you<00:03:56.200> know<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:56.320> think<00:03:56.440> because<00:03:57.030> rain<00:03:58.030> has<00:03:58.270> to

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
you know I think because rain has to

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.950 
you know I think because rain has to
remake<00:03:58.810> his<00:03:59.020> gases<00:03:59.700> it's<00:04:00.720> totally<00:04:01.720> possible

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
remake his gases it's totally possible

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.710 
remake his gases it's totally possible
that<00:04:02.650> even<00:04:03.580> those<00:04:03.790> extra<00:04:04.120> minerals<00:04:04.270> he<00:04:04.480> makes

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
that even those extra minerals he makes

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.600 
that even those extra minerals he makes
on<00:04:04.990> the<00:04:05.110> assimilate<00:04:05.500> errs<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:06.190> going<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.460> put

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
on the assimilate errs is going to put

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.980 
on the assimilate errs is going to put
it<00:04:06.670> behind<00:04:06.760> it<00:04:07.000> up<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.210> where<00:04:07.300> stalker<00:04:07.690> count

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
it behind it up to where stalker count

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.450 
it behind it up to where stalker count
will<00:04:08.110> be<00:04:08.200> lower<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:08.620> then<00:04:08.740> party<00:04:09.040> just<00:04:09.250> wins

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
will be lower and then party just wins

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.180 
will be lower and then party just wins
and<00:04:09.640> warp<00:04:09.850> gate<00:04:10.030> stalkers<00:04:10.570> I<00:04:10.780> think<00:04:11.770> parting

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
and warp gate stalkers I think parting

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.310 
and warp gate stalkers I think parting
is<00:04:12.850> work<00:04:13.150> at<00:04:13.300> research<00:04:13.540> is<00:04:13.660> just<00:04:13.840> too<00:04:13.960> slow<00:04:14.170> and

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
is work at research is just too slow and

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.780 
is work at research is just too slow and
rain<00:04:14.710> is<00:04:14.830> gonna<00:04:14.950> warp<00:04:15.190> in<00:04:15.310> some<00:04:15.460> units<00:04:15.670> here

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
rain is gonna warp in some units here

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.520 
rain is gonna warp in some units here
and<00:04:16.060> possibly<00:04:16.359> just<00:04:16.750> kill<00:04:16.930> parting<00:04:17.260> right<00:04:17.410> now

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
and possibly just kill parting right now

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.710 
and possibly just kill parting right now
that's<00:04:18.280> a<00:04:18.430> possibility<00:04:18.880> as<00:04:19.150> well<00:04:19.180> here<00:04:19.600> it's

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
that's a possibility as well here it's

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.390 
that's a possibility as well here it's
it's<00:04:20.020> hard<00:04:20.230> to<00:04:20.350> say<00:04:20.560> but<00:04:20.620> here<00:04:20.890> come<00:04:21.040> those<00:04:21.190> war

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
it's hard to say but here come those war

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.800 
it's hard to say but here come those war
pins<00:04:21.580> he's<00:04:21.730> got<00:04:21.880> another<00:04:22.000> 1p<00:04:22.240> research<00:04:22.510> way

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
pins he's got another 1p research way

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.330 
pins he's got another 1p research way
fasters<00:04:23.380> mothership<00:04:23.740> core<00:04:23.890> is<00:04:24.010> here<00:04:24.160> as<00:04:24.310> well

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
fasters mothership core is here as well

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.610 
fasters mothership core is here as well
this<00:04:25.330> parting<00:04:25.660> even<00:04:25.840> have<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.020> mothership<00:04:26.320> core

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
this parting even have a mothership core

this parting even have a mothership core
okay<00:04:27.040> he<00:04:27.190> does<00:04:27.370> he's<00:04:27.760> got<00:04:27.940> a<00:04:27.970> cannon<00:04:28.240> up<00:04:28.420> as

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
okay he does he's got a cannon up as

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.910 
okay he does he's got a cannon up as
well<00:04:28.630> that's<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:29.170> might<00:04:29.380> be<00:04:29.470> his<00:04:29.620> saving

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
well that's that might be his saving

good angle here is Randy's gonna
actually<00:04:34.210> maybe<00:04:34.510> I'm<00:04:34.690> power<00:04:34.900> some<00:04:35.020> of<00:04:35.080> these

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
actually maybe I'm power some of these

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.060 
actually maybe I'm power some of these
gates<00:04:35.410> eventually

you<00:06:35.330> block<00:06:35.540> the<00:06:35.720> first<00:06:35.960> Nexus<00:06:36.380> but<00:06:37.070> he<00:06:37.130> didn't

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
you block the first Nexus but he didn't

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.710 
you block the first Nexus but he didn't
have<00:06:37.670> anything<00:06:37.850> to<00:06:38.000> stop<00:06:38.240> the<00:06:38.360> second<00:06:38.600> when<00:06:38.690> he

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
have anything to stop the second when he

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.150 
have anything to stop the second when he
had<00:06:38.840> two<00:06:39.020> probes<00:06:39.230> maybe<00:06:39.560> he<00:06:39.770> could<00:06:39.920> have<00:06:40.010> tried

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
had two probes maybe he could have tried

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.410 
had two probes maybe he could have tried
to<00:06:40.220> block<00:06:40.430> those<00:06:40.700> I<00:06:40.970> was<00:06:41.120> a<00:06:41.150> little<00:06:41.330> bit

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 
to block those I was a little bit

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.820 
to block those I was a little bit
worried<00:06:41.690> about<00:06:41.780> the<00:06:42.230> lack<00:06:42.560> of<00:06:42.590> the

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
worried about the lack of the

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.590 
worried about the lack of the
assimilator<00:06:43.310> when<00:06:43.550> he<00:06:43.640> made<00:06:43.790> the<00:06:43.910> next<00:06:44.150> Nexus

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
assimilator when he made the next Nexus

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.240 
assimilator when he made the next Nexus
I<00:06:44.750> thought<00:06:44.990> oh<00:06:45.200> maybe<00:06:45.590> he<00:06:45.770> won't<00:06:45.890> have<00:06:46.070> enough

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
I thought oh maybe he won't have enough

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.820 
I thought oh maybe he won't have enough
income<00:06:46.790> for<00:06:47.360> the<00:06:47.540> stalkers<00:06:48.020> but<00:06:48.230> he<00:06:48.290> barely

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
income for the stalkers but he barely

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.020 
income for the stalkers but he barely

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
pulled it off with the right combination

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.060 
pulled it off with the right combination
of<00:06:50.360> the<00:06:50.450> zealot<00:06:50.750> down<00:06:50.840> there<00:06:51.080> timed<00:06:51.680> out<00:06:51.890> well

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070
