00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.849
 it immediately comes to mind 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.710
 the image of suffering and 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.930

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.710
 who have a bad concept of the word 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.019
 diet resist them because they know that

 at the end after a while they will return 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.000

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.370
 let go of the strap 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.010
