from<00:01:20.719> standing<00:01:21.140> start<00:01:21.469> at<00:01:21.649> one<00:01:21.799> end<00:01:21.829> of<00:01:22.039> the

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
from standing start at one end of the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.100 
from standing start at one end of the
runway<00:01:22.310> because<00:01:22.759> fast<00:01:23.060> as<00:01:23.270> I<00:01:23.390> can<00:01:23.600> before<00:01:23.810> the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
runway because fast as I can before the

runway because fast as I can before the
other<00:01:24.229> end<00:01:24.469> stop<00:01:25.280> turn<00:01:25.670> around<00:01:25.700> and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
other end stop turn around and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.359 
other end stop turn around and
accelerate<00:01:27.140> back<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.619> where<00:01:27.770> I<00:01:27.799> started<00:01:27.950> from

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
accelerate back to where I started from

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.910 
accelerate back to where I started from
and<00:01:29.240> hopefully<00:01:29.570> get<00:01:29.720> back<00:01:29.960> there<00:01:30.229> before<00:01:30.439> the

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
and hopefully get back there before the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.050 
and hopefully get back there before the
aeroplane<00:01:31.369> ders<00:01:31.579> I<00:01:33.579> think<00:01:34.579> Mike's

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
aeroplane ders I think Mike's

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.139 
aeroplane ders I think Mike's
expectations<00:01:35.810> are<00:01:36.170> for<00:01:36.619> me<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:37.009> just<00:01:37.670> turn<00:01:37.880> as

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
expectations are for me to just turn as

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.179 
expectations are for me to just turn as
tightly<00:01:38.479> as<00:01:38.630> i<00:01:38.869> possibly<00:01:39.259> can<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.740> get<00:01:39.829> back<00:01:40.039> to

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
tightly as i possibly can to get back to

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.880 
tightly as i possibly can to get back to
the<00:01:40.280> runway<00:01:40.720> I'm<00:01:41.720> not<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.439> hundred<00:01:42.649> percent

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
the runway I'm not a hundred percent

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
sure whitewater i'm going to do you I've

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.679 
sure whitewater i'm going to do you I've
got<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.560> few<00:01:45.799> ideas<00:01:45.829> and<00:01:46.520> as<00:01:46.819> we<00:01:46.970> get<00:01:47.060> closer<00:01:47.390> to

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
got a few ideas and as we get closer to

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.120 
got a few ideas and as we get closer to
the<00:01:47.810> start<00:01:48.079> of<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.319> race<00:01:48.439> I'll<00:01:48.770> make<00:01:48.979> that

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
the start of the race I'll make that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.070 
the start of the race I'll make that
decision<00:01:49.460> but<00:01:50.179> I<00:01:50.210> might<00:01:50.450> have<00:01:50.630> something<00:01:50.840> up

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
decision but I might have something up
