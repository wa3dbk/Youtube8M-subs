Peter could you say something about how
the<00:02:56.879> non-dual<00:02:57.390> approach<00:02:57.840> might<00:02:58.410> add<00:02:58.620> value<00:02:59.160> to

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190

guide the unique thing about the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.940 
guide the unique thing about the
non-dual<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:06.150> ultimate

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
non-dual is that it is the ultimate

there's<00:03:31.139> no<00:03:31.410> where<00:03:31.620> further<00:03:31.950> they<00:03:32.220> can<00:03:32.519> go<00:03:33.019> so

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
there's no where further they can go so

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.440 
there's no where further they can go so
for<00:03:34.380> example<00:03:35.129> there<00:03:35.700> are<00:03:35.730> teachers<00:03:36.299> of

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
for example there are teachers of

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
serenity and equanimity the non-dual is

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.920 
serenity and equanimity the non-dual is
a<00:03:45.750> different<00:03:46.169> experience<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:47.370> non-jew<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.660> a

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
a different experience the non-jew is a

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.900 
a different experience the non-jew is a
state<00:03:49.530> that<00:03:50.840> really<00:03:51.840> at<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.139> pinnacle<00:03:52.709> of

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910

state that really at the pinnacle of
human<00:03:53.910> evolution<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:55.470> people<00:03:56.040> can<00:03:56.280> take<00:03:56.699> the

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
human evolution so people can take the

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.390 
human evolution so people can take the
contribution<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.260> they're<00:03:58.530> already<00:03:59.010> making

contribution that they're already making

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.229 
contribution that they're already making
and<00:03:59.849> add<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:01.319> that<00:04:01.500> they<00:04:02.430> can<00:04:02.639> take<00:04:02.849> people

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
and add to that they can take people

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.890 
and add to that they can take people
further<00:04:05.120> Peter<00:04:06.120> could<00:04:06.389> you<00:04:06.480> say<00:04:06.660> something

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 
course called the radiant mind course

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.680 
course called the radiant mind course
that<00:07:49.500> runs<00:07:49.800> over<00:07:50.130> nine<00:07:50.520> months<00:07:51.000> so<00:07:51.270> we've<00:07:51.510> been

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:51.690 
that runs over nine months so we've been

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.230 
that runs over nine months so we've been
doing<00:07:51.930> that<00:07:52.080> now<00:07:52.140> for<00:07:52.410> five<00:07:53.039> years<00:07:53.460> so<00:07:53.789> we've

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 
doing that now for five years so we've

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.529 
doing that now for five years so we've
discovered<00:07:54.720> a<00:07:54.960> structure<00:07:55.530> that<00:07:55.560> really<00:07:55.919> works

00:07:56.529 --> 00:07:56.539 
discovered a structure that really works

00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:59.810 
discovered a structure that really works

both in terms of really bringing forth

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.350 
both in terms of really bringing forth
the<00:08:00.390> experiential<00:08:01.169> dimension<00:08:01.560> and<00:08:02.360> giving

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 
the experiential dimension and giving

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.540 
the experiential dimension and giving
people<00:08:03.600> a<00:08:03.900> fine<00:08:04.260> set<00:08:04.620> of<00:08:04.650> distinctions

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:05.550 
people a fine set of distinctions

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.450 
people a fine set of distinctions
through<00:08:06.360> which<00:08:06.600> to<00:08:07.070> access<00:08:08.070> and<00:08:08.400> share
