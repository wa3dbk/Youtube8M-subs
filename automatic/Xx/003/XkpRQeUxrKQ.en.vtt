00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 the is no business like showbusiness and 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.480
 that means also in the movie that it will be 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.700
 Often, it's mostly about a lot of money and money 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.099
 With that we look at the German 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.849
 seduced trailer for documentation and 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.849
 leave 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.810
 optimistic in asta johann 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.080
 That's why I enjoy documenting 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.030
 seduces me and leaves us 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.890
 world cinema film rental expected from 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.600
 10 july in german cinemas 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.190
 will bring and here you can see alec 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.020
 Baldwin's with director James 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.870
 toback at the filmfestspiele of 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.850
 cannes 2012 is trying a fictitious movie 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.470
 to finance what many often do not 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.540
 know that important behind the film world 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.770
 Turning it simply is a thing and what 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.720
 spectators say about a movie 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.340
 but the whole way to production 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.960
 finance the emergence of 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.550
 scripts the history and people too 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.170
 convince them to have the money 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.610
 invest because you are in the first place 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.050
 Of course, changing a good one 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.540
 Of course, having an investment was one 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.430
 want to profit thereby generate the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.320
 is what film macherey ultimately 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.820
 exactly this topic means itself 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.860
 just James toback and alec baldwin 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.870
 simple man in documentation 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.790
 seduced and abandoned try on the 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.680
 film festival of cannes 2012 behind 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.910
 to find the scenes financiers that 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.470
 I talk to directors and 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.270
 Producers with actors with all 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.650
 those who might have money and so on 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.480
 you see people like francis ford coppola 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.190
 daniel krÃ¼ger ryan gosling or martin 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.900
 scorsese and to name a few here already 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.790
 in the trailer in front of the camera and what 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.020
 of course, for film enthusiasts 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.430
 This view is really exciting 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.290
 behind the scenes that all these 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.210
 people as usual in gloss and glamor 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.950
 stand seems to be a premiere behind the 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.870
 The scene is completely different things do and that 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.670
 is just the movie world to a high 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.650
 level of cinematic quality too 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.060
 Achieve and good explanations too 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.200
 good writers have the great 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.750
 writing stories is over 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.150
 unfortunately always a question of the money because 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.130
 Money often means time to people 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.870
 spend a long time working on something 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.820
 then it will be good, according to the motto 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.440
 Good lasts and money 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.910
 Just make him the difference 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.020
 this is simply not the case in many countries 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.090
 different reasons why we in germany 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.040
 For example, often movie theaters have the 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.209
 Dramas or comedies are because German 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.100
 mainly for German audiences 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.959
 produce because that works best on 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.790
 always end the question of lenders 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.160
 producers in the room is how I do 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.420
 Out of money more money and so it is easy 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.010
 in the world that fact more and more 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.900
 the leased films are getting more and more expensive 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.940
 and so try where it is 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.440
 more and more this 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.240
 seduced parents to tears of the way and 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.800
 may also leave a sober 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.940
 look behind the scenes but definitely 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.530
 and documentation I'm easy 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.420
 excited to all these too 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.890
 well-known actors once behind the 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.360
 to see the scenery as they talk about it 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.830
 think and talk when it comes to money 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.120
 and above all that concerns itself 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.500
 now it can be on all the big ones 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.670
 filmfestspiele for example one has 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.170
 Anyway at the Berlinale 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.880
 just such events 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.470
 any little ones are paris or 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.450
 also the european film market where too 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.010
 try to constantly movies worldwide 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.050
 sell and that should be for everyone 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.970
 want to have a deeper insight from the 10th 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.560
 july maybe at the tips 1 in the cinema 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.700
 but it is clear that such a small film 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.480
 will probably be in many regions 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.860
 do not run at all 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.810
 but here is a note for all 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.340
 then if the strip on dvd or 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.270
 Blu-ray comes out I try that on 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.890
 to look at every case 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.720
 and that was a bit longer now 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.610
 Trailer check for a trailer check though 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.560
 especially in dokus makes the sometimes 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.970
 extra to point out and here is 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.650
 the topic just so exciting because that 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.300
 here only a movie canales and this 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.850
 Documentation with film and the 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.380
 busy behind that and then it has 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.940
 as a very special value as 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.220
 friends i'm through with this trailer 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.570
 to seduce and leave the money 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.280
 thumbs there we leave these words 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.300
 do not stay otherwise you know that 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.919
 there are still a few left around me 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.050
 around and tomorrow 15 clock of course 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.370

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.650
 I hope to be here again tomorrow 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.650
