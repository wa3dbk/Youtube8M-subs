Namaskar
Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:11.203
Today we will make maheri with maize flour.

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:16.359
It’s a north Indian recipe and is also prepared in Rajasthan.

00:00:16.703 --> 00:00:20.797
It has a different name in Rajasthan .i.e. maize flour raabri.

00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:30.242
Maheri tastes delicious and is prepared in rural areas as breakfast.

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:34.961
Let’s start with the procedure of making maize flour maheri.

00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:41.242
For making raabri we have taken buttermilk prepared with curd.

00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:47.445
Whisk 400 grams curd and then add 600 grams water into it.

00:00:47.883 --> 00:00:52.188
We have got 1 liter buttermilk.

00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:57.617
Now we will mix maize flour in buttermilk.

00:00:57.977 --> 00:01:04.109
We have taken ½ cup (60 grams) maize flour

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:21.742
Take maize flour in any vessel and firstly add little buttermilk into it and stir until all lumps dissolves.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:30.203
Avoid adding whole buttermilk at once as it can get difficult to stir the maize flour.

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:35.796
Stir the flour in little amount of buttermilk until smooth.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.109
All lumps have dissolved now add little more buttermilk into it.

00:01:45.664 --> 00:01:50.023
Make sure there are no lumps in batter.

00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:59.335
In case it happens strain the batter with help of a sieve used for straining soup to dissolve the lumps.

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:08.046
Add rest of butter milk and mix well.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:11.047
Now we’ll cook it.

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:14.133
For this place the vessel on flame.

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:21.563
We are making salty maheri but sweet maheri can be prepared.

00:02:22.656 --> 00:02:27.555
For making salty maheri we are using salt, cumin seeds and asafoetida for tadka.

00:02:28.164 --> 00:02:34.835
For making sweet maheri add sugar or jaggery and follow the same procedure.

00:02:35.547 --> 00:02:43.679
Keep the flame high and stir constantly until it turns thick in consistency.

00:02:44.203 --> 00:02:55.265
Maheri has started boiling but keep stirring constantly and cook until it turns thick in consistency.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:04.023
Keep the flame low as maheri can spill.

00:03:04.492 --> 00:03:07.664
Cook on medium-low flame.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:13.250
Maheri has turned thick that means it’s ready.

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:18.515
We have cooked maheri for 25 minutes.

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:31.500
Firstly cook for 10 minutes until it simmers and then reduce the flame and cook for 15 minutes more.

00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:36.453
Add 1 tsp salt or as per taste in maheri.

00:03:38.367 --> 00:03:44.148
Maheri is ready, now take it out in a bowl.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.078
Turn off the flame

00:03:54.578 --> 00:03:57.164
Now make tadka for maheri.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:04.163
For this preheat a pan and add 2 tsp oil into it.

00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:05.805
Ghee can also be used.

00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:19.406
Usually in rural areas maheri is consumed without adding tadka, along with chutney, pickle, extra curd or buttermilk.

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:27.117
But we are adding tadka to enhance the flavor.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:36.203
When oil is hot add ½ tsp cumin seeds and 1 pinch asafoetida.

00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:41.594
If you prefer eating spicy then add red chilly.

00:04:41.992 --> 00:04:52.117
Now pour the tadka over maheri and mix.

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:59.523
Garnish with some green coriander.

00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:02.281
Green coriander enhances the flavor.

00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:11.398
Mouth watering maize flour maheri with good aroma is ready.

00:05:11.672 --> 00:05:28.281
Relish eating maheri as it is or serve with green coriander chutney, green chilly pickle or extra curd or buttermilk to enhance the flavor.

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:35.953
Everyone, including kids and elders can relish eating maheri.

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:42.554
Maheri can even be given to 6-7 months old baby.

00:05:42.898 --> 00:05:52.046
For this don’t add tadka in maheri give it as it is.

00:05:52.398 --> 00:05:54.961
It’s a very nutritional food for them.

00:05:55.281 --> 00:06:02.835
