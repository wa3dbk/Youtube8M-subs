00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
really hard to create controls that are

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.920 
really hard to create controls that are
extremely<00:00:39.239> intuitive<00:00:40.239> and

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
extremely intuitive and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.100 
extremely intuitive and

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
efficient as you can see that guy this

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.790 
efficient as you can see that guy this

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
of the modern cyberpunk is reality and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.770 
of the modern cyberpunk is reality and
you<00:00:55.489> need<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.850> go<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.060> a<00:00:57.070> special<00:00:58.070> challenge

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
deck of cards so each card is a special

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.540 
deck of cards so each card is a special
challenge<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.350> here<00:01:06.560> we've<00:01:06.770> done<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:07.160> combat

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
challenge so here we've done a combat

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.660 
challenge so here we've done a combat
card<00:01:07.850> this<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.570> an<00:01:08.810> upgrade<00:01:09.110> card<00:01:09.650> where<00:01:10.460> you

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
card this is an upgrade card where you

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.310 
card this is an upgrade card where you
can<00:01:10.940> actually<00:01:11.210> upgrade<00:01:11.810> some<00:01:12.020> of<00:01:12.170> your

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
can actually upgrade some of your

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.719 
can actually upgrade some of your
special<00:01:12.560> powers<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:13.310> there<00:01:13.490> are<00:01:13.580> many

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
special powers so there are many

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.310 
special powers so there are many
different<00:01:14.149> powers<00:01:14.509> let's<00:01:14.840> say<00:01:14.990> I<00:01:15.020> take<00:01:15.170> this

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
different powers let's say I take this

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.590 
different powers let's say I take this
one<00:01:15.530> increase<00:01:15.890> your<00:01:16.070> maximum<00:01:16.190> health<00:01:16.759> among

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
one increase your maximum health among

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.690 
one increase your maximum health among
many<00:01:17.840> other<00:01:18.080> choices<00:01:18.410> so<00:01:19.310> I'm<00:01:19.399> going<00:01:19.640> to

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
many other choices so I'm going to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.730 
many other choices so I'm going to
upgrade<00:01:19.940> this<00:01:20.270> one

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
upgrade this one

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.240 
upgrade this one
so<00:01:22.250> this<00:01:22.430> as<00:01:22.780> 12

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
so this as 12

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.350 
so this as 12
total<00:01:24.640> here<00:01:24.940> i'm<00:01:25.900> going<00:01:26.230> to<00:01:26.320> go<00:01:26.560> fight<00:01:26.890> again

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.649 

so<00:01:30.700> this<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:31.970> an<00:01:32.240> easy<00:01:32.480> mode

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
so this is an easy mode

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.510 
so this is an easy mode
but<00:01:34.289> there<00:01:34.469> are<00:01:34.560> three<00:01:34.950> levels<00:01:35.219> of

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
but there are three levels of

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.340 
but there are three levels of
difficulties<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.810> there's<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.079> lot<00:01:37.289> of

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
difficulties so there's a lot of

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.069 
difficulties so there's a lot of
gameplay<00:01:38.100> time<00:01:38.399> actually<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.240> done<00:01:39.479> this

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
gameplay time actually to be done this

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.690 
gameplay time actually to be done this
is<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> type<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.560> game<00:01:40.890> where<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.369> just

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
is the type of game where you have just

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.209 
is the type of game where you have just
one<00:01:41.939> life<00:01:42.179> to<00:01:42.960> try<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.229> go<00:01:43.409> as<00:01:43.500> far<00:01:43.799> as<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.039> can

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
one life to try to go as far as you can

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.429 
one life to try to go as far as you can
in<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> game<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.539> if<00:01:45.719> you<00:01:45.869> die<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.319> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
in the game and if you die you have to

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.230 
in the game and if you die you have to
start<00:01:46.740> over<00:01:46.859> from<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.189> beginning<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
start over from the beginning but the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.240 
start over from the beginning but the
levels<00:01:48.569> are<00:01:48.749> all<00:01:48.929> randomly<00:01:49.469> generated<00:01:50.100> each

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
levels are all randomly generated each

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.789 
levels are all randomly generated each
time<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.939> every<00:01:51.630> walkthrough<00:01:52.319> is<00:01:52.469> unique

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
time so every walkthrough is unique

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.740 
time so every walkthrough is unique
there<00:01:53.459> are<00:01:53.549> four<00:01:53.819> characters<00:01:54.359> each<00:01:54.719> with

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
there are four characters each with

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.940 
there are four characters each with
their<00:01:55.079> own<00:01:55.520> powers<00:01:56.520> each<00:01:56.849> with<00:01:57.090> their<00:01:57.209> own

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
their own powers each with their own

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.719 
their own powers each with their own
achievements<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.159> you<00:02:00.250> also<00:02:00.400> unlock

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
achievements and you also unlock

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.060 
achievements and you also unlock
different<00:02:01.090> ending<00:02:01.900> cinematics<00:02:02.530> for<00:02:02.740> each<00:02:02.890> of

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
different ending cinematics for each of

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.390 
different ending cinematics for each of
them<00:02:03.510> so<00:02:04.510> here<00:02:04.750> I've<00:02:04.960> completed<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:05.799> level<00:02:06.220> I
