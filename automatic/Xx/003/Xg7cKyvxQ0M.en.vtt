00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.790 

so<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.219> Hammond<00:00:15.139> l/100<00:00:16.139> it's

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
so this is the Hammond l/100 it's

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.440 
so this is the Hammond l/100 it's
working<00:00:17.250> but<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:17.550> making<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.939> lot<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.150> noise

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
working but it's making a lot of noise

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.210 
working but it's making a lot of noise
as<00:00:19.200> you<00:00:19.349> can<00:00:19.470> see<00:00:19.590> there's<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.010> tone

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
as you can see there's the tone

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.429 
as you can see there's the tone
generator<00:00:20.759> which<00:00:21.060> I've<00:00:21.240> torn<00:00:21.570> apart<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:24.439> tone

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
generator which I've torn apart the tone

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.100 
generator which I've torn apart the tone
generator<00:00:25.830> was<00:00:25.980> making<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.460> lot<00:00:26.669> of<00:00:26.700> noise

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
generator was making a lot of noise

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.740 
generator was making a lot of noise
it<00:00:28.410> was<00:00:28.560> squealing<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.550> suspected<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.420> was<00:00:30.539> one

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
it was squealing I suspected it was one

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.439 
it was squealing I suspected it was one
of<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.990> tone<00:00:31.650> wheels<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.820> what<00:00:33.000> I've<00:00:33.120> done<00:00:33.269> is

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
of the tone wheels so what I've done is

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.750 
of the tone wheels so what I've done is
I've<00:00:33.600> taken<00:00:33.629> this<00:00:34.559> cover<00:00:34.949> off<00:00:35.040> normally

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
I've taken this cover off normally

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.040 
I've taken this cover off normally
you're<00:00:35.879> supposed<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.269> unsolder

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
you're supposed to unsolder

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.170 
you're supposed to unsolder
everything<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.400> see<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.610> didn't<00:00:38.910> want<00:00:39.059> to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
everything but I see I didn't want to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.750 
everything but I see I didn't want to
make<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.809> tea<00:00:39.900> for<00:00:40.199> solder<00:00:40.620> connections<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.699> I

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
make a tea for solder connections so I

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.090 
make a tea for solder connections so I
just<00:00:41.940> unsoldered<00:00:42.780> once<00:00:42.989> I'd<00:00:43.170> made<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.769> jig

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
just unsoldered once I'd made this jig

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.810 
just unsoldered once I'd made this jig
to<00:00:44.370> hold<00:00:44.580> it<00:00:44.760> up<00:00:45.019> works<00:00:46.019> really<00:00:46.320> well<00:00:46.670> so<00:00:47.670> what

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
to hold it up works really well so what

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.420 
to hold it up works really well so what
I<00:00:47.850> did<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.210> started<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:49.159> this<00:00:50.159> is<00:00:50.339> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
I did is I started it up this is the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.479 
I did is I started it up this is the
sound<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.970> made<00:00:51.119> before

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.430 

so<00:00:58.180> what<00:00:58.300> I've<00:00:58.390> done<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:58.570> I<00:00:58.809> turned<00:00:59.079> it<00:00:59.230> back<00:00:59.379> on

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
so what I've done is I turned it back on

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.389 
so what I've done is I turned it back on
and<00:01:00.239> each<00:01:01.239> of<00:01:01.420> these<00:01:01.540> little<00:01:01.809> wheels<00:01:02.399> these

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
and each of these little wheels these

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:10.290 
and each of these little wheels these
tone<00:01:03.730> generator<00:01:04.269> wheels<00:01:06.210> spin<00:01:08.130> when<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.909> I

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
tone generator wheels spin when the I

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.120 
tone generator wheels spin when the I
don't<00:01:10.630> know<00:01:10.720> if<00:01:10.750> you<00:01:10.930> can<00:01:11.110> see<00:01:11.320> but<00:01:11.530> there's<00:01:11.830> a

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
don't know if you can see but there's a

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.430 
don't know if you can see but there's a
sprocket<00:01:13.060> in<00:01:13.210> between<00:01:13.659> these<00:01:13.930> two<00:01:14.200> wheels

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
sprocket in between these two wheels

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.340 
sprocket in between these two wheels
that's<00:01:15.040> been<00:01:15.369> constantly<00:01:15.909> and<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.960> two<00:01:17.140> other

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
that's been constantly and the two other

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.590 
that's been constantly and the two other
wheels<00:01:17.619> spin<00:01:18.190> because<00:01:18.940> there's<00:01:19.149> a<00:01:19.210> spring

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
wheels spin because there's a spring

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.690 
wheels spin because there's a spring
clutch<00:01:19.990> in<00:01:20.229> there<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.590> grabs<00:01:20.950> those<00:01:21.430> two

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
clutch in there that grabs those two

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.670 
clutch in there that grabs those two
outer<00:01:21.880> wheels<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:23.140> can<00:01:23.290> stop<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:23.530> with

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
outer wheels and you can stop it with

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.609 
outer wheels and you can stop it with
your<00:01:23.920> finger<00:01:24.250> while<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.610> middle<00:01:24.970> one<00:01:25.090> still

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
your finger while the middle one still

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.669 
your finger while the middle one still
spins<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.729> I<00:01:27.790> had<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:28.390> isolate<00:01:28.540> each<00:01:29.050> one<00:01:29.350> one

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
spins so I had to isolate each one one

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.380 
spins so I had to isolate each one one
at<00:01:29.830> a<00:01:29.860> time<00:01:30.130> until<00:01:30.190> I<00:01:30.580> found<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.000> one<00:01:31.119> that<00:01:31.149> was

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
at a time until I found the one that was

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.180 
at a time until I found the one that was
making<00:01:31.570> a<00:01:31.780> lot<00:01:31.929> of<00:01:31.960> noise<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.710> turns<00:01:32.979> out

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
making a lot of noise and it turns out

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.900 
making a lot of noise and it turns out
it<00:01:33.399> was<00:01:33.610> this<00:01:34.030> one<00:01:34.210> right<00:01:34.360> here<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.610> what<00:01:36.759> ideas

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
it was this one right here so what ideas

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.010 
it was this one right here so what ideas
I<00:01:37.270> thought<00:01:37.479> it<00:01:37.690> was<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:39.240> pickups<00:01:40.240> that<00:01:40.539> were

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
I thought it was the pickups that were

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.969 
I thought it was the pickups that were
maybe<00:01:41.259> rubbing<00:01:42.160> against<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:44.110> wheel<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.710> it

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
maybe rubbing against the wheel and it

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.639 
maybe rubbing against the wheel and it
wasn't<00:01:45.250> they<00:01:45.700> were<00:01:45.759> fine<00:01:46.750> they<00:01:47.020> were<00:01:47.050> in<00:01:47.320> good

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
wasn't they were fine they were in good

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.219 
wasn't they were fine they were in good
adjustment<00:01:48.220> so<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:49.450> I<00:01:49.479> did<00:01:49.600> is<00:01:49.869> I<00:01:49.960> had<00:01:49.990> to

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
adjustment so what I did is I had to

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.930 
adjustment so what I did is I had to
isolate<00:01:50.409> each<00:01:50.860> wheel<00:01:51.100> stop<00:01:51.490> it<00:01:51.670> with<00:01:51.789> my

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
isolate each wheel stop it with my

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.350 
isolate each wheel stop it with my
finger<00:01:52.530> listen<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:54.369> noise<00:01:54.670> is<00:01:54.909> still<00:01:55.000> there

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
finger listen the noise is still there

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.910 
finger listen the noise is still there
until<00:01:55.690> I<00:01:55.720> got<00:01:55.899> to<00:01:56.080> this<00:01:56.200> one<00:01:56.440> as<00:01:56.590> soon<00:01:56.740> as<00:01:56.860> I

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
until I got to this one as soon as I

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.100 
until I got to this one as soon as I
stopped<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.250> wheel<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.610> noise<00:01:57.789> went<00:01:58.090> away<00:01:58.179> so

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
stopped the wheel the noise went away so

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.960 
stopped the wheel the noise went away so
there's<00:01:59.289> either<00:01:59.470> something<00:01:59.860> maybe<00:02:00.729> the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
there's either something maybe the

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.649 
there's either something maybe the
spring<00:02:01.479> was<00:02:01.930> making<00:02:02.320> noise<00:02:02.530> or<00:02:02.979> just<00:02:03.909> a<00:02:04.119> lot<00:02:04.479> of

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
spring was making noise or just a lot of

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.749 
spring was making noise or just a lot of
play<00:02:04.930> you<00:02:05.560> need<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.770> lot<00:02:06.009> of<00:02:06.100> oil<00:02:06.280> so<00:02:06.399> I<00:02:06.549> got<00:02:06.729> a

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
play you need a lot of oil so I got a

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.669 
play you need a lot of oil so I got a
q-tip<00:02:07.119> in<00:02:07.329> there<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.689> all<00:02:07.930> dit<00:02:08.200> really<00:02:08.530> well

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
q-tip in there and I all dit really well

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.720 
q-tip in there and I all dit really well
and<00:02:09.009> in<00:02:09.940> about<00:02:10.149> five<00:02:10.420> seconds<00:02:11.070> it<00:02:12.070> cleaned

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
and in about five seconds it cleaned

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.150 
and in about five seconds it cleaned
right<00:02:12.940> up<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:14.200> sounds<00:02:14.500> great<00:02:14.650> now<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:15.010> is

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
right up and it sounds great now this is

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.480 
right up and it sounds great now this is
what<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.459> sounds<00:02:15.700> like

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.690 

spending<00:02:22.300> really<00:02:22.450> smoothly<00:02:23.040> it's<00:02:24.040> been<00:02:24.280> it's

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
spending really smoothly it's been it's

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.250 
spending really smoothly it's been it's
been<00:02:24.790> oiled<00:02:25.060> this<00:02:25.330> thing<00:02:25.540> hasn't<00:02:25.720> been<00:02:25.870> oiled

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
been oiled this thing hasn't been oiled

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.980 
been oiled this thing hasn't been oiled
in<00:02:26.350> probably<00:02:26.860> 10-15<00:02:27.550> years<00:02:27.580> so<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.570> gave<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.930> a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
in probably 10-15 years so I gave it a

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.720 
in probably 10-15 years so I gave it a
really<00:02:29.290> good<00:02:29.470> dose<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:29.950> oil<00:02:30.160> in<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.490> trough

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
really good dose of oil in the trough

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.100 
really good dose of oil in the trough
and<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:32.140> actually<00:02:32.500> oiled<00:02:33.460> each<00:02:33.790> wick<00:02:34.270> going<00:02:34.990> to

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
and I actually oiled each wick going to

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.690 
and I actually oiled each wick going to
every<00:02:35.410> bearing<00:02:36.000> with<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.030> q-tip<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:39.370> all

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
every bearing with the q-tip and I all

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.550 
every bearing with the q-tip and I all
the<00:02:40.000> bearings<00:02:40.360> themselves<00:02:40.840> as<00:02:40.960> well<00:02:41.140> for<00:02:41.470> the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
the bearings themselves as well for the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.280 
the bearings themselves as well for the
q-tip<00:02:41.950> every<00:02:42.250> one<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.550> them<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.780> seems

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
q-tip every one of them and that seems

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.310 
q-tip every one of them and that seems
to<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.740> done<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.010> job
