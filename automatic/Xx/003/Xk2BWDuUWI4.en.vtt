00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.109
 personal hello am abadá landmarks map 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.210
 productions with you again staff 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.599
 today we will learn to divide the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.289
 integer number with no comma for one 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.140
 number with comma in the previous class that 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.140
 she wants class five we learn to 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.800
 divide the number confirm by another 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.920
 Confirmation number is good too and in class 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.349
 four that we learned to divide the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.980
 number with a comma for a number without 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.649
 comma and in this class now clear numbers 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.170
 in force / one with vigor 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.000
 Ok let's go then we'll have the people 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.250
 learned that when it contains 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.230
 comma in number the first thing to 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.719
 do is delete the commas to which 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.690
 to facilitate our continuous 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.360
 It's okay and like we eliminate this 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.030
 comma personal lesson four knots 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:07.439
 We learned, let's multiply it by ten. 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.780
 touch by multiplying 0.4 times 10 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.610
 personal agent happens automatically 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.229
 take off this comma from here play for pants 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:22.380
 we killed that comma and played with it 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:24.710
 here ok so now gave 4.04 zero see it 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:34.710
 here we learned in class four 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:36.930
 that 04 comma is the same as 04 and 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.420
 in previous classes we learned that 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.810
 04 is equal to four 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.759
 Okay, so it's all personal here. 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.290
 just like this here, it's ok then 0 4.04 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.420
 which is equal to four or all that 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.119
 in four so now we already have one 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.000
 number 4 here we will do it again here 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.670
 Let's go and put it here. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.250
 4 place we just found 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.770
 We multiply by ten which is only passing 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.459
 Comes a little house to your right. 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.759
 It's good we found a number 4 or 4.5 to 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.610
 same thing 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.560
 and now landmarks we have a number 18 there 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.370
 that we have to multiply by 10 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:23.250
 also ok, then let's teach more 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:26.829
 A little something here for you guys is 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:31.659
 all numbers x 10 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:35.470
 all numbers x 10 just put the 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:37.420
 in front of the number because then 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.500
 Let's make some of you here. 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.129
 learn 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.269
 come on for example the number 55 times 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:03:03.239
 10 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:03:03.239
 just put 50 10 ten times the number one 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:19.299
 good number 4,650 4,650 times 10 it's just 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.579
 put in front that gave 46,500 enough 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.560
 put a little bit on the front that you 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.230
 already multiplied in group 10 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.340
 So now, as you already know, let's go. 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.190
 return a number that 18 times 10 how much 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.180
 that is enough we put a buck 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.060
 what ahead 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:45.810
 now we have a number 180 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:49.480
 what then we put here both 180 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.400
 / 4 and now something we do 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.829
 let's continue the continuous 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.000
 we multiplied all that by 10 and 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.560
 We arrived at 180/4 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.389
 Let's go to the first step and I'll get this one. 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.639
 number and ask if you can divide 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.489
 by that one gives to divide by four 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.739
 not because one is less than 1 4 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.810
 And when we do not give it, we'll get the 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.359
 number of the lake we learned that too 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.609
 on one of the previous lines 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.120
 so now we have a number 18 not 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.120
 forget the number 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.440
 leave it for now, it's fine then 18 / 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.350
 4 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.680
 the question is what is the number that we 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:32.479
 let's put here that x 4 arrives more 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.669
 close to 18 never greater than 18 oc 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.680
 I already looked as I was taught to 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.650
 you along the continuums is the number 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.960
 four because four on line 1 we 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.490
 we learned this because four frames 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:49.250
 because four times 4 16 less than 18 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.880
 If it were number 5, let's try the number 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:56.240
 5 pretend to have a number 5 here 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:59.090
 five times 44 times 5 and 20 times greater than 18 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.650
 then five can not then the four 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.280
 perfect number because it will give you four 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.990
 4 16 times we do multiply 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.220
 and put the result here 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.229
 ambassador 11 and 16 down from 8 to 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.919
 Who the folks are to make ours? 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.360
 famous subtraction or less 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.130
 good 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.410
 do not forget the zero after we 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.800
 will use again let's do contained 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.669
 branches was first to the right column 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.330
 over there 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:36.110
 8 - 64 which is has eight taken 6 on two 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.750
 good or two but this is equal to 8 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.270
 added with this or that tab 18 - 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.650
 62 this colony is ready to let 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.410
 this bouquets 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:49.970
 1 - 1 is nothing is zero you have a strip it 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.590
 knew nothing about the 0 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.260
 so our continuous until now has already 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.330
 four and there are two here and now one 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.880
 thing, the zezinho there ok we still have 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:04.430
 that to lower it we go down and clean 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:07.340
 the camelô that 3rd 2010 20 and 21 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.800
 to hold but it is also the same thing tá 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.900
 good so now we have a number 20 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.150
 down here and let's ask 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.919
 as it is 20/4 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.670
 this number can be divided because 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.010
 he 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.800
 because he is much greater than that and 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:24.170
 short that is 20/4 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.830
 I've looked as taught to 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:30.830
 You're number five because number 5. 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.860
 because five times four or four 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.140
 times 5 and 21 to equal zero then the 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:41.150
 We put a notebook and put that four 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.750
 yes 22 times below 20 under the 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.810
 zero 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:48.350
 with this we make our continuous 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:51.800
 - ok sells less 20 many already know more 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:56.690
 let's make the first column on the right 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:07:00.080
 nothing less nothing is zero - it is zero or 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:03.020
 Who is this column ready for now? 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.270
 Let's go to this 2 - 2 you have two strip 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:09.590
 2 with what is left we are nothing too 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:12.080
 2 - 20 ok then our continuous has already given 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.270
 00 for usually when there is 00 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.580
 because it contained or ended yesterday that the 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.980
 something happens, let's see, there's a 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.440
 number there to download had we found it 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.580
 This zero for now and now there is no more 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.590
 nothing to download 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.140
 with that the staff when there is 00 here 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.950
 our contained just our 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:43.630
 result is 45 

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:43.630
 then as it got 18 / 0.4 while the 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:51.800
 44 45 

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:55.100
 good is this more personal contained therein 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.470
 line number 6 is good 6

 Leave a comment please if you have 

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:04.700
 any suggestions please leave too 

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.780
 a personal hug frames the map tab 

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.290
 productions 

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.290
