00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.549 

so<00:00:33.030> basically<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.110> something<00:00:34.410> called

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
so basically you have something called

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.080 
so basically you have something called
the<00:00:34.649> wave<00:00:34.800> particle<00:00:35.160> duality<00:00:35.309> which<00:00:35.880> means

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the wave particle duality which means

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.240 
the wave particle duality which means
that<00:00:36.300> matter<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.750> exist<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.710> particle<00:00:38.129> in

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
that matter can exist as the particle in

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.799 
that matter can exist as the particle in
delayed<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.329> something<00:00:39.480> like<00:00:39.690> an

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
delayed so if you have something like an

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.110 
delayed so if you have something like an
electron<00:00:40.200> here<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.100> describe<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.550> as<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
electron here you can describe it as a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.910 
electron here you can describe it as a
wave<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.200> electron<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.620> somewhere

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
wave and the electron is somewhere

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.770 
wave and the electron is somewhere
inside<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.430> wave<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.210> wave<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.480> called<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
inside the wave the wave is called the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.630 
inside the wave the wave is called the
pilot<00:00:45.960> wave<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.710> guys<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.219> path<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
pilot wave is it guys the path of the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.110 
pilot wave is it guys the path of the
electron<00:00:47.700> Oh<00:00:51.739> basically<00:00:52.739> due<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> wave

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
electron Oh basically due to the wave

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.639 
electron Oh basically due to the wave
particle<00:00:54.420> duality<00:00:54.600> since<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.379> describe

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
particle duality since you can describe

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.770 
particle duality since you can describe
all<00:00:56.010> matter<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.420> something

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
all matter as a you have something

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.680 
all matter as a you have something
called<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:59.160> principle<00:00:59.640> which<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.539> you

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
called the principle which is if you

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.750 
called the principle which is if you
know<00:01:00.809> how<00:01:00.960> fast<00:01:01.379> an<00:01:01.559> object<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.920> still<00:01:02.190> don't

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
know how fast an object you still don't

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.979 
know how fast an object you still don't
know<00:01:02.850> exactly<00:01:03.210> where<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.539> since<00:01:03.840> it's

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
know exactly where it is since it's

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.690 
know exactly where it is since it's
somewhere<00:01:04.229> within<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.619> wave<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:05.610> you

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
somewhere within the wave and if you

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.520 
somewhere within the wave and if you
know<00:01:05.850> exactly<00:01:06.510> where<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.350> don't

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
know exactly where not that is you don't

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:34.800 
know exactly where not that is you don't
know<00:01:07.590> how<00:01:07.710> fast<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.159> going

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.880 

five<00:01:35.810> minutes<00:01:36.170> left<00:01:41.049> is<00:01:42.049> it<00:01:42.229> just<00:01:42.469> me<00:01:42.679> or<00:01:42.709> as

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
five minutes left is it just me or as

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:56.840 
five minutes left is it just me or as
the<00:01:43.009> MC<00:01:43.399> wt2<00:01:43.939> I'm<00:01:44.329> here<00:01:49.149> so<00:01:50.149> random

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.310 

I<00:01:56.909> did<00:01:57.900> 420

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.140 

so<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.220> chem<00:02:05.430> test

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
so on the chem test

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:22.460 
so on the chem test
oh<00:02:06.180> not<00:02:06.570> bad<00:02:12.920> never<00:02:20.989> you<00:02:21.989> up<00:02:22.110> done<00:02:22.319> with

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
oh not bad never you up done with

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:43.000 
oh not bad never you up done with
