 so this is the first tip the second 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.229
 tip is you buy a cream of 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.479
 comb or bad 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.619
 no rinse-free cream that contains 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.750
 sunblock 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.750
 it is not only important to protect the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.549
 face and body are ours 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.299
 really need the filter 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.729
 solar 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.150
 so generally at this time of year the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.780
 companies start making lines that 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.130
 are limited lines of 10 from that time 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.060

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:38.369
 and I bought this pantene it's summer 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.240
 edition and he has a sunscreen, and I 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.689
 always use 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.100
 before getting into the water both on the beach 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.150
 how much in the pool 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.950
 and after I leave, then the third 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.460
 tip is that she is together with the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.320
 second sure tip you will pass the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.630
 large the combing cream that has 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.149
 sunscreen at night china goes there and takes 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.110
 your sea bath is going to take your bath 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.960

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.399
 When will you wash your clothes? 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.770

 take a summary of the salt of the pole and there you 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.870
 can you bring a little bottle of home to take 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.940
 a bottle of fresh water from home 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.350
 put it in the bag and take it to the beach or 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.750
 After you left the pool, you 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.170
 take a shower so that it is not 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.000
 red color and reapply this 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.230
 cream with sunscreen 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.040
 understood but Grandpa is to apply the cream of 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.709

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.010
