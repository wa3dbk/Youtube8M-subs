YouTube that they showed this tool to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.580 
YouTube that they showed this tool to
use<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.400> pull<00:00:26.880> focus<00:00:27.180> or<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.750> guess<00:00:28.289> focus

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
use as a pull focus or I guess focus

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.939 
use as a pull focus or I guess focus
ring<00:00:28.769> assist<00:00:29.099> type<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.060> thing<00:00:30.449> now<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.890> is

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
ring assist type of thing now this is

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.299 
ring assist type of thing now this is
originally<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> bottle<00:00:33.149> opener<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.219> know

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
originally a bottle opener so you know

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.459 
originally a bottle opener so you know
it's<00:00:35.550> relatively<00:00:36.180> cheap<00:00:36.570> out<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.260> is

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
it's relatively cheap out this one is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.160 
it's relatively cheap out this one is
actually<00:00:37.649> three<00:00:38.100> dollars<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:39.079> think<00:00:40.079> it

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
actually three dollars I think it

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.930 
actually three dollars I think it
targets<00:00:40.590> probably<00:00:41.100> 250<00:00:41.550> or<00:00:41.610> something<00:00:41.879> i

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
targets probably 250 or something i

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.660 
targets probably 250 or something i
bought<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.329> bed<00:00:42.510> bath<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.809> beyond<00:00:43.670> so

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
bought of that bed bath and beyond so

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.630 
bought of that bed bath and beyond so
yeah<00:00:44.850> basically<00:00:45.770> I'll<00:00:46.770> just<00:00:47.100> demonstrate<00:00:47.280> it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
yeah basically I'll just demonstrate it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.100 
yeah basically I'll just demonstrate it
for<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.789> guys<00:00:47.969> I'll<00:00:48.239> switch<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
for you guys I'll switch it to a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.979 
for you guys I'll switch it to a
different<00:00:49.500> quality<00:00:50.239> after<00:00:51.239> i'm<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
different quality after i'm going to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.700 
different quality after i'm going to
record<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.680> here<00:00:53.000> so<00:00:54.230> basically<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.440> wrap

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
record it on here so basically just wrap

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.599 
record it on here so basically just wrap
it<00:00:55.739> around<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.340> focus<00:00:57.020> ring<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.649> just

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
it around the focus ring here and just

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.250 
it around the focus ring here and just
tighten<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.969> up<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.239> because<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.079> made

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
tighten it up so because this is made

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.650 
tighten it up so because this is made
out<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.379> silicone<00:01:01.469> or<00:01:02.039> i<00:01:02.550> guess<00:01:02.969> some<00:01:03.449> type<00:01:03.629> of

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
out of silicone or i guess some type of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.590 
out of silicone or i guess some type of
rubber<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.920> grips<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.850> your<00:01:06.060> lines<00:01:06.270> really

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
rubber it grips on to your lines really

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.350 
rubber it grips on to your lines really
easily<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.400> since<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.850> said<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.180> made

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
easily and since like I said it's made

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.550 
easily and since like I said it's made
out<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> rubber<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.409> uh<00:01:10.790> it<00:01:11.790> bends<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.540> little<00:01:13.200> so

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
out of rubber it uh it bends a little so

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.100 
out of rubber it uh it bends a little so
this<00:01:14.549> makes<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.119> lot<00:01:15.450> more<00:01:15.509> similar<00:01:16.080> than

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
this makes it a lot more similar than

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.910 
this makes it a lot more similar than
having<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.950> use<00:01:17.159> your<00:01:17.280> hands<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.759> focus<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.920> as

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
having to use your hands to focus and as

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.280 
having to use your hands to focus and as
you<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.159> see<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.490> relatively<00:01:21.360> smooth<00:01:21.750> this

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you can see it's relatively smooth this

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.950 
you can see it's relatively smooth this
lens<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.770> particular<00:01:23.189> isn't<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.729> great<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.930> I

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
lens in particular isn't that great so I

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.910 
lens in particular isn't that great so I
can't<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.439> um<00:01:25.909> do<00:01:26.909> any<00:01:27.119> things<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:28.320> improve

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
can't really um do any things to improve

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.469 
can't really um do any things to improve
it<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.640> all<00:01:30.299> done<00:01:30.930> sooner<00:01:31.200> right<00:01:31.409> here

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it's really smooth actually let me

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.310 
it's really smooth actually let me
record<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> here<00:01:44.030> take<00:01:45.030> my<00:01:45.270> compact<00:01:46.020> flash

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
relatively smooth this is actually the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.039 
relatively smooth this is actually the
first<00:02:03.840> time<00:02:04.110> I'm<00:02:04.530> using<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.509> but<00:02:06.509> yeah<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.869> mean

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
first time I'm using it but yeah I mean

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.279 
first time I'm using it but yeah I mean
this<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:07.920> totally<00:02:08.520> cool<00:02:08.700> because<00:02:09.289> usually

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
this is totally cool because usually

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.800 
this is totally cool because usually
these<00:02:10.709> type<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.160> tool<00:02:11.489> costs<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.300> few<00:02:12.660> hundred

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
these type of tool costs a few hundred

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
these type of tool costs a few hundred
dollars<00:02:13.260> maybe

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
dollars maybe

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.610 
dollars maybe
maybe<00:02:14.190> less<00:02:14.430> than<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.670> hundred<00:02:15.210> dollars
