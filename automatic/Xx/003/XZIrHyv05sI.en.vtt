00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.410
 hello in this video i will tell you 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.890
 what is a downhole 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.900
 adapter 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.630
 and also help answer the question what 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.390
 better to put wells adapter or 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.330
 it is worthwhile to start installing the caisson 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.220
 what if people only live in the house 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.260
 summer time there is no 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.960
 need world well adapters not 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.290
 in caisson adapter or caisson 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.320
 put only if 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.610
 required to bring water into the house below 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.949
 freezing level 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.829
 now let's look at the pros and cons 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.989
 and downhole adapter and caisson to 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.300
 advantages of downhole adapter 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.070
 first here bear its low cost and 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.149
 because the adapter itself is worth order 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.739
 two thousand well, and about 1000 installation 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.660
 further it is necessary to include a quick installation 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.230
 downhole adapter relatively 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.770
 caisson 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.940
 as well as compactness because 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.289
 the final version you have well itself 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.300
 lead through adapter 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.240
 will see quite neatly then 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.910
 have you land will just pipe npvh 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.289
 go out there or iron looking who 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.750
 makes with a neat tip 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.880
 minus well adapter can be attributed 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.580
 and firstly what is required is special 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.280
 key for lowering the pumps for it 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.619
 second well extraction costs 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.599
 note that not all pumps will be you 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.300
 pass through the wells adapter ie 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:44.840
 if you have a pipe for example 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.720
 125 m goes badly instead of 4 inch 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.149
 among only 3 inch pump and last 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.490
 minus it is worth noting that if they 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.890
 example person can be hidden 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.619
 equipment is automatic 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.239
 their accumulator then if you flow 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.280
 cool to do through the adapter wells then 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:02.330
 all this equipment will occupy 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.660
 place in your house 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.330
 to the advantages of the caisson is to carry it 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.970
 simple and uncomplicated design 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.550
 which is absolutely clear to everyone as well 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.680
 it is worth noting that caissons are common 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.080
 much wider than well adapters 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.450
 This is due to the fact that the well adapters 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.880
 tronic recently appeared 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.190
 plus the caisson is worth noting that 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.780
 clear scripture not caisson made from 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.370
 plastic you can hide all the automation and 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.030
 the accumulator thereby freeing 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.710
 Staged non space indoor 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.110
 obvious minus caisson first 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.600
 It should be attributed to their high cost 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.440
 because even if the cheapest 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.510
 caisson 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.730
 from concrete rings in the end anyway 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.500
 will cost times more expensive than well 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.990
 adapter 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.940
 the second disadvantage is the person from 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.000
 concrete rings and it is worth noting that 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.040
 in the spring inside the caisson will be water then 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.990
 have your well headline just 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.120
 flood it because like concrete not 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.430
 seal water anyway find 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.650
 leak out 3 minus caisson 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.470
 relative to the downhole adapter costs 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.060
 note that the caisson will dig 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.990
 much longer than install and 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.660
 downhole adapter 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.120
 and also when digging the caisson will 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.570
 appear a lot of excess soil which 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.190
 will need to scatter on the site and 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.560
 the last minus is worth noting and then 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.600
 that visually already finished caisson with 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.960
 hand will take much more 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.180
 places than the downhole adapter because 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.600
 in the first variant you will have the top 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.540
 hang around the hatch and in the second version you and 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.050
 land will be gently inferior 125 pipe 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.960
 by 5 10 centimeters with ogolovkom now 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.700
 let's consider caissons just three 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.800
 kind of caissons that is, the first is 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.570
 concrete rings 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.940
 its significant disadvantage is 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.610
 that he will pass water and on his 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.610
 Essentially, it will be just useless given 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.640
 caisson will cost you about 6-7 thousand 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.550
 plus delivery to the object 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.090
 next comes the iron caisson that is 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.890
 steel 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:13.860
 it will cost you about 25 thousand and + 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.859
 delivery to the object given caisson 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.750
 no water will be offered 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.250
 sealing it a disadvantage is a cyst 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.520
 on is what it will be from the time 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.310
 After all , the last caisson is plastic 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.560
 it will not oxidize over time 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.120
 also he will not pass water 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.010
 the only wealth of such a caisson is 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.050
 its high cost that is begins 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.210
 for from 50,000 rubles 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.789
 and above now let's talk about 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.620
 downhole adapter device itself 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.400
 the adapter consists of two parts first 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.190
 its part is fixed and 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.479
 it is mounted from inside the casing 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.069
 drilled hole and through 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.530
 rubber o-rings 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:55.289
 are fixed on the outside by captive nut 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.599
 the second part of which is attached 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.300
 pipe mond with pump on special 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:02.759
 rod is fed from above and inserted into 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.250
 pinned again sky 1 fixed part 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.240
 due to this compound called 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.370
 dovetail 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.500
 reliable and tightness is created 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.740
 voltage between first and second part 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.159
 downhole adapter in the sales department 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.930
 Yaroslavl plant of plastic pipes and 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:22.229
 wonderful borehole adapter layout 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.159
 and for clarity, I decided to write on 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.590
 video the process of installation and disassembly 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:29.240
 downhole adapter 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.440
 well adapter mounting 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.629
 carried through a special pants 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.110
 Stake which is screwed into the second 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:38.750
 moving its part after mounting 2 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.969
 the movable part of the downhole adapter 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.400
 the bar gets out and puts on top 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:46.190
 on well cap end video 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.810
 would like to summarize 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.370
 if your equipment will stand 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.979
 example in the basement 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.440
 top vodka is preferable to make 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.360
 Of course cheats borehole adapter with 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.860
 this new company that will do 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.979
 well you on the plot 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.289
 I must say in advance what the submarine is doing 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:07.050
 will you through the adapter to 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.169
 at a depth of somewhere two and a half or 2 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.990
 meters and not through a special adapter 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.159
 products you extension from 125 pipe to 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.409
 example 140 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:19.199
 need this in order to 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.189
 you fit quietly pump well 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.149
 4 inch 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:26.839
 if there is not enough space in your basement 

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:28.679
 automatics and hydroaccumulator then 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:30.959
 would be preferable accordingly 

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:33.589
 either iron or you, if at all 

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:35.909
 a lot of money then plastic caisson 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:36.509
 it only remains to thank you for 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:38.759
 Attention 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:41.759
 next video I'll tell you about 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:44.839
 cheating in drilling water wells with 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.839
 parties of drilling companies
