00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.410
 information 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.530
 of these two pages that will be here 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.989
 down in the description and good but 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.350
 first of all I'm going to talk a little bit 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.659
 of the videos that is not removed 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.269
 recently it is that we say that I have 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:58.229
 taken a video of large start of fire 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.789
 in the photos and then also a montage 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:03.399
 I wish you liked the assembly 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.809
 because I 'm going to try to improve in 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.630
 a second assembly may try to 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.120
 improve the editions the plays and everything 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.680
 that but if my first montage is this 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.049
 file, we are not going to talk a little bit 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.800
 of this this theme the best-selling game 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.800
 in mexico 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.920
 he wanted to discover it by going to google.com 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.580
 I put the words I wrote the game 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.500
 best seller 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.870
 I want to know the best-selling game of 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:34.150
 mexico and good what I discovered 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:36.460
 in these two internet pages that from 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.550
 these two pages that information that 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.640
 they are taking out are from mercadolibre.com 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.530
 let's say that mercadolibre is like a 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.040
 internet store where you where you 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:52.420
 you can buy console games like 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.860
 it's playstation and wii the xbox 360 and 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.869
 I also think that they are selling well in 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.340
 free market 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.090
 electronic all kinds of electronics 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.780
 as it is things of music cables and everything 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.810
 that but yes 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.250
 according to mercadolibre.com the game more 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.010
 currently sold is george war 3 in 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.220
 your page with 14 percent of 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.850
 units sold on my good disk 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.450
 the simple truth surprised me quite 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.270
 this also means that we say that 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.810
 the dublin color is not the best selling 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.170
 as well as in different countries 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.860
 colombi let's say it 's a monster 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.910
 of the USA and of Europe but the mere truth 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.480
 I think it 's in Mexicans we know what 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:50.069
 that is a good game the mere truth and 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.569

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.700

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:59.819
 then in 5% forgiveness in 9% of 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.430
 units sold is for fifa and then 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.909
