 surgical to remove the tissue 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.140
 dead from the inside and around his 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.210
 wound 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.820
 the wounds can occur by 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.820
 various reasons such as injuries 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.620
 Burns is also called faces 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.530
 pressure ulcers or ulcers 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.530
 decubitus and surgical incisions 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.530
 infected 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.150
 the dead tissues damaged or 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.340
 polluted can endanger the 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.740
 circulation to the wound 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.170
 besides the diseased tissues are 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.149
 prone to infection 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 the dead tissues cause the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.839
 growth of competing bacteria 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.000
 with the growth cells for 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.339
 get nutrients and interfere with the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.920
 scar tissue process 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:08.290
 healthy from the wound can become infected 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.500
 the infection can become a 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.830
 pouch of pus called abscess that prevents 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.689
 the healing of wounds a 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.240
 wound as a result of a burn 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:22.420
 can form a hardened crust of 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.610
 Dead tissue called is face that can 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.610
 prevent the growth of healthy tissue and 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.800
 healing 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.600
 before your procedure your doctor 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.120
 numb the area around your 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.520
 wound with local anesthesia for a 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.450
 wider debridement you will receive 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.450
 general anesthesia

 depth of the wound by checking the 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.290
 reach of dead tissue 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.330
 Your doctor can remove the edge of the 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:05.320
 tissues around the wound to 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.940
 generate a clean margin of healthy tissue 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.940

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.770
 with wet gauze to stimulate 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.440
