then<00:01:57.490> we're<00:01:57.580> going<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.729> do<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.090> same<00:01:58.509> on<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
then we're going to do the same on the

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.660 
then we're going to do the same on the
other<00:02:02.380> side

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:19.250 

and<00:02:09.210> going<00:02:09.479> under<00:02:10.190> with<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.490> hair

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:37.699 

I'm<00:02:19.890> taking<00:02:20.340> really<00:02:20.670> large<00:02:20.939> sections

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.830 

so<00:02:38.250> we<00:02:38.430> did<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:38.700> bottom<00:02:39.090> part<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.480> we've<00:02:39.659> got

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
so we did the bottom part and we've got

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.050 
so we did the bottom part and we've got
a<00:02:39.870> little<00:02:40.290> bit<00:02:40.409> of<00:02:40.530> Bend<00:02:40.799> if<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.549> want<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.879> have

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
a little bit of Bend if you want to have

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.319 
a little bit of Bend if you want to have
a<00:02:42.599> bit<00:02:42.900> more<00:02:42.930> wave<00:02:43.319> use<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.739> smaller<00:02:44.129> iron<00:02:44.459> but<00:02:45.299> I

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
a bit more wave use a smaller iron but I

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.349 
a bit more wave use a smaller iron but I
just<00:02:45.569> want<00:02:45.719> a<00:02:45.750> little<00:02:45.780> bit<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.760> polished

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
just want a little bit of a polished

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.949 
just want a little bit of a polished
wave<00:02:48.859> but<00:02:49.859> not<00:02:50.010> really<00:02:50.340> done<00:02:50.819> so<00:02:51.780> we're<00:02:51.870> gonna

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
wave but not really done so we're gonna

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.039 
wave but not really done so we're gonna
take<00:02:52.170> down<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.500> next<00:02:52.859> section<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.900> my<00:02:54.900> hair

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
take down the next section and my hair

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.509 
take down the next section and my hair
is<00:02:55.139> kind<00:02:55.379> of<00:02:55.439> getting<00:02:55.620> some<00:02:55.859> texture<00:02:56.250> already

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
is kind of getting some texture already

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.940 
is kind of getting some texture already
from<00:02:56.700> being<00:02:56.909> up<00:02:57.030> in<00:02:57.180> my<00:02:57.299> little<00:02:57.510> top<00:02:57.810> knot<00:02:58.079> this

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
from being up in my little top knot this

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.179 
from being up in my little top knot this
next<00:02:59.430> section<00:02:59.909> we're<00:03:00.689> gonna<00:03:00.840> wrap<00:03:01.349> this<00:03:01.620> the

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
next section we're gonna wrap this the

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.819 
next section we're gonna wrap this the
opposite<00:03:02.879> direction<00:03:03.469> that<00:03:04.469> we<00:03:04.560> did<00:03:04.709> the

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
opposite direction that we did the

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.729 
opposite direction that we did the
underneath<00:03:05.280> layer<00:03:05.519> so<00:03:06.209> going<00:03:06.389> on<00:03:06.620> over<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
underneath layer so going on over the

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.009 
underneath layer so going on over the
iron<00:03:07.950> but<00:03:08.340> leaving<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:08.730> ends<00:03:09.030> out<00:03:09.299> so<00:03:09.750> we<00:03:09.870> have

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
iron but leaving the ends out so we have

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.659 
iron but leaving the ends out so we have
those<00:03:10.169> straight<00:03:10.560> ends<00:03:13.099> and<00:03:14.099> then<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.280> can<00:03:14.549> see

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:14.669 
those straight ends and then you can see

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.030 
those straight ends and then you can see
I<00:03:14.700> kind<00:03:14.939> of<00:03:15.030> just<00:03:15.180> pull<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:16.530> helps<00:03:16.829> make

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
I kind of just pull it that helps make

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.550 
I kind of just pull it that helps make
the<00:03:17.189> curl<00:03:17.400> look<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.849> little<00:03:18.299> more<00:03:18.720> lazy<00:03:21.349> the<00:03:22.349> mid

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
the curl look a little more lazy the mid

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:31.070 
the curl look a little more lazy the mid
section<00:03:22.859> under

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.500 

pulling<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.980> curl<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.550> you<00:03:33.090> might<00:03:33.240> need<00:03:33.360> to

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
pulling the curl and you might need to

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.260 
pulling the curl and you might need to
add<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:34.320> bit<00:03:35.040> more<00:03:35.070> wave<00:03:35.520> to<00:03:35.850> some<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.210> the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
add a bit more wave to some of the

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.290 
add a bit more wave to some of the
pieces<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:36.720> have<00:03:36.960> gone<00:03:37.140> straight<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:41.300> then

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
pieces that have gone straight and then

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.520 
pieces that have gone straight and then
I'm<00:03:42.390> just<00:03:42.510> going<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.720> carry<00:03:42.990> on<00:03:43.140> doing<00:03:43.350> that

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
I'm just going to carry on doing that

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.170 
I'm just going to carry on doing that
all<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:43.740> way<00:03:43.920> around<00:03:44.220> my<00:03:44.340> head<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:44.910> then<00:03:45.060> I'll

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
all the way around my head and then I'll

00:03:45.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
all the way around my head and then I'll
show<00:03:45.330> you<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.600> last<00:03:45.960> section<00:04:05.810> and<00:04:06.810> then<00:04:07.050> this

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
show you the last section and then this

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.190 
show you the last section and then this
last<00:04:07.440> section<00:04:08.000> I'm<00:04:09.000> just<00:04:09.180> going<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.450> do<00:04:09.690> this

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
last section I'm just going to do this

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.770 
last section I'm just going to do this
front<00:04:10.530> layer<00:04:10.710> back<00:04:11.460> because<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.300> wanted<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.600> go

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
front layer back because I wanted to go

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.390 
front layer back because I wanted to go
away<00:04:13.080> from<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.530> face<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:16.170> if<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.100> have<00:04:17.280> an

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
away from the face and if you have an

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.240 
away from the face and if you have an
iron<00:04:17.580> with<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:17.910> lid<00:04:18.570> on<00:04:18.600> it<00:04:18.810> or<00:04:19.230> a<00:04:19.260> clip<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:19.920> can

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
iron with a lid on it or a clip you can

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.550 
iron with a lid on it or a clip you can
remove<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:20.970> or<00:04:21.180> just<00:04:21.390> get<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.540> wand<00:04:21.810> iron<00:04:22.140> or<00:04:22.530> you

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
remove it or just get a wand iron or you

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.290 
remove it or just get a wand iron or you
can<00:04:22.770> wrap<00:04:22.920> it<00:04:22.980> around<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.400> outside<00:04:23.550> that

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
can wrap it around the outside that

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.290 
can wrap it around the outside that
works<00:04:25.020> too<00:04:26.780> then<00:04:27.780> this<00:04:28.020> section<00:04:29.210> we're<00:04:30.210> gonna

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
works too then this section we're gonna

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.530 
works too then this section we're gonna
do<00:04:30.540> under<00:04:31.370> because<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.670> want<00:04:32.850> a<00:04:32.940> little<00:04:33.180> more

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
do under because I want a little more

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.090 
do under because I want a little more
ball<00:04:33.900> you<00:04:34.200> because<00:04:34.410> I<00:04:34.470> kind<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.740> have<00:04:34.890> less

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
ball you because I kind of have less

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.880 
ball you because I kind of have less
hair<00:04:35.340> on<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.610> sides<00:04:35.850> of<00:04:36.030> my<00:04:36.150> head

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
hair on the sides of my head

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.530 
hair on the sides of my head
and<00:04:37.890> I<00:04:37.950> also<00:04:38.100> want<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:38.669> to<00:04:38.790> not<00:04:38.880> look<00:04:39.150> too

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
and I also want it to not look too

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:47.940 
and I also want it to not look too
perfect<00:04:40.380> wavy<00:04:40.800> on<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.280> sides

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:55.390 

and<00:04:48.950> during<00:04:49.370> this<00:04:49.550> under<00:04:53.980> that<00:04:54.980> way<00:04:55.130> we<00:04:55.250> don't

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
and during this under that way we don't

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.480 
and during this under that way we don't
get<00:04:55.640> those<00:04:55.820> super<00:04:56.270> silky<00:04:57.280> perfectly<00:04:58.280> done

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
get those super silky perfectly done

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.890 
get those super silky perfectly done
waves<00:04:58.760> this<00:04:59.030> is<00:04:59.150> definitely<00:04:59.450> gonna<00:04:59.660> be<00:04:59.870> a

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
waves this is definitely gonna be a

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.530 
waves this is definitely gonna be a
little<00:05:00.080> bit<00:05:00.320> more<00:05:00.560> lived-in<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:05.180> when<00:05:05.300> you<00:05:05.390> do

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
little bit more lived-in and when you do

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.170 
little bit more lived-in and when you do
awaits<00:05:05.840> in<00:05:06.020> different<00:05:06.410> directions<00:05:06.890> they

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
awaits in different directions they

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.460 
awaits in different directions they
aren't<00:05:08.180> likely<00:05:08.390> to<00:05:08.570> fall<00:05:08.810> into<00:05:09.020> each<00:05:09.260> other

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
aren't likely to fall into each other

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.930

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
sections I'm just grabbing kind of the

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.620 
sections I'm just grabbing kind of the
same<00:05:33.260> size<00:05:33.560> each<00:05:33.890> time<00:05:34.220> but<00:05:34.550> not<00:05:34.640> entirely<00:05:35.030> and
