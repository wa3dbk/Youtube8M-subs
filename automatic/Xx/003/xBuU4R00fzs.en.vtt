00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.519
 hello to all our friends 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.560
 It's with great joy with immense 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.100
 satisfaction that we are here one more 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.600
 conversation between friends 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.570
 now we are going to remove the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.390
 wing feathers is indicated for those 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.400
 people who like to play continues 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.850
 this is indicated for those people who 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.950
 have the animal as a pet test 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.739
 who likes to leave the subject and 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.309
 leaving with washer with which the penalty of 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.079
 Wings sorry and it's going to fly away 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.230
 usually people do what they 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.670
 account of the highlights of the game 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.949
 they open take a normal pair of scissors 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.590
 matters as a whole 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.559
 the time the bird closes wing you look 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.079
 The feathers are all spoiled. 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.390
 horrible and anyone who hit the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.030
 eye already identified the wing cut wing 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.939
 It's really spoiled, we're going to 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.520
 teach a technique that can only serve 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.280
 with this white scissors where the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.320
 people can remove the feathers and then 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.860
 you will see the result 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.280
 it does not look like the house is cut 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.189
 It is important to speak to people who 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.790
 always remove reindeer only from one of the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.800
 wings because if you remove the two by 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.740
 last will fly out 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.530
 your intention to remove from one of 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.140
 feathers of one of the wings is that it will 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.410
 lose balance 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.680
 we always remain intact 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.530
 the first two sentences in some cases 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.570
 of birds that are more aggressive in 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.270
 want to continue flying even almost 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.070
 cut can leave only one but it gets 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.060
 beautiful leaving the first two 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.830
 intact 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.250
 We're always going to cut these feathers. 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.380
 bigger how are we going to be doing 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.450
 The scissor picks up the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.010
 tip selects only quill cannon 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.650
 What do you want to cut? 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.380
 you see as indicated two in 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:22.400
 a person is much more difficult than 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.400
 you cut the desired cannon sound 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.560
 to the next 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:55.970
 just select a desired 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:03:00.590
 scissors and removes and so you go 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.280
 doing in every sentence - in both 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.280
 The first ones we'll stay 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.280
 intact 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.840
 i 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:36.580
 it is important to do this procedure 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:40.540
 slowly and carefully so as not to have 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.250
 danger of tamacho because this is a 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.519
 miley's stress 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.540
 Of course the faster you do the more 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.540
 quick and finishes 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.310
 realize that we're safe and cut her 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.430
 close to the cannon leaving space and goes 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.610
 removing the gun only by leaving 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.250
 the other penalties only if we are going to do 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.720
 down to the mall arriving only at 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.720
 two major works 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:46.490
 it's a bit boring process to go through 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.250
 but it's critical to his safety. 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.580
 even because the issue is not just 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.420
 he fled but he fled to where he 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.840
 go 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.580
 What many cases end up dying, right ? 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.610
 I have already witnessed cases of 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.690
 birds that fled from the cage left 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:08.480
 flying hit a one died because they 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.750
 they have little idea and were raised in 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.830
 captivity they do not have that one 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.950
 expertise of wuhan albarn with a percebe 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:23.090
 we are removing the largest and 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:28.870
 staying small will only catch 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.870
 the largest cannon in the base 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:38.100
 the important thing is also the following each 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.290
 case is a case some birds 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.430
 just cut some that is already the 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:48.479
 they do not fly enough others have is 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:53.669
 to remove a little more 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:54.870
 little because of the sweat of the morning the hand 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.500
 we are right people 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:04.350
 I just breathed and ended up leaving. 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:07.350
 just steal and the blind daughter leaves nothing 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.900
 that a bath with naked bath salt does not 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.330
 solve 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:20.780
 you perceive the difference 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:24.750
 looking over and she stays straight 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.280
 who does not notice that she is already 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.680
 cut 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.139
 watching both the two continue with the 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.460
 with the tips 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:37.860
 the feathers of ending kingdom 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:40.320
 they still overlap they were 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.720
 then cut you do not know we do not 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.630
 Can you see we can only see ourselves? 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:49.440
 removed the people from the bottom up 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:52.440
 keep you looking at both a never 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:55.710
 cut to the other but looking at pants in the 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.090
 cage the past remains beautiful and neither 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.590
 It looks like it's going to cut into the tables. 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.900
 We appreciate the attention of everyone and 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.690
 joy that we make this conversation between 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.360
 friends this exchange of experiences and 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.620

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.580
 new experiences and 

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:15.440
