00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 car brake system repair 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.089
 requires a very careful approach 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.309
 car owner should be serious 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.370
 treat the slightest sign 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.130
 brake malfunction and ask for 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.289
 diagnostics and repair specialist not 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.779
 worth experimenting on your own 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.779
 same security and so a brake 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.099
 present most common 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.890
 two types of drum brake systems 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.929
 brakes and disc drum brakes in 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.750
 Mainly used on rear wheels 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.120
 car disc brakes all over the place 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.980
 used on front wheels almost at 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.809
 all cars disc brakes 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.010
 accordingly, they are much more efficient 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.870
 than drums drum brakes 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.780
 used in cars near the old 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.739
 production mainly sponge cake 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.230
 course brakes 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.039
 front suspension on the rear suspension they 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.890
 used in order 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.300
 because many brake systems 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.010
 interrelated with the student's brake and 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.170
 accordingly again disk tormaz 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.949
 leg dummy work case valid 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.770
 moisture in them where ventilated 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.090
 ventilated disc brakes 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.369
 drum brakes respectively 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.720
 supervised blessing there remains on departure 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.580
 let's say we have a big puddle 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.650
 have to slow down several times 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.880
 so they began to work drives John 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.030
 many more actively they dry instantly 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.520
 right away 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.799
 general causes of brake malfunction not 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.600
 so much here is the case when you 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.970
 it is worth thinking about repairing 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.030
 during braking the car starts 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.640
 pull any of the sides you hear 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.150
 screeching sound when braking the pedal 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.580
 brakes 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.920
 began to notice too much work 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.920
 move or vice versa when braking you 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.049
 spend a lot of effort also 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.180
 important point it will be sanctions and gave and 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.220
 sticking it and brakes it 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.799
 indicates engine operation or very 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.200
 hot wheels after riding it all 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.270
 treated and repaired enough 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.289
 quickly need only time to determine 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.120
 the reason is mostly in this evil with decks 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.770
 accordingly either 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.130
 serviceability of the brake was the battle of parts 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.860
 when we brought our northern 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.340
 climate 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.240
 brake hoses often burst 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.720
 that's interesting 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.850
 malfunction 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.670
 brake cylinders often cuff 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.020
 run overheating disc brakes 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.890
 the abyss when the pads are clamped 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.190
 a person gets features like wanna 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.470
 puddle 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.790
 them from overheating and from sharp 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.830
 hypothermia begin to lead 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.260
 then you feel the pedal beating by 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.080
 braking foot respectively 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.520
 it turns out that the disk is twisted and you go 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.120
 bolts 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.290
 correspondingly unpleasant feeling 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.360
 brought 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.970
 consequences and worst all again 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.050
 leads 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.420
 faults main brake 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:52.310
 cylinder is valid even in 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.540
 what else can not only wear pads 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.180
 and overlays 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.010
 But pumping the brakes as a rule 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.440
 produced in case of air ingress 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.599
 into the brake system the main indicator 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.580
 need and produce is 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.930
 increase the working stroke of the brake pedal 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.060
 and and soft 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.100
 pumping brakes must be carried out 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.780
 after any repair in which 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.000
 the system was opened 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.360
 pipeline when I use a person not 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.420
 dilute wine qualitatively 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.430
 winter periods alcohol every cologne 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.610
 with this cop additives respectively 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.560
 here 's a tomazo cuff coming out but 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.630
 if after all pumping and other procedures 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.610
 did not help the pedal still remains 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.860
 soft and when braking you feel 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.140
 how it pulses under your foot is 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.989
 version of the fact that the brake discs guy 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.330
 however, I advise you not to rush 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.780
 some services solve this problem 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.819
 using a groove or sprout disc 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.750
 how this is done we will show already 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.750
