00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.580 
the demo but never seen that kind of gun
before<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:55.409> um<00:01:56.119> anyway<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.960> gameplay<00:01:58.409> is

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
before but um anyway the gameplay is

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.370 
before but um anyway the gameplay is
really<00:01:58.759> probably<00:01:59.759> just<00:02:00.630> awesome

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
really probably just awesome

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.190 
really probably just awesome
they<00:02:02.040> use<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.250> cursor<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.360> because<00:02:03.780> I

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
they use a cursor for it because I

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.959 
they use a cursor for it because I
believe<00:02:04.680> that's<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.979> click<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.460> stuff<00:02:05.790> that

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
believe that's the click on stuff that

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.880 
believe that's the click on stuff that
they<00:02:06.119> walk<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.290> if<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.439> could<00:02:07.590> click<00:02:07.799> on

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
they walk to so if you could click on

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.650 
they walk to so if you could click on
the<00:02:08.009> floor<00:02:08.280> your<00:02:08.849> sim<00:02:09.119> will<00:02:09.270> just<00:02:09.450> walk<00:02:09.629> right

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
the floor your sim will just walk right

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.199 
the floor your sim will just walk right
to<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.830> those<00:02:10.950> kind<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.280> games<00:02:11.489> sims

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
to it it's like those kind of games sims

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.850 
to it it's like those kind of games sims
2<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.629> way<00:02:12.780> different<00:02:12.989> because<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.620> can

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
2 is way different because you can

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.010 
2 is way different because you can
control<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.460> symbol<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.210> manually<00:02:15.810> with<00:02:15.990> your

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
control the symbol if manually with your

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.110 
control the symbol if manually with your
analog<00:02:16.590> stick<00:02:16.890> but<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.610> one<00:02:17.850> doesn't

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
analog stick but this one doesn't

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.930 
analog stick but this one doesn't
because<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:18.780> was<00:02:18.960> like<00:02:19.490> let's<00:02:20.490> look<00:02:20.730> here

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
because this was like let's look here

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:28.270 
because this was like let's look here
what<00:02:21.210> year<00:02:21.480> was<00:02:21.660> this<00:02:23.690> like<00:02:24.690> 2003<00:02:25.320> yeah<00:02:26.000> um<00:02:27.000> I

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
what year was this like 2003 yeah um I

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.800 
what year was this like 2003 yeah um I
really<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.670> my<00:02:29.820> opinion<00:02:30.120> but<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.450> believe

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
really this is my opinion but I believe

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.690 
really this is my opinion but I believe
that<00:02:30.840> Sims<00:02:31.230> bustin<00:02:31.470> out<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:31.920> way<00:02:32.280> better<00:02:32.520> than

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
that Sims bustin out is way better than

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.210 
that Sims bustin out is way better than
Sims<00:02:33.090> 2<00:02:33.300> that's<00:02:34.170> not<00:02:34.320> gonna<00:02:34.470> be<00:02:34.590> wrong<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:35.010> have

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
Sims 2 that's not gonna be wrong I have
