and that was kind of curious to see how
it<00:00:53.750> would<00:00:53.870> look<00:00:53.899> on<00:00:54.140> me

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
it would look on me

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.779 
it would look on me
and<00:00:55.280> when<00:00:55.429> I<00:00:55.460> first<00:00:55.760> got<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.179> wig<00:00:57.100> it<00:00:58.100> was<00:00:58.309> all

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
and when I first got the wig it was all

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.060 
and when I first got the wig it was all
this<00:00:59.210> coat<00:00:59.449> this<00:00:59.719> blonde<00:00:59.989> color<00:01:00.379> everywhere

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
this coat this blonde color everywhere

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.919 
this coat this blonde color everywhere
even<00:01:01.219> at<00:01:01.429> the<00:01:01.579> roots<00:01:01.789> I<00:01:02.030> added<00:01:02.539> this<00:01:02.690> root

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
even at the roots I added this root

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.249 
even at the roots I added this root
myself<00:01:03.410> I<00:01:03.710> heat<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.640> brown<00:01:04.850> marker<00:01:05.330> a<00:01:05.539> black

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
myself I heat the brown marker a black

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.690 
myself I heat the brown marker a black
marker<00:01:07.300> mascara<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:10.190> I<00:01:10.250> think<00:01:10.460> that<00:01:10.580> was

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
marker mascara and I think that was

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.680 
marker mascara and I think that was
about<00:01:10.789> it<00:01:11.110> I<00:01:12.159> used<00:01:13.159> like<00:01:13.429> a<00:01:13.460> prince<00:01:14.300> McCullar

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
about it I used like a prince McCullar

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.020 
about it I used like a prince McCullar
brown<00:01:15.649> marker<00:01:17.649> just<00:01:18.649> a<00:01:18.770> plain<00:01:19.039> black<00:01:19.490> sharpie

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
brown marker just a plain black sharpie

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.020 
brown marker just a plain black sharpie
and<00:01:20.800> I'd<00:01:21.800> use<00:01:22.069> a<00:01:22.100> little<00:01:22.490> bit<00:01:22.610> of<00:01:22.729> a<00:01:22.819> brown

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
and I'd use a little bit of a brown

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.510 
and I'd use a little bit of a brown
sharpie<00:01:23.920> but<00:01:25.509> this<00:01:26.509> is<00:01:26.689> how<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:27.020> came<00:01:27.200> out<00:01:27.520> when

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
sharpie but this is how it came out when

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.429 
sharpie but this is how it came out when
I<00:01:28.549> first<00:01:28.880> put<00:01:29.210> it<00:01:29.329> on<00:01:29.420> like<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.899> texture<00:01:30.320> and

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
I first put it on like the texture and

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.050 
I first put it on like the texture and
everything<00:01:30.590> it's<00:01:31.100> really<00:01:31.579> really<00:01:31.909> really

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
everything it's really really really

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.030 
everything it's really really really
nice<00:01:32.439> but<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:34.700> looks<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:35.360> fake<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.040> she's

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
nice but it looks so fake and she's

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.990 
nice but it looks so fake and she's
unrealistic<00:01:37.630> before<00:01:38.630> I<00:01:38.659> put<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.200> root<00:01:39.380> in<00:01:40.000> so

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
unrealistic before I put the root in so

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.959 
unrealistic before I put the root in so
it's<00:01:41.180> kind<00:01:41.360> of<00:01:41.390> our<00:01:41.600> our<00:01:42.350> project<00:01:42.979> doing<00:01:43.790> this

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
it's kind of our our project doing this

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.109 
it's kind of our our project doing this
hair<00:01:45.310> it's<00:01:46.310> still<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:48.460> drastic<00:01:49.460> change<00:01:49.789> from

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
hair it's still a drastic change from

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.440 
hair it's still a drastic change from
what<00:01:50.420> I<00:01:50.450> wear<00:01:50.750> usually<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:51.590> it's<00:01:51.740> I<00:01:52.329> don't<00:01:53.329> know

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
what I wear usually so it's I don't know

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.929 
what I wear usually so it's I don't know
so<00:01:54.049> I<00:01:54.500> don't<00:01:55.039> think<00:01:55.310> this<00:01:55.460> is<00:01:55.490> something<00:01:55.789> you

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
so I don't think this is something you

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.569 
so I don't think this is something you
would<00:01:56.180> want<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:56.570> wear<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.899> work<00:01:57.579> but

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
would want to wear to work but

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.539 
would want to wear to work but
definitely<00:01:59.329> we<00:01:59.570> can<00:01:59.810> here<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.380> it's<00:02:01.159> super

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
definitely we can here and it's super

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.639 
definitely we can here and it's super
duper<00:02:01.640> long<00:02:01.939> I<00:02:02.210> think<00:02:02.270> it's<00:02:02.539> like<00:02:03.939> 18<00:02:05.649> 18

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
duper long I think it's like 18 18

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.789 
duper long I think it's like 18 18
inches<00:02:07.009> maybe<00:02:07.280> 20<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.350> think<00:02:09.560> I<00:02:09.619> paid<00:02:09.829> about

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
inches maybe 20 and I think I paid about

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:17.319 
inches maybe 20 and I think I paid about
45<00:02:12.850> $44<00:02:13.850> on<00:02:14.150> hair<00:02:14.450> sisters<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:16.150> usually<00:02:17.150> always

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
45 $44 on hair sisters I usually always

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.780 
45 $44 on hair sisters I usually always
get<00:02:17.870> my<00:02:18.019> wigs<00:02:18.260> from<00:02:18.440> hair<00:02:19.040> sisters<00:02:19.459> because

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
get my wigs from hair sisters because

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.720 
get my wigs from hair sisters because
they<00:02:19.970> show<00:02:20.209> how<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.630> mannequin<00:02:21.670> how<00:02:22.670> the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
they show how the mannequin how the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.789 
they show how the mannequin how the
week's<00:02:23.030> look<00:02:23.180> on<00:02:23.329> mannequins<00:02:23.720> instead<00:02:24.680> of

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
week's look on mannequins instead of

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.410 
week's look on mannequins instead of
just<00:02:24.950> showing<00:02:25.400> what<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.730> model<00:02:26.000> looks<00:02:26.030> like

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
just showing what the model looks like

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.580 
just showing what the model looks like
and<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:28.389> think<00:02:29.389> this<00:02:29.510> color<00:02:29.750> looks<00:02:29.870> pretty<00:02:30.350> good

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
and I think this color looks pretty good

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.870 
and I think this color looks pretty good
on<00:02:31.870> my<00:02:32.870> skin<00:02:33.250> especially<00:02:34.250> with<00:02:34.400> this

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
on my skin especially with this

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.830 
on my skin especially with this
but<00:02:35.510> it's<00:02:35.660> still<00:02:35.810> kind<00:02:36.050> of<00:02:36.200> awkward<00:02:36.410> as<00:02:37.010> far<00:02:37.280> as

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
but it's still kind of awkward as far as

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.920 
but it's still kind of awkward as far as
how<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.990> lays<00:02:39.200> but<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:39.950> think<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.370> can<00:02:40.550> fix<00:02:40.730> it

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
how it lays but I think I can fix it

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.760 
how it lays but I think I can fix it
I've<00:02:42.410> already<00:02:42.730> stepped<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.850> up<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.500> lot<00:02:45.500> from

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
I've already stepped it up a lot from

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.710 
I've already stepped it up a lot from

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.380 
package and let's see it came with two
combs<00:02:54.170> in<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.530> front<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:55.070> then<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.610> comb<00:02:56.210> in

type of makeup you wear because it's not

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
it by keeping in the middle bring the

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.720 
it by keeping in the middle bring the
part<00:05:06.070> to<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.310> middle

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
part to the middle

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.050 
part to the middle
I<00:05:06.780> usually<00:05:07.780> really<00:05:08.500> don't<00:05:09.190> like<00:05:09.430> how<00:05:09.730> middle

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
I usually really don't like how middle

I usually really don't like how middle
parts<00:05:10.360> look<00:05:10.540> on<00:05:10.630> my<00:05:10.780> face<00:05:10.990> because<00:05:11.260> it<00:05:11.710> I<00:05:11.860> think

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
parts look on my face because it I think

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.610 
parts look on my face because it I think
it<00:05:12.220> elongate<00:05:12.910> it's<00:05:13.030> my<00:05:13.150> face<00:05:13.390> even<00:05:13.780> more<00:05:13.990> but

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
it elongate it's my face even more but

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.210 
it elongate it's my face even more but
it<00:05:14.740> doesn't<00:05:15.040> look<00:05:15.190> as<00:05:15.370> bad<00:05:15.400> as<00:05:16.120> I<00:05:17.160> thought<00:05:18.160> it

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
it doesn't look as bad as I thought it

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.490 
it doesn't look as bad as I thought it
would<00:05:18.490> be<00:05:18.690> it's<00:05:19.690> kind<00:05:19.900> of<00:05:19.990> cute

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
would be it's kind of cute

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:29.220 
would be it's kind of cute
this<00:05:21.130> color<00:05:21.430> is<00:05:21.520> so<00:05:22.000> nice<00:05:26.130> it<00:05:27.130> starts<00:05:28.230> all

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230

this color is so nice it starts all
blonde<00:05:29.800> I<00:05:30.310> guess<00:05:30.730> that<00:05:30.940> will<00:05:31.090> be<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:32.910> 27<00:05:33.910> and

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
blonde I guess that will be the 27 and

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.320 
blonde I guess that will be the 27 and
613<00:05:34.750> up<00:05:34.960> here<00:05:35.260> and<00:05:35.470> then<00:05:35.590> it<00:05:35.850> goes<00:05:36.850> into<00:05:37.060> the

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
613 up here and then it goes into the

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:48.440 
613 up here and then it goes into the
dark<00:05:37.720> brown<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:38.830> 30<00:05:39.100> down<00:05:39.400> here

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.110 

I<00:05:48.480> was<00:05:49.140> oom<00:05:49.320> in<00:05:49.470> on<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.830> color<00:05:50.070> a<00:05:50.430> little<00:05:51.030> bit

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
I was oom in on the color a little bit

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.950 
I was oom in on the color a little bit
closer<00:05:52.430> and<00:05:53.430> the<00:05:53.670> texture<00:05:54.150> this<00:05:54.450> texture<00:05:54.870> is

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
closer and the texture this texture is

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.900 
closer and the texture this texture is
so<00:05:55.410> really<00:05:55.770> so<00:05:56.160> nice<00:05:56.400> looks<00:05:57.120> very<00:05:57.390> realistic

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
so really so nice looks very realistic

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.870 
so really so nice looks very realistic
and<00:05:59.910> there's<00:06:00.210> my<00:06:00.540> route<00:06:00.840> that<00:06:01.590> I<00:06:01.620> did<00:06:01.950> you<00:06:02.760> can

probably<00:06:03.090> see<00:06:03.360> a<00:06:03.390> little<00:06:03.740> space<00:06:04.740> where<00:06:05.100> the

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
probably see a little space where the

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:27.399 
probably see a little space where the
weekends<00:06:06.060> and<00:06:06.180> then<00:06:06.270> my<00:06:06.480> forehead<00:06:07.350> the<00:06:08.070> end

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.409 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:31.509 

I<00:06:27.499> think<00:06:28.189> it<00:06:28.279> looks<00:06:28.459> really<00:06:28.519> pretty<00:06:30.279> it's<00:06:31.279> nice

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:31.519
