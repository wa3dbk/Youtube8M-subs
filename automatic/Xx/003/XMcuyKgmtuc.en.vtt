asus4<00:00:22.830> he<00:00:23.550> minor<00:00:23.880> seven<00:00:24.480> G<00:00:24.980> but<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.010> know<00:00:26.189> that

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
asus4 he minor seven G but I know that

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.130 
asus4 he minor seven G but I know that
because<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.939> capo<00:00:27.269> was<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.570> there<00:00:27.779> that's<00:00:27.960> not

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
because the capo was on there that's not

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.960 
because the capo was on there that's not
the<00:00:28.320> actual<00:00:28.740> chord<00:00:29.099> than<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.490> actually<00:00:29.670> is

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the actual chord than it actually is

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.690 
the actual chord than it actually is
because<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.260> D<00:00:31.410> chord<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.890> down<00:00:32.070> here<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.610> G

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
because the D chord is down here and G

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.670 
because the D chord is down here and G
chord<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.120> down<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.260> makes<00:00:34.530> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
chord is down here but it just makes it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.040 
chord is down here but it just makes it
easier<00:00:35.100> when<00:00:35.700> explaining<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.690> say<00:00:36.809> this

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
easier when explaining to just say this

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.260 
easier when explaining to just say this
is<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.380> G<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> D<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.180> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
is the G and this is the D and this is a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.330 
is the G and this is the D and this is a
name<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.050> that's<00:00:40.410> all<00:00:40.559> that's<00:00:40.829> all<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.040> got<00:00:41.219> for
