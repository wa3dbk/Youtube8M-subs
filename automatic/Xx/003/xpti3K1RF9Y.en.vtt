I<00:00:00.329> always<00:00:01.140> start<00:00:01.469> off<00:00:01.650> to<00:00:01.890> try<00:00:02.100> and<00:00:02.220> get<00:00:02.370> the

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
I always start off to try and get the

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.950 
I always start off to try and get the
the<00:00:03.090> length<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.990> plate<00:00:04.259> first<00:00:05.750> so<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:06.779> know

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
the length of the plate first so I know

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.890 
the length of the plate first so I know
that<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:07.529> master<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.490> stitching<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.570> new

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
that this master of stitching is new

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.320

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.349 
peak at the back of the spouts I know
that<00:00:28.080> roughly<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:29.340> row<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.640> stitching<00:00:30.210> here

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
that roughly this row of stitching here

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
to be in the right position for me so I

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.010 
to be in the right position for me so I
then<00:00:36.480> take<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.840> other<00:00:37.050> end<00:00:38.840> sliding<00:00:39.840> the

with the exception of dress cords or a
glint<00:00:54.949> and<00:00:55.949> then<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.160> take<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.460> piece<00:00:57.090> off<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
glint and then I take that piece off and

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.760 
glint and then I take that piece off and
I<00:00:58.320> put<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.680> piece<00:00:59.010> back<00:00:59.309> on<00:01:00.109> over<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.289> top<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
I put this piece back on over the top of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.179 
I put this piece back on over the top of
the<00:01:01.859> drum<00:01:02.070> major<00:01:02.430> sensual<00:01:02.969> Baldrick

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.469 

and<00:01:09.729> then<00:01:09.939> replace<00:01:10.359> the<00:01:10.960> long<00:01:11.170> length<00:01:12.479> over

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
and then replace the long length over

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.020 
and then replace the long length over
the<00:01:13.509> top<00:01:13.810> at<00:01:14.469> this<00:01:14.679> point<00:01:15.039> you<00:01:15.670> do<00:01:15.850> the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
the top at this point you do the

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.029 
the top at this point you do the
epilator

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
epilator

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.230 
epilator
but<00:01:18.039> this<00:01:18.250> is<00:01:18.399> where<00:01:18.549> you<00:01:18.670> would<00:01:18.759> check<00:01:19.030> the

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
but this is where you would check the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.249 
but this is where you would check the
length<00:01:19.420> again<00:01:19.869> give<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.770> thing<00:01:20.890> a<00:01:21.009> good<00:01:21.219> tug

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
length again give the thing a good tug

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.069 
length again give the thing a good tug
so<00:01:23.259> that<00:01:23.469> goes<00:01:23.649> as<00:01:23.829> tight<00:01:24.100> as<00:01:24.280> possible<00:01:25.079> once

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
so that goes as tight as possible once

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.319 
so that goes as tight as possible once
again<00:01:26.469> check<00:01:26.799> everything's<00:01:27.369> right<00:01:27.670> if<00:01:27.939> you're

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
again check everything's right if you're

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.899 
again check everything's right if you're
not<00:01:28.509> wearing<00:01:28.959> a<00:01:29.049> drum<00:01:29.289> major<00:01:29.500> sash<00:01:29.920> this

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
not wearing a drum major sash this

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.990 
not wearing a drum major sash this
slider<00:01:31.359> here<00:01:31.569> on<00:01:31.959> the<00:01:32.079> cross<00:01:32.289> belt<00:01:32.759> should<00:01:33.759> go

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
slider here on the cross belt should go

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.069 
slider here on the cross belt should go
up<00:01:34.270> against<00:01:35.049> this<00:01:35.770> edge<00:01:36.069> the<00:01:36.579> bottom<00:01:36.609> edge<00:01:37.149> of

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
up against this edge the bottom edge of

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.719 
up against this edge the bottom edge of
the<00:01:38.140> piece<00:01:38.530> of<00:01:38.740> plate<00:01:39.009> that's<00:01:39.280> wrapped<00:01:39.549> around

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
the piece of plate that's wrapped around

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.229 
the piece of plate that's wrapped around
the<00:01:39.969> front<00:01:40.090> of<00:01:40.359> it<00:01:40.509> you<00:01:40.750> then<00:01:41.259> take<00:01:42.239> long

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:43.239 
the front of it you then take long

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:46.169 
the front of it you then take long
lengths<00:01:43.539> throw<00:01:43.899> it<00:01:44.020> over<00:01:44.259> this<00:01:44.379> shoulder<00:01:45.179> so

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
lengths throw it over this shoulder so

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.499 
lengths throw it over this shoulder so
the<00:01:46.390> short<00:01:46.629> length<00:01:46.840> back<00:01:47.789> this<00:01:48.789> then<00:01:49.179> gets

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
the short length back this then gets

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.429 
the short length back this then gets
tucked<00:01:49.840> into<00:01:50.200> all<00:01:50.619> of<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.950> sashes<00:01:51.219> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
tucked into all of the sashes and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.199 
tucked into all of the sashes and
anything<00:01:53.439> crossing<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.129> body<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.939> it<00:01:55.030> goes

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
anything crossing the body and it goes

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.959 
anything crossing the body and it goes
through<00:01:55.569> the<00:01:55.719> waist<00:01:55.899> belt<00:01:56.170> at<00:01:56.590> back<00:01:56.979> you<00:01:57.759> then

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
through the waist belt at back you then

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.719 
through the waist belt at back you then
throw<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:58.509> long<00:01:59.140> link<00:01:59.379> back<00:01:59.709> it's<00:02:00.399> still

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
throw this long link back it's still

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.599 
throw this long link back it's still
nice<00:02:00.939> and<00:02:00.969> flat<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.869> then<00:02:02.560> take<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:03.250> first

take these first two pleats and we pin

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.349 
take these first two pleats and we pin
through<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.530> bulk<00:02:23.769> of<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.190> section<00:02:24.669> across
