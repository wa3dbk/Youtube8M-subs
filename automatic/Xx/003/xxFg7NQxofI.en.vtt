00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
denture and what this is is a denture

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.789 
denture and what this is is a denture
without<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.799> palate<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.459> lot<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.090> people

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
without the palate a lot of people

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.530 
without the palate a lot of people
suffer<00:02:38.799> from<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:39.099> gag<00:02:39.340> reflex<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.120> they<00:02:40.360> don't

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
like the roof of the mouth being covered

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.240 
like the roof of the mouth being covered
with<00:02:43.180> plastic<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.560> what<00:02:44.709> we<00:02:44.829> can<00:02:44.950> do<00:02:45.069> with

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
denture so they don't have to go through

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.870 
denture so they don't have to go through
the<00:03:19.239> expense<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.780> new<00:03:19.959> dentures<00:03:20.410> we<00:03:20.620> can<00:03:20.880> you

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
the expense of new dentures we can you

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.940 
the expense of new dentures we can you
know<00:03:22.000> retrofit<00:03:22.780> them<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.319> many<00:03:23.500> implants

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
know retrofit them to the many implants

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.900 
know retrofit them to the many implants
and<00:03:24.160> remove<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.639> palate<00:03:25.060> for<00:03:25.269> them<00:03:25.450> that's

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
and remove that palate for them that's

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.700 
and remove that palate for them that's
and<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.420> third<00:03:26.630> example<00:03:26.960> you<00:03:27.140> have<00:03:27.320> here<00:03:27.500> are

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
and the third example you have here are

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.950 
and the third example you have here are
the<00:03:27.920> implants<00:03:28.370> /<00:03:28.640> -<00:03:28.850> right<00:03:29.300> well<00:03:29.510> this<00:03:29.660> is<00:03:29.810> an

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
the implants / - right well this is an

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.050 
the implants / - right well this is an
example<00:03:30.260> here<00:03:30.980> is<00:03:31.160> just<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.460> single<00:03:31.850> tooth

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
example here is just a single tooth

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.640 
example here is just a single tooth
replacement<00:03:32.870> let<00:03:33.050> me<00:03:33.170> see<00:03:33.320> if<00:03:33.380> I<00:03:33.440> can<00:03:33.560> think

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
replacement let me see if I can think

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.820 
replacement let me see if I can think
that<00:03:33.860> oh<00:03:34.090> here's<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.180> single<00:03:35.630> tooth<00:03:35.870> that<00:03:36.230> would

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
that oh here's a single tooth that would

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.350 
that oh here's a single tooth that would
be<00:03:36.950> replaced<00:03:37.340> with<00:03:37.520> a<00:03:37.550> mini<00:03:37.760> implant<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.300> then

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
be replaced with a mini implant and then

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.900 
be replaced with a mini implant and then
cemented<00:03:38.900> in<00:03:39.020> place<00:03:39.050> and<00:03:39.770> here's<00:03:40.430> an<00:03:40.580> example

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
cemented in place and here's an example

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.050 
cemented in place and here's an example
of<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.270> bridge<00:03:41.960> with<00:03:42.350> four<00:03:43.040> mini<00:03:43.280> implants<00:03:43.760> and

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
of a bridge with four mini implants and

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.750 
of a bridge with four mini implants and
that<00:03:44.840> again<00:03:45.410> would<00:03:45.590> be<00:03:45.620> cemented<00:03:46.040> right<00:03:46.520> so

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
that again would be cemented right so

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.070 
that again would be cemented right so
they<00:03:46.850> would<00:03:47.000> never<00:03:47.120> take<00:03:47.360> those<00:03:47.570> out<00:03:47.780> they're

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
they would never take those out they're

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.730 
they would never take those out they're
cemented<00:03:48.590> in<00:03:49.510> as<00:03:50.510> if<00:03:50.720> somebody<00:03:51.200> has<00:03:51.350> a<00:03:51.380> lot<00:03:51.620> of
