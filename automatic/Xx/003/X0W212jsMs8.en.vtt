going to show you my solo strategy for

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.570 
going to show you my solo strategy for
nuketown<00:00:15.030> 2025<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:16.440> new<00:00:16.650> zombies<00:00:17.160> map<00:00:17.190> that's

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
nuketown 2025 the new zombies map that's

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.910 
nuketown 2025 the new zombies map that's
available<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:18.090> season<00:00:18.330> pass<00:00:18.480> holders<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:19.050> got

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
available for season pass holders I got

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.230 
available for season pass holders I got
to<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> pretty<00:00:20.310> high<00:00:20.460> round<00:00:20.760> using<00:00:21.150> this

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
to a pretty high round using this

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.810 
to a pretty high round using this
strategy<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.199> think<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:22.980> probably<00:00:23.460> one

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
strategy and I think it's probably one

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.769 
strategy and I think it's probably one
of<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> best<00:00:24.119> I'm<00:00:24.330> not<00:00:24.449> going<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.630> make<00:00:24.720> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
of the best I'm not going to make a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.300 
of the best I'm not going to make a
thumbnail<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.320> says<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.769> know<00:00:25.859> world's

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
thumbnail that says you know world's

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.000 
thumbnail that says you know world's
best<00:00:26.550> nuketown<00:00:27.449> strategy<00:00:28.410> like<00:00:28.560> some<00:00:28.769> people

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
best nuketown strategy like some people

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.679 
best nuketown strategy like some people
do<00:00:29.099> because<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.490> know<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:30.029> mean<00:00:30.240> can<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.449> prove

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
do because you know I mean can you prove

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.139 
do because you know I mean can you prove
it<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:30.900> what's<00:00:31.080> best<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.890> did<00:00:32.759> get<00:00:32.910> two

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
it so what's best but I did get two

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.389 
it so what's best but I did get two
rounds<00:00:34.050> up<00:00:34.200> into<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> 30s<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> high

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
rounds up into the 30s and it's the high

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.490 
rounds up into the 30s and it's the high
20s<00:00:35.790> using<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.180> strategy<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.140> I'm<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
20s using this strategy so I'm going to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.770 
20s using this strategy so I'm going to
show<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.800> off<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.120> first<00:00:39.300> thing<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.629> always

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
show it off so the first thing is always

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.660 
show it off so the first thing is always
I<00:00:40.079> i<00:00:40.410> recommend<00:00:41.010> picking<00:00:41.160> up<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.460> quicker

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
I i recommend picking up the quicker

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.090 
I i recommend picking up the quicker
vibe<00:00:41.910> right<00:00:42.210> at<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> start<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:43.530> pretty<00:00:43.920> easy

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
vibe right at the start it's pretty easy

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.680 
vibe right at the start it's pretty easy
to<00:00:44.219> go<00:00:44.399> down<00:00:44.610> at<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> early<00:00:45.120> levels<00:00:45.450> if<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
to go down at the early levels if you

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.479 
to go down at the early levels if you
don't<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.079> Juggernog<00:00:46.530> get<00:00:46.950> three<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.250> them

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
don't have Juggernog get three of them

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.180 
don't have Juggernog get three of them
so<00:00:47.850> I'll<00:00:48.480> find<00:00:48.809> where<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.110> spawn<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.980> pick

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
so I'll find where that spawn is in pick

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.459 
so I'll find where that spawn is in pick
it<00:00:50.309> up<00:00:51.079> um<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:53.370> next<00:00:53.640> thing<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.820> recommend<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
it up um the next thing I recommend is

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.139 
it up um the next thing I recommend is
moving<00:00:55.469> into<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:55.980> yellow<00:00:56.399> house<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.030> we'll

those<00:01:44.759> doors<00:01:44.970> closed<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.840> don't

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
those doors closed so that you don't

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.840 
those doors closed so that you don't
have<00:01:46.049> zombies<00:01:46.470> coming<00:01:46.740> through<00:01:47.100> when<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.520> run

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
have zombies coming through when you run

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.210 
have zombies coming through when you run
this<00:01:48.090> pattern<00:01:48.600> see<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.710> want<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.040> door

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
this pattern see we want that door

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.620 
this pattern see we want that door
closed<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:50.970> run<00:01:51.180> right<00:01:51.420> by<00:01:51.600> it

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
closed we can just run right by it

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.810 
closed we can just run right by it
safely<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.680> what<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.070> recommend<00:01:53.369> doing<00:01:53.579> is

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
safely and what I recommend doing is

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.999 
safely and what I recommend doing is
just<00:01:53.850> kind<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.210> running<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.720> circle<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.860> you

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
just kind of running this circle if you

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.620 
just kind of running this circle if you
see<00:01:56.219> what<00:01:56.399> I'm<00:01:56.490> doing<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.790> run<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.210> exact

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
see what I'm doing just run this exact

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.109 
see what I'm doing just run this exact
circle<00:01:58.110> using<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.920> variation<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.549> sprint<00:01:59.969> and

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
circle using a variation of sprint and

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.810 
circle using a variation of sprint and
walking<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.799> you'll<00:02:01.950> start<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.219> pull<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
walking and you'll start to pull the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.090 
walking and you'll start to pull the
zombies<00:02:03.210> up

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
zombies up

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.130 
zombies up
be<00:02:04.220> really<00:02:04.460> nice<00:02:04.640> what<00:02:05.540> you<00:02:05.659> want<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.900> keep<00:02:06.020> in

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
be really nice what you want to keep in

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.510 
be really nice what you want to keep in
mind<00:02:06.170> is<00:02:06.409> that<00:02:06.470> there<00:02:06.619> are<00:02:06.680> some<00:02:06.890> choke<00:02:07.130> points

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
mind is that there are some choke points

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.249 
mind is that there are some choke points
like<00:02:07.700> right<00:02:07.970> there<00:02:08.149> at<00:02:08.270> that<00:02:08.390> rock<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:08.899> you

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
like right there at that rock and you

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.020 
like right there at that rock and you
can<00:02:09.410> go<00:02:09.590> on<00:02:09.860> either<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.310> left<00:02:10.520> or<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.850> right

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
can go on either the left or the right

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.479 
can go on either the left or the right
of<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.420> rock<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:12.620> make<00:02:12.770> sure<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:13.069> look<00:02:13.310> at

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
of the rock so make sure you look at

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.220 
of the rock so make sure you look at
what<00:02:13.640> you're<00:02:13.819> dealing<00:02:14.000> with<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.540> shoot<00:02:15.050> any

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
what you're dealing with and shoot any

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.540 
what you're dealing with and shoot any
zombies<00:02:15.739> if<00:02:15.890> they're<00:02:16.040> blocking<00:02:16.310> your<00:02:16.520> way

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
zombies if they're blocking your way

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.059 
zombies if they're blocking your way
this<00:02:17.120> probably<00:02:17.450> only<00:02:17.690> works<00:02:17.989> at<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.440> early

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
this probably only works at the early

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.680 
this probably only works at the early
levels<00:02:19.400> but<00:02:19.610> you'll<00:02:19.940> see<00:02:20.060> here<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.270> get<00:02:20.420> stuck

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
levels but you'll see here I get stuck

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.570 
levels but you'll see here I get stuck
on<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:20.959> Bush<00:02:21.200> but<00:02:21.830> I'm<00:02:21.950> able<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.220> shoot<00:02:22.400> that

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
on that Bush but I'm able to shoot that

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.699 
on that Bush but I'm able to shoot that
zombie<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.120> get<00:02:23.239> out<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:24.080> make<00:02:24.380> sure<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.680> just

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
zombie and get out so make sure you just

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.320 
zombie and get out so make sure you just
see<00:02:25.130> what<00:02:25.310> you're<00:02:25.430> working<00:02:25.489> with<00:02:25.670> kill

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
see what you're working with kill

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.370 
see what you're working with kill
zombies<00:02:26.690> if<00:02:26.840> they're<00:02:27.020> in<00:02:27.110> your<00:02:27.230> way

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
zombies if they're in your way

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.559 
zombies if they're in your way
especially<00:02:28.010> at<00:02:28.489> this<00:02:28.610> early<00:02:28.790> level<00:02:29.300> when<00:02:29.480> you

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
especially at this early level when you

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.120 
especially at this early level when you
don't<00:02:29.780> have<00:02:29.989> juggernaut<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:30.770> want<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.040> be

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
don't have juggernaut you want to be

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.030 
don't have juggernaut you want to be
very<00:02:31.160> careful<00:02:31.670> not<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.209> get<00:02:32.300> close<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.720> anyone

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
very careful not to get close to anyone

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.620 
very careful not to get close to anyone
and<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.340> can't<00:02:34.550> be<00:02:34.610> easy<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:35.060> get<00:02:35.209> tripped<00:02:35.480> up

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
and it can't be easy to get tripped up

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.180 
and it can't be easy to get tripped up
so<00:02:35.989> run<00:02:36.470> this<00:02:36.620> circle<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:36.980> I'll<00:02:37.040> show<00:02:37.160> you

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
so run this circle and I'll show you

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.699 
so run this circle and I'll show you
what<00:02:37.310> looks<00:02:37.459> like<00:02:37.550> at<00:02:37.640> higher<00:02:37.819> levels<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:42.590> when

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
what looks like at higher levels so when

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.290 
what looks like at higher levels so when
the<00:02:42.800> zombie<00:02:43.069> start<00:02:43.280> coming<00:02:43.550> faster<00:02:44.090> they'll

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
the zombie start coming faster they'll

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.790 
the zombie start coming faster they'll
get<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.600> runners<00:02:44.959> on<00:02:45.260> they'll<00:02:45.440> be<00:02:45.500> spawning

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
get the runners on they'll be spawning

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.229 
get the runners on they'll be spawning
in<00:02:45.980> make<00:02:46.220> sure<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.670> you're<00:02:46.819> using<00:02:46.850> your

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
in make sure that you're using your

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.360 
in make sure that you're using your
sprint<00:02:47.600> wisely<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.319> i<00:02:48.440> recommend<00:02:48.739> sprinting

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
sprint wisely and i recommend sprinting

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.000 
sprint wisely and i recommend sprinting
through<00:02:49.550> what<00:02:49.819> i<00:02:49.850> call<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.300> choke<00:02:50.540> points<00:02:51.010> the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
through what i call the choke points the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.830 
through what i call the choke points the
checkpoints<00:02:52.519> are<00:02:52.610> right<00:02:52.910> here<00:02:53.300> between<00:02:53.510> this

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
checkpoints are right here between this

checkpoints are right here between this
bush<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.319> fireplace<00:02:54.830> right<00:02:55.730> here

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
bush and the fireplace right here

and right here between the the stairs
and<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.530> house<00:03:00.709> those<00:03:01.370> are<00:03:01.519> pretty<00:03:01.700> much<00:03:01.910> the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
and the house those are pretty much the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.199 
and the house those are pretty much the
most<00:03:02.390> easy<00:03:02.780> places<00:03:03.319> for<00:03:03.769> you<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:03.890> get<00:03:04.220> mopped

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
most easy places for you to get mopped

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.699 
most easy places for you to get mopped
up<00:03:05.420> with<00:03:05.600> some<00:03:05.750> of<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.930> zombies<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.530> so<00:03:06.680> I

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
up with some of the zombies and so I

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.500 
up with some of the zombies and so I
recommend<00:03:07.010> using<00:03:07.459> your<00:03:07.700> sprint<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.239> even<00:03:08.420> you

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
recommend using your sprint and even you

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.880 
recommend using your sprint and even you
see<00:03:08.660> there<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:08.840> jumped<00:03:09.260> over<00:03:09.500> some<00:03:09.709> of<00:03:09.739> these

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
see there I jumped over some of these

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.569 
see there I jumped over some of these
zombies<00:03:10.310> get<00:03:11.299> through<00:03:11.540> these<00:03:11.690> areas<00:03:12.110> as<00:03:12.709> fast

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
zombies get through these areas as fast

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.430 
zombies get through these areas as fast
as<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:13.880> can<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.660> don't<00:03:14.840> want<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.079> get<00:03:15.170> pinned

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
as you can you don't want to get pinned

much<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.110> only<00:03:28.230> two<00:03:28.560> places<00:03:28.799> that<00:03:29.159> I'm<00:03:29.280> safe

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
take my own advice and I actually step

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.230 
take my own advice and I actually step
forward<00:04:36.380> so<00:04:36.560> you<00:04:36.650> see<00:04:36.860> I<00:04:36.890> just<00:04:37.220> shot<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:37.730> killed

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.940 
forward so you see I just shot I killed
some<00:04:38.480> of<00:04:38.510> my<00:04:38.660> pool<00:04:38.930> I<00:04:39.170> didn't<00:04:39.410> really<00:04:39.530> wait<00:04:39.740> for

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
some of my pool I didn't really wait for

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.570 
some of my pool I didn't really wait for
it<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.070> get<00:04:40.310> to<00:04:41.030> get<00:04:41.150> big<00:04:41.330> enough<00:04:41.420> again<00:04:41.810> I

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.890 

typically<00:04:46.580> only<00:04:46.790> shoot<00:04:47.180> at<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.390> zombies<00:04:47.750> when

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
typically only shoot at the zombies when

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.740 
typically only shoot at the zombies when
my<00:04:48.020> pool<00:04:48.260> is<00:04:48.440> pretty<00:04:48.680> big

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
my pool is pretty big

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.159 
my pool is pretty big
this<00:04:50.230> game<00:04:50.470> was<00:04:50.650> going<00:04:50.830> well<00:04:51.160> into

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
this game was going well into

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.570 
this game was going well into
you<00:04:53.349> can<00:04:53.710> see<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:53.889> start<00:04:54.159> to<00:04:54.249> play<00:04:54.400> a<00:04:54.430> little

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
you can see I start to play a little

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.600 
you can see I start to play a little
sloppy

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.760 

but<00:04:59.610> there<00:04:59.820> I<00:04:59.850> took<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.240> step<00:05:00.510> forward<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:01.260> I

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
but there I took a step forward and I

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.740 
but there I took a step forward and I
got<00:05:01.920> caught<00:05:02.250> up<00:05:02.430> right<00:05:02.730> in<00:05:02.760> my<00:05:03.000> choke<00:05:03.270> point<00:05:03.540> in

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
got caught up right in my choke point in

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.050 
got caught up right in my choke point in
the<00:05:03.870> bush<00:05:04.080> so<00:05:05.040> I<00:05:05.370> didn't<00:05:05.670> take<00:05:05.790> my<00:05:05.940> own<00:05:06.030> advice

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
the bush so I didn't take my own advice
