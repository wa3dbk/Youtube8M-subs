00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
of nothing it was just a bunch of

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.340 
of nothing it was just a bunch of
matches<00:00:24.269> there<00:00:24.449> was<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> few<00:00:24.869> storyline

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
matches there was a few storyline

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.800 
matches there was a few storyline
progressions<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.130> since<00:00:26.910> raw<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.180> taped<00:00:27.570> and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
progressions but since raw is taped and

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.939 
progressions but since raw is taped and
since<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.170> kind<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.680> results

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
since you kind of have the results

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.669 
since you kind of have the results
before<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.699> think<00:00:30.689> they<00:00:30.840> kind<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.199> do<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> thing

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
before I think they kind of do a thing

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.250 
before I think they kind of do a thing
where<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.040> like<00:00:32.099> let's<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.149> give<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:34.050> fans

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
where it's like let's not give the fans

because

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
because

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.190 
because
I<00:02:13.980> think<00:02:14.700> AJ<00:02:15.030> plays<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> good<00:02:15.540> job<00:02:15.720> being<00:02:15.930> crazy

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
I think AJ plays a good job being crazy

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.140 
I think AJ plays a good job being crazy
big<00:02:16.710> E's<00:02:16.890> kind<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.430> tweener<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
big E's kind of that tweener in the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.630 
big E's kind of that tweener in the
middle<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.660> then<00:02:18.830> Dolph<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:20.100> Dolph<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.610> I

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
middle and then Dolph is Dolph and I

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.010 
middle and then Dolph is Dolph and I
think<00:02:20.850> he's<00:02:21.000> pretty<00:02:21.240> much<00:02:21.420> great<00:02:21.690> at<00:02:21.840> being

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
think he's pretty much great at being

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.070 
think he's pretty much great at being
the<00:02:22.200> bad<00:02:22.380> guy<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.130> just<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.420> bumps<00:02:24.780> he<00:02:24.870> takes

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
the bad guy and just the bumps he takes

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.600 
the bad guy and just the bumps he takes
for<00:02:25.260> Big<00:02:25.410> E<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.650> incredible<00:02:26.130> this<00:02:26.220> big<00:02:26.400> he's

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
for Big E is incredible this big he's

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.010 
for Big E is incredible this big he's
huge<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.000> then<00:02:27.150> compared<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.510> Ziggler<00:02:27.780> he

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
huge and then compared to Ziggler he

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.420 
huge and then compared to Ziggler he
flies<00:02:28.380> left<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:28.890> right<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.160> think<00:02:29.340> it

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
flies left and right and I think it

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.460 
flies left and right and I think it
really<00:02:29.460> makes<00:02:29.760> for<00:02:29.940> great<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.420> great<00:02:31.020> story

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
really makes for great a great story

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.150 
really makes for great a great story
being<00:02:31.770> told<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:32.280> on<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.120> situation<00:02:33.330> at<00:02:33.810> hand

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
being told on on the situation at hand

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.150 
being told on on the situation at hand
so<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.520> was<00:02:36.060> ok<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.540> then<00:02:37.050> Christian<00:02:37.890> and

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
so that was ok and then Christian and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.750 
so that was ok and then Christian and
Alberto<00:02:38.580> Del<00:02:38.790> Rio<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.380> call<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.760> decent

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
Alberto Del Rio I call this is decent

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.800 
Alberto Del Rio I call this is decent
match<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.150> really<00:02:42.390> thought<00:02:42.540> they<00:02:42.690> were

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
match and I really thought they were

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.840 
match and I really thought they were
doing<00:02:42.990> van<00:02:43.230> dam<00:02:43.470> burst<00:02:43.770> del<00:02:44.280> Rio<00:02:44.459> at

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
doing van dam burst del Rio at

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.900 
doing van dam burst del Rio at
SummerSlam<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:46.740> dam<00:02:47.070> burst<00:02:47.370> obvious<00:02:47.670> yeah

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
SummerSlam and dam burst obvious yeah

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.250 
SummerSlam and dam burst obvious yeah
but<00:02:48.240> it<00:02:48.450> looks<00:02:48.600> like<00:02:48.690> they<00:02:48.870> might<00:02:48.990> be<00:02:49.140> home

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
but it looks like they might be home

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.690 
but it looks like they might be home
with<00:02:49.380> Christian<00:02:49.800> now<00:02:49.890> since<00:02:50.130> he<00:02:50.250> did<00:02:50.400> pin<00:02:50.580> the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
with Christian now since he did pin the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.240 
with Christian now since he did pin the
champion<00:02:51.230> maybe<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.320> triple<00:02:52.620> threat<00:02:52.650> match<00:02:52.830> I

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.000 
was a good match i enjoyed it Brian one
with<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.330> small<00:03:12.600> package<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.739> think<00:03:13.920> he's

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
with a small package and I think he's

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.530 
with a small package and I think he's
trying<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.280> do<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:14.520> whole<00:03:14.580> thing<00:03:14.730> where<00:03:15.090> he's

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
trying to do this whole thing where he's

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.390 
trying to do this whole thing where he's
waiting<00:03:15.810> with<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.930> small<00:03:16.170> package<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:17.220> think

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
waiting with a small package and I think

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.100 
waiting with a small package and I think
this<00:03:17.489> is<00:03:17.550> going<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.700> make<00:03:17.850> for<00:03:18.060> great<00:03:18.209> match<00:03:18.870> at

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
the greatest match but for a raw of main

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.960 
the greatest match but for a raw of main
event<00:04:12.989> that<00:04:13.170> kind<00:04:13.320> of<00:04:13.350> really<00:04:13.560> had<00:04:13.850> you<00:04:14.850> know

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970

event that kind of really had you know
whatever<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.720> guess<00:04:15.989> is<00:04:16.169> because<00:04:16.410> he<00:04:16.709> put<00:04:16.919> Bryan

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
whatever I guess is because he put Bryan

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.409 
whatever I guess is because he put Bryan
through<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.430> table<00:04:17.579> so<00:04:17.880> now<00:04:18.000> he's<00:04:18.150> gonna<00:04:18.239> get

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
through a table so now he's gonna get

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.270 
through a table so now he's gonna get
put<00:04:18.630> through<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.810> table<00:04:18.840> himself<00:04:19.440> but<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.190> was
