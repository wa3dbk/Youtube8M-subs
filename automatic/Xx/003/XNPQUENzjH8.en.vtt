you just want to make sure that you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.190 
you just want to make sure that you
really<00:01:15.360> whisk<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.869> really<00:01:16.170> good<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.009> you

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
really whisk that in really good so you

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.469 
really whisk that in really good so you

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
we're gonna go ahead and start adding

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.010 
we're gonna go ahead and start adding
the<00:01:23.729> fat<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.450> case<00:01:24.720> I'm<00:01:24.990> using

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the fat in this case I'm using

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.859 
the fat in this case I'm using
shortening<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.970> could<00:01:27.119> actually<00:01:27.330> use

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
shortening but you could actually use

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.870 
shortening but you could actually use
butter<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.710> prefer<00:01:29.070> butter<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.700> could

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
butter if you prefer butter you could

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.480 
butter if you prefer butter you could
use<00:01:30.090> lard<00:01:30.570> some<00:01:31.500> people<00:01:31.740> may<00:01:31.890> not<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.460> that

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
use lard some people may not like that

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.249 
use lard some people may not like that
but<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.939> actually<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.360> pretty<00:01:33.600> good<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
but it actually can be pretty good you

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.230 
but it actually can be pretty good you
could<00:01:34.350> even<00:01:34.500> try<00:01:34.650> bacon<00:01:35.130> fat<00:01:35.430> if<00:01:35.880> you're<00:01:36.030> using

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
could even try bacon fat if you're using

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.120 
could even try bacon fat if you're using
butter<00:01:36.630> would<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.259> cold<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.979> want

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
butter would it have to be cold you want

batter<00:01:45.899> okay<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.799> basically<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.189> going<00:01:47.399> to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
batter okay so basically just going to

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.980 
batter okay so basically just going to
continue<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.909> incorporate<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.570> until<00:01:48.930> you

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
continue to incorporate this until you

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.670 
continue to incorporate this until you
get<00:01:49.200> smaller<00:01:49.560> than<00:01:49.799> pea-sized<00:01:50.340> pieces<00:01:51.500> you<00:01:52.500> go

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
get smaller than pea-sized pieces you go

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.940 
get smaller than pea-sized pieces you go
alright<00:01:54.049> okay<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.290> only<00:01:55.380> takes<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.920> few

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.740 
gonna have to fold it out a little bit
I<00:03:07.340> think<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.700> key<00:03:07.850> words<00:03:08.060> are<00:03:08.270> what<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:08.630> just

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
I think the key words are what you just

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.600 
I think the key words are what you just
said<00:03:08.990> it's<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.500> dough<00:03:09.650> not<00:03:09.920> about<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:10.340> right

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
said it's a dough not about it right

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.030 
said it's a dough not about it right
alright<00:03:11.060> so<00:03:11.540> anyway<00:03:11.900> this<00:03:12.440> might<00:03:12.680> just<00:03:12.710> use<00:03:13.010> a

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
alright so anyway this might just use a

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.950 
alright so anyway this might just use a
little<00:03:13.370> bit<00:03:13.550> more<00:03:13.670> milk<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.480> then<00:03:14.600> once<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:14.840> got

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
little bit more milk and then once I got

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.910 
little bit more milk and then once I got
incorporated<00:03:15.320> we'll<00:03:15.740> roll<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.100> out<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:17.920> you

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
incorporated we'll roll it out so you

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.350 
incorporated we'll roll it out so you
can<00:03:19.190> see<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.550> it<00:03:19.670> started<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.000> come<00:03:20.180> together

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
can see that it started to come together

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.720 
can see that it started to come together
now<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.080> it's<00:03:22.010> basically<00:03:22.250> ready<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.550> be

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
now and it's basically ready to be

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.400 
now and it's basically ready to be
rolled<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.420> again<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.870> same<00:03:24.080> thing<00:03:24.290> on

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
rolled and again the same thing on

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.740 
rolled and again the same thing on
rolling<00:03:24.830> you<00:03:24.950> don't<00:03:25.250> want<00:03:25.580> to<00:03:25.670> do<00:03:25.850> too<00:03:26.570> much

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
rolling you don't want to do too much

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.780 
rolling you don't want to do too much
because<00:03:27.440> again<00:03:27.470> if<00:03:27.860> you<00:03:27.950> try<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:28.220> do<00:03:28.310> too<00:03:28.640> much

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
because again if you try and do too much

didn't realize I've been guilty of that

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.420 
didn't realize I've been guilty of that
more<00:04:36.080> than<00:04:36.260> once<00:04:37.270> there<00:04:38.270> is<00:04:38.620> science<00:04:39.620> baking

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
more than once there is science baking

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.800 
more than once there is science baking
is<00:04:40.520> definitely<00:04:40.669> much<00:04:41.000> more<00:04:41.030> of<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.360> science

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
is definitely much more of a science

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.070 
is definitely much more of a science
than<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.680> savory<00:04:43.130> side<00:04:43.160> of<00:04:43.580> food<00:04:43.840> so<00:04:44.840> anyway

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
little butter on top of them when they

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.600 
little butter on top of them when they
come<00:04:53.690> out<00:04:53.720> Oh<00:04:54.199> as<00:04:54.650> usual<00:04:54.889> you<00:04:55.220> make<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:55.490> look

very<00:04:55.820> easy<00:04:56.979> but<00:04:57.979> I<00:04:58.070> think<00:04:58.100> this<00:04:58.370> is<00:04:58.580> one

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
very easy but I think this is one

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.760 
very easy but I think this is one
anybody<00:04:59.450> can<00:04:59.600> do<00:04:59.690> I<00:04:59.870> think<00:05:00.110> so<00:05:00.260> too<00:05:00.320> and<00:05:00.500> I

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
anybody can do I think so too and I

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.620 
anybody can do I think so too and I
think<00:05:01.010> by<00:05:01.220> adding<00:05:01.580> something<00:05:01.790> like<00:05:01.910> chives<00:05:02.330> or

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
think by adding something like chives or

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.659 
think by adding something like chives or
some<00:05:02.780> other<00:05:02.930> herb<00:05:03.139> you<00:05:03.680> actually<00:05:04.100> elevate<00:05:04.520> it

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
some other herb you actually elevate it

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.990 
some other herb you actually elevate it
and<00:05:04.760> you<00:05:04.850> make<00:05:05.000> it<00:05:05.030> a<00:05:05.240> much<00:05:06.200> more<00:05:06.229> interesting

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
and you make it a much more interesting

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.780 
and you make it a much more interesting
food<00:05:08.000> absolutely<00:05:08.690> and<00:05:09.520> homemade<00:05:10.520> is<00:05:10.610> always

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
food absolutely and homemade is always

best<00:05:13.630> anything<00:05:14.630> bread<00:05:15.110> I<00:05:15.139> think<00:05:15.650> and<00:05:16.400> you<00:05:16.610> can

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
best anything bread I think and you can

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.800 
best anything bread I think and you can
reroll<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:18.260> dough<00:05:18.590> maybe<00:05:19.430> one<00:05:19.760> more<00:05:20.000> time<00:05:20.300> but

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
reroll the dough maybe one more time but

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.000 
reroll the dough maybe one more time but
if<00:05:20.870> you<00:05:20.960> have<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.200> re-roll<00:05:21.470> up<00:05:21.620> more<00:05:21.770> than<00:05:21.889> that

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
if you have to re-roll up more than that

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.480 
if you have to re-roll up more than that
you're<00:05:22.220> going<00:05:22.340> to<00:05:22.400> make<00:05:22.520> it<00:05:22.700> really<00:05:22.880> tough<00:05:24.490> so

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490
