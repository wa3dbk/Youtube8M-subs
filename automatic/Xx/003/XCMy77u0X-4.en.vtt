00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
and listen to them that's I think that's

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.800 
and listen to them that's I think that's
one<00:01:07.640> of<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.760> things<00:01:07.909> that<00:01:08.030> we<00:01:08.390> do<00:01:08.600> in<00:01:08.720> the

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
one of the things that we do in the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.230 
one of the things that we do in the
military<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.620> we<00:01:09.950> listen<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.340> each<00:01:10.490> each<00:01:10.940> other

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
military is we listen to each each other

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.899 
military is we listen to each each other
and<00:01:11.780> come<00:01:12.020> out<00:01:12.229> with<00:01:12.440> come<00:01:12.770> up<00:01:12.890> with<00:01:13.100> a<00:01:13.340> goal<00:01:13.520> or

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.180 
and come out with come up with a goal or
a<00:01:13.970> plan<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.990> reason<00:01:15.260> I<00:01:15.320> chose<00:01:15.500> family

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
a plan the reason I chose family

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.180 
a plan the reason I chose family
medicine<00:01:16.450> was<00:01:17.450> due<00:01:18.260> to<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.440> fact<00:01:18.470> that<00:01:18.740> the

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
medicine was due to the fact that the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.950 
medicine was due to the fact that the
scope<00:01:19.460> of<00:01:19.640> things<00:01:19.790> you're<00:01:20.000> able<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.270> take<00:01:20.630> care

of a newborn all the way to it to the

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.830 
of a newborn all the way to it to the
