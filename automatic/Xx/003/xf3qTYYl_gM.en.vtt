00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.960 

another<00:02:12.010> feature<00:02:13.010> everyone<00:02:13.489> was<00:02:13.580> asking<00:02:13.850> this

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
another feature everyone was asking this

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.030 
another feature everyone was asking this
about<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.300> Bluetooth<00:02:14.690> in<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.900> vehicle<00:02:15.260> this

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
about is Bluetooth in the vehicle this

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.130 
about is Bluetooth in the vehicle this
one<00:02:16.220> is<00:02:16.340> actually<00:02:16.430> wired<00:02:16.850> directly<00:02:17.600> to<00:02:17.930> the

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
one is actually wired directly to the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.620 
one is actually wired directly to the
radio<00:02:18.440> through<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.310> actual<00:02:19.819> connector<00:02:20.239> so<00:02:20.510> it

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
radio through the actual connector so it

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.880 
radio through the actual connector so it
is<00:02:20.750> charging<00:02:21.050> if<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.290> actually<00:02:21.410> look<00:02:21.620> up<00:02:21.680> here

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
is charging if you actually look up here

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.430 
is charging if you actually look up here
it<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.880> full<00:02:23.150> charge<00:02:23.420> right<00:02:23.569> now<00:02:23.630> once<00:02:24.260> it's

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
it is full charge right now once it's

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.040 
it is full charge right now once it's
docked<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.830> does<00:02:25.010> charge<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:26.239> Bluetooth<00:02:26.690> so

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
docked it does charge the Bluetooth so

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.580 
docked it does charge the Bluetooth so
say<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.470> have<00:02:27.500> my<00:02:27.739> iPhone<00:02:28.100> with<00:02:28.280> me<00:02:28.430> we<00:02:29.030> can<00:02:29.209> do

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
say I have my iPhone with me we can do

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.030 
say I have my iPhone with me we can do
in<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.860> actual<00:02:31.160> Sony<00:02:31.430> app<00:02:31.610> itself<00:02:32.829> we<00:02:33.829> can<00:02:33.920> go

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
in the actual Sony app itself we can go

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.449 
in the actual Sony app itself we can go
to<00:02:34.100> bluetooth<00:02:34.340> phone<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:37.010> still<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> little

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
to bluetooth phone it's still a little

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.830 
to bluetooth phone it's still a little
it's<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:37.910> new<00:02:38.030> app<00:02:38.209> so<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.510> doesn't<00:02:38.750> have

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
it's a new app so it doesn't have

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.300 
it's a new app so it doesn't have
everything<00:02:39.170> select<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.500> full<00:02:39.680> keypad<00:02:40.070> but

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
everything select the full keypad but

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.100 
everything select the full keypad but
for<00:02:40.430> an<00:02:40.489> example<00:02:40.760> if<00:02:41.269> you<00:02:41.390> do<00:02:41.510> voice<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:42.019> will

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
for an example if you do voice it will

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.590 
for an example if you do voice it will
activate<00:02:42.440> Siri<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.940> we<00:02:44.030> do<00:02:44.120> voice<00:02:46.209> call<00:02:47.209> sound

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
activate Siri so we do voice call sound

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.410 
activate Siri so we do voice call sound
waves<00:02:51.549> calling<00:02:52.549> sounds<00:02:52.760> we<00:02:53.030> thought<00:02:53.269> it

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
waves calling sounds we thought it

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.930 
waves calling sounds we thought it
sounded<00:02:53.600> security<00:02:54.440> main

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.309 

so<00:03:00.940> as<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.120> can<00:03:01.180> see<00:03:01.239> on<00:03:01.420> my<00:03:01.510> phone<00:03:01.690> now<00:03:01.870> it's

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
so as you can see on my phone now it's

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.440 
so as you can see on my phone now it's
calling<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.770> through<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.069> store<00:03:03.610> here<00:03:06.450> I'm

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
just end it the Bluetooth mic itself is

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.860 
just end it the Bluetooth mic itself is
actually<00:03:15.910> up<00:03:15.970> here<00:03:16.209> so<00:03:16.510> when<00:03:16.660> we're<00:03:16.780> actually

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
actually up here so when we're actually

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.690
