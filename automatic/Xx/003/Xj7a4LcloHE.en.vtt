00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.030
 so never 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.230
 maybe someone has gone past democracy unit 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.740

 I'm quieter 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.820
 that I am going to run a policy policy about ever by Mr. 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.480
 cohen was invented 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.210
 and I still have that for the perpetrators of sexual offenses 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.630
 furthermore indeed with a straight back and straightforward but she does it 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.610
 maybe you will need to implement the policy if you look in the Netherlands 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.110
 customers with unlikely riches and the richest countries of the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.900
 world yes i none of us we have that wealth in the past two three 400 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.280
 years together 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.090
 yes that largely what is new front 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.220
 and perhaps still retain for our children the children and for us one 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.609
 indignant wishes 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.800
 and rules and passport and pa 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.159
 rita drowned it out 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.520
 Some people died when it was welcome and that is also what stop 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.570
 and its still here i am not according to the rules and we do that every one 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.039
 case 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.059
 then you are galen and we thought that is why this is not a crime young 

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:06.890
 illegally send this save to schiphol ready to send 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.960

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.549
 and Rita drowned out those feet 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.490
 indeed viewers who are inhuman 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.519
 but she does 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.539
 and maybe unnecessary 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:17.289
 she gets the party dredging governments damn not only benefits from it 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.800

 in the controlled room the road to whoever goes there that he had could turn his back 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.209

 Europe under pressure from states 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:15.210
 for hours in the recreation room in the distance, they might die 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.069
 but they were lying and Saturdays in blind panic adequate around five hours before it 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.990

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:42.870
 to another prison in rotterdam arrived there chained to each other 

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:43.360
 complain 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.759
 this vision flourishes 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.050
 then he looks as if you look at what they came from a goddamn 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.590
 prison after another prison but they were inspected plan the rules 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.439
 to comply with his rules and when he looked at this approach in Rotterdam first 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.719
 stopped two by two 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:00.779
 and three days later they are going to look away with those people stuck and that it is always 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:02.330
 acting according to Rita Verdonk
