this is this area here is is as risky as
up<00:03:31.430> here<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.660> promoters<00:03:35.870> if<00:03:36.350> they'll

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
up here so the promoters if they'll

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.289 
up here so the promoters if they'll
smart<00:03:36.859> the<00:03:37.100> promoters<00:03:37.609> would<00:03:37.850> have<00:03:37.970> been

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
smart the promoters would have been

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.559 
smart the promoters would have been
saying<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:40.370> buy<00:03:40.579> here<00:03:41.060> they<00:03:41.359> would

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
saying to to buy here they would

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:42.940 
saying to to buy here they would
probably<00:03:41.840> would<00:03:42.079> have<00:03:42.140> sold<00:03:42.410> out<00:03:42.680> here

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
probably would have sold out here

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.500 
probably would have sold out here
somebody<00:03:43.250> told<00:03:43.640> you<00:03:43.850> they<00:03:44.000> are<00:03:44.030> selling<00:03:44.239> out

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
somebody told you they are selling out

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.830 
somebody told you they are selling out
here<00:03:45.549> and<00:03:46.549> then<00:03:47.950> they<00:03:48.950> dump<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.609> usually<00:03:50.090> the

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
here and then they dump and usually the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.840 
here and then they dump and usually the
promoters<00:03:51.350> will<00:03:51.530> pick<00:03:51.709> up<00:03:51.889> below<00:03:52.220> fair<00:03:52.489> value

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
promoters will pick up below fair value

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:02.910 
promoters will pick up below fair value
again<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.450> those<00:03:53.690> continue<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.560> cycle<00:03:58.600> okay

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.400 

okay<00:04:03.920> so<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.459> can<00:04:04.819> see<00:04:05.090> that's<00:04:05.900> where<00:04:06.079> we<00:04:06.170> pick

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
okay so you can see that's where we pick

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:13.210 
okay so you can see that's where we pick
up<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.590> grant<00:04:06.980> moles<00:04:07.190> and<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:12.799> other<00:04:12.950> place
