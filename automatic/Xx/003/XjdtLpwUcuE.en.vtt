it's<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.369> scanning<00:01:17.850> sometimes<00:01:18.540> they'll<00:01:18.720> scan

it's to scanning sometimes they'll scan

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.510 
it's to scanning sometimes they'll scan
the<00:01:18.990> top<00:01:19.200> line<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.890> bottom<00:01:20.130> line

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the top line then the bottom line

the top line then the bottom line
progressive<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.869> scans<00:01:22.439> both<00:01:22.770> lines<00:01:23.250> or<00:01:23.640> both

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
progressive it scans both lines or both

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.289 
progressive it scans both lines or both
odds<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.780> evens<00:01:24.900> at<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.500> same<00:01:25.710> time<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.729> your

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
odds and evens at the same time so your

1080p will give you your sharpest

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.289 
1080p will give you your sharpest
picture<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.079> then<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.159> decide<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:33.030> kind<00:01:33.180> of
