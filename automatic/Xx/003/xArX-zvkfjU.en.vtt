00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.110 
this is Texas Tiger digs and I'm talking
about<00:00:23.350> the<00:00:23.590> TRX<00:00:23.980> pinpointer<00:00:24.700> again<00:00:24.940> I've

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.120 
about the TRX pinpointer again I've

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.180 
about the TRX pinpointer again I've
talked<00:00:25.330> about<00:00:25.570> it<00:00:25.690> a<00:00:25.720> couple<00:00:25.840> of<00:00:25.990> times<00:00:26.230> but<00:00:26.950> I

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
talked about it a couple of times but I

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.940 
talked about it a couple of times but I
need<00:00:27.460> to<00:00:27.550> give<00:00:27.700> it<00:00:27.730> a<00:00:27.990> revised<00:00:28.990> review<00:00:29.740> now

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
need to give it a revised review now

need to give it a revised review now
that<00:00:30.070> I've<00:00:30.190> been<00:00:30.340> using<00:00:30.610> it<00:00:30.820> for<00:00:30.850> two<00:00:31.830> two<00:00:32.830> or

that I've been using it for two two or
more<00:00:33.130> months<00:00:33.550> give<00:00:33.790> or<00:00:33.820> take<00:00:34.060> and<00:00:37.080> it<00:00:38.080> changes

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
more months give or take and it changes

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.650 
more months give or take and it changes
the<00:00:38.739> way<00:00:38.890> you<00:00:38.950> detect<00:00:39.370> now<00:00:39.730> I'm<00:00:40.059> not<00:00:40.239> saying<00:00:40.540> I

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
the way you detect now I'm not saying I

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.220 
the way you detect now I'm not saying I
don't<00:00:40.690> blow<00:00:41.170> the<00:00:41.410> TRX<00:00:41.739> pinpointer<00:00:42.309> this<00:00:42.550> is<00:00:42.730> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
don't blow the TRX pinpointer this is a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.310 
don't blow the TRX pinpointer this is a
not<00:00:44.230> an<00:00:44.320> empty<00:00:44.530> box<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.690> another<00:00:46.989> pin

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
not an empty box this is another pin

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.060 
not an empty box this is another pin
pointer<00:00:47.739> so<00:00:47.950> I<00:00:48.340> purchased<00:00:49.180> two<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:50.710> in<00:00:50.860> case

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
pointer so I purchased two just in case

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.710 
pointer so I purchased two just in case
I<00:00:51.250> don't<00:00:51.430> want<00:00:51.640> to<00:00:51.730> I<00:00:51.910> don't<00:00:52.089> want<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.540> be

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
I don't want to I don't want to be

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.530 
I don't want to I don't want to be
without<00:00:53.080> so<00:00:53.860> I'm<00:00:53.949> gonna<00:00:54.070> have<00:00:54.280> knit<00:00:54.489> this<00:00:55.330> one

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
without so I'm gonna have knit this one

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.450 
without so I'm gonna have knit this one
in<00:00:55.660> a<00:00:55.720> back<00:00:55.930> up<00:00:56.140> now<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:56.949> reason<00:00:57.190> I'm<00:00:57.280> doing

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
in a back up now the reason I'm doing

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.700 
in a back up now the reason I'm doing
this<00:00:57.640> is<00:00:57.790> because<00:00:58.059> I<00:00:58.300> still<00:00:58.870> can<00:00:59.140> use<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.530> in<00:00:59.650> a

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
this is because I still can use the in a

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.200 
this is because I still can use the in a
Gary<00:00:59.920> pin<00:01:00.129> point<00:01:00.400> and<00:01:00.640> I'm<00:01:00.760> still<00:01:00.970> a<00:01:01.000> believer

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
Gary pin point and I'm still a believer

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.299 
Gary pin point and I'm still a believer
in<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:01.629> Garrett<00:01:01.900> pin<00:01:02.080> pointer<00:01:02.410> like<00:01:03.040> I<00:01:03.129> said

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
in the Garrett pin pointer like I said

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.320 
in the Garrett pin pointer like I said
it's<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.489> personal<00:01:03.850> choice<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:05.379> know<00:01:05.530> it's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
it's a personal choice you know it's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.500 
it's a personal choice you know it's
there<00:01:07.330> are<00:01:07.630> pluses<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.230> minuses<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:08.770> both<00:01:09.510> but

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
there are pluses and minuses to both but

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.170 
there are pluses and minuses to both but
the<00:01:10.780> TRX<00:01:11.140> has<00:01:11.350> changed<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:11.860> way<00:01:12.070> I<00:01:12.340> detect<00:01:13.000> to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
the TRX has changed the way I detect to

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.050 
the TRX has changed the way I detect to
the<00:01:13.300> degree<00:01:13.659> that<00:01:13.930> I<00:01:14.320> really<00:01:14.800> need<00:01:15.070> it<00:01:15.250> now<00:01:15.880> I'm

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
the degree that I really need it now I'm

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.969 
the degree that I really need it now I'm
not<00:01:16.210> saying<00:01:16.450> I'm<00:01:16.720> addicted<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.290> it<00:01:17.440> I<00:01:17.620> couldn't

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
not saying I'm addicted to it I couldn't

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.450 
not saying I'm addicted to it I couldn't
use<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.250> other<00:01:18.610> pin<00:01:18.850> pointer<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:20.320> I<00:01:20.710> went<00:01:21.310> out

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
use the other pin pointer but I went out

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.000 
use the other pin pointer but I went out
to<00:01:22.030> finds<00:01:22.750> a<00:01:22.840> couple<00:01:23.229> of<00:01:23.320> targets<00:01:23.500> you<00:01:23.860> might

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
to finds a couple of targets you might

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.620 
to finds a couple of targets you might
have<00:01:24.130> seen<00:01:24.280> videos<00:01:24.670> where<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:24.910> did<00:01:25.090> this<00:01:25.300> with

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
have seen videos where I did this with

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.840 
have seen videos where I did this with
the<00:01:25.660> Garrett<00:01:26.560> because<00:01:26.680> I<00:01:26.890> forgot<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.430> TRX

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
the Garrett because I forgot the TRX

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.940 
the Garrett because I forgot the TRX
lifted<00:01:28.300> at<00:01:28.390> home<00:01:28.540> and<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:30.720> had<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.930> you<00:01:32.590> know<00:01:32.710> do

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
lifted at home and I had to you know do

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.220 
lifted at home and I had to you know do
the<00:01:33.070> little<00:01:33.190> do<00:01:33.760> little<00:01:34.060> distance<00:01:34.630> adjustment

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
the little do little distance adjustment

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.550 
the little do little distance adjustment
to<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.310> coin<00:01:36.580> move<00:01:36.910> I<00:01:37.150> have<00:01:37.330> a<00:01:37.360> little<00:01:37.600> little

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
to the coin move I have a little little

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.280 
to the coin move I have a little little
spacer<00:01:39.010> I<00:01:39.040> can<00:01:39.280> move<00:01:39.400> up<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:39.880> I<00:01:40.600> tested<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.200> I

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
spacer I can move up and I tested it I

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.210 
spacer I can move up and I tested it I
couldn't<00:01:41.620> find<00:01:41.770> it<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:44.140> those<00:01:44.440> were<00:01:44.650> those

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
couldn't find it but those were those

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.820 
couldn't find it but those were those
were<00:01:45.280> targets<00:01:46.180> I<00:01:46.300> could<00:01:46.510> find<00:01:46.780> with<00:01:47.230> the<00:01:47.380> TRX

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
were targets I could find with the TRX

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.530 
were targets I could find with the TRX
the<00:01:48.160> reason<00:01:48.370> I<00:01:48.430> know<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:48.880> I<00:01:49.060> had<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.390> went

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
the reason I know that is I had I went

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.220 
the reason I know that is I had I went
out<00:01:49.690> one<00:01:49.900> time<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.380> carry<00:01:51.130> both<00:01:51.340> pin<00:01:51.610> pointers

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
out one time and carry both pin pointers

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.840 
out one time and carry both pin pointers
no<00:01:53.230> no<00:01:53.410> really<00:01:53.560> why<00:01:53.830> I<00:01:53.860> just<00:01:54.220> having<00:01:54.490> both<00:01:54.640> in<00:01:54.790> a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
no no really why I just having both in a

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.150 
no no really why I just having both in a
pouch<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.420> I<00:01:56.170> reached<00:01:56.530> in<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:56.860> grabbed<00:01:57.040> a

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
pouch and I reached in and grabbed a

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.620 
pouch and I reached in and grabbed a
garrote<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.610> tested<00:01:58.000> it<00:01:58.090> not<00:01:58.300> you<00:01:58.510> know

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
garrote and tested it not you know

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.690 
garrote and tested it not you know
because<00:01:59.260> it<00:01:59.410> was<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.980> first<00:02:00.160> one<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.340> pop<00:02:00.550> the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
because it was the first one to pop the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.340 
because it was the first one to pop the
hand<00:02:00.910> and<00:02:01.360> I<00:02:01.390> couldn't<00:02:01.720> get<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.930> dip

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
hand and I couldn't get the dip

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.430 
hand and I couldn't get the dip
I<00:02:02.380> moved<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:04.020> adjustment<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.080> look<00:02:05.260> there

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
I moved the adjustment to look there

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.110 
I moved the adjustment to look there
could<00:02:05.740> still<00:02:05.950> couldn't<00:02:06.310> get<00:02:06.400> it<00:02:06.550> and<00:02:06.730> went

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
could still couldn't get it and went

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.229 
could still couldn't get it and went
back<00:02:07.330> got<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.900> TRX<00:02:08.349> out<00:02:08.560> of<00:02:08.679> my<00:02:08.890> pouch<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.759> I

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
back got the TRX out of my pouch and I

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.300 
back got the TRX out of my pouch and I
could<00:02:10.420> I<00:02:10.599> could<00:02:10.869> touch<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.110> target<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.099> the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
could I could touch the target so the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.339 
could I could touch the target so the
distance<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:12.790> still<00:02:12.910> greater<00:02:13.390> with<00:02:14.140> or

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
distance is still greater with or

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.180 
distance is still greater with or
without<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.860> distance<00:02:15.220> adjustment<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:17.190> I'll

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
without the distance adjustment so I'll

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.100 
without the distance adjustment so I'll
make<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.849> love<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.269> TRX<00:02:19.690> in<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:19.930> way

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
make this so I love the TRX in that way

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.890 
make this so I love the TRX in that way
now<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.379> TRX<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:21.010> another<00:02:21.280> thing<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.870> a

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
now the TRX is another thing this is a

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.550 
now the TRX is another thing this is a
dime<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.550> don't<00:02:25.120> think<00:02:25.239> just<00:02:25.540> quite<00:02:25.959> any<00:02:26.260> up

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
dime and I don't think just quite any up

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.550 
dime and I don't think just quite any up
any<00:02:27.459> metal<00:02:27.879> right<00:02:28.030> underneath<00:02:28.329> me<00:02:28.569> here<00:02:28.749> so<00:02:29.260> I

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
any metal right underneath me here so I

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.140 
any metal right underneath me here so I
can<00:02:29.980> actually<00:02:30.129> hit<00:02:30.459> my<00:02:30.609> TRX<00:02:31.030> spend<00:02:31.269> corner

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
can actually hit my TRX spend corner

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.330 
can actually hit my TRX spend corner
and<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.450> can<00:02:34.900> tell<00:02:35.230> some<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.740> depth<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.220> the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
and I can tell some of the depth of the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.070 
and I can tell some of the depth of the
dime<00:02:36.720> from<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.900> pimp<00:02:38.140> or<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.590> bus<00:02:39.540> for<00:02:40.540> half<00:02:40.570> five

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
dime from a pimp or a bus for half five

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.330 
dime from a pimp or a bus for half five
inches<00:02:41.410> above<00:02:41.560> right<00:02:42.280> here<00:02:42.520> and<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:45.010> know<00:02:45.160> I

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
inches above right here and you know I

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.690 
inches above right here and you know I
can<00:02:45.550> hear<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:46.150> die<00:02:46.620> now<00:02:47.620> closer<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.550> get

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
can hear that die now closer I get

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.820 
can hear that die now closer I get
closer<00:02:48.910> I<00:02:49.090> get<00:02:49.180> closer<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.720> get<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.650> actually

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
closer I get closer I get it so actually

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.370 
closer I get closer I get it so actually
I<00:02:51.040> can<00:02:51.130> determine<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.880> zip<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.660> just<00:02:53.170> like<00:02:53.350> a

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
I can determine the zip so just like a

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.580 
I can determine the zip so just like a
point-and-click<00:02:54.480> detector<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:56.170> techniques

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
point-and-click detector the techniques

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.110 
point-and-click detector the techniques
you<00:02:56.680> use<00:02:56.830> with<00:02:57.010> some<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.340> desserts

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
you use with some of the desserts

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.240 
you use with some of the desserts
by<00:02:58.780> raising<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.350> core<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.860> can<00:02:59.890> determine

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
by raising the core you can determine

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.770 
by raising the core you can determine
the<00:03:00.460> depth<00:03:00.700> of<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.940> target<00:03:01.300> you<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.510> do<00:03:01.600> that

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
the depth of the target you can do that

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.590 
the depth of the target you can do that
to<00:03:02.020> degree<00:03:02.530> within<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:03.250> fights<00:03:03.490> TRX<00:03:04.180> limit<00:03:04.510> of

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
to degree within the fights TRX limit of

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.930 
to degree within the fights TRX limit of
five<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:05.020> six<00:03:05.230> inches<00:03:05.350> how<00:03:06.130> deep<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.430> target

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
five to six inches how deep that target

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.090 
five to six inches how deep that target
is<00:03:07.030> if<00:03:07.180> I'm<00:03:07.330> right<00:03:07.630> on<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.840> ground<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.860> can

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
is if I'm right on the ground and I can

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.130 
is if I'm right on the ground and I can
get<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.610> signal<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.180> move<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.570> up<00:03:10.630> our

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
get that signal and I move it up our

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.870 
get that signal and I move it up our
quarter<00:03:11.770> of<00:03:11.830> an<00:03:11.890> inch<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.280> lose<00:03:12.490> it<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.790> know

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
quarter of an inch and I lose it I know

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.550 
quarter of an inch and I lose it I know
it's<00:03:13.240> four<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.690> half<00:03:13.720> five<00:03:14.020> inches<00:03:14.380> down

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
it's four and a half five inches down

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.310 
it's four and a half five inches down
maybe<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.370> little<00:03:15.490> more<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:16.450> that's<00:03:16.840> great<00:03:17.020> so<00:03:17.140> I

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
maybe a little more so that's great so I

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.100 
maybe a little more so that's great so I
can<00:03:17.560> determine<00:03:17.680> depth<00:03:18.220> with<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.750> now<00:03:19.750> with

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
can determine depth with it now with

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.830 
can determine depth with it now with
that<00:03:20.350> comes<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:22.060> weird<00:03:22.300> thing<00:03:22.570> is<00:03:22.720> the

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
that comes the the weird thing is the

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.800 
that comes the the weird thing is the
TRX<00:03:23.260> is<00:03:23.500> in<00:03:23.800> a<00:03:23.950> Bell<00:03:24.280> detector<00:03:24.730> just<00:03:24.910> like<00:03:25.120> the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
TRX is in a Bell detector just like the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.830 
TRX is in a Bell detector just like the
coil<00:03:26.080> base<00:03:26.800> Meli<00:03:27.100> ticker<00:03:27.370> but<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.570> can<00:03:28.690> also

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
coil base Meli ticker but you can also

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.300 
coil base Meli ticker but you can also
get<00:03:29.140> some<00:03:29.200> of<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.440> Mel<00:03:29.620> detector<00:03:29.980> features

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
get some of the Mel detector features

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.690 
get some of the Mel detector features
from<00:03:30.459> this<00:03:30.610> you<00:03:30.790> can<00:03:31.000> be<00:03:31.209> off<00:03:31.390> on<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:31.870> dime

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
from this you can be off on a dime

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.820 
from this you can be off on a dime
excuse<00:03:33.700> me<00:03:33.820> off<00:03:34.030> on<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.480> nail<00:03:34.780> because<00:03:35.650> you

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
excuse me off on a nail because you

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.400 
excuse me off on a nail because you
might<00:03:36.040> hit<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.700> field<00:03:37.269> hit<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.840> head<00:03:38.110> of<00:03:38.290> the

might hit the field hit the head of the
nail<00:03:38.610> instead<00:03:39.610> of<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.850> point<00:03:40.209> of<00:03:40.360> the<00:03:40.450> nail<00:03:40.660> so

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
nail instead of the point of the nail so

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.580 
nail instead of the point of the nail so
you<00:03:41.650> might<00:03:42.040> be<00:03:42.250> off<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.489> little<00:03:42.790> bit<00:03:43.590> adjusting

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
you might be off a little bit adjusting

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.130 
you might be off a little bit adjusting
for<00:03:44.739> that<00:03:44.890> point<00:03:45.190> on<00:03:45.550> your<00:03:46.150> pinpointing<00:03:46.780> with

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
for that point on your pinpointing with

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.830 
for that point on your pinpointing with
the<00:03:47.410> TRX<00:03:48.010> pin<00:03:48.250> pointer<00:03:48.550> you<00:03:49.090> can<00:03:49.239> also<00:03:49.390> do<00:03:49.660> that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
the TRX pin pointer you can also do that

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.080 
the TRX pin pointer you can also do that
with<00:03:49.900> coins<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.769> are<00:03:50.920> standing<00:03:51.220> up<00:03:51.370> straight

with coins that are standing up straight

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.270 
with coins that are standing up straight
up<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.720> can<00:03:52.840> also<00:03:52.989> do<00:03:53.200> that<00:03:53.350> with<00:03:53.410> with<00:03:54.070> the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
up you can also do that with with the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.490 
up you can also do that with with the
even<00:03:55.180> aluminum<00:03:55.600> cans<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.019> are<00:03:56.140> standing

straight up that will give you a UH
tichelman<00:03:59.560> might<00:03:59.890> might<00:04:00.430> make<00:04:00.700> you<00:04:00.850> believe

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
tichelman might might make you believe

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.509 
tichelman might might make you believe
it's<00:04:01.390> coin<00:04:01.660> size<00:04:01.989> because<00:04:02.890> it's<00:04:03.100> just<00:04:03.280> it's

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
it's coin size because it's just it's

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.520 
it's coin size because it's just it's
very<00:04:03.610> narrow<00:04:04.120> if<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.750> don't<00:04:04.959> go<00:04:05.110> up<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:05.440> down

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
very narrow if you don't go up and down

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.699 
very narrow if you don't go up and down
exactly<00:04:06.190> right<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:06.640> you<00:04:06.730> won't<00:04:06.910> know<00:04:07.090> it<00:04:07.709> but

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
exactly right and you won't know it but

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:09.900 
exactly right and you won't know it but
you<00:04:08.830> might<00:04:08.980> be<00:04:09.070> off<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.250> little<00:04:09.400> bit<00:04:09.700> because

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
you might be off a little bit because

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.570 
you might be off a little bit because
the<00:04:10.450> because<00:04:11.380> it's<00:04:11.590> a<00:04:11.680> detector<00:04:12.220> and<00:04:12.400> that

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
the because it's a detector and that

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.720 
the because it's a detector and that
that<00:04:13.560> vertical<00:04:14.560> orientation<00:04:14.739> can<00:04:15.340> sometimes

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
that vertical orientation can sometimes

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.949 
that vertical orientation can sometimes
throw<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.000> off<00:04:16.120> a<00:04:16.150> little<00:04:16.330> bit<00:04:16.450> that's<00:04:16.720> pretty

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
throw it off a little bit that's pretty

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.340 
throw it off a little bit that's pretty
cool

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
cool

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.469 
cool
now<00:04:17.709> with<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.010> whites<00:04:18.400> you<00:04:18.820> know<00:04:18.910> you<00:04:18.970> dig<00:04:19.180> you

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
now with the whites you know you dig you

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.180 
now with the whites you know you dig you
dig<00:04:19.660> a<00:04:19.690> little<00:04:19.870> bit<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:20.380> then<00:04:20.590> you<00:04:20.739> just<00:04:20.979> put

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
dig a little bit and then you just put

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.400 
dig a little bit and then you just put
it<00:04:21.280> back<00:04:21.489> in<00:04:21.790> you<00:04:22.360> hit<00:04:22.570> up<00:04:22.690> hit<00:04:22.930> this<00:04:23.080> button

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
it back in you hit up hit this button

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.560 
it back in you hit up hit this button
reset<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.220> then<00:04:24.669> you<00:04:24.850> begin<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.330> get<00:04:25.450> the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
reset and then you begin to get the

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.030 
reset and then you begin to get the
angle<00:04:25.870> so<00:04:26.050> it's<00:04:26.169> not<00:04:26.260> like<00:04:26.470> it's<00:04:26.650> in<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.830> big

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
angle so it's not like it's in a big

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.590 
angle so it's not like it's in a big
effect<00:04:27.400> but<00:04:28.090> it's<00:04:28.210> something<00:04:28.360> interesting

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
effect but it's something interesting

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.240 
effect but it's something interesting
it's<00:04:29.530> kind<00:04:29.710> of<00:04:29.800> cool

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
it's kind of cool

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.890 
it's kind of cool
knowing<00:04:30.700> this<00:04:30.790> little<00:04:31.030> detector<00:04:31.419> has<00:04:31.600> some<00:04:31.810> of

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
knowing this little detector has some of

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.530 
knowing this little detector has some of
the<00:04:31.960> characteristics<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.530> a<00:04:32.620> big<00:04:32.770> detector<00:04:33.540> so

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
the characteristics of a big detector so

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.909 
the characteristics of a big detector so
I<00:04:34.570> got<00:04:34.810> no<00:04:34.930> complaints<00:04:35.380> there<00:04:35.410> either<00:04:35.650> it's

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
I got no complaints there either it's

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.010 
I got no complaints there either it's
just<00:04:36.070> it's<00:04:36.520> just<00:04:36.610> a<00:04:36.820> little<00:04:37.000> quirk<00:04:37.240> like<00:04:37.930> I

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
just it's just a little quirk like I

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.200 
just it's just a little quirk like I
said<00:04:38.169> I<00:04:38.200> bought<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.440> other<00:04:38.620> one<00:04:38.890> so<00:04:39.100> about<00:04:40.030> the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
said I bought the other one so about the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.540 
said I bought the other one so about the
other<00:04:40.360> one<00:04:40.510> so<00:04:40.690> you<00:04:41.140> know<00:04:41.740> how<00:04:41.890> to<00:04:41.919> support<00:04:42.430> it

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
other one so you know how to support it

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.300 
other one so you know how to support it
I<00:04:42.669> am

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
I am

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.520 
I am
they're<00:04:43.970> not<00:04:44.090> cheap<00:04:44.360> they're<00:04:44.960> not<00:04:45.139> expensive

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
they're not cheap they're not expensive

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.379 
they're not cheap they're not expensive
is<00:04:45.860> in<00:04:46.310> most<00:04:47.150> cases<00:04:47.450> as<00:04:47.750> a<00:04:47.780> as<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:49.580> mine<00:04:50.060> layup

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
is in most cases as a as the mine layup

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.060 
is in most cases as a as the mine layup
but<00:04:50.600> they're<00:04:50.900> still<00:04:51.110> not<00:04:51.170> something<00:04:51.980> you<00:04:52.040> just

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
but they're still not something you just

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.210 
but they're still not something you just
go<00:04:52.310> out<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:52.490> buy<00:04:52.840> for<00:04:53.840> own<00:04:54.440> a<00:04:54.710> ax<00:04:54.740> or<00:04:55.160> a<00:04:56.120> phlegm

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
go out and buy for own a ax or a phlegm

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.870 
go out and buy for own a ax or a phlegm
so<00:04:58.220> that's<00:04:58.580> great

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
so that's great

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.320 
so that's great
now<00:04:59.480> you<00:04:59.870> know<00:04:59.990> I<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:01.060> you<00:05:02.060> know<00:05:02.180> the

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
now you know I and you know the

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.680 
now you know I and you know the
adjustability<00:05:02.980> you<00:05:03.980> can<00:05:04.160> you'll<00:05:04.370> see

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
adjustability you can you'll see

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.000 
adjustability you can you'll see
different<00:05:05.690> videos<00:05:06.290> out<00:05:06.530> there<00:05:06.560> on<00:05:06.800> how<00:05:06.950> to

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
different videos out there on how to

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.390 
different videos out there on how to
adjust<00:05:07.190> it<00:05:07.550> from<00:05:07.820> a<00:05:08.120> 1<00:05:08.660> to<00:05:08.870> 2<00:05:09.110> to<00:05:09.139> 3<00:05:09.350> to<00:05:09.770> 4<00:05:09.800> level

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
adjust it from a 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 level

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.850 
adjust it from a 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 level
and<00:05:10.580> then<00:05:11.000> you<00:05:11.150> get<00:05:11.360> different<00:05:11.870> gradations<00:05:12.410> I

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
and then you get different gradations I

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.930 
and then you get different gradations I
have<00:05:13.490> I<00:05:13.700> do<00:05:14.150> it<00:05:14.450> just<00:05:14.660> from<00:05:14.870> 4<00:05:15.139> to<00:05:15.260> 3<00:05:15.290> sometimes

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
have I do it just from 4 to 3 sometimes

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.360 
have I do it just from 4 to 3 sometimes
because<00:05:16.940> 4<00:05:17.330> is<00:05:17.450> not<00:05:17.600> it's<00:05:17.990> not<00:05:18.530> always<00:05:19.040> stable

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
because 4 is not it's not always stable

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.210 
because 4 is not it's not always stable
insulin<00:05:20.120> gets<00:05:20.300> a<00:05:20.390> little<00:05:20.540> bit<00:05:21.070> it's<00:05:22.070> a<00:05:22.190> little

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
insulin gets a little bit it's a little

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.960 
insulin gets a little bit it's a little
bit<00:05:22.510> noisy<00:05:23.510> but<00:05:23.960> I<00:05:24.620> can<00:05:25.040> always<00:05:25.310> tell<00:05:25.730> the

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
bit noisy but I can always tell the

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.420 
bit noisy but I can always tell the
signal<00:05:26.360> so<00:05:26.840> I<00:05:26.870> use<00:05:27.200> the<00:05:27.320> keep<00:05:27.500> mind<00:05:27.740> at<00:05:27.860> 4<00:05:28.070> and

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
signal so I use the keep mind at 4 and

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.730 
signal so I use the keep mind at 4 and
I'll<00:05:28.580> just<00:05:28.790> down<00:05:29.000> to<00:05:29.150> 3<00:05:29.419> sometimes<00:05:29.900> you<00:05:30.500> know

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
I'll just down to 3 sometimes you know

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.930 
I'll just down to 3 sometimes you know
it's<00:05:30.860> all<00:05:30.950> according<00:05:31.190> to<00:05:31.370> what<00:05:31.490> depths<00:05:31.850> the

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
it's all according to what depths the

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.940 
it's all according to what depths the
coins<00:05:32.210> I'm<00:05:32.510> beginning<00:05:32.900> to<00:05:33.050> hit<00:05:33.200> on<00:05:33.440> a<00:05:33.500> on<00:05:33.890> a

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
coins I'm beginning to hit on a on a

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.640 
coins I'm beginning to hit on a on a
consistent<00:05:34.460> basis<00:05:35.030> so<00:05:35.810> you<00:05:36.110> know<00:05:36.350> that's

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
consistent basis so you know that's

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.040 
consistent basis so you know that's
that's<00:05:36.860> also<00:05:37.370> been<00:05:37.610> great<00:05:37.850> so<00:05:38.600> I<00:05:38.630> really<00:05:38.900> get

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
that's also been great so I really get

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.080 
that's also been great so I really get
not<00:05:39.590> a<00:05:39.620> lot<00:05:39.830> of<00:05:39.979> complaints<00:05:40.370> about<00:05:40.490> the<00:05:40.729> TRX

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
not a lot of complaints about the TRX

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.200 
not a lot of complaints about the TRX
about<00:05:41.479> another<00:05:41.750> one<00:05:42.310> you<00:05:43.310> know<00:05:43.460> like<00:05:43.669> I<00:05:43.970> said<00:05:44.030> I

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
about another one you know like I said I

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.530 
about another one you know like I said I
went<00:05:44.479> out<00:05:44.660> with<00:05:45.050> my<00:05:45.290> ax<00:05:45.320> with<00:05:46.160> my<00:05:46.310> carrot<00:05:46.729> Pro

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
went out with my ax with my carrot Pro

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.750 
went out with my ax with my carrot Pro
corner<00:05:48.940> and<00:05:49.940> I<00:05:50.300> I<00:05:50.950> missed<00:05:51.950> the<00:05:52.100> depth<00:05:52.340> no

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
corner and I I missed the depth no

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.020 
corner and I I missed the depth no
there's<00:05:53.330> more<00:05:53.570> depth<00:05:53.840> in<00:05:54.020> my<00:05:54.590> parks<00:05:55.010> I<00:05:55.220> can

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
there's more depth in my parks I can

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.420 
there's more depth in my parks I can
find<00:05:56.330> this<00:05:56.600> I<00:05:56.810> can<00:05:57.020> hit<00:05:57.229> it<00:05:57.380> and<00:05:57.500> nine<00:05:58.190> times

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.060 
find this I can hit it and nine times
out<00:05:58.640> of<00:05:58.700> 10<00:05:59.000> because<00:05:59.630> I<00:06:00.050> can<00:06:00.200> hit<00:06:00.320> it<00:06:00.350> so

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
out of 10 because I can hit it so

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.520 
out of 10 because I can hit it so
precisely<00:06:01.340> I<00:06:02.030> can<00:06:02.390> pop<00:06:02.660> it<00:06:02.810> out<00:06:02.930> with<00:06:03.260> a<00:06:03.289> small

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
precisely I can pop it out with a small

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.860 
precisely I can pop it out with a small
trial<00:06:04.250> or<00:06:04.550> I<00:06:04.820> can<00:06:05.120> pop<00:06:05.270> it<00:06:05.450> out<00:06:05.570> with<00:06:05.840> a

trial or I can pop it out with a

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.810 
trial or I can pop it out with a
screwdriver<00:06:06.110> but<00:06:07.100> what's<00:06:07.310> good<00:06:07.520> about<00:06:07.640> that

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820

in this time of the year my ground is

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.469 
in this time of the year my ground is
cracking<00:06:12.380> it's<00:06:12.590> very<00:06:12.919> very<00:06:13.190> dry<00:06:13.370> I<00:06:13.640> can't<00:06:14.060> cut

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479

two and a half to three inches you know

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:59.529 
two and a half to three inches you know
what<00:06:57.949> you<00:06:58.039> need<00:06:58.190> to<00:06:58.250> determine<00:06:58.400> depth<00:06:58.940> when

00:06:59.529 --> 00:06:59.539 
what you need to determine depth when

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:01.689 
what you need to determine depth when
they're<00:06:59.660> five<00:06:59.900> maybe<00:07:00.410> more<00:07:00.800> in<00:07:01.280> the<00:07:01.460> ground

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:01.699 
they're five maybe more in the ground

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:04.360 
they're five maybe more in the ground
then<00:07:02.060> it<00:07:02.539> helps<00:07:02.780> to<00:07:02.960> determine<00:07:03.229> them<00:07:03.560> anyway

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
then it helps to determine them anyway
