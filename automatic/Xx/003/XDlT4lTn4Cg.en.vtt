there's no marking anywhere on the body
top<00:00:22.420> front<00:00:22.900> sides<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:24.550> it's<00:00:24.670> not<00:00:24.790> very<00:00:24.939> heavy

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
top front sides but it's not very heavy

top front sides but it's not very heavy
and<00:00:25.480> by<00:00:25.630> comparison<00:00:26.080> this<00:00:26.380> is<00:00:26.529> a<00:00:26.560> master<00:00:27.130> lock

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
and by comparison this is a master lock

and by comparison this is a master lock
number<00:00:27.610> three<00:00:27.880> so<00:00:28.720> you<00:00:28.779> can<00:00:28.960> see<00:00:29.140> how<00:00:29.350> just<00:00:29.619> how

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
number three so you can see how just how

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.009 
number three so you can see how just how

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.019 
large this thing is it's not very heavy

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:34.020 
large this thing is it's not very heavy

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
have some marking I don't know how many

of<00:00:42.309> you<00:00:42.340> guys<00:00:42.519> speak<00:00:42.790> Russian<00:00:43.210> but<00:00:43.420> let's

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
of you guys speak Russian but let's

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.570 
of you guys speak Russian but let's
transliterate<00:00:44.350> this<00:00:44.530> that<00:00:44.769> that<00:00:45.040> first

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
transliterate this that that first

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.119 
transliterate this that that first
character<00:00:46.080> when<00:00:47.080> we<00:00:47.199> look<00:00:47.379> at<00:00:47.470> it<00:00:47.589> in<00:00:47.680> Latin<00:00:47.890> is

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
character when we look at it in Latin is

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.299 
character when we look at it in Latin is
a<00:00:48.159> TS<00:00:48.640> so<00:00:48.970> we<00:00:49.030> have<00:00:49.150> a<00:00:49.210> TS<00:00:49.570> seven<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.440> then<00:00:51.220> the

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
a TS so we have a TS seven and then the

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.189 
a TS so we have a TS seven and then the
P<00:00:51.549> is<00:00:51.699> actually<00:00:52.120> an<00:00:52.180> r<00:00:52.390> so<00:00:52.780> TS<00:00:53.170> 7<00:00:53.470> are<00:00:53.850> 0<00:00:54.850> 0<00:00:54.970> and<00:00:55.629> K

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
P is actually an r so TS 7 are 0 0 and K

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.729 
P is actually an r so TS 7 are 0 0 and K
s<00:00:56.260> or<00:00:56.470> actually<00:00:56.830> KS<00:00:57.070> so<00:00:57.970> TS<00:00:58.269> 7<00:00:58.479> are<00:00:58.750> 0<00:00:59.080> 0<00:00:59.350> K<00:00:59.559> now

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.160 
s or actually KS so TS 7 are 0 0 K now
I've<00:01:00.180> translated<00:01:01.180> it<00:01:01.479> but<00:01:01.600> do<00:01:01.720> I<00:01:01.780> know<00:01:01.869> what<00:01:02.080> it

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
I've translated it but do I know what it

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.020 
I've translated it but do I know what it
means<00:01:02.350> no<00:01:02.589> I<00:01:02.830> don't<00:01:03.549> know<00:01:03.670> if<00:01:03.729> that's<00:01:03.879> the

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
means no I don't know if that's the

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.910 
means no I don't know if that's the
model<00:01:04.299> and<00:01:04.659> I<00:01:04.839> don't<00:01:04.900> know<00:01:05.170> if<00:01:05.260> that's<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.650> key

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
model and I don't know if that's the key

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.539 
model and I don't know if that's the key
number<00:01:06.400> I<00:01:06.580> have<00:01:07.030> absolutely<00:01:07.690> no<00:01:08.049> clue<00:01:08.549> but

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
number I have absolutely no clue but

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.450 
number I have absolutely no clue but
here's<00:01:10.030> what<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.270> key<00:01:10.390> looks<00:01:10.630> like<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:12.250> does

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
here's what the key looks like it does

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.370 
here's what the key looks like it does
have<00:01:12.640> a<00:01:12.670> pretty<00:01:13.390> challenging<00:01:13.600> key<00:01:14.080> way<00:01:14.260> it

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
have a pretty challenging key way it

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.260 
have a pretty challenging key way it
looks<00:01:14.530> like<00:01:14.710> we've<00:01:15.460> got<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.700> go<00:01:15.820> around<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.150> very

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
looks like we've got to go around a very

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.720 
looks like we've got to go around a very
sharp<00:01:16.630> corner<00:01:16.930> so<00:01:17.050> it<00:01:17.140> is<00:01:17.230> Paris<00:01:17.530> centric<00:01:17.920> so

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
sharp corner so it is Paris centric so

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.500 
sharp corner so it is Paris centric so
you<00:01:18.820> got<00:01:18.910> to<00:01:19.000> give<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.120> a<00:01:19.180> little<00:01:19.300> bit<00:01:19.420> of

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
you got to give it a little bit of

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.960 
you got to give it a little bit of
credit<00:01:19.750> it's<00:01:20.200> also<00:01:20.410> very<00:01:20.860> very<00:01:21.130> old<00:01:21.460> and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
credit it's also very very old and

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.960 
credit it's also very very old and
having<00:01:22.900> been<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.620> Russia<00:01:23.830> having<00:01:24.670> known

who had seen someone drinking a glass of
milk<00:01:32.470> and<00:01:32.680> he<00:01:32.770> goes<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.610> you're<00:01:33.880> like<00:01:34.060> milk<00:01:34.360> yes

milk and he goes so you're like milk yes
in<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.440> Russia<00:01:35.620> we<00:01:35.950> invent<00:01:36.370> milk<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.840> I<00:01:38.260> know

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
in the Russia we invent milk so I know

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.800 
in the Russia we invent milk so I know
that<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.310> tolerance<00:01:39.790> on<00:01:39.940> these<00:01:40.120> older<00:01:40.570> things

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
that the tolerance on these older things

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.720 
that the tolerance on these older things
are<00:01:40.960> probably<00:01:41.350> not<00:01:41.890> so<00:01:41.950> tight

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
are probably not so tight

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.180 
are probably not so tight
you're<00:01:43.000> like<00:01:43.120> microchips<00:01:43.810> yes<00:01:44.560> in<00:01:44.740> Russia<00:01:44.950> we

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
you're like microchips yes in Russia we

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.420 
you're like microchips yes in Russia we
invent<00:01:45.550> microchips<00:01:46.180> we<00:01:46.330> make<00:01:46.510> the<00:01:46.659> largest

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
invent microchips we make the largest

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.050 
invent microchips we make the largest
microchips<00:01:48.430> in<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.700> world<00:01:49.890> also<00:01:50.890> looks<00:01:51.460> so

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
microchips in the world also looks so

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.280 
microchips in the world also looks so
let's<00:01:52.240> give<00:01:52.390> this<00:01:52.480> one<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.659> shot<00:01:52.720> what<00:01:53.200> I'm

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.750 
going to try to do I'm going to try to
rake<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.540> um<00:01:55.930> I've<00:01:56.830> got<00:01:57.010> two<00:01:57.159> choices<00:01:57.370> here

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
rake it um I've got two choices here

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.870 
rake it um I've got two choices here
these<00:01:58.300> are<00:01:58.450> both<00:01:58.600> from<00:01:59.020> sparrows<00:01:59.729> I'm<00:02:00.729> going

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
these are both from sparrows I'm going

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.180 
these are both from sparrows I'm going
to<00:02:00.940> I<00:02:01.150> would<00:02:01.659> like<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:02.020> use<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.530> triple<00:02:02.890> peak

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
to I would like to use the triple peak

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.980 
to I would like to use the triple peak
because<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:03.970> really<00:02:04.270> works<00:02:04.450> well<00:02:04.659> on<00:02:04.690> a<00:02:04.870> lot

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
because that really works well on a lot

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.930 
because that really works well on a lot
of<00:02:05.110> locks<00:02:05.320> but<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.130> problem<00:02:06.460> with<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.610> triple

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
of locks but the problem with the triple

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.969 
of locks but the problem with the triple
peak<00:02:07.090> is<00:02:07.330> that<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.930> profile<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.679> just<00:02:08.860> a

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
peak is that the profile is just a

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.520 
peak is that the profile is just a
little<00:02:09.280> bit<00:02:09.459> tall<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.269> looks<00:02:10.479> like<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.869> me<00:02:11.019> to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
little bit tall it looks like to me to

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.080 
little bit tall it looks like to me to
go<00:02:11.680> inside<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.099> here<00:02:12.340> without<00:02:12.400> over<00:02:12.760> setting

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
go inside of here without over setting

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.240 
go inside of here without over setting
everything<00:02:13.569> luckily<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.709> triple<00:02:14.980> peak<00:02:15.099> has<00:02:15.220> a

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
everything luckily the triple peak has a

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.220 
everything luckily the triple peak has a
little<00:02:15.459> brother<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.879> they<00:02:16.629> call<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:17.019> the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
little brother and they call this the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.280 
little brother and they call this the
worm<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.920> on<00:02:18.670> shorter<00:02:19.299> profile<00:02:19.840> locks<00:02:20.110> this

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
worm and on shorter profile locks this

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.780 
worm and on shorter profile locks this
works<00:02:20.530> really<00:02:20.709> well<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:21.069> looks<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.430> lot<00:02:21.640> like

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
works really well it looks a lot like

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.559 
works really well it looks a lot like
the<00:02:21.940> triple<00:02:22.150> peak<00:02:22.390> except<00:02:23.200> all<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.350> edges

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
the triple peak except all the edges

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.540 
the triple peak except all the edges
are<00:02:24.870> kind<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.200> rounded<00:02:25.560> off<00:02:25.709> getting<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.459> to

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
are kind of rounded off getting it to

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.539 
are kind of rounded off getting it to
focus<00:02:26.760> here<00:02:27.830> so<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.040> bottom<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:29.400> got<00:02:29.489> the

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
focus here so on the bottom we got the

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.830 
focus here so on the bottom we got the
worm<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.879> all<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.090> edges<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.450> sharp<00:02:30.690> edges

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
worm in all the edges the sharp edges

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.970 
worm in all the edges the sharp edges
are<00:02:31.080> kind<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.260> rounded<00:02:31.560> off<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.830> it's<00:02:31.920> a

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
are kind of rounded off and it's a

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.220 
are kind of rounded off and it's a
shorter<00:02:32.280> profile<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:32.940> we<00:02:33.540> can<00:02:33.690> sometimes<00:02:34.019> get

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
shorter profile so we can sometimes get

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.839 
shorter profile so we can sometimes get
it<00:02:34.379> in<00:02:34.470> these<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:34.920> these<00:02:35.069> older<00:02:35.370> locks<00:02:35.580> that

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
it in these in these older locks that

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.729 
it in these in these older locks that
have<00:02:35.970> these<00:02:36.060> pair<00:02:36.299> centric<00:02:36.659> key<00:02:36.840> ways<00:02:37.049> so

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
have these pair centric key ways so

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.110 
have these pair centric key ways so
enough<00:02:38.010> talking<00:02:38.250> bill<00:02:38.519> let's<00:02:38.730> try<00:02:38.879> to<00:02:38.940> get

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
enough talking bill let's try to get

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.460 
enough talking bill let's try to get
this<00:02:39.239> thing<00:02:39.450> open<00:02:40.340> get<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.519> little<00:02:42.180> bit<00:02:42.410> try<00:02:43.410> to

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
this thing open get a little bit try to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.030 
this thing open get a little bit try to
zoom<00:02:43.709> in<00:02:43.950> just<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.340> hair<00:02:45.650> all<00:02:46.650> right<00:02:46.769> little<00:02:46.980> bit

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
zoom in just a hair all right little bit

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.800 
zoom in just a hair all right little bit
of<00:02:47.129> tension<00:02:47.360> let's<00:02:48.360> see<00:02:48.420> if<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:48.569> can<00:02:48.690> first

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
of tension let's see if we can first

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.420 
of tension let's see if we can first
rake<00:02:49.080> our<00:02:49.260> way<00:02:49.379> into<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:49.739> whole<00:02:49.920> lot<00:02:50.129> because

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
rake our way into this whole lot because

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.130 
rake our way into this whole lot because
again<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.090> tolerances<00:02:51.569> are<00:02:51.690> probably<00:02:51.959> not<00:02:52.079> so

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
again the tolerances are probably not so

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.390 
again the tolerances are probably not so
good<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.769> there<00:02:53.510> there<00:02:54.510> we<00:02:54.629> go<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.840> said<00:02:55.230> but<00:02:55.500> it

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
good and there there we go I said but it

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.750 
good and there there we go I said but it
did<00:02:56.610> turn<00:02:56.910> we<00:02:57.209> have<00:02:57.329> about<00:02:57.569> oh<00:02:58.519> not<00:02:59.519> quite<00:02:59.670> a

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
did turn we have about oh not quite a

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.349 
did turn we have about oh not quite a
quarter<00:03:00.209> turn<00:03:00.450> there<00:03:01.280> maybe<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:02.549> just<00:03:03.470> nah

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
quarter turn there maybe it's just nah

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.069 
quarter turn there maybe it's just nah
I'll<00:03:06.359> bet<00:03:07.370> typical<00:03:08.370> Russian<00:03:09.030> engineering<00:03:09.989> I

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
I'll bet typical Russian engineering I

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.930 
I'll bet typical Russian engineering I
will<00:03:10.680> bet<00:03:10.859> a<00:03:10.890> dollar<00:03:11.129> to<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.459> doughnut<00:03:11.760> that

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
will bet a dollar to a doughnut that

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.569 
will bet a dollar to a doughnut that
they<00:03:12.239> open<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.690> opposite<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:13.739> of<00:03:14.010> everybody

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
they open it opposite so of everybody

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.210 
they open it opposite so of everybody
else<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:14.849> the<00:03:14.910> world<00:03:14.940> so<00:03:15.739> let's<00:03:16.739> try<00:03:17.190> that

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
else in the world so let's try that

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.360 
else in the world so let's try that
again<00:03:17.370> again<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.030> want<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.239> go<00:03:18.359> in<00:03:18.480> with<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.629> worm

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
again again I want to go in with a worm

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.160 
again again I want to go in with a worm
slight<00:03:20.370> tension<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:21.180> just<00:03:21.209> try<00:03:21.599> to<00:03:21.629> rake<00:03:21.959> it

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
slight tension and just try to rake it

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.800 
slight tension and just try to rake it
and<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:23.160> was<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.519> its<00:03:24.180> opposite<00:03:24.690> of

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
and that was it its opposite of

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.490 
and that was it its opposite of
everybody<00:03:25.170> else<00:03:25.349> in<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.560> world<00:03:26.690> so<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.900> got<00:03:28.470> a

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
everybody else in the world so I got a

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.289 
everybody else in the world so I got a
backup<00:03:28.980> about<00:03:29.280> five<00:03:29.489> feet<00:03:29.790> here<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.090> get<00:03:30.209> this

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
backup about five feet here to get this

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.539 
backup about five feet here to get this
thing<00:03:30.450> in<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:30.660> frame<00:03:30.900> all<00:03:31.709> right<00:03:31.889> so<00:03:32.069> it<00:03:32.340> does

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
thing in the frame all right so it does

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.050 
thing in the frame all right so it does
open<00:03:32.760> with<00:03:33.389> a<00:03:33.660> rake<00:03:35.060> let<00:03:36.060> me<00:03:36.150> lock<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:38.060> back

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
open with a rake let me lock it back

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.699 
open with a rake let me lock it back
this<00:03:39.299> thing<00:03:39.359> up<00:03:39.569> as<00:03:39.720> far<00:03:39.989> as<00:03:40.169> I<00:03:40.260> can<00:03:40.319> get<00:03:40.620> it

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
this thing up as far as I can get it

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.819 
this thing up as far as I can get it
from<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:40.950> camera<00:03:41.450> believe<00:03:42.450> me<00:03:42.630> this<00:03:42.750> thing<00:03:42.989> is

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
from the camera believe me this thing is

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.650 
from the camera believe me this thing is
about<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.190> have<00:03:44.430> let<00:03:44.700> me<00:03:44.790> unzoom<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.419> a<00:03:45.480> bit

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
about I have let me unzoom it a bit

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.409 
about I have let me unzoom it a bit
there<00:03:45.959> we<00:03:46.049> go<00:03:46.579> all<00:03:47.579> right<00:03:47.639> so<00:03:47.790> let's<00:03:48.180> try<00:03:48.359> that

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
there we go all right so let's try that

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.150 
there we go all right so let's try that
we<00:03:48.690> don't<00:03:48.840> know<00:03:49.079> it<00:03:49.200> opens<00:03:49.440> backwards<00:03:49.859> so

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
we don't know it opens backwards so
