00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.459 
we're actually going to look at two
different<00:00:07.770> systems<00:00:08.840> and<00:00:09.840> just<00:00:09.990> give<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.349> an

pros and cons of each one before we get

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.880 
pros and cons of each one before we get
into<00:00:35.219> talking<00:00:35.399> about<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.059> actual<00:00:36.890> roller

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
into talking about the actual roller

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.740 
into talking about the actual roller
cages<00:00:38.460> themselves<00:00:39.000> we'll<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.300> take<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> quick

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
cages themselves we'll just take a quick

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.130 
cages themselves we'll just take a quick
look<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.200> these<00:00:40.379> trays<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.300> you'll<00:00:42.300> see<00:00:42.570> that

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
look at these trays and you'll see that

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.910 
look at these trays and you'll see that
this<00:00:44.059> gray<00:00:45.059> one<00:00:45.300> here<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.930> somewhat<00:00:46.469> deeper

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
this gray one here is somewhat deeper

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.170 
this gray one here is somewhat deeper
it's<00:00:47.579> about<00:00:47.850> an<00:00:48.149> inch<00:00:48.270> deeper<00:00:49.670> this<00:00:50.670> black<00:00:50.940> one

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
it's about an inch deeper this black one

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.020 
it's about an inch deeper this black one
though<00:00:51.420> has<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:52.579> trough<00:00:53.809> setup<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:56.030> I

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
though has this trough setup here and I

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.319 
though has this trough setup here and I
started<00:00:57.750> off<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.620> works<00:00:58.770> fine

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
started off with this one it works fine

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.150 
started off with this one it works fine
but<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> find<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.949> do<00:01:02.129> have

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
but what I find that is that you do have

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.820 
but what I find that is that you do have
to<00:01:02.670> fill<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.719> little<00:01:04.379> bit<00:01:04.619> more

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
to fill it up a little bit more

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.210 
to fill it up a little bit more
regularly<00:01:05.400> than<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.030> deeper<00:01:06.960> unit<00:01:08.900> but<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
regularly than the deeper unit but the

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.320 
regularly than the deeper unit but the
when<00:01:11.220> you're<00:01:11.369> rolling<00:01:11.760> off<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.960> excess<00:01:13.409> paint

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
when you're rolling off the excess paint

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.090 
when you're rolling off the excess paint
this<00:01:15.330> system<00:01:15.960> here<00:01:16.140> seems<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.680> work<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.979> little

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
this system here seems to work a little

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.330 
this system here seems to work a little
better<00:01:18.020> there's<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.259> more<00:01:19.799> aggressive

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
better there's the more aggressive

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.990 
better there's the more aggressive
notches<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.390> pan<00:01:21.630> here<00:01:22.460> so<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.610> depends

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
notches on the pan here so it depends

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.700 
notches on the pan here so it depends
what's<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.420> your<00:01:24.659> market<00:01:25.110> area<00:01:25.259> what's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
what's in your market area what's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.990 
what's in your market area what's
available<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.630> works<00:01:27.960> okay<00:01:28.680> but

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
available this is this works okay but

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.640 
available this is this works okay but
this<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.210> good<00:01:30.450> because<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.900> holds<00:01:31.020> more<00:01:31.350> paint

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
this is good because it holds more paint

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.710 
this is good because it holds more paint
and<00:01:31.890> usually<00:01:32.250> when<00:01:32.460> we're<00:01:32.670> working<00:01:33.270> with<00:01:33.600> an

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
and usually when we're working with an

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.359 
and usually when we're working with an
18<00:01:34.049> inch<00:01:34.079> roller<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.420> larger<00:01:36.420> type<00:01:36.750> setup

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
18 inch roller it's a larger type setup

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.039 
18 inch roller it's a larger type setup
so<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.640> comes<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.479> really<00:01:39.630> handy<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.840> this

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
so this comes in really handy so this

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.740 
so this comes in really handy so this
particular<00:01:43.409> setup<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.490> Worcester<00:01:44.970> as<00:01:45.600> I

really awkward so the one main Pro about
the<00:02:20.590> loser<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:22.030> there's<00:02:22.210> not<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.390> lot<00:02:22.510> of

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
the loser is that there's not a lot of

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.020 
the loser is that there's not a lot of
mechanical<00:02:23.440> parts<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.840> even<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.580> set<00:02:27.580> up<00:02:27.730> to

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
mechanical parts and even the set up to

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.350 
mechanical parts and even the set up to
release<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.990> roller<00:02:29.760> it's<00:02:30.760> like<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:30.970> friction

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
release the roller it's like a friction

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.650 
release the roller it's like a friction
system<00:02:32.130> it's<00:02:33.130> like<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.310> peg<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:34.210> just<00:02:34.450> goes

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
system it's like a peg that just goes

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.380 
system it's like a peg that just goes
into<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.410> hole<00:02:35.710> so<00:02:36.490> this<00:02:36.700> whole<00:02:36.910> piece<00:02:37.150> is

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
into the hole so this whole piece is

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.250 
into the hole so this whole piece is
solid<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:39.370> then<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.820> just<00:02:40.180> fit<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:41.080> you're

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
solid and then you just fit in you're

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.580 
solid and then you just fit in you're
over<00:02:41.650> on<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.250> one<00:02:42.430> side

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.090 

fit<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.040> on<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.340> other

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
fit it on the other

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.350 
fit it on the other
and<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.580> lock<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.930> just<00:02:50.220> pop<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.520> in<00:02:51.700> like

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
and to lock it you just pop that in like

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.380 
and to lock it you just pop that in like
so

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
so

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.840 
so
then<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.260> course<00:02:54.290> your<00:02:54.770> roller<00:02:55.160> wheels<00:02:55.550> are

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
then of course your roller wheels are

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.240 
then of course your roller wheels are
inside<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.510> roller<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.709> they<00:02:57.860> attach<00:02:58.220> to

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
inside the roller and they attach to

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.250 
inside the roller and they attach to
these<00:02:59.350> pieces<00:03:00.350> here

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.740 

so<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.920> mood<00:03:04.099> suits<00:03:04.370> really<00:03:04.580> good<00:03:05.290> but<00:03:06.700> in

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
so the mood suits really good but in

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.199 
so the mood suits really good but in
ways<00:03:08.750> it's<00:03:09.110> somewhat<00:03:09.980> inflexible<00:03:10.819> as<00:03:11.030> well

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
ways it's somewhat inflexible as well

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.690 
ways it's somewhat inflexible as well
because<00:03:11.629> it's<00:03:11.810> rigid<00:03:12.310> obviously<00:03:13.310> there's<00:03:13.549> no

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
because it's rigid obviously there's no

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.490 
because it's rigid obviously there's no
room<00:03:13.970> for<00:03:14.269> adjustment<00:03:14.330> so<00:03:15.080> that's<00:03:15.260> where<00:03:15.470> our

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
room for adjustment so that's where our

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.479 
room for adjustment so that's where our
next<00:03:15.769> model<00:03:16.190> comes<00:03:16.610> in<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.950> now<00:03:19.099> our<00:03:19.129> next

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
next model comes in so now our next

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.660 
next model comes in so now our next
model<00:03:19.849> is<00:03:20.150> really<00:03:20.569> neat<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.980> is<00:03:22.040> made<00:03:22.640> by

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
model is really neat this is made by

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.430 
model is really neat this is made by
dynamic<00:03:23.890> what<00:03:24.890> I<00:03:24.920> like<00:03:25.190> about<00:03:25.340> this<00:03:25.700> is<00:03:26.440> I've

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
dynamic what I like about this is I've

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.150 
dynamic what I like about this is I've
had<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.680> few<00:03:27.980> adjustable<00:03:28.730> models<00:03:29.150> before<00:03:30.160> but

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
had a few adjustable models before but

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.619 
had a few adjustable models before but
what<00:03:31.280> I<00:03:31.310> really<00:03:31.610> like<00:03:31.790> about<00:03:31.819> this<00:03:32.239> one<00:03:32.480> is

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
what I really like about this one is

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.350 
what I really like about this one is
that<00:03:32.659> it<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.140> locks<00:03:33.379> on<00:03:34.099> each<00:03:34.370> side<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:35.180> the

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
that it it locks on each side of the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.789 
that it it locks on each side of the
adjustment<00:03:35.959> and<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:37.730> also<00:03:37.879> locks<00:03:38.450> on<00:03:39.319> the

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
adjustment and it also locks on the

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.789 
adjustment and it also locks on the
handle<00:03:40.730> so<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.989> would<00:03:42.319> screw<00:03:42.620> in<00:03:42.769> your

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
handle so you would screw in your

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.910 
handle so you would screw in your
extension<00:03:43.700> pole<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:45.079> then<00:03:45.290> this<00:03:45.440> would<00:03:45.680> lock

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
extension pole and then this would lock

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.300 
extension pole and then this would lock
down<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.870> grip<00:03:48.140> that<00:03:48.349> and<00:03:48.590> that's<00:03:48.739> important

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
down and grip that and that's important

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.839 
down and grip that and that's important
because<00:03:49.599> when<00:03:50.599> using<00:03:51.530> these<00:03:51.680> 18<00:03:52.129> inch<00:03:52.370> units

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
because when using these 18 inch units

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.619 
because when using these 18 inch units
they<00:03:53.450> tend<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:54.250> have<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.340> little<00:03:56.239> bit<00:03:56.359> of<00:03:56.450> weight

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
they tend to have a little bit of weight

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.210 
they tend to have a little bit of weight
on<00:03:56.930> them<00:03:57.109> when<00:03:57.440> they're<00:03:57.560> loaded<00:03:57.890> up<00:03:58.040> with

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
on them when they're loaded up with

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.550 
on them when they're loaded up with
paint<00:03:58.459> and<00:03:58.670> they<00:03:58.879> can<00:03:59.120> undo<00:03:59.780> themselves<00:04:00.410> off

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
paint and they can undo themselves off

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.190 
paint and they can undo themselves off
of<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.859> pole<00:04:01.120> so<00:04:02.120> with<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.420> booster<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:03.049> have

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
of the pole so with the booster you have

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.160 
of the pole so with the booster you have
the<00:04:03.379> locking<00:04:03.829> system<00:04:04.420> with<00:04:05.420> this<00:04:05.629> you<00:04:06.019> have

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
the locking system with this you have

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.800 
the locking system with this you have
this<00:04:06.349> manual<00:04:06.950> lock<00:04:07.220> system<00:04:07.730> so<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:08.569> want<00:04:08.720> to

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
this manual lock system so you want to

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.800 
this manual lock system so you want to
look<00:04:08.930> for<00:04:09.200> that<00:04:09.319> in<00:04:09.769> whatever<00:04:10.090> unit<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.120> buy<00:04:11.419> I

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
look for that in whatever unit you buy I

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.879 
look for that in whatever unit you buy I
had<00:04:12.650> previously<00:04:13.459> had<00:04:13.819> an<00:04:14.810> adjustable<00:04:15.470> unit

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
had previously had an adjustable unit

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.210 
had previously had an adjustable unit
and<00:04:16.250> it<00:04:17.030> would<00:04:17.239> undo<00:04:18.019> itself<00:04:18.410> all<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:18.829> time<00:04:19.039> it

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
and it would undo itself all the time it

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.330 
and it would undo itself all the time it
didn't<00:04:19.459> have<00:04:19.579> locking<00:04:19.970> systems<00:04:20.419> on<00:04:20.599> it<00:04:21.340> this

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
didn't have locking systems on it this

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.290 
didn't have locking systems on it this
is<00:04:22.580> really<00:04:22.880> good

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
is really good

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.150 
is really good
that's<00:04:23.750> what<00:04:23.930> you<00:04:24.020> want<00:04:24.200> to<00:04:24.260> look<00:04:24.380> for<00:04:24.710> where

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
that's what you want to look for where

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.370 
that's what you want to look for where
it<00:04:25.250> locks<00:04:25.520> onto<00:04:25.789> the<00:04:26.060> extension<00:04:26.539> pole<00:04:26.750> and

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
it locks onto the extension pole and

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.750 
it locks onto the extension pole and
then<00:04:28.039> after<00:04:28.400> you've<00:04:28.610> adjusted<00:04:30.729> for<00:04:31.729> the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
then after you've adjusted for the

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.480 
then after you've adjusted for the
roller<00:04:32.090> once<00:04:32.690> you've<00:04:32.810> got<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.110> roller<00:04:33.349> on

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
roller once you've got the roller on

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.540 
roller once you've got the roller on
then<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:36.000> can<00:04:36.630> lock<00:04:36.810> these<00:04:37.080> it<00:04:37.380> don't<00:04:38.340> move

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
then you can lock these it don't move

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.469 
then you can lock these it don't move
around<00:04:38.759> on<00:04:39.120> you

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
around on you

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.260 
around on you
near<00:04:39.780> as<00:04:39.960> much<00:04:40.729> another<00:04:41.729> neat<00:04:41.970> thing<00:04:42.240> about

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
near as much another neat thing about

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.550 
near as much another neat thing about
this<00:04:42.630> system<00:04:42.900> is<00:04:43.229> that<00:04:43.289> the<00:04:43.680> roller

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
this system is that the roller

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.980 
this system is that the roller
attachments<00:04:46.560> are<00:04:47.280> built<00:04:47.849> into<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.389> frame<00:04:48.660> so

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
attachments are built into the frame so

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.249 
attachments are built into the frame so
you<00:04:49.020> less<00:04:49.800> likely<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.460> lose<00:04:50.789> them<00:04:51.169> there's<00:04:52.169> a

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
you less likely to lose them there's a

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.680 
you less likely to lose them there's a
couple<00:04:52.470> of<00:04:52.650> pluses<00:04:53.039> about<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.460> unit<00:04:53.759> one

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
couple of pluses about the unit one

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.689 
couple of pluses about the unit one
thing<00:04:54.960> I<00:04:55.139> didn't<00:04:55.650> like<00:04:55.680> about<00:04:55.830> this<00:04:56.250> unit<00:04:56.610> is

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
thing I didn't like about this unit is

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.790 
thing I didn't like about this unit is
they<00:04:56.849> thought<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.240> would<00:04:57.330> collapse<00:04:57.750> to<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.470> nine

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
they thought it would collapse to a nine

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.890 
they thought it would collapse to a nine
and<00:04:58.979> a<00:04:59.039> half<00:04:59.069> inch<00:04:59.490> roller<00:05:00.259> but<00:05:01.259> it<00:05:01.380> doesn't

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
and a half inch roller but it doesn't

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.809 
and a half inch roller but it doesn't
see<00:05:03.900> that<00:05:04.110> but<00:05:04.590> if<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:05.039> had<00:05:05.220> different<00:05:05.490> size

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
see that but if you had different size

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.309 
see that but if you had different size
rollers<00:05:06.150> I've<00:05:06.509> never<00:05:06.720> seen<00:05:07.020> them<00:05:07.169> in<00:05:07.259> the

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:07.319 
rollers I've never seen them in the

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:09.710 
rollers I've never seen them in the
marketplace<00:05:07.770> but<00:05:08.759> if<00:05:08.849> there<00:05:09.060> are<00:05:09.210> different

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
marketplace but if there are different

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.249 
marketplace but if there are different
size<00:05:09.870> rollers<00:05:10.319> you<00:05:10.380> can<00:05:10.590> adjust<00:05:11.069> to<00:05:11.430> fit<00:05:12.389> so<00:05:13.110> we

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
size rollers you can adjust to fit so we

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.189 
size rollers you can adjust to fit so we
can<00:05:13.409> see<00:05:13.620> how<00:05:13.830> that<00:05:13.889> would<00:05:14.220> be<00:05:14.250> a<00:05:14.810> benefit<00:05:15.810> over

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
can see how that would be a benefit over

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:21.880 
can see how that would be a benefit over
the<00:05:16.380> booster<00:05:17.130> even

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.280 

but<00:05:22.890> I<00:05:22.920> just<00:05:23.130> wanted<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:23.580> show<00:05:23.820> you<00:05:23.850> this<00:05:24.290> last

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
but I just wanted to show you this last

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.160 
but I just wanted to show you this last
item<00:05:25.710> this<00:05:26.400> used<00:05:26.640> to<00:05:26.700> be<00:05:26.850> a<00:05:26.880> full<00:05:27.180> 18<00:05:27.600> inch<00:05:27.900> wide

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
item this used to be a full 18 inch wide

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.490 
item this used to be a full 18 inch wide
roller<00:05:28.590> setup<00:05:29.270> but<00:05:30.270> I<00:05:30.630> was<00:05:31.050> bound<00:05:31.290> and

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
roller setup but I was bound and

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.850 
roller setup but I was bound and
determined<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:32.190> get<00:05:32.460> a<00:05:33.020> system<00:05:34.020> like<00:05:34.200> this<00:05:34.470> a

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
determined to get a system like this a

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.160 
determined to get a system like this a
more<00:05:35.430> rigid<00:05:35.820> system<00:05:36.450> for<00:05:36.690> a<00:05:36.720> nine<00:05:36.930> and<00:05:37.080> a<00:05:37.140> half

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
more rigid system for a nine and a half

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.450 
more rigid system for a nine and a half
inch<00:05:37.560> roller<00:05:38.540> so<00:05:39.540> I<00:05:39.600> adapted<00:05:40.200> it<00:05:40.380> I<00:05:40.590> basically

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
inch roller so I adapted it I basically

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.680 
inch roller so I adapted it I basically
just<00:05:41.940> locked<00:05:42.810> off<00:05:43.760> few<00:05:44.760> inches<00:05:45.000> off<00:05:45.360> of<00:05:45.390> each

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
just locked off few inches off of each

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.310 
just locked off few inches off of each
end<00:05:46.340> re<00:05:47.340> drilled<00:05:47.670> holes<00:05:48.030> where<00:05:48.420> the<00:05:48.630> Machine

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
end re drilled holes where the Machine

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.930 
end re drilled holes where the Machine
bolts<00:05:49.680> went<00:05:49.920> through<00:05:50.160> and<00:05:50.370> just<00:05:50.430> used<00:05:50.760> the

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
bolts went through and just used the

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.990 
bolts went through and just used the
same<00:05:51.150> hardware<00:05:51.860> same<00:05:52.860> basic<00:05:53.370> essential

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
same hardware same basic essential

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.670 
same hardware same basic essential
design<00:05:54.920> so<00:05:55.920> now<00:05:56.070> I<00:05:56.100> have<00:05:56.460> a<00:05:56.930> system<00:05:57.930> that<00:05:58.410> I<00:05:58.440> can

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
design so now I have a system that I can

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.290 
design so now I have a system that I can
use<00:05:58.860> for<00:05:58.890> a<00:05:59.190> nine<00:05:59.370> and<00:05:59.520> a<00:05:59.580> half<00:05:59.760> inch<00:06:00.000> roller

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
use for a nine and a half inch roller

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.400 
use for a nine and a half inch roller
and<00:06:00.480> why<00:06:00.630> would<00:06:00.840> I<00:06:00.870> do<00:06:01.020> that

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
and why would I do that

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.750 
and why would I do that
well<00:06:01.850> because<00:06:02.850> of<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.410> stability<00:06:04.550> having<00:06:05.550> the

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
well because of the stability having the

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.010 
well because of the stability having the
two<00:06:07.430> supports<00:06:08.430> on<00:06:08.640> each<00:06:08.790> end<00:06:09.090> of<00:06:09.300> the<00:06:09.390> roller<00:06:09.630> I

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
two supports on each end of the roller I

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.540 
two supports on each end of the roller I
get<00:06:10.860> the<00:06:10.980> benefit<00:06:11.460> of<00:06:11.690> the<00:06:13.040> 18<00:06:14.040> inch<00:06:14.310> wide

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
get the benefit of the 18 inch wide

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.350 
get the benefit of the 18 inch wide
roller<00:06:14.910> and<00:06:15.410> the<00:06:16.410> benefits<00:06:16.860> are<00:06:17.460> many<00:06:17.520> and<00:06:18.180> you

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
roller and the benefits are many and you

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.080 
roller and the benefits are many and you
will<00:06:18.540> realize<00:06:18.990> them<00:06:19.670> immediately<00:06:20.670> as<00:06:20.820> soon<00:06:20.970> as

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
will realize them immediately as soon as

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.620 
will realize them immediately as soon as
you<00:06:21.210> use<00:06:21.450> that<00:06:21.660> system<00:06:22.610> so<00:06:23.610> I<00:06:23.640> wanted<00:06:24.030> to<00:06:24.090> apply

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
you use that system so I wanted to apply

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.990 
you use that system so I wanted to apply
it<00:06:24.690> to<00:06:24.990> a<00:06:25.020> nine<00:06:25.170> and<00:06:25.380> a<00:06:25.410> half<00:06:25.440> inch<00:06:25.860> roller<00:06:29.000> so

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
it to a nine and a half inch roller so

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.810 
it to a nine and a half inch roller so
now<00:06:30.180> you<00:06:30.330> just<00:06:30.660> take<00:06:30.870> the<00:06:31.370> regular<00:06:32.370> roller

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
now you just take the regular roller

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.730 
now you just take the regular roller
sleeve

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740

and fruity rolls and it has support and
so<00:07:02.960> you<00:07:03.020> have<00:07:03.260> your<00:07:03.410> central<00:07:04.030> attachment<00:07:05.030> with

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180 
so you have your central attachment with

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.440 
so you have your central attachment with
your<00:07:05.330> pole<00:07:05.890> and<00:07:06.890> you're<00:07:07.370> going<00:07:07.520> to<00:07:07.580> get<00:07:07.760> good

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:08.450 
your pole and you're going to get good
