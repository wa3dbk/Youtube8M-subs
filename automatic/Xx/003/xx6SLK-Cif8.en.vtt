right here if you want to hear the truth

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.970 
right here if you want to hear the truth
then<00:00:53.879> keep<00:00:54.059> watching<00:00:54.289> but<00:00:55.289> anyway<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.620> both<00:00:55.949> of

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
then keep watching but anyway so both of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.160 
then keep watching but anyway so both of
these<00:00:56.129> foundations<00:00:56.699> are<00:00:56.940> formed<00:00:57.750> foundations

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
these foundations are formed foundations

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.479 
these foundations are formed foundations
so<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.440> flip<00:00:58.620> over<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> bottom<00:00:59.190> they

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
so if you flip over to the bottom they

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.430 
so if you flip over to the bottom they
come<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.699> an<00:00:59.879> aerosol<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.300> they<00:01:00.960> tend<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> have

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
come in an aerosol can they tend to have

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.280 
come in an aerosol can they tend to have
a<00:01:01.649> actual<00:01:01.980> flammable<00:01:02.969> warning<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.480> them<00:01:03.750> so

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
a actual flammable warning on them so

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.840 
a actual flammable warning on them so
basically<00:01:04.650> don't<00:01:05.159> put<00:01:05.369> these<00:01:05.489> near<00:01:05.729> your

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
basically don't put these near your

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.789 
basically don't put these near your
stove<00:01:06.060> when<00:01:06.420> you're<00:01:06.570> doing<00:01:06.780> um<00:01:07.049> making

mousse like a moose when you touch it it
pretty<00:02:17.920> much<00:02:18.040> vanishes<00:02:18.700> um<00:02:19.410> now<00:02:20.410> when<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.620> first

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
pretty much vanishes um now when I first

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.830 
pretty much vanishes um now when I first
sprayed<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.580> out<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:21.970> tapped<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.720> was

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
sprayed this out and tapped in it I was

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.290 
sprayed this out and tapped in it I was
like<00:02:22.900> oh<00:02:23.110> my<00:02:23.260> gosh<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:24.610> has<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:24.910> lot<00:02:25.270> of

like oh my gosh that has a lot of
coverage<00:02:25.630> or<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.840> lot<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.050> pigment<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.530> looks

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
coverage or a lot of pigment it looks

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.230 
coverage or a lot of pigment it looks
like<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.160> might<00:02:27.280> actually<00:02:27.430> be<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> shade<00:02:28.030> kind

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
like it might actually be a shade kind

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.990 
like it might actually be a shade kind
of<00:02:28.300> close<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.690> my<00:02:28.810> skin<00:02:28.840> tone<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.640> put<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:30.910> on

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
of close to my skin tone and I put it on

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.910 
of close to my skin tone and I put it on
I<00:02:31.270> thought<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.630> didn't<00:02:31.810> look<00:02:31.900> bad<00:02:31.960> I<00:02:32.440> tried<00:02:32.800> it

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
I thought it didn't look bad I tried it

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.110 
I thought it didn't look bad I tried it
with<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.040> little<00:02:33.220> bit<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.400> white<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.820> see<00:02:34.000> if

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
with a little bit of white to see if

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.090 
with a little bit of white to see if
that<00:02:34.240> looked<00:02:34.420> fine<00:02:34.570> too<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.470> will<00:02:35.650> say<00:02:35.890> this

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
that looked fine too and I will say this

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.650 
that looked fine too and I will say this
one<00:02:36.340> does<00:02:36.610> have<00:02:36.910> more<00:02:37.180> coverage<00:02:37.450> in<00:02:37.600> the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
one does have more coverage in the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.590 
one does have more coverage in the
Maybelline<00:02:37.990> so<00:02:38.350> that's<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.710> good<00:02:38.920> option<00:02:39.600> but

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
Maybelline so that's a good option but

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.020 
Maybelline so that's a good option but
everything<00:02:41.200> else<00:02:41.350> about<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.620> fails<00:02:42.030> this

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
everything else about it fails this

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.790 
everything else about it fails this

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
it's a positive if it does and it's

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.269 
it's a positive if it does and it's

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:06.279 
functional still but that was not the

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:08.879 
functional still but that was not the

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
shade in this one is a lot more pink the

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.350 
shade in this one is a lot more pink the
Maple<00:05:09.159> Lane<00:05:09.250> one<00:05:09.400> like<00:05:09.520> I<00:05:09.610> said<00:05:09.759> has<00:05:09.939> really<00:05:10.240> no

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
Maple Lane one like I said has really no

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.760 
Maple Lane one like I said has really no
coverage<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:10.930> you<00:05:10.990> can<00:05:11.139> see<00:05:11.349> that<00:05:11.379> right<00:05:11.710> here

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
coverage and you can see that right here

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.089 
coverage and you can see that right here
now<00:05:12.490> that<00:05:12.639> I've<00:05:12.729> padded<00:05:13.060> into<00:05:13.240> my<00:05:13.360> hand<00:05:14.099> you

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
now that I've padded into my hand you

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.379 
now that I've padded into my hand you
can<00:05:15.250> see<00:05:15.430> through<00:05:15.639> this<00:05:15.789> one<00:05:16.000> where<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.270> Rev

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
can see through this one where the Rev

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.659 
can see through this one where the Rev
11<00:05:16.750> at<00:05:16.870> least<00:05:17.020> has<00:05:17.169> some<00:05:17.199> opacity<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:17.979> it<00:05:18.129> so

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
11 at least has some opacity to it so

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.749 
11 at least has some opacity to it so
this<00:05:18.849> one<00:05:19.090> when<00:05:19.330> you<00:05:19.449> blend<00:05:19.659> it<00:05:19.840> in<00:05:19.960> it<00:05:20.259> really

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
this one when you blend it in it really

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.129 
this one when you blend it in it really
almost<00:05:21.759> vanishes<00:05:22.300> so<00:05:22.330> this<00:05:22.539> is<00:05:22.659> really<00:05:22.840> good

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
almost vanishes so this is really good

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.390 
almost vanishes so this is really good
maybe<00:05:23.319> a<00:05:23.409> good<00:05:23.590> foundation<00:05:23.710> for<00:05:23.979> somebody<00:05:24.279> who

maybe a good foundation for somebody who

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.029 
maybe a good foundation for somebody who
has<00:05:24.520> no<00:05:24.729> flaws<00:05:24.969> but<00:05:25.810> chances<00:05:26.650> are<00:05:26.800> if<00:05:26.919> you're

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039
