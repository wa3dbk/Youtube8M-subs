00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
hey guys Jack and I recently made a new

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.619 
hey guys Jack and I recently made a new
glow-in-the-dark<00:00:05.190> Park<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:05.940> didn't<00:00:06.480> come<00:00:06.600> up

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
glow-in-the-dark Park I didn't come up

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.230 
glow-in-the-dark Park I didn't come up
with<00:00:06.720> this<00:00:06.930> idea<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.319> found<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:08.069> online<00:00:08.210> but<00:00:09.210> my

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
with this idea I found it online but my

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.270 
with this idea I found it online but my
is<00:00:09.540> unique<00:00:09.990> because<00:00:10.200> I'm<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.860> first<00:00:10.889> one<00:00:11.219> I

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
is unique because I'm the first one I

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.299 
is unique because I'm the first one I
think<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.700> incorporate<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> mega<00:00:12.450> wrap<00:00:12.710> am<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.980> in

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
think to incorporate a mega wrap am I in

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.640 
think to incorporate a mega wrap am I in
my<00:00:14.519> other<00:00:15.210> one<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.719> had<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> mega<00:00:16.170> ramp<00:00:16.379> but<00:00:16.590> it

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
my other one I had a mega ramp but it

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.010 
my other one I had a mega ramp but it
wasn't<00:00:16.980> as<00:00:17.190> big<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.570> one<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.779> think<00:00:18.840> I

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
wasn't as big and this one I think I

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.260 
wasn't as big and this one I think I
made<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.230> work<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.560> little<00:00:19.650> more<00:00:20.070> fluently<00:00:20.490> like

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
made it work a little more fluently like

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.070 
made it work a little more fluently like
if<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.600> don't<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.960> know<00:00:22.080> bail<00:00:22.350> as<00:00:22.529> much<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.890> it

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
if you don't you know bail as much on it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.540 
if you don't you know bail as much on it
how<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.140> do<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.680> I've<00:00:26.310> already

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
how you do this is I've already

them a shade of yellow just play around
with<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> yellow<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.370> find<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.699> perfect

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
with the yellow so you find a perfect

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.170 
with the yellow so you find a perfect
pitch<00:00:54.239> black<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.870> that'll<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:57.500> yeah

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
pitch black and that'll be the one yeah

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.580 
pitch black and that'll be the one yeah
this<00:01:00.180> park<00:01:00.480> took<00:01:00.629> about<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:00.899> two<00:01:01.260> hours<00:01:01.500> to

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
this park took about like two hours to

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.490 
this park took about like two hours to
make<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.329> it<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.539> think<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.290> first

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
make and it is I think it is the first

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.350 
make and it is I think it is the first
golden<00:01:05.369> dart<00:01:05.489> park<00:01:05.700> besides<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> other<00:01:06.180> one

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
golden dart park besides the other one

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.969 
golden dart park besides the other one
to<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> mega<00:01:07.110> ramp<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:09.290> hi<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> did

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to have a mega ramp in it hi what I did

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.560 
to have a mega ramp in it hi what I did
to<00:01:11.100> make<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:11.430> graph<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.909> actually<00:01:12.060> put

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
to make the my graph is I actually put

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.750 
to make the my graph is I actually put
tiles<00:01:13.260> over<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> mega<00:01:14.310> ramp<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.640> had

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
tiles over like a mega ramp I had

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.780 
tiles over like a mega ramp I had
pre-built<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.530> know<00:01:16.619> your<00:01:16.830> custom<00:01:17.250> your

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
pre-built like you know your custom your

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.070 
pre-built like you know your custom your
average<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.299> know<00:01:18.360> mega<00:01:18.630> ramp<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.020> it

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
average you know mega ramp and it

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.630 
average you know mega ramp and it
actually<00:01:19.229> worked<00:01:19.619> really<00:01:19.860> well<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.460> just

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
actually worked really well like just

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.999 
actually worked really well like just
placing<00:01:21.000> them<00:01:21.090> over<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.740> made<00:01:22.860> them

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
placing them over it and it made them

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.370 
placing them over it and it made them
banger<00:01:23.250> ramp<00:01:23.400> work<00:01:23.610> perfectly<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:25.080> needed<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
banger ramp work perfectly it needed a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.620 
banger ramp work perfectly it needed a
little<00:01:25.470> bit<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.799> tweaking<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:27.390> can't

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
little bit of tweaking but and you can't

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.270 
little bit of tweaking but and you can't
push<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> mega<00:01:28.229> ramp<00:01:28.439> or<00:01:28.680> grab<00:01:28.950> when<00:01:29.220> you

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
push on the mega ramp or grab when you

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.880 
push on the mega ramp or grab when you
get<00:01:29.400> down<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.729> bottom<00:01:29.850> or<00:01:30.090> your<00:01:30.180> veil<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
get down to the bottom or your veil and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.580 
get down to the bottom or your veil and
this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.009> all<00:01:32.189> made<00:01:32.400> with<00:01:32.579> blue<00:01:32.820> screens<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
this is all made with blue screens and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
this is all made with blue screens and
green<00:01:34.590> screens<00:01:34.979> which<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.490> which<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.150> just

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
green screens which is which is just

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.760 
green screens which is which is just
like<00:01:36.450> your<00:01:36.600> average<00:01:36.750> square<00:01:37.170> tiles<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
like your average square tiles so it's a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.289 
like your average square tiles so it's a
little<00:01:37.950> difficult<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.150> only

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
little difficult because you can only

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.749 
little difficult because you can only
make<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.750> objects<00:01:40.170> out<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.530> once<00:01:41.460> again

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
make the objects out of that once again

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.370 
make the objects out of that once again
you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.000> only<00:01:42.119> make<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.140> the
