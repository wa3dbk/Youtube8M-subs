the<00:01:14.490> phone<00:01:14.700> itself<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.270> think<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.720> phone<00:01:15.900> might

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the phone itself I think the phone might

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.359 
the phone itself I think the phone might
be<00:01:16.229> getting<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.560> little<00:01:16.680> bigger<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.220> they

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
be getting a little bigger if they

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.550 
be getting a little bigger if they
redesign<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> at<00:01:18.119> all<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.990> even<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
redesign it at all if this is even a

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.950 
redesign it at all if this is even a
part<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.420> pretty<00:01:21.689> cool<00:01:21.900> to

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
part of that but it's pretty cool to

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.480 
part of that but it's pretty cool to
throw<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.500> rumors<00:01:22.770> around<00:01:22.890> I'm<00:01:23.189> pretty

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
throw the rumors around I'm pretty

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.950 
throw the rumors around I'm pretty
excited<00:01:23.549> maybe<00:01:24.090> about<00:01:24.330> having<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> little

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
excited maybe about having a little

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.640 
excited maybe about having a little
larger<00:01:25.610> screen<00:01:26.610> will<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.299> affect<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.020> bezel

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
larger screen will it affect the bezel

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.069 
larger screen will it affect the bezel
on<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> side<00:01:29.130> being<00:01:29.430> any<00:01:29.610> smaller<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.420> don't

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
on the side being any smaller I don't

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.660 
on the side being any smaller I don't
know<00:01:31.200> that's<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:31.770> for<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.100> guys<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.549> decide

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
know that's up for you guys to decide

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.480 
know that's up for you guys to decide
and<00:01:33.150> all<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.540> us<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.840> speculate<00:01:34.220> until<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and all of us to speculate until the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.740 
and all of us to speculate until the
phone<00:01:35.670> comes<00:01:35.909> out<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.509> looks<00:01:36.659> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
phone comes out I think it looks a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.929 
phone comes out I think it looks a
little<00:01:36.869> funny<00:01:37.140> without<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.159> bezel<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.759> side

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
little funny without a bezel on the side

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.899 
little funny without a bezel on the side
it<00:01:39.780> would<00:01:39.960> look<00:01:40.140> neat<00:01:40.439> with<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.829> glass<00:01:41.520> going

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
it would look neat with the glass going

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.910 
it would look neat with the glass going
straight<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.390> edge<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.560> don't<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:43.829> if

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
straight to the edge but I don't know if

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.730 
straight to the edge but I don't know if
to<00:01:43.979> design<00:01:44.340> necessarily<00:01:45.090> matches<00:01:45.600> uh<00:01:45.740> what

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
to design necessarily matches uh what

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.850 
to design necessarily matches uh what
what<00:01:47.189> they<00:01:47.310> probably<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.119> mind<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.450> that

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
what they probably have in mind for that

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.920 
what they probably have in mind for that
if<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.250> picture<00:01:50.610> does<00:01:50.850> hold<00:01:51.149> true<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.750> this

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
if the picture does hold true and this

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.649 
if the picture does hold true and this
is<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.320> size<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.310> front<00:01:53.579> screen<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:54.060> think

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
is the size of the front screen I think

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.539 
is the size of the front screen I think
