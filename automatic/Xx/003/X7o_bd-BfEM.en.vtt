go ahead and use the black Yoshi just
cuz<00:00:11.090> and<00:00:13.009> really<00:00:14.009> uh<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.670> almost<00:00:15.540> could<00:00:15.990> just

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
cuz and really uh I almost could just

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.650 
cuz and really uh I almost could just
have<00:00:16.379> been<00:00:16.529> doing<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.010> level<00:00:17.369> blind<00:00:17.699> however

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
have been doing this level blind however

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.000 
have been doing this level blind however
this<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.050> not<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.199> third<00:00:19.470> time<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.859> I'm

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
this is not the third time that I'm

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.370 
this is not the third time that I'm
starting<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.550> segment<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.210> guess<00:00:21.510> that's

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
starting this segment so I guess that's

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.490 
starting this segment so I guess that's
not<00:00:22.500> as<00:00:22.800> true<00:00:23.070> as<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.340> thought<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.699> was<00:00:23.789> at<00:00:24.000> first

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
not as true as I thought it was at first

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.200 
not as true as I thought it was at first
there's<00:00:25.500> really<00:00:25.769> not<00:00:26.220> anything<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.760> hard

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
there's really not anything that hard

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.000 
there's really not anything that hard
about<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.750> just<00:00:27.990> keep<00:00:28.320> making<00:00:28.470> stupid

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
about it I just keep making stupid

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.260 
about it I just keep making stupid
mistakes<00:00:30.349> but<00:00:31.349> um<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.369> reason<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.730> say<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.239> I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
mistakes but um the reason I say that I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.670 
mistakes but um the reason I say that I
could<00:00:33.480> probably<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.899> blind<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.469> cuz

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
could probably do it blind it's just cuz

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.959 
could probably do it blind it's just cuz
uh<00:00:36.590> nothing<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.770> really<00:00:38.160> hidden<00:00:38.399> there's

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
uh nothing is really hidden there's

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.000 
uh nothing is really hidden there's
three<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.570> could<00:00:39.780> be<00:00:39.930> possibly<00:00:40.410> considered

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
three that could be possibly considered

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.220 
three that could be possibly considered
a<00:00:41.100> hidden<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.520> out<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.300> those<00:00:42.390> three<00:00:42.780> two<00:00:43.079> of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
a hidden and out of those three two of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.690 
a hidden and out of those three two of
them<00:00:43.379> are<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.649> buried<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.280> ground<00:00:44.460> like

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
them are just buried in the ground like

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.930 
them are just buried in the ground like
there's<00:00:44.940> always<00:00:45.149> some<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.789> chicks<00:00:47.789> are

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.139 
there's always some so chicks are
annoying<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.390> let<00:00:48.570> them<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:50.000> what<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
annoying if you let them do what the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
hell did I just get hit by the side of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.830 
hell did I just get hit by the side of
the<00:00:53.010> logs<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:54.050> don't<00:00:55.050> know<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.440> happened

surprised that these things actually go
left<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.899> right<00:01:55.079> because<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:55.590> run<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.979> so

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
left and right because the run is so

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.609 
left and right because the run is so

there's an egg box right here Wow I did

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.349

not<00:02:02.129> know<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:05.549> better<00:02:05.729> not<00:02:05.819> die

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:08.359 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.880 

anyway<00:02:09.359> I<00:02:09.539> was<00:02:09.869> starting<00:02:10.109> to<00:02:10.140> say<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.679> ROM

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
anyway I was starting to say in the ROM

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.369 
anyway I was starting to say in the ROM
these<00:02:11.220> things<00:02:11.519> I<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:11.970> distort<00:02:12.480> vertically<00:02:13.140> I

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
these things I just distort vertically I

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.400 
these things I just distort vertically I
thought<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.430> they<00:02:14.549> were<00:02:14.609> like<00:02:14.910> tipping<00:02:15.510> to

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.819 
those with one egg to get a melon that's
where<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:23.130> screwed<00:02:23.400> up<00:02:23.459> last<00:02:23.730> time<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:25.019> here

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
where I screwed up last time and here

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.500 
where I screwed up last time and here
we've<00:02:25.980> got<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.250> race<00:02:27.169> which<00:02:28.849> really<00:02:29.849> there's<00:02:30.239> no

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
we've got a race which really there's no

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.199 
we've got a race which really there's no
way<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.780> screw<00:02:31.169> up<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.440> race<00:02:31.880> because<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:33.000> even

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
way to screw up this race because I even

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.030 
way to screw up this race because I even
waste<00:02:33.540> time<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.989> get<00:02:34.109> the<00:02:34.200> happy<00:02:34.500> for<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:35.010> I

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
waste time to get the happy for it and I

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.789 
waste time to get the happy for it and I
still<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.459> enough<00:02:35.639> time<00:02:35.849> so<00:02:39.620> why<00:02:40.620> don't<00:02:40.769> we

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
still have enough time so why don't we

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.370 
still have enough time so why don't we
just<00:02:41.040> keep<00:02:41.430> doing<00:02:41.819> this<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.389> try<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.870> not<00:02:43.169> die

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
just keep doing this and try to not die

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.140 
just keep doing this and try to not die
and<00:02:43.650> don't<00:02:43.919> worry<00:02:44.130> too<00:02:44.310> much<00:02:44.340> about<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.819> coins

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
and don't worry too much about the coins

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.850 
and don't worry too much about the coins
and<00:02:45.480> there<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.959> go

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.440 

go<00:02:51.860> ahead<00:02:52.069> and<00:02:52.190> grab<00:02:52.430> these<00:02:52.640> corners<00:02:53.060> just<00:02:53.239> cuz

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
go ahead and grab these corners just cuz

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.990 
go ahead and grab these corners just cuz
and<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:57.650> should<00:02:57.860> be<00:02:57.980> exactly<00:02:58.430> half<00:02:58.790> of<00:02:58.940> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
and that should be exactly half of the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.610 
and that should be exactly half of the
melons<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.720> half<00:02:59.959> of<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.140> level<00:03:00.470> and

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
melons and that half of the level and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.970 
melons and that half of the level and
then<00:03:00.739> this<00:03:01.069> half<00:03:01.310> s<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.640> other<00:03:01.760> half<00:03:02.890> it's<00:03:03.890> a

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
then this half s the other half it's a

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.009 
then this half s the other half it's a
very<00:03:04.160> straightforward<00:03:04.489> level<00:03:05.239> I'm<00:03:05.540> thankful

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
very straightforward level I'm thankful

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.320 
very straightforward level I'm thankful
for<00:03:06.170> that<00:03:06.440> because<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:07.580> last<00:03:07.760> couple<00:03:07.910> have

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
do is walk on the top path to make it

do is walk on the top path to make it
come<00:03:15.049> but<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.410> don't<00:03:15.560> have<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.860> do<00:03:15.980> that<00:03:16.129> one

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
I've actually tried taking the lower

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.630 
I've actually tried taking the lower
path<00:05:14.480> I<00:05:14.690> usually<00:05:15.170> just<00:05:15.440> try<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:15.890> jump<00:05:16.220> over<00:05:16.370> it

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
path I usually just try and jump over it

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.040 
path I usually just try and jump over it
on<00:05:16.730> the<00:05:16.850> top<00:05:17.060> but<00:05:17.390> I<00:05:17.420> wanted<00:05:17.720> to<00:05:17.780> be<00:05:17.900> a<00:05:17.930> little

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
on the top but I wanted to be a little

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.500 
on the top but I wanted to be a little
more<00:05:18.230> careful<00:05:18.620> this<00:05:18.740> time<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:20.210> way<00:05:20.330> they<00:05:20.450> were

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
more careful this time the way they were

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.800 
more careful this time the way they were
gotten<00:05:20.840> apostrophe<00:05:21.440> s<00:05:22.180> because<00:05:23.180> unlike<00:05:23.600> all

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
gotten apostrophe s because unlike all

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.540 
gotten apostrophe s because unlike all
YouTube<00:05:24.260> users<00:05:24.680> I've<00:05:24.860> seen<00:05:25.130> this<00:05:25.340> game

that's way too close anyway I remember

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.110 
that's way too close anyway I remember
what<00:06:48.740> the<00:06:48.830> boss<00:06:49.009> of<00:06:49.219> the<00:06:49.310> first<00:06:49.460> level<00:06:49.639> is<00:06:50.000> but

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
what the boss of the first level is but

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.820 
what the boss of the first level is but
not<00:06:50.330> the<00:06:50.479> third<00:06:50.750> so<00:06:51.080> I<00:06:51.139> guess<00:06:51.319> we'll<00:06:51.469> see<00:06:51.650> that

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
not the third so I guess we'll see that

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.040 
not the third so I guess we'll see that
one<00:06:51.949> eventually
