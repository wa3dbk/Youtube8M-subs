an A and a C and then what you need is a
Gianna<00:00:50.030> B<00:00:50.590> before<00:00:51.590> you<00:00:51.710> go<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.579> deep<00:00:52.820> that

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
Gianna B before you go to the deep that

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.040 
Gianna B before you go to the deep that
F<00:00:53.210> sharp<00:00:53.239> in<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:53.690> base<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.289> a<00:00:58.989> so<00:00:59.989> you

F sharp in the base and the a so you

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.840 
F sharp in the base and the a so you
need<00:01:00.170> five<00:01:00.469> notes<00:01:00.920> in<00:01:01.129> there<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:01.489> I<00:01:01.550> haven't<00:01:01.760> I

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
don't think I've done a lesson on this

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.450 
don't think I've done a lesson on this
yet<00:01:03.019> I'll<00:01:03.410> get<00:01:03.559> to<00:01:03.679> it<00:01:03.769> someday<00:01:04.010> but<00:01:04.070> that's<00:01:04.280> so

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
yet I'll get to it someday but that's so

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.500 
yet I'll get to it someday but that's so
that's<00:01:04.580> that's<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.940> hint<00:01:05.059> in<00:01:05.180> there<00:01:05.300> try<00:01:05.449> to

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
that's that's the hint in there try to

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.540 
that's that's the hint in there try to
make<00:01:05.690> it<00:01:05.780> sound<00:01:05.930> like<00:01:06.110> this<00:01:08.290> and<00:01:09.490> then<00:01:10.490> you

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
make it sound like this and then you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.340 
make it sound like this and then you
land<00:01:10.670> back<00:01:10.850> on<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.090> G<00:01:11.240> chord<00:01:11.420> down<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.990> second

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
land back on the G chord down the second

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.620 
land back on the G chord down the second
run

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.609 

oh<00:01:16.700> then<00:01:17.700> when<00:01:18.330> you're<00:01:18.420> singing<00:01:18.720> use<00:01:19.439> that

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
oh then when you're singing use that

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.609 
oh then when you're singing use that
same<00:01:19.830> chord<00:01:20.100> progression<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:21.060> from<00:01:21.210> G<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:22.140> B

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
same chord progression going from G to B

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.450 
same chord progression going from G to B
minor<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> minor<00:01:24.090> 7<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:25.799> then<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
minor to a minor 7 and then the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.620 
minor to a minor 7 and then the
descending<00:01:27.119> run<00:01:28.759> with<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:29.970> four<00:01:30.149> pinches<00:01:30.390> in

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
descending run with just four pinches in

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.980 
descending run with just four pinches in
there<00:01:30.750> ending<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> G<00:01:32.270> watch<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.659> right

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
there ending on the G watch out right

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.990 
there ending on the G watch out right
here<00:01:34.259> you're<00:01:34.470> doing<00:01:34.649> a<00:01:34.680> fancy<00:01:35.100> little<00:01:35.250> thing

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
here you're doing a fancy little thing

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.330 
here you're doing a fancy little thing
in<00:01:36.119> there<00:01:36.330> that's<00:01:36.539> taking<00:01:37.409> one<00:01:37.680> beat<00:01:37.890> too<00:01:38.100> long

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
in there that's taking one beat too long

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.950 
in there that's taking one beat too long
so<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.909> got<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.119> scope<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.750> out<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.899> little

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
so you got to scope that out a little

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.969 
so you got to scope that out a little
bit<00:01:40.080> more<00:01:40.289> carefully<00:01:40.590> because<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.830> end<00:01:40.950> up

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
bit more carefully because you end up

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.010 
bit more carefully because you end up
being<00:01:41.190> a<00:01:41.369> beat<00:01:41.759> late<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.330> do<00:01:42.450> something<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.960> I

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
being a beat late to do something like I

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.380 
being a beat late to do something like I
don't<00:01:43.200> fly<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.500> figure<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.039> I<00:01:44.159> can

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
don't fly can figure this out if I can

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.719 
don't fly can figure this out if I can
fake<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:48.830> so<00:01:49.830> before<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.250> minor<00:01:50.490> chord

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
fake this so before that a minor chord

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.609 
fake this so before that a minor chord
you<00:01:50.909> get<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.179> get<00:01:51.330> hung<00:01:51.509> up<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.259> something

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
you get you get hung up in in something

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.169 
you get you get hung up in in something
a<00:01:52.800> little<00:01:52.830> too<00:01:53.280> fancy<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.819> watch<00:01:53.970> out<00:01:54.149> for

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
a little too fancy so watch out for

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.330 
a little too fancy so watch out for
those<00:01:54.360> kinds<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.720> embellishments<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.950> they<00:01:56.130> if

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
those kinds of embellishments if they if

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.950 
those kinds of embellishments if they if
they<00:01:56.580> mess<00:01:56.909> up<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.149> timing<00:01:57.539> a<00:01:57.600> little<00:01:57.630> bit

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960
