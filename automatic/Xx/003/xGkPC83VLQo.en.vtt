00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
 Hmm 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.840
 a 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.170
 Such things 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.170
 Saw 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:15.260
 I am experimenting from now 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:20.860
 The vibration of a string was why I wanted to make it The vibration of a string 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.860
 It's such for clarity and pull push to these 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.260
 It is this kind of shaking 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.460
 Once Well this is that it is the surface plate 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.460
 Longitudinal vibration 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.710
 from now on 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:44.510
 It may be good to say that it is the vibration of the concussion horizontal level against the face man 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.410
 In we though that the live clitoris uses One eye is what 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.060
 You will be hit 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.820
 A celebration 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.860
 Well almost that against the face plate 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.950
 Who can beat the vibration 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.390
 Give before the surface 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.190
 Vibrational 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.190
 Power guess is that that strong 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.380
 So then that kind of vertical vibration 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.380
 Give this kind of vibration 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.340
 By the shape of the nails that what it is 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.869
 various 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.170
 Easy to understand how to think in that or do an easy-to-understand to the student tried to make this 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.650
 I 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.940
 For example, if your nails hit 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.390
 The shape is diagonal 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.340
 That one 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.500
 It is going to move this way against the such Fu at the frontmost Once that's the way 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.740
 I will leave at last 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.510
 This of course say finger 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.010
 Because it moves in a circle 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.590
 a little 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:51.030
 There are times when it is pushed in by itself, but the form of the nail itself is pushed in 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.300
 I say that I have to make 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.140
 It is a thing 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.490
 so 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.090
 This is a pick of electric guitar 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.110
 If you use it and press it 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.830
 Because it goes the instep finger 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.600
 Hit here 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.770
 If you go this way 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.770
 If you move in this direction 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.400
 Vertical vibration 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.400
 I wonder if I'm doing this 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.069
 think 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:27.939
 Taking in also the guitar list is that management of the claw 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.939
 It is an area of research, for example, if the second slope is strong 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:38.670
 If I do my best, I can push it down to the bottom but my finger is hard to get big 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:42.210
 For example, a finger of the inheritance is to say that gentle managers You're sorry one eye of the slope of the claw 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.820
 It is such an image when we think 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.820
 Then the nail is easy to come off 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.510
 The part pushed down a little becomes weak 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.510
 Since the fall out and after slip 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:03.189
 The vibration itself will be reduced a little, but everyone will search for this money 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.189
 When I do it with a finger that is very easy to get through 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:12.620
 Since the nail itself has little force to push in , it will be accumulated and pulled out like this 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.620
 It will be said that 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.319
 I tried to make seen this kind of thing that you say 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.260
 How is it 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:27.420
 Easy to wood 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:29.840
 This screw is a wood screw for putting things on a wall or something 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.840
 later 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:38.200
 Hey What Te do you that is one cat of public service coat you say 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:43.000
 某 diy's shop 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:46.140
 That's right sideways time is 6 hours after onset 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.140
 I guess I called the fashionable rubber 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.420
 How did you try to use it 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.069
 Resin etc 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.270
 Parallel sheet 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:02.390
 The visual aspect of Apoyando is 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:08.959
 Is there anyone who thinks like pushing in? If you say from the angle of the finger, it is so 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:11.180
 However, depending on the situation, if you pull out smoothly as it is, it feels like a relatively high groom 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:15.590
 Become 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.850
 Well to make it easy for later students to study various things like that 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.510
 I made it 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.510
 that's all
