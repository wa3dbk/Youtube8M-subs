00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 a short description about agm 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.910
 battery is located at the agm batteries 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.820
 Not containing sulfuric acid 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.519
 in battery case but is in the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.980
 Mats of glass water flows bound 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.039
 so occurs at a damage of the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.340
 battery case no acid from there the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.500
 Battery dry is the missing one 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.230
 liquid allows the agm battery 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.630
 to be mounted in any position 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.059
 through the printed packaging of the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.070
 plates with the glass fiber mats 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.430
 There is also no flow 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.309
 plate movements he this particular 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.430
 construction makes them 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.649
 less sensitive to vibrations 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.070
 the active mass is on the positive 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.520
 and negative grids are applied and will 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.510
 about special mixtures from the 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.280
 Main ingredients lead oxide 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.670
 sulfuric acid and water 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.590
 with an agm battery transform 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.009
 the two gases, the water too 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.080
 back in this way goes the gas and 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.770
 so that the electric is not 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.740
 lost 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.850
 even the agm battery is gas-tight 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.330
 be opened 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.600
 only with too strong gas development the 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.649
 means at too high pressure builds 20 to 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.619
 200 billion pressure relief valve gas off 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:31.789
 via a discharge channel up to one 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.220
 dismissal as a safety measure there 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.770
 it is a so-called back seat 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.159
 it is a small disc 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.500
 made of ceramic or plastic this back 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.319
 Protection prevents a flame 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.000
 from outside in the battery penetrates 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:52.399
 and thus could cause an explosion 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.069
 the agm battery has opposite the 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.440
 conventional battery one clearly 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.289
 higher energy throughput for a lot 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.020
 performance over a long time as well as one 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.880
 extreme sieglin strength in the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.060
 she can cut faster and faster 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.640
 be unloaded more often 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.130
 Thus, agm batteries are mainly 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.820
 on vehicles with stop josi themes 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.970
 where the electric energy when braking 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.549
 recuperated is used 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.250
 why do not open the lock stocker 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.950
 The closure plug must not under any circumstances 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.190
 be opened because the battery through 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.109
 the entry of oxygen 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.720
 chemical balance loses and 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:38.079
 short-term inoperable 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.079
 becomes
