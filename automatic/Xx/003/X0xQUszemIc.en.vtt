concaved<00:00:52.559> inside<00:00:53.100> shrunk<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.390> won't<00:00:54.600> do

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
concaved inside shrunk in this won't do

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.660 
concaved inside shrunk in this won't do
that<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.320> I'll<00:00:55.980> show<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.250> what<00:00:56.460> we're<00:00:56.550> going

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
that so I'll show you what we're going

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.970 
that so I'll show you what we're going
to<00:00:56.699> do<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.000> now<00:00:57.149> why<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:57.989> brush<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.559> wall<00:00:58.800> to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
to do it now why I brush this wall to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.709 
to do it now why I brush this wall to
get<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> dirt<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.730> crap<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.449> this

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
get all the dirt and crap out of this

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.860 
get all the dirt and crap out of this
and<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.469> idea<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.489> squeeze<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.390> caulking

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
and the idea is to squeeze the caulking

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.100 
and the idea is to squeeze the caulking
into<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.890> crack<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.489> when<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.540> caulking

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
into the crack and when the caulking

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.780 
into the crack and when the caulking
comes<00:01:07.320> out<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.010> crack<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.520> full

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
comes out you know that crack is full

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.820 
comes out you know that crack is full
then<00:01:09.330> we'll<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.049> either<00:01:10.170> use<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.500> glove

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
then we'll we can either use a glove

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.179 
then we'll we can either use a glove
like<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.400> thing<00:01:11.640> that's<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.630> finish<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.950> we

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
like this thing that's the finish or we

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.469 
like this thing that's the finish or we
could<00:01:14.340> use<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> sponge<00:01:14.760> bullet<00:01:15.090> I'll<00:01:15.180> show<00:01:15.420> you

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
could use a sponge bullet I'll show you

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.300 
could use a sponge bullet I'll show you
with<00:01:15.689> either<00:01:15.869> first<00:01:16.470> let<00:01:16.740> me<00:01:16.770> go<00:01:16.950> ahead<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
with either first let me go ahead and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.480 
with either first let me go ahead and
notice<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.880> cut<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.299> at<00:01:18.540> an<00:01:18.659> angle<00:01:18.930> here<00:01:19.320> 45<00:01:19.860> so

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
notice I cut this at an angle here 45 so

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.800 
notice I cut this at an angle here 45 so
I<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.729> get<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.299> here

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
I can get it in here

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.399 
I can get it in here
bit<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.560> stretch<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.810> for<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> purpose<00:01:25.259> of

the back of them hole itself

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.319 
the back of them hole itself
don't<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.590> resort<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.729> place<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
don't just resort to place in the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.319 
don't just resort to place in the
caulking<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> top<00:01:46.880> goes<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.270> that

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
caulking on the top goes up like that

00:01:48.329 --> 00:02:03.590 
caulking on the top goes up like that
too<00:01:48.750> much<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.259> clean<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:51.060> start<00:01:51.509> again

the<00:02:20.130> idea<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:21.380> let<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.710> with<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
the idea is to let it in with the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.110 
the idea is to let it in with the
surrounding<00:02:24.630> finish<00:02:25.020> otherwise<00:02:25.970> if<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.090> just

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
surrounding finish otherwise if you just

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.180 
surrounding finish otherwise if you just
go<00:02:27.450> like<00:02:27.630> this<00:02:27.840> what<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.560> drives<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.100> it

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
go like this what it drives in it

go like this what it drives in it
painted<00:02:29.580> you'll<00:02:29.760> see<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.090> falling<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.720> I

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
painted you'll see that falling so I

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.020 
painted you'll see that falling so I
guess<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.710> floated<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.280> give<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.820> same

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
guess it floated in give it the same

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.050 
guess it floated in give it the same
finish<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:35.120> lot<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.240> times<00:02:36.450> what<00:02:36.690> I'll<00:02:36.810> do<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.260> is

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
because most most EU homeowners will

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.220

have<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.470> flow<00:02:44.770> but<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:46.420> really<00:02:46.690> want<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.960> do<00:02:47.110> it

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
have a flow but you really want to do it

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.120 
have a flow but you really want to do it
just<00:02:47.610> tad<00:02:48.610> bit<00:02:48.910> better<00:02:49.150> like<00:02:49.390> what<00:02:49.660> we<00:02:49.810> do<00:02:50.080> is<00:02:51.010> a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
just tad bit better like what we do is a

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.250 
just tad bit better like what we do is a
sponge<00:02:51.400> flow<00:02:51.670> put<00:02:52.330> some<00:02:52.480> water<00:02:52.660> on<00:02:52.840> it

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
sponge flow put some water on it

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.910 
sponge flow put some water on it
and<00:02:53.350> what<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.710> do<00:02:53.860> is<00:02:54.010> just<00:02:54.370> simply<00:02:55.360> Ingrid<00:02:56.290> and

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
and what we do is just simply Ingrid and

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.550 
and what we do is just simply Ingrid and
that<00:02:57.100> actually<00:02:57.580> raises<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.840> aggregate<00:02:59.320> in

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
that actually raises the aggregate in

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.830 
that actually raises the aggregate in
the<00:02:59.680> coffin<00:03:00.100> itself<00:03:02.160> pretty<00:03:03.160> simple<00:03:03.840> we've
