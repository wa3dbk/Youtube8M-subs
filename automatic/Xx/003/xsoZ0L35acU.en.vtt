problem I can see aside from of course a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.130 
problem I can see aside from of course a
little<00:01:11.390> placement<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.450> buttons<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.049> are

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
kind of odd like these are your volume

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.749 
kind of odd like these are your volume
controls<00:01:15.270> over<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.200> your<00:01:16.860> end<00:01:17.100> button<00:01:17.460> is

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
controls over here your end button is

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.130 
controls over here your end button is
over<00:01:18.030> here<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> side<00:01:18.450> also<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.990> can

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
over here on the side also you can

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.899 
over here on the side also you can
hardly<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.189> that's<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
hardly see it and that's one of the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.700 
hardly see it and that's one of the
problems<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.479> well<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:22.110> other<00:01:22.380> than<00:01:22.650> that

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
problems as well but other than that

it<00:01:30.420> has<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> camera<00:01:30.869> here<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> back<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:31.920> well

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it has a camera here at the back as well

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.670 
it has a camera here at the back as well
as<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.909> matter<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.180> fact<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> functions

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
as a matter of fact all the functions

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.920 
as a matter of fact all the functions
are<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.159> phone<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:36.180> only<00:01:36.390> thing<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.720> guess

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
are in this phone the only thing I guess

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.440 
are in this phone the only thing I guess
it<00:01:37.590> could<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:37.890> improved<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.270> memory

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
it could be improved on is the memory

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.230
