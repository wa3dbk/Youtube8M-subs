00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.100
 From time to time van Sant Egidio will improve that in ours 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.230
 Records software and less connotates us there but in two 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.940
 Modes of still so way smaller forms of break-ins come h 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:22.349
 but overall, after massive state aid would have the most 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:23.220
 newspapers 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.939
 since the game modes are based on about Modern Warfare 2 oriented is the 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.960
 Entry for connoisseurs of Koller for the series also pretty easy 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.290
 Here we are, for example, in a stink-normal game Team Deathmatch 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.690
 the card Hanoi Ott next to 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.370
 This is 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.350
 just like in the predecessors Modern Warfare Modern Warfare 2 and was introduced 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.550
 Bonds rise soldiers by kills in the ranks 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.590
 I entertain entertaining challenges coupled with weapons or game modes 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.010
 additional experience points 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.970
 for the ranks are new weapons 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.920
 and grenades and off reds the rifle scopes unlocked differently though 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.320
 than in the old serial parts you can not then according to your mood on it 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.050
 but must first buy the purchased equipment 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.190
 with the so-called Figo the dollar 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.150
 Incidentally, the completion of the investigation as this new 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.000
 remotely controlled cars that you can jump wonderfully in small groups 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.380
 unless it is completed beforehand 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.060
 The DVD dollar is earned automatically during the game 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.900
 normal moody's or in the so-called Greeter matches 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.240
 or bed playing in the beginning 500 c and d dollar wager 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.240
 have to be invested to participate 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.540
 then the other soldiers play the prizes thousand 500 900 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.310
 and 6 Knots July dollars spread over the top three of the total stands 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.270
 there are only six players 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.850
 the Uenzer Mertes differ not only in the number of players but 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.780
 in other respects of the rest, too, at the core of it is courageous 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.310
 Example of a test match in the blackout, however, the weapons in court in 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.060
 Stock and stone respectively Saxon 12 the counterparties for example with 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.840
 Crossbows and ballistic knives go on each other in a run or 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.100
 English warning Chambre players have as you can already only one 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.670
 Ball in the barrel »with each conclusion comes like a new ball 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.900
 if the projectile landed in the hit, only that remains 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.900
 Messer altogether a hochspannender mode of the however also quite to the 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.170
 Camping or a loving said 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.260
 to lure animated what the games sometimes drag out badly 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.600
 can between the prelude of the round and this castle ten contained almost 8 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.859
 min 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.889
 By the way, who does not want to participate in a game of sweepstakes does not have to 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.059
 Entry in the final in the main menu go and hope that his game 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.619
 is assigned what turns out then usually as full 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:48.239
 yet you can also search through the server browser and take India game 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.159
 In the end it was never a pretty show Gómez that in the 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.109
 The multiplayer mode of backups puts the cinema above the animals 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.959
 Function, you can download the games you have completed 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.769
 So see so-called replace it, but at your whim Rome 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.809
 tinker and take scene from 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:09.319
 You can switch between the players back and forth in the exterior view 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.259
 watch or send the camera freely across the markets 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:16.879
 you can slow down the time in the room or accelerate absolutely who? 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.559
 has times talent has so can create really cool movies because the 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:25.359
 but no talent no leisure and have no time at least have to 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.779
 slowly but surely reach rank 50 and then the prestige mode 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:32.869
 Visual still have fun with the remaining seconds of the video and 

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:35.869
