right<00:00:44.910> there<00:00:44.969> comes<00:00:45.149> from<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.660> my<00:00:45.870> foot<00:00:46.170> I

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
right there comes from just my foot I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.840 
right there comes from just my foot I
think<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.070> where<00:00:47.309> my<00:00:47.520> foot<00:00:47.730> of

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
think that it's just where my foot of

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.520 
think that it's just where my foot of
shape<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> majority<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.750> my<00:00:48.809> shoes<00:00:49.110> do<00:00:49.350> that

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
shape the majority of my shoes do that

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.160 
shape the majority of my shoes do that
anyway<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.550> because<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.390> air<00:00:51.510> bubbles<00:00:51.989> air

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
anyway but because the air bubbles air

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.590 
anyway but because the air bubbles air
bubbles<00:00:52.680> are<00:00:52.800> clear<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.760> only<00:00:54.030> thing<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.510> I

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
bubbles are clear the only thing that I

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.020
