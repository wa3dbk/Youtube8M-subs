00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
for tablet interfaces you're actually

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.410 
for tablet interfaces you're actually
going<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.129> be<00:02:08.190> able<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.550> switch<00:02:08.789> over<00:02:08.970> from

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
going to be able to switch over from

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.790

the<00:02:14.730> biggest<00:02:15.030> difference<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.570> going<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.900> be

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
the biggest difference is going to be

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.050 
the biggest difference is going to be
that<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.500> desktop<00:02:17.160> mode<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.580> going<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:17.910> be

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
that the desktop mode is going to be

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.900 
that the desktop mode is going to be
more<00:02:18.300> centered<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.860> point<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.400> click<00:02:20.640> of

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.700 
a mouse and keyboard and the tablet mode
obviously<00:02:23.790> will<00:02:23.940> be<00:02:24.030> centered<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.720> tablet

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710
