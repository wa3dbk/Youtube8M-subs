00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.420 
23 layers you just want to make sure
that<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.960> don't<00:02:16.050> kick<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.470> out<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.920> thin

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
that you don't kick it out so you thin

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.970 
that you don't kick it out so you thin
thin<00:02:18.090> layers<00:02:18.360> but<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.230> really<00:02:19.590> like<00:02:19.800> this

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
thin layers but I really like this

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.080 
thin layers but I really like this
product<00:02:20.280> because<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.420> more<00:02:22.110> higher

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
product because it is a more higher

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.760 
product because it is a more higher
coverage<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:25.020> need<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> more<00:02:25.560> higher

coverage and I need a more higher

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.330 
coverage and I need a more higher
coverage<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.460> can<00:02:26.580> also<00:02:26.790> use<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:28.070> fluffy<00:02:29.070> brush

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340

coverage you can also use a fluffy brush
in<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.630> get<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> lighter<00:02:31.500> coverage<00:02:32.510> but<00:02:33.510> I

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
in it and get a lighter coverage but I

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.500

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
I'm going to pick up a little bit of the

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:57.830 
I'm going to pick up a little bit of the
mineralized<00:05:53.400> skinfinish<00:05:56.120> you<00:05:57.120> can<00:05:57.330> use<00:05:57.599> this

mineralized skinfinish you can use this

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.640 
mineralized skinfinish you can use this
wet<00:05:58.110> because<00:05:58.590> it<00:05:58.770> is<00:05:58.860> mineralized<00:06:00.169> so<00:06:01.169> you<00:06:01.259> get

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
wet because it is mineralized so you get

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.890 
wet because it is mineralized so you get
a<00:06:01.680> little<00:06:02.009> more<00:06:02.370> coverage<00:06:02.699> when<00:06:03.210> you<00:06:03.360> use<00:06:03.690> it

in<00:06:04.259> the<00:06:04.409> wet<00:06:04.650> version<00:06:05.070> it's<00:06:05.250> more<00:06:05.490> like<00:06:05.639> a

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
in the wet version it's more like a

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.620 
in the wet version it's more like a
foundation<00:06:07.610> but<00:06:08.610> it<00:06:08.759> definitely<00:06:08.969> works<00:06:09.419> both

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
foundation but it definitely works both

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.560 
foundation but it definitely works both
ways<00:06:10.159> so<00:06:11.159> there's<00:06:11.400> versatility<00:06:12.300> in<00:06:12.479> the

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570
