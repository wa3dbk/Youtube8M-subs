00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.590

 garlic 3 cloves rice cereal 2 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.230

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.599
 vegetable oil 2 tablespoons 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.710
 bay leaf two pieces salt one 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.440
 tablespoon 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.399
 black pepper peas de sep 13 pieces and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.160
 allspice 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.690
 branches peas and so we need 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.730
 cook broth 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.989
 today I will cook pickle on 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.329
 ordinary meat broth 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.390
 here is traditional this soup taken 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.460
 cook with al buds from meat for 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.860
 lifting it is better to use meat on 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.629
 bones so he will be more nourishing and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.059
 at least this time I only use 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.820
 pork but itâ€™s best to cook broth 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.739
 from several types of meat 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.280
 maybe it doesn't quite match 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.010
 culinary rule 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.110
 to the forest nw no always for one to three 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.270
 minutes boil in boiling water 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.830
 wash and only then put in 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.460
 pan with which I am going to date 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.770
 venturi 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.439
 thanks to this procedure, protein on 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.630
 the surface of the meat collapses and is no longer 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.350
 no need to catch foam 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.299
 skimmer from broth meat only 5 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.220
 washed and placed in a pot of water 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.439
 or water to boil 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.020
 not covered tightly and turned off 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.799
 fire further boil broth on a gentle 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.860
 fire for 30 and 50 minutes water at 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.930
 this should not boil too much if you want 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.090
 get rich soup with rich 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.549
 taste you need your so much 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.979
 broth so you don't have to add to 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.200
 soup water and if the need is all 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.560
 there was only water 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.590
 that boiled and so half boil in 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.509
 for 30-40 minutes and then add to 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.189
 pan a few bay leaves 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.790
 onions carrots 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.590
 honeycomb black and allspice peas 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.899
 Onions need to be cleaned and notched 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.450
 crosswise to somewhere in the middle of the bulbs 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.280
 or grandchildren can do from four to 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.440
 six puncture the beach thanks to this 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.390
 broth has all his taste 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.120
 carrot also need to be pre 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.430
 you can clear the carrot except broth 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.920
 put parsley root a lover 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.020
 can add parsnip pour and broth 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.700
 moderately because of the presence in the soup 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.520
 pickled cucumbers its very easy 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.739
 salted if you salted soup 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.050
 then you need to rinse one or two handfuls 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.010
 rice itself such in pure gauze and 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.830
 put in the soup 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.840
 croup feeds itself a personal essence and when 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.270
 it happens you just need to get it 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.700
 food warmer steep out of the pot making broth 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.250
 until boiling and boil under tightly closed 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.670
 cover it with medium heat for 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.550
 40 and 10 minutes first you need 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.920
 to decide whether you will clean the cucumbers 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.780
 the fact is that sometimes pickles 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.000
 have a fairly tough skin 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.819
 which spoils the whole impression of plus 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.350
 if you just got such cucumbers then 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.840
 it is better to clean the skin 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.989
 and so it says good did not disappear 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.080
 for nothing, you can add broth for 15-20 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.810
 minutes before the end of cooking so she 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.880
 will give broth and all your taste naturally 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.620
 then these skins from the broth need to be removed 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.940
 but it's best to just strain the broth 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.459
 slag man 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.590
 cucumbers themselves need to be cut thin 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.140
 straw than the thinner sliced 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.840
 the cucumbers will be softer and richer 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.910
 pickle can certainly speed up 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.709
 process and grate cucumbers on large 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.110
 grater but better to spend a few 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.930
 extra minutes and cut the cucumbers into strips 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.780
 keep in mind that the number of cucumbers 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.390
 directly depends on their taste 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.640
 if cucumbers are very sour salty but 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.260
 you need to reduce their number but there is 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.940
 cucumbers weak with adobe 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.010
 that is, not only can you put a little 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.880
 more than stated in the recipe but also 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.590
 add court cucumber pickle 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.519
 peel carrots and grate 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.720
 grater or chop finely chopped 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.510
 Onions clean and crumble 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.910
 small cubes 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.420
 from the ready broth you need to remove the vegetables and 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.850
 meat 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.950
 and you can just strain the broth meat 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.989
 need to cool and chop if you 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.180
 used meat on the bone before 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.609
 how to cut it you need to sort out from 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.370
 cartilage bones and streak if desired 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.760
 can remove meat fat meat can 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.290
 cut into small cube 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.380
 stone or just take it apart 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.690
 fiber now proceed to cooking 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.880
 refueling on heated vegetable 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.920
 butter carrots fry until 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.560
 transparency then add the bulb 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.080
 onions and fry vegetables until transparency and 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.330
 light golden color now 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.120
 add to fried onions with carrots 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.090
 chopped meat and lightly fry it 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.170
 for two or three will follow to 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.200
 vegetables are not burnt 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.540
 late add refills chopped 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.760
 straws pickles and stews everything under 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.790
 lid on low heat for 10 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.430
 20 minutes refueling is necessary periodically 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.680
 stir so that it does not burn if in 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.870
 filling up very little fluid is not necessary 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.030
 add ladle broth and if you 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.010
 use slightly salted cucumbers then 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.400
 instead of broth dressing you can add 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:19.220
 half a glass of cucumber pickle 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.550
 wash rice with running water 68 times until 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.050
 the water will not become clear 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.220
 strained broth to return to the plate and 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.580

 after 5 minutes add to the soup dressing of 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.810
 vegetables and meat and pickles bring 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.730

 turn down the heat and cook under loosely 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.770

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.640
 peel potatoes and cut into small ones 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.340
 diced 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.500
 if you peeled potatoes beforehand 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.570
 forget to put in cold water to 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.460

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.110

 and then add to butter 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:45.580
 deep enough bowl 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:47.620
 stir butter garlic ideas 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.520

 mortars 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.229

 once sony can be tangled with a towel and 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.689
 let it stand for 20-30 minutes while 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:15.939
 pickle is resting and gaining taste 

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:18.550
 you can cook a simple dressing 

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:22.449
 You can of course submit if it is not just with 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:25.599
