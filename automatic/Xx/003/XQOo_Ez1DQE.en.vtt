 it's up and that's so I do not like 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.149

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.600
 any light sure you have on 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.129
 the pupil except the lips so it does 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.559

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.360
 confused taken 3 too bad for me 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.619

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.830
 done it's a watercolor oled ray thing 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.020
 eyes I take this as one like a 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.180
 blush and its brand enormously its mark 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.619
 the om student - I do not like do not put any 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.840
 the powder on the pupil is very very 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.320
 good too and I took products 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.310
 L'orÃ©al 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.020
 so you have a 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.460
 lied it is she who is super 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.470
 frankly I love them they found 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.200
 that's what I have right now and a 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.299
 blue liner here I price because 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.259
 it was like 4 euros and wise in 8th 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:52.170
 red then it's my mother who gave it to me 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.170
 bought and so I'm going to chain with 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.789
 so sounded then required with the card 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.229
 gift prizes gifts for my mother 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.289
 for my sister and for myself 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.750
 obviously so I redid myself 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.869
 late facade on Thursday for all what the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.209
 dyed because in fact I basically 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.950
 always took this tent there n141 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.989
 who goes to my Pakistani girlfriend what 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.580
 is slightly black so it does not suit me 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.959
 it's too dark a good tax the day 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.430
 dogma advised actually wanted 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.810
 a max of the small shops where you 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.580
 have all the blinds that enlightens you the 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.709
 face whose face you have and 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.540
 orange and so suddenly me 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.040
 the friend I said it's great it's great 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.660
 I say yeah that's good too 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.940
 no it's too dark and like a 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.739
 mouth I took two foundations 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.660
 and dark circles that do not go they 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.580
 are way too dark so I 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.010
 am redoing a stock so of two camps 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.720
 prices 2 as his red lottery 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.329
 before will go down so I have 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.440
 taken the excess 35 that clearly went to me 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.299
 the better you see the difference when 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.340
 even that's nc because in terms of that 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.750
 okay but Indian or Pakistani I 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.850
 find that my girlfriend and that's the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.100
 hate it is 41 of the course of 35 to redon 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.720
 which suddenly is not morning so suddenly 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.390
 I took two like that but who 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.700
 are worth 32 euros 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.540
 then I had taken before the concealer 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.519
 liquid in w25 that was similar too 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.230
 dark at it was dark circles or the 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.359
 we conceal them suddenly I wanted 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.120
 to test the stuff you know the stuff 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.170
 years so we are open a very bridge 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.389
 because I have not used them yet 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.250
 that's it so suddenly I took mw 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.690
 before so still a good color 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.489
 underneath like that if I did them 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.910
 that once I took two and 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.620
 that's 20 euros each 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.519
 Then I took a fold pauthe 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.859
 so it's the father ly to smooth the lah 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.810
 for the mobile eyelid it's like a 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:38.260
 basis so I prices because I the 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.180
 mostly saw the tutorials of youtube two 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.040
 Australian and French American 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.569
 I thought why not test it and 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.280
 it costs about 20 euros it's me 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.190
 it seems and it reads your eyelid 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.140
 sets the 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.790
 the makeup is too good I have 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.440
 tried to not fooled me 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.910
 glitters not everything from maybelline that are 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.580
 not even basics but hey I 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.780
 served it as a base nothing to see even 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.250
 sometimes I put my anti firm 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.630
 as a base but that's too good 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.950
 I assure you that bullys eyelid 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.630
 because I have eyelids that will be 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.300
 bridles even though I'm only 27 years old I have 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.820
 eyelids ride and so the lighthouse 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.920
 net between my merits late May but get 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.600
 did it when we called it so it was 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.190
 really ugly and with that see the 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.540
 result it's going to change completely its 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.410
 eyeshadow I'm so happy 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.940
 so that's after I took his 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.990
 share when it's my only regret it's 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.730
 a lip pencil from chez mac 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.590
 I did not expect it to be 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.210
 so expensive actually I was wrong I 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.010
 thought it was 13 euros and it did not 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.210
 will not change p 19 euros so that I 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.550
 regret it's really too expensive at 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.710
 price level so that's the bell ball 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.420
 the bar is actually a mood 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.120
 here I have dyed nude this is not a 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.950
 colored pencil this is a point the 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.230
 quality is not top I believe it in 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.620
 face we see nothing I made a mistake 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:52.310
 with that but it's okay too bad 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.930
 then I took a mineral powder is 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.140
 like those have I took two 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.760
 one like that and a powder so here 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.200
 I took the hue medium is 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.030
 fundamental for me to mess up like that 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.190
 it's too good and I took one 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.600
 in powder but embarrassed to my mother because 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.760
 I regret because I do not like 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.230
 do you put yourself a little bit and 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.610
 then finally to 10,000 who cling to 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.010
 brush is without losing too much 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.510
 quantity so the swords 32 euros and 32 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:20.900
 euros then I finally filled my quad 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.150
 of mac after ten years so I took over the 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.250
 concrete hue for my eyebrows 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.780
 I took the orange row that I have on 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.160
 my eyes are called orange and that's 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.680
 atlantic I do not know what's a blue 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.890
 very very pigmented so here I have 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.840
 resumed my quad and then I took 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.720
 red lipstick pardon 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.660
 so it's the end of time like that 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.250
 it's a rose like that simple 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.820
 I offered a masseur called the pink 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.230
 pigeon 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.250
 this is actually I thought I had 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.450
 moistened with products because I have to 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.490
 do it anyway she is for massa 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.020
 for my mother I took it a red which 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.230
 does long lasting the red ring of 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.970
 the other side is the gloss and I 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.770
 pray the powder and a blush here and for 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.500
 my sister I also pray for the red to 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.810
 lips and a lighthouse for c 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.430
 for his eyebrows so that's all that 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.260
 I took during the sales it was not 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.580
 finally max was not paid but see 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.050
 I did not really fool myself 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.490
 many commented on beauty brive and 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.450
 after I do not know if it's necessary 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.040
 that I tell you the world because I 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.900
 many of the micellar waters decree n 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.310
 dropping things like that I spent 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.500
 two big orders on private beauty 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.880
 and then the other commands that I have 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.040
 past is more at the level of the clothes 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.450
 and all that I personally I 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.680
 do not like watching this kind of videos 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.030
 so I will not introduce you to any wheat 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.320
 everything I ordered so here we go 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.320
 sorry picasso
