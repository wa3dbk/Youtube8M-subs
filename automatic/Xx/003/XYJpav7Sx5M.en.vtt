first stage of the building seven we do

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.090 
first stage of the building seven we do
our<00:00:36.300> plumbing<00:00:36.750> we<00:00:37.350> start<00:00:37.620> setting<00:00:37.980> our

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
our plumbing we start setting our

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100 
our plumbing we start setting our
cabinets<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.059> then<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.300> moves<00:00:39.480> down<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.750> few

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.470 
cabinets and then it moves down a few
stations<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:41.399> set<00:00:41.670> our<00:00:41.790> cabinets<00:00:42.239> at<00:00:42.390> our

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
stations we set our cabinets at our

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.060 
stations we set our cabinets at our
showers<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.140> then<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.320> put<00:00:43.500> our<00:00:43.530> side<00:00:43.860> walls

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
showers and then we put our side walls

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.610 
showers and then we put our side walls
on<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.399> are<00:00:44.489> built<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.789> another<00:00:44.969> building

look<00:01:23.610> at<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.180> then<00:01:24.869> pull<00:01:25.130> wires<00:01:26.130> or<00:01:26.520> baby

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
look at it and then pull wires or baby

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.149 
look at it and then pull wires or baby
wires<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:27.720> add<00:01:27.930> receptor<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.860> add

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
here basically we have three stations

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.870 
here basically we have three stations
here<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:34.650> all<00:01:34.829> our<00:01:34.979> wiring<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.490> kept<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:35.820> the
