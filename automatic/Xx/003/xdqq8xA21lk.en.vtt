to<00:01:45.490> use<00:01:45.820> now<00:01:46.600> I'm<00:01:47.110> just<00:01:47.380> doing<00:01:47.500> a<00:01:47.860> half<00:01:48.159> circle

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
to use now I'm just doing a half circle

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.510 
to use now I'm just doing a half circle
dreamcatcher<00:01:49.210> at<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.869> base<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.380> my<00:01:51.070> middle

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
dreamcatcher at the base of my middle

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.059 
dreamcatcher at the base of my middle
nail<00:01:51.789> and<00:01:52.229> starting<00:01:53.229> off<00:01:53.350> with<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.530> dot<00:01:53.830> and

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
nail and starting off with a dot and

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.850 
nail and starting off with a dot and
then<00:01:54.280> this<00:01:54.700> one's<00:01:54.940> a<00:01:55.270> triangle<00:01:55.869> triangular

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
then this one's a triangle triangular

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.219 
then this one's a triangle triangular
one<00:01:57.220> so<00:01:57.520> just<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:58.030> lots<00:01:58.270> of<00:01:58.360> little<00:01:58.600> lines<00:01:58.869> and

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
one so just a lots of little lines and

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.600 
one so just a lots of little lines and
they'll<00:01:59.319> all<00:01:59.440> end<00:01:59.470> up<00:01:59.740> being<00:02:00.009> like<00:02:00.280> little

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
they'll all end up being like little

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.340 
they'll all end up being like little
triangles<00:02:01.149> you'll<00:02:01.960> see<00:02:02.080> what<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.259> mean

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.930 

now<00:02:05.350> also<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.069> lines<00:02:06.340> are<00:02:06.580> on<00:02:06.700> this

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
now also the lines are on this

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.820 
now also the lines are on this
dreamcatcher<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.780> little<00:02:08.140> thicker<00:02:08.410> than<00:02:08.500> what

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
dreamcatcher a little thicker than what

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.169 
dreamcatcher a little thicker than what
I<00:02:08.890> would<00:02:09.100> normally<00:02:09.250> do<00:02:09.580> because<00:02:09.910> we're<00:02:10.030> going

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
I would normally do because we're going

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.330 
I would normally do because we're going
to<00:02:10.269> be<00:02:10.330> going<00:02:10.450> over<00:02:10.780> them<00:02:11.170> with<00:02:11.470> some<00:02:11.739> color<00:02:12.069> to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
to be going over them with some color to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.150 
to be going over them with some color to
make<00:02:12.519> them<00:02:12.730> all<00:02:12.850> rainbow<00:02:13.269> B<00:02:13.769> that's<00:02:14.769> probably

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
make them all rainbow B that's probably

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.970 
make them all rainbow B that's probably
not<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.340> word<00:02:15.549> I've<00:02:16.090> just<00:02:16.299> made<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.980> so

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
not a word I've just made that so

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.539 
not a word I've just made that so
rainbow<00:02:18.370> E<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.640> definitely<00:02:19.570> a<00:02:19.600> word<00:02:19.840> now

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
rainbow E is definitely a word now

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:39.199 
rainbow E is definitely a word now
because<00:02:21.549> it's<00:02:21.670> on<00:02:21.790> YouTube

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.809 

so<00:02:40.209> once<00:02:40.360> you<00:02:40.450> have<00:02:40.569> your<00:02:40.750> half<00:02:41.019> circle

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
so once you have your half circle

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.460 
so once you have your half circle
dreamcatcher<00:02:42.819> you<00:02:43.120> want<00:02:43.329> to<00:02:43.510> draw<00:02:43.900> some<00:02:44.200> lines

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
dreamcatcher you want to draw some lines

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.530 
dreamcatcher you want to draw some lines
or<00:02:44.709> paint<00:02:44.950> some<00:02:45.159> lines<00:02:45.189> from<00:02:45.760> firstly<00:02:46.390> the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
or paint some lines from firstly the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.509 
or paint some lines from firstly the
middle<00:02:46.810> there's<00:02:47.319> three<00:02:47.680> lines<00:02:47.920> on<00:02:48.159> this<00:02:48.280> one

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
middle there's three lines on this one

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.740 
middle there's three lines on this one
you<00:02:48.730> can<00:02:48.879> paint<00:02:49.090> as<00:02:49.239> many<00:02:49.450> as<00:02:49.569> you<00:02:49.720> like

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
now all you need to do with this because

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.580 
now all you need to do with this because
the<00:04:10.290> color<00:04:10.739> is<00:04:10.830> very<00:04:11.010> very<00:04:11.640> sheer<00:04:12.590> depending

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
the color is very very sheer depending

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.869 
the color is very very sheer depending
on<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.769> strength<00:04:14.040> of<00:04:14.159> color<00:04:14.370> that<00:04:14.549> you<00:04:14.670> want

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
will depend on how often or how much you

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.949 
will depend on how often or how much you
go<00:04:17.040> over<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.549> top<00:04:17.699> of<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:18.239> can<00:04:18.660> make

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
go over the top of that you can make

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
doesn't work as well simply because it

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.350 
doesn't work as well simply because it
it<00:04:48.930> makes<00:04:49.169> it<00:04:49.260> dry<00:04:49.650> really<00:04:50.220> fast<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:51.000> yeah

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.150 
it makes it dry really fast and yeah
just<00:04:51.630> I<00:04:51.840> have<00:04:52.410> done<00:04:52.590> it<00:04:52.680> before<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:53.100> it

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
just I have done it before and it

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.120 
just I have done it before and it
doesn't<00:04:53.370> work<00:04:53.639> as<00:04:53.820> well<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:55.320> nail<00:04:55.770> polish

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130

on<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.740> dreamcatcher<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.430> can<00:05:05.550> see<00:05:05.669> that<00:05:05.789> I'm

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
on the dreamcatcher you can see that I'm

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.850 
on the dreamcatcher you can see that I'm
using<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:06.240> brushes<00:05:06.450> straight<00:05:06.900> from<00:05:07.229> the

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
using the brushes straight from the

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.980 
using the brushes straight from the
polish<00:05:08.310> bottles<00:05:08.639> from<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:08.910> OPI<00:05:09.240> she<00:05:09.630> attends

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
polish bottles from the OPI she attends

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.629 
polish bottles from the OPI she attends
and<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.650> only<00:05:10.889> reason<00:05:11.160> I<00:05:11.250> did<00:05:11.430> that<00:05:11.460> was

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
and the only reason I did that was

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.760 
and the only reason I did that was
because<00:05:12.120> this<00:05:12.750> polish<00:05:13.110> tends<00:05:13.349> to<00:05:13.470> be<00:05:13.560> quite

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
because this polish tends to be quite

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.909 
because this polish tends to be quite
stringing<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.460> thing<00:05:14.760> and<00:05:15.060> I<00:05:15.930> just<00:05:16.169> felt<00:05:16.380> like

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
stringing and thing and I just felt like

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.920 
stringing and thing and I just felt like
it<00:05:17.190> was<00:05:17.310> better<00:05:17.520> to<00:05:18.000> use<00:05:18.180> it<00:05:18.360> directly<00:05:18.810> from

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
it was better to use it directly from

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.420 
it was better to use it directly from
the<00:05:19.229> brush<00:05:21.320> now<00:05:22.320> as<00:05:22.530> per<00:05:22.710> usual<00:05:22.919> once<00:05:23.280> you've
