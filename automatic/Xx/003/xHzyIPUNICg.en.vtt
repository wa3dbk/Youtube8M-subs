00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
pretty good i got me kind of upset

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.699 
pretty good i got me kind of upset
considering<00:03:04.109> because<00:03:05.109> he<00:03:05.200> say<00:03:05.410> he's<00:03:05.560> gonna

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
considering because he say he's gonna

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.559 
considering because he say he's gonna
keep<00:03:05.859> above<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.489> I<00:03:07.000> don't<00:03:07.120> see<00:03:07.239> how<00:03:07.329> it<00:03:07.450> makes

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
keep above and I don't see how it makes

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.460 
keep above and I don't see how it makes
any<00:03:07.720> difference<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:08.260> what<00:03:08.739> happens<00:03:09.430> or

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
any difference to you what happens or

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.509 
any difference to you what happens or
your<00:03:11.470> videos<00:03:11.889> if<00:03:12.160> you're<00:03:12.280> not<00:03:12.400> engaged

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
your videos if you're not engaged

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.710 
your videos if you're not engaged
anymore<00:03:12.700> just<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.239> just<00:03:13.450> leave<00:03:13.569> it<00:03:13.599> alone

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
anymore just you just leave it alone

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.440 
anymore just you just leave it alone
right<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.400> guess<00:03:15.639> the<00:03:15.970> whole<00:03:16.090> stack<00:03:16.299> those

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
right so I guess the whole stack those

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.740 
right so I guess the whole stack those
videos<00:03:16.780> even<00:03:17.049> existed<00:03:17.709> bother<00:03:18.040> him<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:18.609> guess<00:03:19.540> I

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
videos even existed bother him I guess I

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.120 
videos even existed bother him I guess I
don't<00:03:19.959> know<00:03:20.019> I'm<00:03:20.260> not<00:03:20.380> gonna<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:20.769> don't<00:03:20.950> really

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
know it's just a stupid theory but it's

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.500

guys something hypothetically speaking

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.849 
guys something hypothetically speaking
before<00:03:28.569> hypothetically<00:03:29.319> speaking<00:03:29.440> this

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
before hypothetically speaking this

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.729 
before hypothetically speaking this
couldn't<00:03:30.250> happen<00:03:30.609> possibly<00:03:31.419> but<00:03:32.049> if<00:03:32.290> someone

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
couldn't happen possibly but if someone

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.289 
couldn't happen possibly but if someone
were<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.190> download<00:03:33.579> all<00:03:33.609> of<00:03:33.819> his<00:03:34.000> legos

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
were to download all of his legos

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.030 
were to download all of his legos
apartment<00:03:34.599> videos<00:03:34.900> would<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.709> want<00:03:35.889> them<00:03:35.980> to

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
apartment videos would you want them to

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.740 
apartment videos would you want them to
be<00:03:36.190> reuploading<00:03:36.400> on<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:36.970> website<00:03:37.239> or<00:03:37.480> something

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
be reuploading on a website or something

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.800 
be reuploading on a website or something
uh<00:03:39.150> because<00:03:40.150> I<00:03:40.299> don't<00:03:40.419> think<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.599> makes<00:03:40.720> any

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
uh because I don't think it makes any

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.300 
uh because I don't think it makes any
difference<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.290> him<00:03:41.319> and<00:03:41.680> so<00:03:41.739> one<00:03:41.859> uses<00:03:42.130> his

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
difference to him and so one uses his

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.680 
difference to him and so one uses his
stuff<00:03:42.840> because<00:03:43.840> he<00:03:44.440> deleted<00:03:44.799> it<00:03:45.569> what<00:03:46.569> if

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
stuff because he deleted it what if

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.449 
stuff because he deleted it what if
someone<00:03:46.870> just<00:03:47.169> download<00:03:47.530> all<00:03:47.769> of<00:03:47.799> them<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.250> I

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
someone just download all of them and I

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.960 
someone just download all of them and I
I<00:03:48.849> have<00:03:49.569> it<00:03:49.750> because<00:03:49.989> I<00:03:50.019> I<00:03:50.500> can't<00:03:51.370> do<00:03:51.579> that<00:03:51.609> out

I don't think I can do something
but<00:03:56.000> I<00:03:57.000> don't<00:03:57.510> think<00:03:57.689> I<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:58.049> can't<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.739> really<00:03:59.040> but
