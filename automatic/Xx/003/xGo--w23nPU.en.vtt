00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
kind of guy build your own player and

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.880 
kind of guy build your own player and
start<00:02:39.810> them<00:02:39.900> as<00:02:39.990> like<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.140> rookie<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.620> kind<00:02:40.830> of

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
start them as like a rookie and kind of

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.410 
start them as like a rookie and kind of
go<00:02:41.370> through<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.790> think<00:02:41.970> they

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
go through that so I think they

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.370 
go through that so I think they
developed<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.750> side<00:02:43.020> of<00:02:43.050> things<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.290> little

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
developed that side of things a little

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.960 
developed that side of things a little
be<00:02:43.620> cool<00:02:43.770> they've<00:02:43.980> also<00:02:44.160> had<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> connect<00:02:44.820> so

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
be cool they've also had a connect so

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.190 
be cool they've also had a connect so
you<00:02:45.030> can<00:02:45.210> actually<00:02:45.300> physically<00:02:45.840> get<00:02:46.080> him

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
you can actually physically get him

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.600 
you can actually physically get him
pumped<00:02:46.320> right<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.620> haven't<00:02:47.130> tried<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.400> it's
