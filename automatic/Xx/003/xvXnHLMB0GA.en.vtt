the two centre-backs I don't think our

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.830

the edge in this area it's interesting

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.190 
the edge in this area it's interesting
that<00:01:47.579> isn't<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.270> Bayern<00:01:48.689> trio<00:01:48.990> of

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the edge and it's tough to say I think

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.990 
the edge and it's tough to say I think
you'll<00:02:04.200> see<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> vastly<00:02:05.399> different<00:02:05.759> approach

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
you'll see a vastly different approach

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.540 
you'll see a vastly different approach
in<00:02:06.240> each<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> legs<00:02:07.160> who's<00:02:08.160> ever<00:02:08.310> playing

at<00:02:08.640> home<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:09.179> course<00:02:09.810> that's<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.349> Byron<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
at home of course that's a Byron in the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.860 
at home of course that's a Byron in the
first<00:02:11.129> leg<00:02:11.370> and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
first leg and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.089 
first leg and
I<00:02:12.930> expect<00:02:13.290> them<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.470> have<00:02:13.500> more<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.890> ball

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
I expect them to have more of the ball

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.460 
I expect them to have more of the ball
and<00:02:14.430> you've<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.360> away<00:02:15.720> from<00:02:15.930> home<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.349> the

Champions League they're well equipped

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.509

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
to set up to play on the defensive they

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.800 
to set up to play on the defensive they
don't<00:02:20.700> mind<00:02:20.819> doing<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.330> saw<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.629> two

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
don't mind doing it we saw it in two

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.000 
don't mind doing it we saw it in two
legs<00:02:21.989> against<00:02:22.290> Celtic<00:02:22.650> where<00:02:22.799> there<00:02:22.920> are

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
legs against Celtic where there are

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.289 
legs against Celtic where there are
content<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.340> let<00:02:23.489> Celtic<00:02:23.790> have<00:02:23.909> the<00:02:24.000> ball<00:02:24.150> in

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
content to let Celtic have the ball in

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.670 
content to let Celtic have the ball in
front<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.569> them<00:02:24.659> without<00:02:25.080> getting<00:02:25.440> turned

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
front of them without getting turned

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.780 
front of them without getting turned
without<00:02:25.860> getting<00:02:26.220> troubled<00:02:26.400> really

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
without getting troubled really

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.640 
without getting troubled really
themselves<00:02:27.360> by<00:02:27.989> own<00:02:28.110> on<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.290> other<00:02:28.440> hand<00:02:28.500> they

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
themselves by own on the other hand they

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.220 
themselves by own on the other hand they
like<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:28.860> force<00:02:29.129> the<00:02:29.340> issue<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:30.230> while

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
like to force the issue but while

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.390 
like to force the issue but while
they're<00:02:31.379> at<00:02:31.470> home<00:02:31.680> but<00:02:31.980> when<00:02:32.099> they're<00:02:32.220> away

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
they're at home but when they're away

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.380 
they're at home but when they're away
from<00:02:32.430> home<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.819> think<00:02:32.849> they're<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> little<00:02:33.150> bit

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
from home I think they're a little bit

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.300 
from home I think they're a little bit
more<00:02:33.480> susceptible<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.319> threats<00:02:34.950> like<00:02:35.099> set

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
more susceptible to threats like set

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.250 
more susceptible to threats like set
pieces<00:02:35.549> and<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.000> think<00:02:36.209> blares<00:02:36.659> like<00:02:36.810> Barzagli

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
pieces and I think blares like Barzagli

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.140 
pieces and I think blares like Barzagli
Bonucci<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.190> Chiellini<00:02:38.519> if<00:02:38.670> they<00:02:38.790> can<00:02:38.940> get<00:02:39.030> in

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
Bonucci and Chiellini if they can get in

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.819 
Bonucci and Chiellini if they can get in
and<00:02:39.269> around<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.569> box<00:02:39.780> at<00:02:39.989> those<00:02:40.110> set<00:02:40.290> pieces<00:02:40.500> I

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
and around the box at those set pieces I

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.100 
and around the box at those set pieces I
think<00:02:41.280> they<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.489> cause<00:02:41.750> Bayern<00:02:42.750> Munich<00:02:42.989> all

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
think they can cause Bayern Munich all

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.050 
think they can cause Bayern Munich all
sorts<00:02:43.409> of<00:02:43.470> trouble<00:02:43.769> but<00:02:44.280> which<00:02:44.459> midfield<00:02:44.910> is

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
sorts of trouble but which midfield is

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.119 
sorts of trouble but which midfield is
better<00:02:45.239> though<00:02:45.450> people<00:02:45.660> which<00:02:46.620> midfield<00:02:47.010> is

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
better though people which midfield is

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.650 
better though people which midfield is
better<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.430> think<00:02:47.640> we're<00:02:48.000> about<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> find<00:02:48.299> out

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
better I think we're about to find out

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.140 
better I think we're about to find out
both<00:02:49.590> these<00:02:49.769> teams<00:02:49.980> have<00:02:50.220> been<00:02:50.400> dominating

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
both these teams have been dominating

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.449 
both these teams have been dominating
their<00:02:51.299> domestic<00:02:51.780> leagues<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.310> they<00:02:53.310> all<00:02:53.430> have

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
their domestic leagues and they all have

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.130 
their domestic leagues and they all have
their<00:02:53.730> respective<00:02:54.209> strengths<00:02:54.629> obviously<00:02:54.989> the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
their respective strengths obviously the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.259 
their respective strengths obviously the
craft<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.829> artistry<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.310> Pirlo<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.879> firing

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
craft and artistry of Pirlo is firing

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.030 
craft and artistry of Pirlo is firing
away<00:02:57.450> better<00:02:57.780> than<00:02:58.019> anything<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.530> think<00:02:58.680> that

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
away better than anything I think that

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.069 
away better than anything I think that
that<00:02:59.069> bayern<00:02:59.849> have<00:02:59.970> aside<00:03:00.690> maybe<00:03:00.900> from<00:03:01.049> the

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
that bayern have aside maybe from the

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.110 
that bayern have aside maybe from the
goal<00:03:01.290> scoring<00:03:01.560> threat<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:01.920> Tony<00:03:02.400> Cruz<00:03:02.730> so

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
goal scoring threat of Tony Cruz so

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.819 
goal scoring threat of Tony Cruz so
think<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.510> would<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:03.930> just<00:03:04.349> think<00:03:04.620> you're<00:03:04.709> going

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
think I would I just think you're going

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.979 
think I would I just think you're going
to<00:03:04.859> put<00:03:05.129> myself<00:03:05.220> on<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.519> fence<00:03:05.730> herro<00:03:06.150> just

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
to put myself on the fence herro just

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.020 
to put myself on the fence herro just
until<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.349> leg<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:08.310> think<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.879> most

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
until this leg is I think the most

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.750 
until this leg is I think the most
dangerous<00:03:09.450> weapons<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.049> by<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.409> have<00:03:10.760> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
dangerous weapons that by and have and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.699 
dangerous weapons that by and have and
the<00:03:12.120> only<00:03:12.239> weapons<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.140> aventis<00:03:13.560> will

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
the only weapons that the aventis will

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.530 
the only weapons that the aventis will

left<00:03:23.040> Franck<00:03:23.489> Ribery<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.090> think<00:03:24.750> if<00:03:24.900> you've

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
left Franck Ribery I think if you've

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.509 
left Franck Ribery I think if you've
enter<00:03:25.260> stop<00:03:25.500> those<00:03:25.680> three<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.160> think<00:03:26.400> they'll

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
enter stop those three I think they'll

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.580 
enter stop those three I think they'll
be<00:03:26.609> confident<00:03:27.090> they<00:03:27.239> can<00:03:27.299> win<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.630> tie<00:03:27.840> but<00:03:28.500> in

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
be confident they can win the tie but in

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.990 
be confident they can win the tie but in
the<00:03:28.680> actual<00:03:28.829> center<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.459> midfield<00:03:29.819> I

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
the actual center of the midfield I

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.280 
the actual center of the midfield I
think<00:03:30.209> Juventus<00:03:30.510> have<00:03:30.629> got<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.840> edge<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.200> I

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
think Juventus have got the edge and I

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.740 
think Juventus have got the edge and I
think<00:03:31.440> they<00:03:31.530> showed<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> year<00:03:32.160> 2012<00:03:33.030> when

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
think they showed that a year 2012 when

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.690 
think they showed that a year 2012 when
Italy<00:03:34.169> beat<00:03:34.379> germany<00:03:34.859> in<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.069> semi-final

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
that was almost the Avensis versus

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.629 
that was almost the Avensis versus
buying<00:03:37.470> midfield<00:03:38.190> battle<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.989> that<00:03:39.989> day

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
buying midfield battle and that day

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.369 
buying midfield battle and that day
italy<00:03:41.639> or<00:03:41.760> events<00:03:41.970> has<00:03:42.209> totally<00:03:42.690> dominated

that midfield and they won the game

that midfield and they won the game
although<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:45.359> wasn't<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:45.780> much<00:03:45.810> about<00:03:45.930> Pirlo

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
although it wasn't so much about Pirlo

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.869 
although it wasn't so much about Pirlo
that<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.889> game<00:03:47.099> is<00:03:47.250> one<00:03:47.370> of<00:03:47.489> his<00:03:47.579> italy

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
notable exceptions then you know they

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.659

out<00:05:05.759> a<00:05:05.820> chance<00:05:06.120> interesting<00:05:07.020> in<00:05:07.110> that<00:05:07.139> that

tactical flexibility that Antonia Conte
has<00:05:09.780> shown<00:05:10.080> this<00:05:10.560> season<00:05:10.620> could<00:05:10.979> be<00:05:11.009> a<00:05:11.099> major

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
has shown this season could be a major

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.010 
has shown this season could be a major
advantage<00:05:11.789> I<00:05:12.090> think<00:05:12.330> Peters<00:05:12.630> absolutely

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
advantage I think Peters absolutely

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.480 
advantage I think Peters absolutely
right<00:05:13.139> i<00:05:13.199> think<00:05:13.349> avensis<00:05:13.949> there's<00:05:14.130> a<00:05:14.190> there's

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
right i think avensis there's a there's

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.460 
right i think avensis there's a there's
a<00:05:14.550> number<00:05:14.699> of<00:05:14.820> ways<00:05:14.910> they<00:05:15.210> can<00:05:15.270> score<00:05:15.630> they<00:05:16.259> can

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
a number of ways they can score they can

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.899 
a number of ways they can score they can
score<00:05:16.800> through<00:05:17.009> the<00:05:17.070> middle<00:05:17.400> obviously<00:05:17.789> with

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
score through the middle obviously with

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:20.510 
score through the middle obviously with
the<00:05:17.940> craft<00:05:18.449> of<00:05:18.630> a<00:05:19.020> PLA<00:05:19.409> they<00:05:19.919> they're<00:05:20.340> very

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
the craft of a PLA they they're very

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.700 
the craft of a PLA they they're very
strong<00:05:20.909> on<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:21.840> flanks<00:05:22.199> and<00:05:22.320> I<00:05:22.560> actually

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
strong on the flanks and I actually

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.950 
strong on the flanks and I actually
think<00:05:23.009> that<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.610> two<00:05:24.000> sets<00:05:24.360> of<00:05:24.449> wing<00:05:24.630> backs<00:05:24.840> on

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
think that the two sets of wing backs on

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.270 
think that the two sets of wing backs on
both<00:05:25.110> teams<00:05:25.349> will<00:05:25.530> cancel<00:05:25.770> each<00:05:25.979> other<00:05:26.130> out

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
both teams will cancel each other out

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.129 
both teams will cancel each other out
which<00:05:26.849> is<00:05:26.970> why<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:27.210> centre<00:05:27.599> of<00:05:27.630> midfield<00:05:27.750> will

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
which is why the centre of midfield will

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.399 
which is why the centre of midfield will
be<00:05:28.289> so<00:05:28.470> important<00:05:29.449> they<00:05:30.449> can<00:05:30.990> attack<00:05:31.289> from

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
be so important they can attack from

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.110 
be so important they can attack from
deep<00:05:31.650> like<00:05:31.919> they<00:05:32.039> did<00:05:32.220> against<00:05:32.610> Celtic<00:05:33.030> where

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
deep like they did against Celtic where

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.670 
deep like they did against Celtic where
they<00:05:33.210> invited<00:05:33.630> pressure<00:05:33.990> onto<00:05:34.229> them<00:05:34.440> and<00:05:34.470> then

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
they invited pressure onto them and then

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.980 
they invited pressure onto them and then
you<00:05:35.400> know<00:05:35.520> almost<00:05:35.810> school<00:05:36.810> on<00:05:36.900> the

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
you know almost school on the

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.469 
you know almost school on the
counter-attack<00:05:37.789> so<00:05:38.789> I<00:05:39.120> think<00:05:39.210> they're<00:05:39.449> a

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
counter-attack so I think they're a

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:40.820 
counter-attack so I think they're a
little<00:05:39.630> bit<00:05:39.810> more<00:05:39.930> complete<00:05:40.320> by<00:05:40.530> and<00:05:40.680> have<00:05:40.800> a

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
little bit more complete by and have a

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.499 
little bit more complete by and have a
set<00:05:41.219> way<00:05:41.370> of<00:05:41.490> playing<00:05:41.699> and<00:05:41.969> that's<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:42.419> way

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
set way of playing and that's the way

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.379 
set way of playing and that's the way
they<00:05:42.659> play<00:05:42.900> for<00:05:43.830> Pete<00:05:44.039> into<00:05:44.340> your<00:05:44.460> Ventus<00:05:44.820> just

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
they play for Pete into your Ventus just

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.870 
they play for Pete into your Ventus just
what's<00:05:46.050> carlo's<00:05:46.500> of<00:05:46.680> you<00:05:46.770> I'm<00:05:47.460> going<00:05:47.699> to<00:05:47.759> tip

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
what's carlo's of you I'm going to tip

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.980 
what's carlo's of you I'm going to tip
events<00:05:48.210> as<00:05:48.330> well<00:05:48.360> I<00:05:48.509> think<00:05:48.659> will<00:05:48.870> be<00:05:48.960> very

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
events as well I think will be very

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.990 
events as well I think will be very
close<00:05:49.320> it<00:05:49.770> will<00:05:49.889> be<00:05:49.979> a<00:05:50.009> tie<00:05:50.280> that<00:05:50.310> we<00:05:50.550> decided

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
close it will be a tie that we decided

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.570 
close it will be a tie that we decided
on<00:05:51.090> the<00:05:51.150> small<00:05:51.389> details<00:05:51.680> but<00:05:52.680> i<00:05:53.099> think<00:05:53.490> the

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
on the small details but i think the

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.999 
on the small details but i think the
aventis<00:05:54.030> will<00:05:54.300> win<00:05:54.960> the<00:05:55.080> midfield<00:05:55.409> battle<00:05:55.500> and

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
aventis will win the midfield battle and

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.709 
aventis will win the midfield battle and
I<00:05:56.070> think<00:05:56.310> that's<00:05:56.520> that<00:05:57.000> will<00:05:57.090> be<00:05:57.210> decisive

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:57.719 
I think that's that will be decisive

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:00.200 
I think that's that will be decisive
right<00:05:58.199> quite<00:05:58.710> a<00:05:58.740> battle<00:05:59.009> in<00:05:59.250> store<00:05:59.610> then<00:05:59.820> you
