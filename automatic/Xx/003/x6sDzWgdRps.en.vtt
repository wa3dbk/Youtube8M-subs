 my top 5 drugstore mascara 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.010

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.590
 praised by you in the comment 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.450
 photos on instagram totally often asked 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.710
 which mascara I use and 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.390
 That's why I thought I'll show you 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.579
 just a small selection of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.809
 my dearest all a bit 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.410
 different have different 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.390
 effects, colors and so on 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.640
 I always have eyes with the rossmann 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.589
 eyelash curler bent and the other 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.850
 not and then you can always do that 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.500
 see direct comparison 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.689
 I'll also stick the brush for you 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 All the price and tell you why I am 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.270
 that look good 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.880
 and then I wish a lot of fun with it 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.460
 Watch the video to see my eyelashes 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.070
 when they are impatient and unborn 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.170
 they are dark and relatively long and one 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.180
 little swinging and go with 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.299
 the first mascara that is the 1000th 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.799
 canary mascara of max factor and the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.659
 I really like it a lot when I go 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.310
 lust habe to a natural order 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.140
 reliable result 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.460
 I see her not offering an eye as they 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.380
 you ever have a little difference 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.210
 and then I do that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.130
 The brush is very simple in the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.450
 handling man does not fit around and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.070
 That's why I like it very much 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.689
 if I just want to have one 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.149
 little mascara here you see 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.890
 ever make the difference and then do 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.720
 I still have the second eye and have 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.369
 determined that it was at this 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.590
 mascara not necessary is one 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.479
 to use eyelash curler because it is in 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.820
 principle the same out comes but you 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.649
 See the result is very natural of 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.299
 momentum is maintained and that's why 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.840
 I like these for everyday life pretty much 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.840
 with pleasure 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.900
 if I'm in the mood for a less 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.240
 natural result in everyday life then 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.250
 I reach for the live sensation mascara 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.290
 by nay berlin that enters namely 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.120
 a little more product that is one 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.770
 rubber stock exchange for different lengths 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.660
 so bristles bent this and 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.580
 the outside are slightly longer than inside 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.290
 which makes you all good eyelashes 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.750
 can catch both the little ones 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.280
 also the bigger or longer or how 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.050
 whatever you have here already 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.000
 the difference so seen on each 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.770
 case you can see that eyelashes here 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.300
 they are showered if you like them 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.920
 bit back and forth then find 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.750
 I, however, that the result still 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.890
 relatively natural, but is easy with 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.510
 a little bit more 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.510
 because if you know what I mean 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.290
 It continues with a very very 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.630
 striking mascara and that the 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.400
 miss manga mascara from l'oreal though 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.250
 not quite normal black but in 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.620
 that blatantly temperate blue and that 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.720
 little bit has such a ball joint 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.370
 The shower is supposed to be lighter 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.770
 but by that I do not now 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.300
 super tight on it I notice the 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.070
 effect of this ball joint is not 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.540
 Really she is in the order bit 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.550
 difficult because she is very fluid and 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.800
 not really as creamy but I will 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.600
 think there is crazy for the color donation 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.640
 the whole is still good in one layer 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.950
 a bit easier in two layers 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.630
 then this color really pops out 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.550
 and if I want something in everyday life 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.140
 to wear then I just give it that way 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.000
 the approach of eyelash a bit 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.400
 black mascara so only the 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.900
 tips of eyelashes are blue and that 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.520
 then shimmers in the light and has one 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.290
 really cool effect with 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.970
 an eyeliner or something and me 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.470
 really like this mascara and 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.790
 That's why she was allowed in this video 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.790
 Of course not missing 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.920
 because of that the eyeliner ink because that 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.540
 mascara is the one I like to use 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.500
 if I carry one in a hurry 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.450
 I have this here in the video 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.760
 omitted so that you all better 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.170
 but you can see that is the mascara 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.790
 which I usually have on it if you 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.840
 me in the comments asks which 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.459
 mascara I use the max factor 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.829
 masterpiece mascara and that's how it is 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.629
 incredible volume at the eyelash approach 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.790
 it stays a lot of color you feel 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.870
 a little bit hard though 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.789
 but then it looks right 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.380
 really good if you have one 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:22.030
 eyeliner has because the eyelashes then so 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.030
 look really tight 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.010
 and what's missing is natural 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.380
 a waterproof mascara and mine 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.020
 my favorite is the giant mascara of 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.150
 patrice because they are incredibly good 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.830
 I think I have a detailed 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.900
 Mascara tests for this mascara 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.880
 made i link you down in the 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.650
 infos and a little older video and there 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.060
 I really have heart and kidding 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.920
 That means if I tell you that 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.700
 interested then you can the video 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.530

 this is a mascara now 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.620
 the difference between curved and 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.720
 unbent you will definitely 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.820
 because it looks easy when waterproof 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.590
 eyelashes showering through the waxes is like that 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.330
 and this one but meets any 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.260
 Desires and demands you to one

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.910
