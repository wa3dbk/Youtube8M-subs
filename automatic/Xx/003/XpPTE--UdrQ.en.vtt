00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:08.270 

I<00:00:05.779> wants<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.899> create<00:00:07.260> something<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:08.100> can

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
I wants to create something that can

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.049 
I wants to create something that can
solve<00:00:09.150> our<00:00:09.510> problem<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:09.960> dirty<00:00:10.139> water<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:11.059> can't

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
solve our problem of dirty water I can't

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.520 
solve our problem of dirty water I can't
do<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.330> one<00:00:12.480> day<00:00:12.629> you<00:00:12.870> can't<00:00:13.080> do<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.410> one

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
do it in one day you can't do it in one

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.510 
do it in one day you can't do it in one
year<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.639> my<00:00:15.320> whole<00:00:16.320> idea<00:00:16.350> has<00:00:16.740> been<00:00:16.770> what

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
year and so my whole idea has been what

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.340 
year and so my whole idea has been what
can<00:00:17.700> we<00:00:17.730> develop<00:00:18.090> from<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.750> nail<00:00:18.930> technology

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
can we develop from the nail technology

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.790 
can we develop from the nail technology
point<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.890> view<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:21.270> grow<00:00:22.080> into<00:00:22.530> a

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
point of view that we can grow into a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.000 
point of view that we can grow into a
real<00:00:23.190> working<00:00:23.460> technology<00:00:24.120> to<00:00:24.780> address<00:00:25.010> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
real working technology to address the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.880 
real working technology to address the
issue<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.400> dirty<00:00:26.580> water<00:00:27.530> but<00:00:28.530> this<00:00:28.620> is<00:00:28.770> what

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
issue of dirty water but this is what

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.550 
issue of dirty water but this is what
I'm<00:00:28.980> talking<00:00:29.010> about<00:00:29.400> here<00:00:29.820> these<00:00:30.690> are<00:00:30.930> pellet

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
I'm talking about here these are pellet

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.680 
I'm talking about here these are pellet
particles<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.279> we're<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.730> insert

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
particles that we're going to insert

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.650 
particles that we're going to insert
into<00:00:33.960> our<00:00:34.350> reactor<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.210> these<00:00:36.210> alumina

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
into our reactor and these alumina

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.480 
into our reactor and these alumina
pellets<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.050> normally<00:00:37.440> white<00:00:37.740> looking<00:00:38.100> but

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 
pellets are normally white looking but

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.400 
pellets are normally white looking but
in<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.820> case<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:39.210> there<00:00:39.450> violet<00:00:40.050> colored

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
in this case here there violet colored

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.140 
in this case here there violet colored
and<00:00:40.560> that's<00:00:40.740> because<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.310> infused<00:00:41.820> with

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
and that's because it's infused with

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.050 
and that's because it's infused with
small<00:00:42.750> bits<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.230> gold<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.920> palladium<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:45.000> of

small bits of gold and palladium one of

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.229 
small bits of gold and palladium one of
the<00:00:45.120> first<00:00:45.240> exact<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.780> did<00:00:46.020> when<00:00:46.500> my<00:00:47.370> program

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the first exact we did when my program

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.210 
the first exact we did when my program
is<00:00:48.270> starting<00:00:48.480> up<00:00:48.720> at<00:00:48.930> Rice<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.680> look<00:00:50.010> at

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
is starting up at Rice was to look at

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.690 
is starting up at Rice was to look at
the<00:00:50.430> problem<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:51.650> trichloroethylene

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
the problem of trichloroethylene

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.450 
the problem of trichloroethylene
contamination<00:00:53.700> of<00:00:53.760> water<00:00:53.820> tce<00:00:54.690> tce<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:56.070> this

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
contamination of water tce tce is this

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.710 
contamination of water tce tce is this
organic<00:00:57.649> solvent<00:00:58.649> molecule<00:00:59.130> that<00:00:59.880> is<00:01:00.300> very

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
organic solvent molecule that is very

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.850 
organic solvent molecule that is very
popular<00:01:01.290> to<00:01:01.770> use<00:01:03.379> when<00:01:04.379> you're<00:01:04.530> working<00:01:04.649> with

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
popular to use when you're working with

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.859 
popular to use when you're working with
metals<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.610> use<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.999> to<00:01:06.090> degrease<00:01:06.479> metals

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
metals you use it to degrease metals

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.950 
metals you use it to degrease metals
basically<00:01:07.399> the<00:01:08.399> problem<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.819> is<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.539> TC

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
basically the problem is is that this TC

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.760 
basically the problem is is that this TC
has<00:01:10.170> been<00:01:10.850> used<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.119> such<00:01:12.600> large<00:01:12.869> volumes<00:01:13.469> that

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
has been used in such large volumes that

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.690 
has been used in such large volumes that
inevitably<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:15.060> lot<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.020> tce<00:01:16.710> ends<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.579> in

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
inevitably a lot of this tce ends up in

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.940 
inevitably a lot of this tce ends up in
the<00:01:17.729> groundwater<00:01:18.209> and<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.499> how<00:01:19.649> do<00:01:19.709> you<00:01:19.829> get

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the groundwater and so how do you get

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.230 
the groundwater and so how do you get
rid<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.130> something<00:01:20.490> that's<00:01:20.609> underground

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
rid of something that's underground

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.359 
rid of something that's underground
that's<00:01:21.929> in<00:01:22.079> contact<00:01:22.649> with<00:01:22.799> ground<00:01:23.009> water

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
that's in contact with ground water

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.699 
that's in contact with ground water
that's<00:01:23.939> flowing<00:01:24.090> slowly<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.229> picking<00:01:25.590> up

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:25.709 
that's flowing slowly and picking up

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:28.190 
that's flowing slowly and picking up
small<00:01:25.889> amounts<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.490> tce<00:01:26.880> every<00:01:27.689> minute<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
small amounts of tce every minute and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.830 
small amounts of tce every minute and
that's<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.340> problem<00:01:29.399> that<00:01:30.119> we're<00:01:30.420> trying<00:01:30.569> to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that's a problem that we're trying to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.249 
that's a problem that we're trying to
solve<00:01:31.020> once<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:31.889> discovered<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.399> problem<00:01:32.909> and

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
solve once we discovered the problem and

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.469 
solve once we discovered the problem and
realizes<00:01:34.259> how<00:01:34.409> tremendous<00:01:35.219> this<00:01:35.670> problem<00:01:36.240> was

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
realizes how tremendous this problem was

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.260 
realizes how tremendous this problem was
in<00:01:36.749> the<00:01:37.049> US<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.560> also<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:38.130> other<00:01:38.340> parts<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.209> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
in the US but also in other parts of the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.719 
in the US but also in other parts of the
world<00:01:39.539> we<00:01:39.869> decided<00:01:40.319> to<00:01:40.469> set<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.069> this<00:01:41.369> course

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
world we decided to set on this course

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.260 
world we decided to set on this course
of<00:01:41.999> finding<00:01:42.929> a<00:01:42.990> new<00:01:43.139> technology<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.270> help

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
of finding a new technology to help

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.969 
of finding a new technology to help
solve<00:01:45.569> this<00:01:45.719> problem<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.679> felt<00:01:46.889> that

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
solve this problem and we felt that

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.160 
solve this problem and we felt that
nanotechnology<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.060> catalysis<00:01:48.450> would<00:01:48.929> be

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
nanotechnology and catalysis would be

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.190 
nanotechnology and catalysis would be
able<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.409> do<00:01:49.529> the<00:01:49.649> trick<00:01:50.929> what<00:01:51.929> we<00:01:52.020> didn't

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
able to do the trick what we didn't

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.099 
able to do the trick what we didn't
realize<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:53.009> how<00:01:53.099> good<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.119> materials

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
realize was just how good the materials

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.769 
realize was just how good the materials
that<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.319> made<00:01:55.560> turned<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.459> be<00:01:56.609> turns<00:01:57.599> out

00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:57.779 
that we made turned out to be turns out

00:01:57.779 --> 00:02:00.379 
that we made turned out to be turns out

that small bits of palladium and gold
medal<00:02:00.810> two<00:02:01.799> metals<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.520> wouldn't

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
medal two metals that you wouldn't

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.059

our directions to look at other types of
contaminants<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.970> understand<00:02:48.630> better<00:02:48.840> just

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
contaminants to understand better just

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.759 
contaminants to understand better just
why<00:02:49.709> did<00:02:50.340> palladium<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.120> gold<00:02:51.660> bits<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.530> metal

why did palladium and gold bits of metal

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.410 
why did palladium and gold bits of metal
was<00:02:53.069> able<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.430> do<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.670> tricks<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.030> much<00:02:54.180> better

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
was able to do the tricks so much better

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.390 
was able to do the tricks so much better
than<00:02:54.630> what's<00:02:54.900> out<00:02:54.989> there<00:02:55.200> now<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:56.040> one<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.250> the
