be my favorite bourbon of all time at

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.990 
be my favorite bourbon of all time at
least<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.150> far<00:00:12.389> out<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.690> ones<00:00:12.840> I've<00:00:13.019> tried

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
least so far out of the ones I've tried

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.540 
least so far out of the ones I've tried
so<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.960> costs<00:00:16.470> about<00:00:16.970> $40<00:00:17.970> which<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
so this costs about $40 which is on the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.910 
so this costs about $40 which is on the
low<00:00:20.760> end<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.750> premium<00:00:22.230> bourbon<00:00:22.619> price

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
low end of the premium bourbon price

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.779 
low end of the premium bourbon price
scale<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.580> BC<00:00:24.890> and<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.180> 45%<00:00:27.180> alcohol<00:00:28.519> as<00:00:29.519> far

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
scale and BC and it's 45% alcohol as far

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.479 
scale and BC and it's 45% alcohol as far
as<00:00:29.939> age<00:00:30.179> goes

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
as age goes

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.700 
as age goes
apparently<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> age<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.360> these<00:00:33.660> varies<00:00:35.360> the

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
apparently the age on these varies the

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.270 
apparently the age on these varies the
sample<00:00:37.710> them<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.370> barrels<00:00:39.800> barrel<00:00:40.800> by<00:00:40.950> barrel

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
sample them the barrels barrel by barrel

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.500 
sample them the barrels barrel by barrel
and<00:00:41.399> then<00:00:41.489> depending<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> taste<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.390> it

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
and then depending on the taste of it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.700 
and then depending on the taste of it
they'll<00:00:42.660> decide<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.140> they<00:00:43.230> want<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> released

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
they'll decide if they want to released

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.610 
they'll decide if they want to released
or<00:00:43.890> not<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.930> depending<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.020> your<00:00:46.170> bottle<00:00:46.469> you

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
or not so depending on your bottle you

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.220 
or not so depending on your bottle you
might<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.270> few<00:00:48.270> years<00:00:48.480> difference<00:00:48.989> than

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
might have a few years difference than

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.840 
might have a few years difference than
the<00:00:49.260> age<00:00:51.440> what<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.100> much<00:00:53.340> about<00:00:53.640> this

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the age what I like so much about this

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.189 
the age what I like so much about this
is<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:57.360> flavors<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.020> has<00:00:58.410> are<00:00:58.770> basically<00:00:59.370> a

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
is the flavors that has are basically a

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.599 
is the flavors that has are basically a
combination<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.320> everything<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.280> like

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
combination of everything that I like

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.590 
combination of everything that I like
about<00:01:03.030> bourbon<00:01:04.250> amplified<00:01:05.250> other<00:01:06.210> other

about bourbon amplified other other

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.359 
about bourbon amplified other other
Bourbons<00:01:06.960> I've<00:01:07.080> tried<00:01:07.350> really<00:01:07.830> sort<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.220> do

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
Bourbons I've tried really sort of do

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.980 
Bourbons I've tried really sort of do
one<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> other<00:01:09.060> thing<00:01:10.610> better<00:01:11.689> but<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.720> find

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
one or the other thing better but I find

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.450 
one or the other thing better but I find
this<00:01:13.110> combines<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.830> them<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.369> not

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
this combines all of them but it's not

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.539 
this combines all of them but it's not
washed<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.299> either<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.930> not<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.530> uh<00:01:16.619> sort

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
washed out either it's not just uh sort

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.999 
washed out either it's not just uh sort
of<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.729> mishmash<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.420> everything<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:19.049> all<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
flavors in it are really clear so I find

it that might feel a feel or sound a
little<00:01:36.570> bit<00:01:36.750> weird<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.380> uh<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:38.189> actually

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
little bit weird but uh it's actually

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.069 
little bit weird but uh it's actually
really<00:01:39.030> good<00:01:40.520> just<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:41.909> clear<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.570> it's

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
really good just really clear it's it's

really good just really clear it's it's
kind<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.350> refreshing<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.189> way<00:01:44.310> actually<00:01:45.079> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
kind of refreshing in a way actually the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.149 
kind of refreshing in a way actually the
finish<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:48.409> sort<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.530> comma<00:01:49.799> at<00:01:50.009> least

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
finish on it is sort of a comma at least

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.310 
finish on it is sort of a comma at least
I<00:01:50.280> find<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.790> combination<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.509> cinnamon

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
I find it's a combination of cinnamon

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.030 
I find it's a combination of cinnamon
and<00:01:52.590> cherry<00:01:53.100> taste<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:54.530> what<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.920> do

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
and cherry taste and what I like to do

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.330 
and cherry taste and what I like to do
is<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> rocks<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.560> as<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
is I have this on the rocks and as the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.080 
is I have this on the rocks and as the
ice<00:01:59.640> melts<00:02:00.149> down<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:01.259> mixes<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
ice melts down it mixes in with the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.700 
ice melts down it mixes in with the
Bourbon<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.659> kind<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.899> dilutes<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
Bourbon that kind of dilutes it and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.310 
Bourbon that kind of dilutes it and
changes<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.189> flavor<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:06.200> some<00:02:07.200> people

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
changes the flavor of it some people

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.559 
changes the flavor of it some people
don't<00:02:07.469> like<00:02:07.770> doing<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.879> especially<00:02:09.090> for

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
don't like doing that especially for

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.240 
don't like doing that especially for
scotch<00:02:10.340> but<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.610> find<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.660> really<00:02:13.110> like<00:02:13.260> this

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
scotch but I find I really like this

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.849 
scotch but I find I really like this
in<00:02:15.250> Bourbon<00:02:15.549> because<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.450> your<00:02:17.140> glass<00:02:17.379> really

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:17.859 
in Bourbon because the your glass really

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.640 
in Bourbon because the your glass really
changes<00:02:18.519> as<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.879> goes<00:02:19.060> down<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.719> it<00:02:20.439> makes

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
changes as it goes down and it makes

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.910 
changes as it goes down and it makes
each<00:02:21.129> glass<00:02:21.519> really<00:02:21.849> interesting<00:02:22.510> because

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
each glass really interesting because

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.899 
each glass really interesting because
from<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.099> top<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.519> bottom<00:02:24.790> you

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.629 
experience pretty much all of the
different<00:02:26.739> flavors<00:02:26.950> in<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:28.599> Bourbon<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:30.310> I

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639 
different flavors in the Bourbon so I

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.599 
different flavors in the Bourbon so I
would<00:02:30.849> highly<00:02:31.510> recommend<00:02:31.959> this<00:02:32.079> I<00:02:32.829> know<00:02:33.310> that

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
would highly recommend this I know that

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.050 
would highly recommend this I know that
maker's<00:02:34.030> mark<00:02:34.269> now<00:02:34.569> has<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:35.849> premium<00:02:36.849> version

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
maker's mark now has a premium version

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.660 
maker's mark now has a premium version
or<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.599> even<00:02:38.409> more<00:02:38.439> premium<00:02:39.040> version<00:02:39.370> than<00:02:39.459> this

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
or a even more premium version than this

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.190 
or a even more premium version than this
called<00:02:40.629> makers<00:02:40.989> mark<00:02:41.200> 46<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.629> I<00:02:43.629> think<00:02:44.049> the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
called makers mark 46 and I think the

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.319 
called makers mark 46 and I think the
deal<00:02:44.439> with<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.920> is<00:02:46.349> it's<00:02:47.349> I<00:02:47.859> think<00:02:48.159> they<00:02:48.329> put

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
deal with that is it's I think they put

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.179 
deal with that is it's I think they put
it<00:02:49.419> through<00:02:49.450> an<00:02:49.689> extra<00:02:50.079> stage<00:02:50.379> of<00:02:50.620> aging<00:02:51.040> and

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
it through an extra stage of aging and

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.190 
it through an extra stage of aging and
oak<00:02:51.370> barrel<00:02:52.090> or<00:02:52.239> something<00:02:52.540> like<00:02:52.629> that<00:02:52.689> I've

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
oak barrel or something like that I've

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.349 
oak barrel or something like that I've
heard<00:02:53.439> pretty<00:02:53.530> good<00:02:53.799> reviews<00:02:54.099> on<00:02:54.129> it<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.639> think

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
heard pretty good reviews on it I think

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.750 
heard pretty good reviews on it I think
it's<00:02:55.510> about<00:02:55.750> 10<00:02:56.200> bucks<00:02:56.650> more<00:02:57.010> than<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.400> normal

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
it's about 10 bucks more than the normal

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.589 
it's about 10 bucks more than the normal
version<00:02:58.799> so<00:02:59.799> I<00:02:59.829> might<00:03:00.250> try<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:00.430> eventually<00:03:00.790> I

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
version so I might try that eventually I

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.149 
version so I might try that eventually I
like<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.439> regular<00:03:02.769> version<00:03:03.189> so<00:03:03.639> much<00:03:03.909> that

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
like the regular version so much that

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.409 
like the regular version so much that
it's<00:03:06.159> such<00:03:06.310> like<00:03:06.489> it's<00:03:06.879> such<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.120> sure<00:03:07.389> shot

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419 
it's such like it's such a sure shot

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.890 
it's such like it's such a sure shot
shot<00:03:08.169> that<00:03:08.379> I<00:03:08.409> would<00:03:08.889> be<00:03:09.040> I<00:03:09.569> don't<00:03:10.569> really<00:03:10.719> have

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
shot that I would be I don't really have

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.159 
shot that I would be I don't really have
to<00:03:11.049> be<00:03:11.139> feeling<00:03:11.379> the<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.980> 46<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.639> go<00:03:12.730> for<00:03:12.909> that

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
to be feeling the the 46 to go for that

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:17.449
