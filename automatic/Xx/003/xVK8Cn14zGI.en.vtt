between but that is what you guys get to

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.519 
between but that is what you guys get to
find<00:00:16.379> out<00:00:16.529> or<00:00:16.800> figure<00:00:17.760> out<00:00:17.789> for<00:00:18.359> me<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.750> should

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
find out or figure out for me I should

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.380 
find out or figure out for me I should
say<00:00:20.510> so<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.920> got<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.100> bulb<00:00:23.430> from<00:00:23.820> my<00:00:23.939> grandpa

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
say so I got this bulb from my grandpa

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.529 
say so I got this bulb from my grandpa
and<00:00:25.130> as<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.400> tell<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.820> has<00:00:26.849> seen<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> lot<00:00:27.510> of

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and as you can tell it has seen a lot of

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.200 
and as you can tell it has seen a lot of
use<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.340> there's<00:00:29.340> probably<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.849> lot<00:00:30.060> of

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
use and there's probably a lot of

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.580 
use and there's probably a lot of
history<00:00:30.570> behind<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.109> too<00:00:31.669> but<00:00:32.669> anyway<00:00:33.590> I'll

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
history behind it too but anyway I'll

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.500 
history behind it too but anyway I'll
take<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> quick<00:00:35.130> look<00:00:35.309> at<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> base<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.239> see

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
take a quick look at the base and see

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.910 
take a quick look at the base and see
it's<00:00:36.690> been<00:00:36.930> pinched<00:00:37.320> right<00:00:37.469> there<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
it's been pinched right there and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.360 
it's been pinched right there and
there's<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.640> hole<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.239> see<00:00:39.450> inside<00:00:40.370> some

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
there's a hole you can see inside some

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
there's a hole you can see inside some
corrosion<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:42.149> some<00:00:42.360> type<00:00:42.600> or<00:00:42.809> another<00:00:45.050> pretty

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
corrosion of some type or another pretty

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.580 
corrosion of some type or another pretty
standard<00:00:46.559> base<00:00:47.030> on<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> bottom<00:00:48.180> here<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:48.989> have

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
standard base on the bottom here we have

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.950 
standard base on the bottom here we have
the<00:00:49.829> insulator<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> bottom<00:00:52.020> contact<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
the insulator for the bottom contact and

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.990 
the insulator for the bottom contact and
you<00:00:54.960> see<00:00:55.140> all<00:00:55.230> these<00:00:55.379> little<00:00:55.559> ripples<00:00:56.039> around

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
you see all these little ripples around

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.770 
you see all these little ripples around
the<00:00:57.149> edge<00:00:57.270> here<00:00:58.370> very<00:00:59.370> interesting<00:00:59.780> there

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the edge here very interesting there

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.930 
the edge here very interesting there
over<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.109> all<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.770> way<00:01:01.859> around<00:01:02.160> those

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
over here all the way around those

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.170 
over here all the way around those
little<00:01:03.120> ripples<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:04.670> don't<00:01:05.670> know<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:05.909> that's<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
little ripples I don't know if that's a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.880 
little ripples I don't know if that's a
certain<00:01:06.479> design<00:01:06.780> feature<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> certain

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
certain design feature for a certain

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.630 
certain design feature for a certain
time<00:01:08.189> period<00:01:08.490> or<00:01:09.020> anything<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.439> was<00:01:11.250> not<00:01:11.430> able

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
time period or anything I was not able

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.330 
time period or anything I was not able
to<00:01:11.820> find<00:01:12.060> any<00:01:12.299> Catchings<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.470> particular

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
to find any Catchings on this particular

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.050 
to find any Catchings on this particular
light<00:01:14.549> bulb<00:01:15.890> but<00:01:16.890> let's<00:01:17.369> take<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> look<00:01:17.820> at<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
light bulb but let's take a look at the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.289 
light bulb but let's take a look at the
filament<00:01:18.600> I'm<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.770> use<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.430> flash<00:01:20.939> on

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
filament I'm going to use the flash on

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.429 
filament I'm going to use the flash on
my<00:01:21.750> iPhone<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.619> us<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:24.090> illuminate<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
my iPhone for us to illuminate the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.770 
my iPhone for us to illuminate the
inside<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.540> this<00:01:27.540> bulb<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:30.180> there<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.570> can

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
inside of this bulb and there you can

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.050 
inside of this bulb and there you can
see<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> filament<00:01:33.140> as<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
see the filament as you can see it is a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.319 
see the filament as you can see it is a
type<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.329> coil<00:01:37.610> I'm<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:38.820> very<00:01:39.000> good<00:01:39.119> with

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
type of a coil I'm not very good with

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.200 
type of a coil I'm not very good with
these<00:01:40.140> antique<00:01:40.920> bulbs<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.610> know<00:01:41.759> everything

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
these antique bulbs to know everything

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.179 
these antique bulbs to know everything
about<00:01:42.299> them<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.439> know<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.920> there<00:01:44.070> are

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
about them but I know that there are

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.880 
about them but I know that there are
people<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:44.700> there<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.119> do<00:01:46.790> so<00:01:48.649> try<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> get

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
people out there that do so try to get

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.069 
people out there that do so try to get
different<00:01:50.009> shots<00:01:50.460> here<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.030> maybe<00:01:51.750> somebody

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
different shots here so maybe somebody

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.959 
different shots here so maybe somebody
can<00:01:52.439> identify<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:53.630> anyway<00:01:55.579> that<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.729> what<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
can identify it anyway that is what the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.670 
can identify it anyway that is what the
inside<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.509> ball<00:01:57.659> looks<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.049> with<00:01:58.439> that

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
inside of the ball looks like with that

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.429 
inside of the ball looks like with that
type<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.009> filament<00:02:01.250> very<00:02:02.250> interesting<00:02:04.520> so

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
type of filament very interesting so

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.029 
type of filament very interesting so
there<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.740> my<00:02:08.220> antique<00:02:09.020> light<00:02:10.020> bulb<00:02:10.319> from<00:02:10.860> my

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
there is my antique light bulb from my
