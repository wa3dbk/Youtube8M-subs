in<00:00:13.879> order<00:00:14.119> to<00:00:14.389> get<00:00:14.539> the<00:00:14.629> correct<00:00:14.869> technique

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
in order to get the correct technique

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.109 
in order to get the correct technique
and<00:00:15.949> for<00:00:16.100> safety<00:00:16.430> reasons<00:00:16.760> it's<00:00:16.940> also

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
and for safety reasons it's also

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.050 
and for safety reasons it's also
important<00:00:17.720> to<00:00:17.869> have<00:00:18.110> control<00:00:18.500> of<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:18.650> ball

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
important to have control of the ball

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.160 
important to have control of the ball
let's<00:00:20.060> look<00:00:20.240> and<00:00:20.390> see<00:00:20.449> what<00:00:20.690> happens<00:00:21.050> when

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
let's look and see what happens when

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:29.890 
let's look and see what happens when
you've<00:00:21.320> got<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:21.530> wrong<00:00:21.650> technique<00:00:28.810> okay<00:00:29.810> so

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
you've got the wrong technique okay so

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.750 
you've got the wrong technique okay so
there's<00:00:30.170> a<00:00:30.260> perfect<00:00:30.619> example<00:00:30.680> you<00:00:31.610> will

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
there's a perfect example you will

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.939 
there's a perfect example you will
generally<00:00:32.239> pull<00:00:32.509> or<00:00:32.809> hook<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:33.200> ball<00:00:33.350> round<00:00:33.680> to

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
generally pull or hook the ball round to

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:35.740 
generally pull or hook the ball round to
the<00:00:33.980> left<00:00:34.250> hand<00:00:34.460> side<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:35.239> if<00:00:35.329> he<00:00:35.449> was<00:00:35.600> right

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
the left hand side so if he was right

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.860 
the left hand side so if he was right
hand<00:00:36.020> side<00:00:36.230> as<00:00:36.440> Christmas<00:00:37.040> display<00:00:37.489> so<00:00:38.450> we're

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
hand side as Christmas display so we're

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.300 
hand side as Christmas display so we're
going<00:00:38.989> to<00:00:39.079> look<00:00:39.170> at<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.410> technique<00:00:39.770> be<00:00:39.980> using

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
going to look at the technique be using

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.569 
going to look at the technique be using
the<00:00:40.489> ligament<00:00:41.800> so<00:00:42.800> in<00:00:42.950> starting<00:00:43.310> off<00:00:43.430> i

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
the ligament so in starting off i

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.080 
the ligament so in starting off i
recommend<00:00:44.060> to<00:00:44.270> go<00:00:44.899> for<00:00:45.710> a<00:00:45.739> slow<00:00:46.040> pace<00:00:46.310> and<00:00:46.550> just

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
recommend to go for a slow pace and just

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.910 
recommend to go for a slow pace and just
work<00:00:47.239> on<00:00:47.420> accuracy<00:00:47.810> before<00:00:48.140> you<00:00:48.440> try<00:00:48.739> that

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
work on accuracy before you try that

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.100 
work on accuracy before you try that
power<00:00:49.220> into<00:00:49.520> your<00:00:49.640> shop<00:00:49.790> and<00:00:50.630> as<00:00:50.840> a<00:00:50.870> rule<00:00:51.050> of

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
power into your shop and as a rule of

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.889 
power into your shop and as a rule of
thumb<00:00:51.200> i<00:00:51.559> recommend<00:00:52.220> people<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.630> pick<00:00:53.630> up<00:00:53.780> the

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
thumb i recommend people to pick up the

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.139 
thumb i recommend people to pick up the
ball<00:00:54.079> from<00:00:54.290> just<00:00:55.040> outside<00:00:55.190> their<00:00:55.670> back<00:00:55.880> foot

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
ball from just outside their back foot

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.240 
ball from just outside their back foot
and<00:00:56.630> we're<00:00:56.780> going<00:00:56.899> to<00:00:56.960> take<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:57.230> ball<00:00:57.469> in<00:00:58.070> a

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
and we're going to take the ball in a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.970 
and we're going to take the ball in a
fluid<00:00:58.820> motion<00:00:59.410> forwards<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:00.559> finish<00:01:00.800> on<00:01:00.950> that

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
fluid motion forwards and finish on that

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.179 
fluid motion forwards and finish on that
45<00:01:01.550> degree<00:01:01.579> angle<00:01:02.500> so<00:01:03.500> let's<00:01:03.770> have<00:01:03.890> a<00:01:03.950> look<00:01:04.100> at

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
45 degree angle so let's have a look at

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.860 
45 degree angle so let's have a look at
that

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:21.179 

see<00:01:07.440> I'm<00:01:07.560> finishing<00:01:07.860> one<00:01:08.670> down<00:01:08.970> 45

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:45.660 

let's<00:01:22.189> go<00:01:22.399> for<00:01:22.789> a<00:01:22.850> walk<00:01:23.979> pace<00:01:24.979> of<00:01:25.159> it

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:02:36.010
