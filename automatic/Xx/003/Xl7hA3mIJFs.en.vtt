with a fellow Samba whisper called I'm

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.020 
with a fellow Samba whisper called I'm
too<00:00:39.510> high<00:00:39.900> and<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.410> was<00:00:40.589> yeah<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.699> it's<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
too high and it was yeah I think it's a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.150 
too high and it was yeah I think it's a
how<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.269> pronounce<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.140> yeah<00:00:43.950> he's<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
how we pronounce it and yeah he's a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.619 
how we pronounce it and yeah he's a
really<00:00:44.579> big<00:00:44.760> player<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:46.219> yeah<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.539> can

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
really big player so yeah and as you can

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.290 
really big player so yeah and as you can
see<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.129> abusing<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> spawn<00:00:50.489> system<00:00:51.030> they

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
see it's abusing the spawn system they

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.869 
see it's abusing the spawn system they
only<00:00:51.660> spawn<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.530> two<00:00:53.039> windows<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.760> the
