 hi friends from youtube i'm irwin magot and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.350
 In this video we will see a top 10 of the 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.580
 hardest enemies in my opinion of the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.679
 resident evil 4 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.900
 I will also give you information about your strength and 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.150
 their weaknesses and to calculate the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.690
 force of each enemy the normal gun 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.029
 has a power of 1 and so let's start 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.519
 position 10 doctor savior this enemy 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.830
 possesses a great strength so much so that 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.019
 it takes 76 shots from the gun 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.269
 normal to kill him maybe many what 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.340
 we have underestimated but compared to 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.320
 its most powerful version if they descojonan 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.450
 is the mega doctor savior is a 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.820
 shitty shitty your weakness is the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.370
 Bone magnum broken butterfly or killer 7 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.559
 especially if you shoot in the head 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.050
 If you kill him, he will leave you a ruby ​​or 10,000 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.340

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.559

 a powerful 6-inch garlic machine gun 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.670
 cannons with which it is crushed as 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.890
 grandeur let the software to this enemy 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.350
 almost does not hurt the shots with 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.390
 shotguns his weakness is his head of 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.430
 Yucatecans and more if you shoot him with the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.960
 magnum in the head if you kill it 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.119
 will leave 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.909
 and first aid or 10,000 pesetas 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.850
 this enemy has a force of 110 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.340
 position 8 winner this is an enemy 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.170
 too strong and with a weak point not 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.630
 so easy to win as it has a 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.909
 clear that looks like a mucus on his back and 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.130
 It is not so easy to give, let alone the 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.860
 modified version and more desca hong ante 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.229
 that we see in chapter 41 where it comes out 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.360
 completely covered with an armor his 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.610
 weak point is your badge on your back and 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.040
 more if you shoot him with a magnum when 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.280
 you kill him will leave you 15,000 pesetas this 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.860
 enemy has strength of 95 position 7 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.050
 regenerator this enemy can be very 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.300
 They descojonan you and desperate if you 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.250
 shoot with conventional weapons since 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.679
 your weaknesses are only seen with 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.110
 thermal vision there are two species of this 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.149
 kind of enemies one that is normal the 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.950
 hairy and disgusting species and the other one is 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.560
 the species with barbs all over his body 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.869
 which hurt you very much if you're 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.119
 near his weakness is the hand cannon 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.080
 launches infinity rockets rifle with sight 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.360
 thermal pr l412 or chicago type greater 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.620
 when you kill this enemy will leave you 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.110
 five thousand pesetas 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.060
 these enemies have 25 power in 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.370
 each of his plagues but if he does not 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.150
 you shoot their plagues their strength will be 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.010
 from 220 position 6 the giant with the 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.170
 name we imply its strength and 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.629
 resistance plus it is very strong 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.400
 it's very fast and more uncool in the 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.349
 where you choose one of the two 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.090
 paths in the village and in the part where 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.430
 you're in an oven and you get two 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.890
 giants his weakness is the grenade of 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.810
 flash and beats mp since when you throw a 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.760
 pomegranate to hurt we have your eyes 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.340
 tapatíos which are your points 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.859
 weak and then we shoot him with the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.760
 cmp when you kill him will leave you 15,000 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:55.760
 pesetas its strength is 450 position 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.099
 5 salazar although he is the final boss of the 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.409
 castle is not so powerful since its 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.420
 weak point is at eye your eye 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.519
 yellowish and ugly but neither should 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.440
 underestimate what since during the fight 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.599
 thrown beam that is that they will end up with lyon 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.000
 at one stroke his weak point is his eye 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.489
 yellow and more if you shoot with the cmp 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.739
 then salazar will be discovered and it is better 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.560
 shoot him with the magnum when you kill him 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.520
 will leave you 50,000 pesetas the strength of 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.480
 his eye is 2 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.940
 50 and that of salazar is 500 position 4 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.550
 shift better known as mentor cheers 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.890
 this enemy is very powerful in terms of 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.960
 force and in terms of attack since if 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.450
 you are playing on professional difficulty 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.090
 It will kill you with two blows, although many will not 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.950
 they create it but this enemy is stronger 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.100
 that salazar since in its normal form 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.790
 it has a force of 600 and when its 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.290
 body its strength decreases to only 350 its 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.050
 weakness are the grenades of 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.120
 fragmentation the tmb and any of the 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.910
 Shotguns when you kill him will leave you 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.550
 25,000 pesetas position 3 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.800
 sadler although it is the final enemy is not 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.630
 stronger than the 2 that I lack if you 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.640
 will battle because in your position 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.880
 normal or when you fight with him in 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.030
 separates you have a force of 600 and 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.490
 in its final form it has a power of 550 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.890
 his weakness is the grenades and although 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.290
 do not believe the knife, also 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.140
 Throw mines and the magnum when you kill him 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.630
 you will give 100,000 pesetas position 2 the 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.790
 hangman the executioner although you do not believe it 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.450
 this enemy is more powerful than sadler 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.950
 if not 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.750
 is a rocket launcher or some 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.150
 machine gun you just can not 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.340
 kill him so easy since practically 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.930
 this bastard does not have any weakness to 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.880
 unless you throw the tanks of 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.950
 liquid nitrogen and discharge all your 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.870
 fury against him his weakness is the 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.670
 nitrogen since it freezes it and 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.860
 allows bullets to pierce you more 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.440
 when you kill him, he will leave you the jewel of 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.660
 crown valued at 13,000 pesetas but if 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.270
 you combine it with the crown and the badge 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.880
 real the merchant will give you 48 thousand pesetas 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.290
 for her his weakness as I said is 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.980
 any machine gun or the 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.980
 rocket launcher its strength is 850 and 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.800
 now in the position number 1 a chicken 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.510
 this bastard has incredible power 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.730
 of infinity and has no weakness 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.530
 if you face him it's as if you 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.040
 ripped the eggs with a clamp 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.010
 electrical anything nothing they believed it the 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.900
 position number one is for closer this 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.880
 bastard has no mercy against you when 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.280
 fight against him you will need a lot 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.200
 cunning patience concentration and 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.630
 precision since in its normal form 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.460
 you will never kill him because his strength 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.550
 it's infinite although when it's 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.980
 turned 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.020
 decreases considerably up to 900 its 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.180
 weakness are his feet and also the 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.490
 knife and more will be cut on the feet 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.130
 or also if you shoot with the magnum 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.140
 some shotgun or with the tmb on his feet 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.240
 and in its transformed form if 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.430
 weaknesses in spear mines and the magnum 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.590
 This is the only eyelet and stingy 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.230
 game because when you kill him he does not let you 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.590
 money the good bully friends this was 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.350
 all 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:03.270
 remember like and psuv for more videos if 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.270
 you do not give it like I'm going to make mincemeat
