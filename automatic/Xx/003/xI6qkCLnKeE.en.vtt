00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.610
 a good match is perfect even the market is not just having to wk 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.949
 be football 

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:10.329
 yes that is very disappointing 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:13.329
 in that we have our best match under 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.960
 under our wing had honestly try yourself two very well though 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.329
 started a little less again, but it was picked up again by actually immediately 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.220
 to the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.409
 no less than ten minutes legs derby got a great chance 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.189
 further out of the blue for nothing but three minutes later earth front there 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.260
 I am unfortunately not scared 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.440
 in addition to the strong, but there we have so many opportunities 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.560
 Could at that time substitute this feeling and it is nonsense that you have less 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.110
 rest but we have acted or that stupid of fallen into it for whom 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.790
 European result 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.140
 you can see that you can't resist that 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.240
 in europe it is 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.570
 ballast from england 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.650
 No 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.580
 randstad can defend especially did more few have had great opportunities 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.940
 it seemed like he didn't want to go there anymore, it was a bit disappointed on Sunday 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.030
 again because 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.240
 so that more in particular 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.240
 ap we know that 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.729
 that also for the next game that it can cope well with this 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.349
 opponent and bad buy am very satisfied being played 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.160
 and daler 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.240
 get the positive out of it 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.180
 this is what we would like to see 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.350
 and finally reward yourself the week of being convinced 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.250
 and whether that is over next week first 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.840
 in the coming weeks but I am convinced that this is a good move 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.210
 she can turn bronze for herself 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.990
 just a raid 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.520
 yes two games in which much less chance times much more score 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.990
 the gazet think we ourselves here on the side of owner geert wilders 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.770
 and we can handle it 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.320
 today it was again that with this result one way or the other 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.530
 difficult story 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.530
 yes, of course, but if you can also create such a dominating opportunity 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.500
 I have created twelve others, one of which is still full 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.569
 but still half chances 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.280
 prorail are happy let's hope we have sex next week with 4 2 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.999
 that contest in the first part instead of fake pieces better 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:21.379
 is then you take peace think it has to be very bad 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:25.619
 for a second chance according to him to record
