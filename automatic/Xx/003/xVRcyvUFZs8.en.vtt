Tony<00:00:50.340> beulah<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.850> lot<00:00:51.360> bigger<00:00:51.690> than<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.110> other

skill<00:00:52.800> point<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.550> gooz<00:00:54.539> LA<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.140> takes<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.590> lot

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
skill point in a gooz LA it takes a lot

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.200 
skill point in a gooz LA it takes a lot
longer<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.719> hence<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:58.079> reckon<00:00:59.039> really<00:00:59.489> really

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
longer and hence I reckon really really

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.639 
longer and hence I reckon really really
recommend<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> box<00:01:01.320> breaker

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649

recommend that you have the box breaker
for<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.129> mean<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.670> without<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
for this I mean you can do without the

for this I mean you can do without the
box<00:01:03.270> breaker<00:01:03.570> but<00:01:04.790> it's<00:01:05.790> much<00:01:06.060> more<00:01:06.240> fun<00:01:06.299> and

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
box breaker but it's much more fun and

box breaker but it's much more fun and
it's<00:01:08.220> much<00:01:08.549> much<00:01:08.850> more<00:01:09.090> easier<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.780> box

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it's much much more easier with the box

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.050

trying<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.590> destroy<00:02:07.890> these<00:02:08.039> are<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.810> make<00:02:09.810> a

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
trying to destroy these are and make a

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.440 
trying to destroy these are and make a
call<00:02:09.959> sign<00:02:10.649> things<00:02:10.950> my<00:02:11.129> dad's<00:02:11.519> got<00:02:11.700> hit<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.060> he

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
call sign things my dad's got hit and he

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.650 
call sign things my dad's got hit and he
takes<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.840> only<00:02:13.319> like<00:02:13.799> 130<00:02:14.430> health<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.819> if<00:02:15.540> you

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
takes I only like 130 health and if you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.360 
takes I only like 130 health and if you
can<00:02:15.810> if<00:02:15.959> here<00:02:16.290> originally<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.860> think<00:02:17.129> I<00:02:17.190> had

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
can if here originally I think I had

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.970 
can if here originally I think I had
about<00:02:17.489> four<00:02:18.120> or<00:02:18.150> five<00:02:18.360> bits<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.810> health<00:02:18.989> so<00:02:19.799> it

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
about four or five bits in health so it

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.170 
about four or five bits in health so it
would<00:02:20.099> have<00:02:20.190> been<00:02:20.250> much<00:02:20.459> harder<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.060> can

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
would have been much harder and you can

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.509 
would have been much harder and you can
see<00:02:21.540> hyper-strike<00:02:22.019> just<00:02:22.379> completely<00:02:22.950> owns<00:02:23.250> in

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
see hyper-strike just completely owns in

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.550 
see hyper-strike just completely owns in
and<00:02:23.760> who<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.599> like<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.840> style<00:02:25.110> every<00:02:25.410> time

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and who just like it style every time

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.880 
and who just like it style every time
you<00:02:25.680> hit<00:02:25.739> him<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.450> about<00:02:27.500> 10<00:02:28.500> hits<00:02:28.769> were

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
you hit him so about 10 hits were

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.440 
you hit him so about 10 hits were
killing<00:02:29.190> with<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.430> would<00:02:29.849> be<00:02:29.970> hyper<00:02:30.150> track

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
killing with it would be hyper track

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.110 
killing with it would be hyper track
while<00:02:30.690> first<00:02:31.500> time<00:02:31.769> it<00:02:32.069> would<00:02:32.400> take<00:02:32.430> about<00:02:32.700> 30

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
while first time it would take about 30

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.250 
while first time it would take about 30
hits<00:02:33.390> or<00:02:33.510> something<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.870> was<00:02:33.989> something<00:02:34.230> like

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
hits or something it was something like

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.190 
hits or something it was something like
that<00:02:34.379> maybe<00:02:34.890> more<00:02:35.250> 30<00:02:35.519> though<00:02:36.360> hits<00:02:36.720> 20<00:02:37.019> hits

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
that maybe more 30 though hits 20 hits

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.539 
that maybe more 30 though hits 20 hits
something<00:02:37.410> right<00:02:37.650> around<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
something right around that and

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.130 
something right around that and
therefore<00:02:38.970> thousand<00:02:39.420> volts<00:02:39.629> for<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:39.900> and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
therefore thousand volts for that and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.400 
therefore thousand volts for that and
the<00:02:40.590> second<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:42.420> third<00:02:42.450> skill<00:02:42.930> point<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.260> this

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
the second the third skill point in this

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.020 
the second the third skill point in this
level<00:02:43.739> are<00:02:43.890> no<00:02:44.160> one<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.400> recommend<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.910> come

level are no one I recommend to come

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.059 
level are no one I recommend to come
back<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.329> it<00:02:45.420> for<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.900> battle<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.590> be<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.829> brawl

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
tie it on this at first and that's

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.910 
tie it on this at first and that's
really<00:02:51.780> pathetic<00:02:51.930> cuz<00:02:52.319> this<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.560> really

it's<00:04:07.099> nearly<00:04:07.310> done<00:04:07.579> you<00:04:07.909> have<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.150> go<00:04:08.269> through

that room back there you just come

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.729 
that room back there you just come
straight<00:04:10.430> there<00:04:10.519> here<00:04:10.900> guess<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.019> recipes

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
straight there here guess the recipes

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.229 
straight there here guess the recipes
and<00:04:13.010> I'll<00:04:13.370> show<00:04:13.609> you<00:04:13.639> that<00:04:13.849> you<00:04:13.909> can<00:04:14.000> actually

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
and I'll show you that you can actually

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.729 
and I'll show you that you can actually
leave<00:04:14.599> a<00:04:14.629> few<00:04:14.930> do<00:04:15.139> see<00:04:16.130> is<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:17.840> see<00:04:18.530> there's

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
leave a few do see is to see there's

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:19.839 
leave a few do see is to see there's
your<00:04:18.829> school<00:04:19.250> point<00:04:19.430> and<00:04:19.519> they<00:04:19.579> can<00:04:19.699> see<00:04:19.820> a

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
your school point and they can see a

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:21.249 
your school point and they can see a
light<00:04:20.090> back<00:04:20.329> there<00:04:20.359> you<00:04:20.570> can<00:04:20.690> actually<00:04:20.870> leave

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259 
light back there you can actually leave

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:22.810 
light back there you can actually leave
and<00:04:21.470> I<00:04:21.530> think<00:04:21.739> there's<00:04:21.889> more<00:04:22.099> some<00:04:22.610> more

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
and I think there's more some more

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.520 
and I think there's more some more
things<00:04:23.060> in<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.810> building<00:04:24.139> and<00:04:24.229> some<00:04:24.380> of<00:04:24.470> the

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
things in the building and some of the

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.680 
things in the building and some of the
places<00:04:24.740> that<00:04:24.889> we<00:04:25.070> left<00:04:25.280> so<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:26.240> don't<00:04:26.509> have<00:04:26.570> to

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
places that we left so you don't have to

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.830 
places that we left so you don't have to
get<00:04:26.780> everything<00:04:27.139> now<00:04:28.039> the<00:04:28.509> so<00:04:29.509> though<00:04:29.660> all

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
get everything now the so though all

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.870 
get everything now the so though all
those<00:04:29.930> free<00:04:30.169> skill<00:04:30.380> points<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:30.740> there's<00:04:31.520> good

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
those free skill points I there's good

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.180 
those free skill points I there's good
reason<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.330> come<00:04:32.539> back<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:33.050> do<00:04:33.199> it<00:04:33.349> anyway<00:04:34.039> this

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
reason to come back to do it anyway this

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.710 
reason to come back to do it anyway this
is<00:04:34.340> just<00:04:34.520> showing<00:04:34.550> you<00:04:34.759> a<00:04:34.849> client<00:04:35.360> class<00:04:35.509> large

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
is just showing you a client class large

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.379 
is just showing you a client class large
noggin<00:04:36.430> except<00:04:37.430> this<00:04:37.580> last<00:04:37.639> one<00:04:38.000> which<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.240> the

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
noggin except this last one which is the

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.390 
noggin except this last one which is the
fourth<00:04:38.570> skill<00:04:38.870> point<00:04:39.080> um<00:04:39.229> I<00:04:39.650> tried<00:04:39.949> the<00:04:40.130> last

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
fourth skill point um I tried the last

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.879 
fourth skill point um I tried the last
last<00:04:40.789> time<00:04:40.970> I<00:04:41.000> came<00:04:41.210> here<00:04:41.419> but<00:04:41.630> I<00:04:41.690> failed<00:04:42.530> and

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
last time I came here but I failed and

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.860 
last time I came here but I failed and
so<00:04:43.639> I<00:04:43.669> decided<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.120> come<00:04:44.240> back<00:04:44.360> here<00:04:44.419> and<00:04:44.690> do<00:04:44.840> it

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
so I decided to come back here and do it

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.499 
so I decided to come back here and do it
while<00:04:45.409> I<00:04:45.440> was<00:04:45.590> doing<00:04:45.860> a<00:04:46.190> post<00:04:47.060> comment<00:04:47.419> here

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
while I was doing a post comment here

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.339 
while I was doing a post comment here
anyway<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:49.370> actually<00:04:50.360> forgot<00:04:50.720> about<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.139> first

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
anyway I actually forgot about the first

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
time when I was actually recording on

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.499 
time when I was actually recording on
this<00:04:54.530> route<00:04:55.090> so<00:04:56.090> uh<00:04:57.490> yeah<00:04:58.490> I<00:04:58.520> am<00:04:58.909> that<00:04:59.360> was<00:04:59.479> a

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
this route so uh yeah I am that was a

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.749 
this route so uh yeah I am that was a
big<00:04:59.690> big<00:04:59.870> cut<00:05:00.139> there<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:01.250> can<00:05:01.340> see<00:05:01.550> how<00:05:01.729> I

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
big big cut there and you can see how I

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.499 
big big cut there and you can see how I
change<00:05:02.509> from<00:05:02.960> using<00:05:03.800> a<00:05:04.030> what's<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:05.180> called<00:05:05.210> on

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
change from using a what's it called on

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:09.999 
change from using a what's it called on
the<00:05:07.060> Clank<00:05:08.060> to<00:05:08.419> go<00:05:09.020> faster<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.590> chargers

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
the Clank to go faster to the chargers

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.219 
the Clank to go faster to the chargers
I'm<00:05:10.220> I'm<00:05:10.639> sorry<00:05:11.090> for<00:05:11.360> using<00:05:11.479> Clank<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.110> go

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
I'm I'm sorry for using Clank to go

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.020 
I'm I'm sorry for using Clank to go
faster<00:05:12.710> and<00:05:12.889> I<00:05:13.009> should<00:05:13.250> be<00:05:13.340> using<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:13.610> charges

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
faster and I should be using the charges

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.790 
faster and I should be using the charges
because<00:05:14.240> it's<00:05:14.389> much<00:05:14.630> quicker<00:05:14.810> but<00:05:15.080> I'm<00:05:15.259> really

takes forever on I think my original
recording<00:05:40.969> is<00:05:41.090> something<00:05:41.419> like<00:05:41.479> eight<00:05:41.690> mins<00:05:41.870> I

um if you only have one less because he

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.100 
um if you only have one less because he
keep<00:05:46.580> on<00:05:46.700> destroying<00:05:47.030> the<00:05:47.240> rest<00:05:47.450> then<00:05:47.780> you

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
keep on destroying the rest then you

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.820 
keep on destroying the rest then you
might<00:05:48.290> as<00:05:48.320> well<00:05:48.470> just<00:05:48.590> kill<00:05:48.740> yourself<00:05:48.860> and<00:05:49.550> get

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
might as well just kill yourself and get

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.230 
might as well just kill yourself and get
all<00:05:51.830> them<00:05:52.160> back<00:05:52.340> because<00:05:52.550> it's<00:05:52.850> much<00:05:53.030> much

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
all them back because it's much much

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
more quicker much more easily are losing

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.210 
more quicker much more easily are losing
more<00:05:56.630> than<00:05:56.690> more<00:05:57.260> than<00:05:57.290> just<00:05:57.650> one<00:05:57.680> of<00:05:57.950> the<00:05:58.010> time

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220

and you get 300 fault which is much less

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.370 
and you get 300 fault which is much less
than<00:06:13.640> what<00:06:14.360> you<00:06:14.390> should<00:06:14.720> get<00:06:14.960> for<00:06:15.320> that
