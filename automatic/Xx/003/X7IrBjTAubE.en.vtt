actually cross points points are very

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.619 
actually cross points points are very
important<00:00:59.489> because<00:00:59.579> they<00:00:59.940> basically<00:01:00.390> related

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
important because they basically related

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.189 
important because they basically related
to<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> lot<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.710> stuff<00:01:01.920> from<00:01:02.510> defense<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.989> using

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that we've got a fair bunch of units

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960 
that we've got a fair bunch of units
around<00:01:27.060> at<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> moment<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.280> see<00:01:29.549> where

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
around at the moment you can see where

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.030 
around at the moment you can see where
the<00:01:30.180> units<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.049> move<00:01:31.229> them<00:01:31.439> which<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.799> labeled

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the units can move them which is labeled

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.270 
the units can move them which is labeled
on<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.310> map<00:01:33.060> by<00:01:33.270> blue<00:01:33.900> squares<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.950> simply

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
on the map by blue squares you simply

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880 
on the map by blue squares you simply
move<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.490> circle<00:01:36.360> pad<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:37.049> direction<00:01:37.619> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
move the circle pad in direction and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.109 
move the circle pad in direction and
they<00:01:38.040> automatically<00:01:38.490> moves<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:38.850> there's<00:01:39.030> no

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
they automatically moves so there's no

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.149 
they automatically moves so there's no
need<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.360> highlight<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.380> point<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.799> tell<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
need to move so x and y much okay on the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.359 
need to move so x and y much okay on the
top<00:01:46.740> right<00:01:47.540> here<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.259> see<00:01:49.470> attack<00:01:49.950> change

since we're here we might we'll give it

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.930 
since we're here we might we'll give it
a<00:02:26.079> shot<00:02:26.250> unfortunately<00:02:27.250> due<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.640> enemy

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:50.449 
layout you can will only be able to hit
two<00:02:29.829> at<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.280> time<00:02:30.610> but<00:02:31.510> let's<00:02:32.260> put<00:02:32.470> some<00:02:32.650> music

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.100 

I'm<00:02:51.459> sub-series<00:02:52.000> me<00:02:52.240> recognize<00:02:52.600> that<00:02:52.750> as<00:02:52.930> the

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
I'm sub-series me recognize that as the

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.750 
I'm sub-series me recognize that as the
variant<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:55.410> moonlight<00:02:56.410> blade<00:02:56.709> which<00:02:57.160> was

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
variant of the moonlight blade which was

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.400 
variant of the moonlight blade which was
a<00:02:57.790> move<00:02:58.060> by<00:02:58.209> Shion<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.959> first<00:02:59.170> game<00:03:04.410> okay

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
a move by Shion in the first game okay

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.250 
a move by Shion in the first game okay
so<00:03:05.470> that's<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:06.480> multiple<00:03:07.480> assault<00:03:07.720> moves<00:03:07.930> you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
so that's the multiple assault moves you

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.990 
so that's the multiple assault moves you
can<00:03:08.410> only<00:03:08.530> use<00:03:08.620> those<00:03:08.980> when<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.220> have<00:03:09.310> cross

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
can only use those when you have cross

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.710 
can only use those when you have cross
points<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.569> a<00:03:10.780> hundred<00:03:11.140> percent<00:03:11.230> or<00:03:11.620> more<00:03:12.720> so

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
points of a hundred percent or more so

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.360 
points of a hundred percent or more so
that<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:14.530> won't<00:03:14.590> be<00:03:14.739> able<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:14.920> use<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.100> there

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
that you won't be able to use it there

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.310 
that you won't be able to use it there
indefinitely<00:03:16.830> okay<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.540> going<00:03:19.540> back<00:03:19.660> down<00:03:20.050> now

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
indefinitely okay so going back down now

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.670 
indefinitely okay so going back down now
to<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:21.150> Richmond<00:03:22.150> moves<00:03:24.959> let's<00:03:25.959> go<00:03:26.290> and

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
to the Richmond moves let's go and

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.870 
to the Richmond moves let's go and
attack<00:03:27.540> right<00:03:28.540> at<00:03:29.130> basically<00:03:30.130> I'm<00:03:30.400> in<00:03:30.730> the

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
attack right at basically I'm in the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.559 
attack right at basically I'm in the
game<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.239> have<00:03:31.590> sets<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.860> units<00:03:33.850> which<00:03:33.970> are<00:03:34.090> in

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
game you have sets of units which are in

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.300 
game you have sets of units which are in
pairs<00:03:34.959> so<00:03:35.260> they're<00:03:35.440> your<00:03:35.560> main<00:03:35.739> attacking<00:03:36.190> it

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
pairs so they're your main attacking it

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.979 
pairs so they're your main attacking it
so<00:03:36.489> in<00:03:37.120> this<00:03:37.209> particular<00:03:37.360> case<00:03:37.720> we<00:03:37.870> have

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
so in this particular case we have

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.890 
so in this particular case we have
cosmos<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:38.470> tell<00:03:38.650> us<00:03:38.769> as<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:39.790> can<00:03:40.000> add<00:03:40.180> a

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
cosmos and tell us as you can add a

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.979 
cosmos and tell us as you can add a
third<00:03:41.890> unit<00:03:42.280> term<00:03:42.700> called<00:03:43.030> solar<00:03:43.390> units<00:03:43.630> to

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
third unit term called solar units to

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.259 
third unit term called solar units to
them<00:03:44.140> which<00:03:44.620> gives<00:03:44.890> them<00:03:45.130> an<00:03:45.610> extra<00:03:45.850> attack

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
them which gives them an extra attack

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.630 
them which gives them an extra attack
when<00:03:47.049> they<00:03:47.200> get<00:03:47.350> amped<00:03:47.650> on<00:03:47.829> the<00:03:48.010> assault<00:03:48.280> and

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
when they get amped on the assault and

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.699 
when they get amped on the assault and
they<00:03:49.209> usually<00:03:49.390> map<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:49.900> L<00:03:50.049> button<00:03:50.320> and

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
they usually map to the L button and

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.580 
they usually map to the L button and
also<00:03:51.340> when<00:03:52.120> you're<00:03:52.390> close<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.810> characters

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
also when you're close to characters

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.890 
also when you're close to characters
like<00:03:53.739> we<00:03:53.890> are<00:03:53.980> here<00:03:54.370> notice<00:03:55.060> them<00:03:55.299> reuse<00:03:55.660> over

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
like we are here notice them reuse over

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.380 
like we are here notice them reuse over
here<00:03:56.140> we<00:03:56.290> have<00:03:56.890> browning<00:03:57.310> from<00:03:57.579> an

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
here we have browning from an

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.020 
here we have browning from an

endless frontier over there as well you

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.850 
endless frontier over there as well you
can<00:04:01.180> actually<00:04:01.480> have<00:04:01.630> them<00:04:01.810> support<00:04:02.260> um<00:04:02.620> your

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
can actually have them support um your

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.470 
can actually have them support um your
characters<00:04:03.310> as<00:04:03.489> well<00:04:03.519> in<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.820> attack<00:04:04.090> and

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
characters as well in the attack and

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.720 
characters as well in the attack and
they<00:04:05.260> are<00:04:05.440> mapped<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.829> hour<00:04:06.010> button<00:04:06.280> as

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
they are mapped to the hour button as

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.960 
they are mapped to the hour button as
you<00:04:06.790> can<00:04:07.180> see<00:04:07.299> here<00:04:07.720> that<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:08.019> support<00:04:08.970> allows

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
you can see here that the support allows

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.810 
you can see here that the support allows
us<00:04:10.209> to<00:04:10.360> change<00:04:11.250> character<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:12.459> let's<00:04:12.730> have

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
us to change character so let's have

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.380

need that extra fifty percent during

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.970 
need that extra fifty percent during
your<00:05:31.710> attacks<00:05:33.140> ok<00:05:34.140> we<00:05:34.380> managed<00:05:34.650> to<00:05:34.680> kill<00:05:34.860> that

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
your attacks ok we managed to kill that

your attacks ok we managed to kill that
one<00:05:35.130> and<00:05:35.400> this<00:05:35.850> could<00:05:36.090> be<00:05:36.210> start<00:05:36.540> again

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
one and this could be start again

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.570 
one and this could be start again
because<00:05:37.560> we<00:05:37.650> did<00:05:37.800> have<00:05:37.950> the<00:05:38.070> end<00:05:38.250> points

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
because we did have the end points

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.620 
because we did have the end points
before<00:05:38.670> so<00:05:39.090> let's<00:05:39.480> take<00:05:39.990> advantage<00:05:40.110> of<00:05:40.470> that

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630
