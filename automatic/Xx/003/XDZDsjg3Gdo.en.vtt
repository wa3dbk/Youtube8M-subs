multiplayer<00:02:43.069> so<00:02:43.700> I<00:02:45.280> guess<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.430> could<00:02:46.580> do<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.760> I

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
multiplayer so I guess I could do that I

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.930 
multiplayer so I guess I could do that I
need<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.530> meet<00:02:48.650> some<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:48.980> my<00:02:49.069> skype<00:02:49.459> friends
