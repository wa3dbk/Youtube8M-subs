00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
use in the field and i'll actually like

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.450 
use in the field and i'll actually like
them<00:05:52.199> to<00:05:52.349> be<00:05:52.469> a<00:05:52.500> little<00:05:52.680> bit<00:05:52.830> smaller<00:05:53.159> with

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
them to be a little bit smaller with

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.550 
them to be a little bit smaller with
this<00:05:53.580> extra<00:05:53.940> bevel<00:05:54.449> this<00:05:54.900> is<00:05:55.110> getting<00:05:55.469> a

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
this extra bevel this is getting a

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.409 
this extra bevel this is getting a
little<00:05:55.589> bit<00:05:55.979> larger<00:05:56.129> than<00:05:56.370> seven<00:05:56.879> inches<00:05:57.180> a

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
little bit larger than seven inches a

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:58.999 
little bit larger than seven inches a
lot<00:05:57.750> of<00:05:57.930> the<00:05:58.050> other<00:05:58.259> panels<00:05:58.710> have<00:05:58.860> the

00:05:58.999 --> 00:05:59.009 
lot of the other panels have the

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.129 
lot of the other panels have the
controls<00:05:59.460> located<00:05:59.879> on<00:06:00.360> the<00:06:00.509> tops<00:06:00.750> or<00:06:00.990> the

controls located on the tops or the

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:02.990 
controls located on the tops or the
sides<00:06:01.440> so<00:06:01.979> that<00:06:02.009> they<00:06:02.219> can<00:06:02.370> eliminate<00:06:02.610> this

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
sides so that they can eliminate this

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.600 
sides so that they can eliminate this
area<00:06:03.389> down<00:06:03.659> here<00:06:03.800> aperture<00:06:04.800> has<00:06:05.069> decent

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
area down here aperture has decent

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.850 
area down here aperture has decent
controls<00:06:06.210> but<00:06:06.659> because<00:06:07.050> they<00:06:07.199> take<00:06:07.409> up<00:06:07.440> space

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
controls but because they take up space

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.709 
controls but because they take up space
down<00:06:08.159> here<00:06:08.190> they<00:06:08.729> make<00:06:08.909> the<00:06:09.089> panel<00:06:09.419> bigger

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:09.719 
down here they make the panel bigger

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.409 
down here they make the panel bigger
otherwise<00:06:10.710> this<00:06:11.159> is<00:06:11.370> a<00:06:11.400> pretty<00:06:11.669> good<00:06:11.879> by<00:06:12.089> if

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
otherwise this is a pretty good by if

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.050 
otherwise this is a pretty good by if
