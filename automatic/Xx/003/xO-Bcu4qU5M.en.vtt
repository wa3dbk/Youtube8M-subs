 and another new game is in the open 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.540
 beta started called odyssee yes and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.290
 I have it for you of course 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.290
 watched 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.360
 my name is called acer and my name 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.750
 Welcome to a new one 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.850
 follow hands-on beta this time with odyssey 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.310
 to play a browser which is currently in 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.590
 the open beta started as usual 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.269
 in advance a few small infos what is one 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.939
 song baths i'll show you the games 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.610
 either in the same access in the closed 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.250
 or open beta are the games in the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.780
 normal cases are not yet final but where 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.489
 I'll give you a quick impression of it 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.410
 I want to give what I think of the game 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.190
 is what you should look forward to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.800
 and so on and so on bodies 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.600
 browser game of arthur games straight in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.850
 the open beta started and I want to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.460
 from the beginning I say personally 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.289
 no browser game player and I am 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.289
 not a player who loves browsergames 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.180
 plays why they are too simplistic 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.670
 or just not implemented well enough 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.500
 there are very few exceptions but the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.960
 Exceptions I like it there 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.909
 usually with a possible 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.200
 small downloads like drakensang that 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.880
 you can play in the browser that you can 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.590
 but also in the small play and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.200
 that's why it could be this 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.790
 video maybe a bit one-sided 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.080
 but it is my opinion like 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.920
 if you see it differently in the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.020
 Write comments 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.030
 they are there for that and you can find it 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.650
 as usual, of course, a link to 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.150
 the game in the video description 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.880
 if you look at it for free 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.130
 So what do you expect in this 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.200
 fishing season with the setting to the whole 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.210
 is in Greek mythology 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.610
 Law that means you become gods like 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.490
 zeus and demigods like perseus or 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.110
 also how to find herpes and yes that was 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.899
 actually everything you actually do 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.820
 it can just say so if the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.950
 play the popular online poker one 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.820
 piece online or league of angels 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.920
 would like to 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.009
 why you will, too 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.210
 can do something with odyssey 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.040
 short version of the game character 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.130
 create a click 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.220
 click click again 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.720
 click here and that's it so it is 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.670
 a typical browser game what you 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.470
 car park gives that means it leads you 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.180
 automatically to the host and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.020
 back and again to the stronger and 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.110
 first in itself 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.550
 it has a more or less 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.780
 automated process of fighting why 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.510
 I'll get more or less rap 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.950
 and in itself it is one of those games 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.300
 where I say there you only need 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.160
 a finger to play the game 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.780
 because you actually have to work as well as 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.820
 do not click anything yourself with time 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.100
 you turn more and more things free 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.230
 but in the end to the same 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.459
 play principle lead the these typical 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.020
 call browser games 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.300
 I did not play online on me 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.620
 I played montis online and what 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.120
 me personally at these games always 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.580
 not like it is actually that 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.290
 just a spectator for me 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.750
 and the game is actually about 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.400
 alone and I do not understand why 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.780
 such games always come out again 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.790
 somewhere it has to be a sense that 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.650
 there are people who like such games 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.790
 At least I'm not one of them 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.320
 That's why I said at the beginning 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.660
 I'm not the browser games fan 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.670
 this game joins the game 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.830
 The actual seamless to that is one 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.970
 play where i say okay that's nothing 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.380
 for me that does not mean that it 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.810
 not fallen to one or the other 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.269
 I might ask why but why 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.440
 could definitely be something in very much 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.209
 Dangerous game is one level 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.100
 incredibly fast within 20 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.100
 Minutes with 30 believe maximum level 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.600
 currently 100 it is great and that means 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.920
 you immediately realize that comes from somewhere 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.340
 the asian countries 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.290
 the interface is packed with 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.549
 show any where the half of 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.799
 I had to show this after 20 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.140
 still do not know what they are for 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.030
 and in the end I would say 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.160
 if i get something positive from the game 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.989
 should definitely pull out then in any case 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.070
 the quest texts this very nice 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.269
 written here and there not quite 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.950
 so I translated had a few 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.140
 Spanish word words still in there though 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.170
 it fits in with this old ideological 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.030
 setting from the Greek mythology 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.950
 From the gameplay, it's just not 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.239
 gameplay for me so in the fight 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.040
 system learns here with the time 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.540
 different skills you then 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.030
 enable turn-based 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.500
 The game runs automated view 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.239
 but you can say it in the first one 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.590
 round I use my first skill in 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.269
 I use the second round through mine 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.439
 second skeleton third useful 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.030
 Provider my first child 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.010
 interesting is that even there 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.109
 there is a button preliminary car 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.239
 can adjust where even fight then 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.769
 automatically run well there is 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.169
 group systems that means we know that 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.460
 also from all other games so 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.199
 you are not alone on the road but 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.330
 with different characters the 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.160
 follow you with the times and blablabla 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.289
 So I have to say I have in the five 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.180
 not really seen that much in minutes 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.530
 whole ran automatically and after the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.090
 It was always five minutes 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.919
 Again the same thing too short a run 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.080
 for another donor somehow run 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.789
 an item will get a bit short 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.949
 unlock a fight against pug and 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.770
 back to the sgb and back to the circle 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.120
 I really wonder why so it is 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.289
 Although an open beta was the game 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.840
 completely finished if you know completely 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.789
 it's just that there is not 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.740
 if you play in these games 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.270
 Look , they are all the same are still 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.680
 the same basic principle that means one 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.880
 Easy to exchange trades you know 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.259
 maybe exchange the story or 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.240
 somehow the lyrics are songs inside 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.770
 brings the game new rauslässt it 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.120
 At some point degenerate and then brings that 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.889
 next out and land completely honest 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.970
 somehow it has to be for the people 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.260
 otherwise they would be worth such games 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.270
 do not always bring out 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.159
 but I say it's completely honest for me 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.539
 that nothing I can recommend it to you if 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.770
 to go on such there are 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.030
 Of course people will find something like that 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.010
 interesting that one can do well by the way 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.300
 play then look at you calmly 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.250
 you stop in the video description below 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.659
 the link to the official page and 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.220
 otherwise I am very happy if he 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.900
 me actually in the comments 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.550
 what do you write about such games 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.260
 Do you think anyone since he says yes 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.389
 but I can order what to do with me 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.820
 makes it fun or you say like me 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.710
 just I just do not understand why 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.210
 developers even only one euro 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.400
 in the development of such games 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.810
 I'm really looking forward to invest there 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.159
 I can not do much more 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.199
 I do not want to say much more 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.389
 but i say i definitely 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:53.190
 Hope to see you in my next one 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:56.190
 video by up then I'm Zschau times 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.190
 Out
