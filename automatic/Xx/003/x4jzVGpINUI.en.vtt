00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.830
 to achieve your parish it would take 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.650
 turn everything milk so cut 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.150
 on sale like this so shares 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.260
 about 60 70 cm long and a half 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.840
 centimeter wide 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.710
 so that will take eighty blues 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.140
 like this is a white besides 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.099
 andrÃ©e it will take a small body of water to 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.690
 about 20 cm I think we will cut them 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.989
 so here's a little square like these 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 a small orange- yellow rectangle so the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:46.469
 coopec the little eyes like this 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.019
 2 obviously and then glue 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.579
 I agree specifically for the 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.690
 corrugated cardboard but I think with a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.350
 classic glue and no worries that's fine 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.449
 worked 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.850
 and then it would also need a 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.140
 decision here we are found for the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.479
 so here is the principle is the following 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.640
 it's the killing principle I do not know 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:09.119
 if you know so we can be a 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.440
 will roll the paper on itself in 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:22.979
 putting time glue points in 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:24.929
 time I give you to neck so high 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.460
 flow and then after we go we get 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:30.330
 will find step by step 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.720
 this is actually we roll like these 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.720
 paper 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.680
 which will allow us to actually 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.930
 create shapes at closures so there 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.460
 in fact the goal is to roll all 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:54.500
 your white band on itself 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.700
 to have a big round that will make the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.560
 penguin's belly 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.000
 so we end up once the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.350
 white band and roll on itself 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.870
 for the sequel once you have 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.110
 rolled your white stripe we get a 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.450
 good like this to continue so the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.510
 belly or will do we will roll a 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.870
 second band but this one the bands 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.780
 blue around so we'll take over 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.250
 in fact we will approach it like these 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.250
 around the white stripe 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.320
 while still putting glue 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.110
 finally sometimes I continue to roll 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.820
 always like this and then he gets 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.370
 so find once the belly is 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.600
 finished for the others here is the belly 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.570
 is finished so in fact for the sequel 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.950
 you will have to do three 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:50.830
 identical rolls without using the 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.590
 little band especially used so the 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.330
 three blue stripes you have left 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.080
 you make yourself three rolls 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.480
 identical 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.330
 and then once so always with 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.670
 the glue enlisting turns and once 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.380
 that it's over so we end up 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.910
 for really well finalized so the 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.490
 Penguin 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.740
 here we can each make his little ones his 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.740
 three little circles and immediately 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.879
 so here I have all the parts of the 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.400
 my father's body you just had 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.790
 have them assemble 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.370
 and thus creates the head of the siding is 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.019
 took over here the most 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.049
 today in the last three you 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.090
 have been so he will serve to make the 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.200
 europe head 1 in front of us first of all 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.200
 it will be necessary to speak the eyes 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.600
 moore 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:06.210
 especially those 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:11.520
 and then to cut with and the 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:17.540
 parcels I take my box 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.540
 young orange and I cut 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:27.350
 like these here is lo 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:36.020
 then I'll be able to fold it for the 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.020
 trainer 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.710
 these 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:52.880
 hop we get the head and then it's 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.200
 very simple we are not actually going to stick 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:01.520
 these two roles have we served for 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.520
 feet here we are going to stick like this 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.240
 the body on the legs 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:16.630
 here phone call pretty strong and then 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.770
 so we will come head forward before the 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:23.240
 head by janice so is your band 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:28.390
 you had just keep going now 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:31.100
 you know in front we close our arms 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:35.980
 so after you do the length that 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:39.610
 you wish I had abyssal losses 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.610
 and that I thought 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.630
 then we stick here before 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.419
 here 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.530
 and so after my little head 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.970
 but there 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:12.610
 there is more to wait for it 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:15.730
 well and that would be if you see well I 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.260
 tipped hoping to Cressat 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:21.010
 take off a little but the principle here 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.870
 it is to stick so the body here all 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.900
 of school gets worse so you paste your 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.660
 body on your paws is then you 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.230
 so put your 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.250
 our son that you kept here between 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.530
 head and body 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.760
 and then after all that changed everything and 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.430
 you do not like me before 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.280
 touch you wait until it dries 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:43.200
 here I hope this little tutorial visas 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.180
 then found again for other videos 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.070
 on my channel studies and especially 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.070
