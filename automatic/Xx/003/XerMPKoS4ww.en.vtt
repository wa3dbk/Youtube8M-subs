and they end up winning three maps
straight<00:01:27.869> which<00:01:28.290> i<00:01:28.409> think<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.680> pretty

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
straight which i think is pretty

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.649 
straight which i think is pretty
ridiculous<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.700> we're<00:01:29.820> playing<00:01:30.060> against

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
ridiculous and we're playing against

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.780 
ridiculous and we're playing against
people<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.079> equal<00:01:31.740> skill<00:01:31.890> level<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
people of equal skill level I think it

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.920 
people of equal skill level I think it
makes<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> game<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.540> much<00:01:33.720> more

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
makes the game that much more

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.630 
makes the game that much more

keeping<00:01:45.450> call<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.899> duty<00:01:46.110> alive<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.920> past

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
keeping call of duty alive and this past

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130 
keeping call of duty alive and this past
few<00:01:47.430> months<00:01:47.579> really<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.119> past<00:01:48.390> year<00:01:48.570> because

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
few months really this past year because

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.109 
few months really this past year because
if<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.380> ask<00:01:49.590> me<00:01:49.860> from<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> pub<00:01:50.759> side<00:01:51.030> of

game of all time the Moab really helped

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.930 
game of all time the Moab really helped
that<00:02:13.810> game<00:02:13.990> out<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:15.340> need<00:02:15.520> something

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940

like<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.630> game<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.140> people<00:02:17.440> who

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
like that in the game for the people who

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.440 
like that in the game for the people who
do<00:02:17.740> play<00:02:17.950> pubs<00:02:18.220> as<00:02:18.490> well<00:02:18.880> as<00:02:18.970> competitive

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
do play pubs as well as competitive

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.910
