00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Minnelli representing the perfectly 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.240
 there in the confederations forward in 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.950
 happy vinyl with your interview with the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.389
 chepo of the technical tower of the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.389
 Mexican soccer team 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.850
 good night erika rufo, very much liked in 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.260
 say hello, we have here JosÃ© Manuel de 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.510
 the technical selection tower 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.710
 Mexican who gave us a few minutes 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.590
 teacher, thank you very much 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.900
 first how is it after 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.849
 of the hexagonal I imagine that already thinking about 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.130
 confederations but what is the feeling 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.610
 at this time the coach of the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.430
 mexican selection good first 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.050
 we are calm but yes with the pain 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.879
 of not being able to give the results that 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.140
 we thought we could give at home 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:51.399
 then and give satisfaction to the people 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.840
 but well that's already happened and we've 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.600
 focused solely on what 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.070
 is this confederation tournament 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.930
 of power 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.610
 be well concentrated to be able to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.800
 make the most of enjoying it at 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.930
 maximum 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.670
 and looking for some way to reverse 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.220
 all these circumstances that we have 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.470
 been watching on the ex cell phone says that 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.119
 Mexico grows before big rivals 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.950
 he sees it like this the players said yes 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.229
 we can face these rivals italy-brazil 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.550
 which are of the so-called large 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.400
 you can buy any 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.590
 what you believe is something that many times 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.120
 I have commented with you that if you believe 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.670
 what can you do or do you think you can not? 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.890
 everything is in each of us and that 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.110
 it has been constantly demonstrated by the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.450
 national elections is going to any 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.520
 place against any rival and they have 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.070
 could get good results now 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.350
 Well, we have not been able to 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.490
 with our house the hexagonal take out 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.380
 our results what 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.130
 and that are usually obtained with 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.290
 national team and now the active at 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.930
 let it be now in confederations let's 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.630
 look for it or brazil is italy 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.340
 be it japan, whatever it is that is 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.229
 working precisely already facing 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.270
 this confederations cup in which is 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.649
 obviously preparing a lot of time 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.390
 He said that the definition was not what 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.660
 I was failing but another thing 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.880
 apart from that we do not work everything 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.459
 absolutely everything because any 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.560
 detail is different if we have put a 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.670
 little more emphasis on what is the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.040
 definition 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.800
 I'm sorry with the tranquility at the time 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.970
 to stop the opportunities but 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.160
 we also have to create the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.050
 opportunities and we have to have the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.920
 solvency to be able to have a good 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.410
 transfer of the ball then 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.770
 in all we seek to have improvement and not 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.030
 defensively because the defense does 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.580
 also that you can have an attack 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.160
 important 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.470
 my first forward is the goalkeeper of 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.180
 first defense is the front center 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.830
 thank you very much teacher for these minutes 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.930
 we will stay a little longer 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.350
 with you with you I return with you 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.350
 to the study
