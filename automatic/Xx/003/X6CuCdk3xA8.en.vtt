special episode on the entirety of my
Lego<00:00:35.579> modular<00:00:36.090> set<00:00:36.360> which<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.200> now<00:00:37.380> at<00:00:37.440> this

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
Lego modular set which is now at this

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.170 
Lego modular set which is now at this
point<00:00:37.770> colossal<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.489> fact<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> Lego<00:00:38.969> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
point colossal in fact the Lego is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.459 
point colossal in fact the Lego is
scattered<00:00:39.690> around<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> four<00:00:40.079> winds<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.379> my

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
scattered around the four winds of my

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.369 
scattered around the four winds of my
house<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.820> are<00:00:42.420> getting<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.140> all<00:00:43.230> together

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
house and so are getting it all together

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.380 
house and so are getting it all together
would<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:43.890> impossible<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.789> fact<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:45.149> all<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
would be impossible in fact like all the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.819 
would be impossible in fact like all the
Lego<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:45.750> own<00:00:45.930> together<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> same<00:00:46.680> place

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
Lego they own together in the same place

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.770 
Lego they own together in the same place
the<00:00:47.579> world<00:00:47.789> would<00:00:47.969> end<00:00:48.149> because<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.539> don't<00:00:48.690> be

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the world would end because we don't be

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.940 
the world would end because we don't be
sucked<00:00:48.989> into<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> black<00:00:49.440> hole<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.829> would

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
sucked into the black hole that would

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.709 
sucked into the black hole that would
form<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.550> today<00:00:50.730> I'm<00:00:50.910> gonna<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.300> go<00:00:51.420> through

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
form but today I'm gonna just go through

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.630 
form but today I'm gonna just go through
a<00:00:51.930> two<00:00:52.469> little<00:00:52.739> sets<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.100> I've<00:00:53.219> got<00:00:53.460> one

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
a two little sets that I've got one

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.700 
a two little sets that I've got one
that's<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.210> think<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.989> one<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.170> my<00:00:55.260> favorite

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that's I think is one of my favorite

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.959 
that's I think is one of my favorite
ever<00:00:55.800> LEGO<00:00:56.100> sets<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.940> more

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
ever LEGO sets and one that is more

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.360 
ever LEGO sets and one that is more
general<00:00:57.690> interest<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.620> we'll<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> bit<00:00:59.340> of

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
general interest and we'll have a bit of

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.250 
general interest and we'll have a bit of
a<00:00:59.489> chat<00:00:59.699> just<00:01:00.120> note<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.660> me<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.170> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
a chat just note you can see me but you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.660 
a chat just note you can see me but you
can<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.440> how<00:01:01.530> much<00:01:01.590> hammering<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.250> when<00:01:02.579> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
can see how much hammering I do when you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.549 
can see how much hammering I do when you
can't<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.359> my<00:01:03.480> reflection<00:01:03.600> maybe

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
can't see it it's in my reflection maybe

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.130 
can't see it it's in my reflection maybe
right<00:01:05.339> let's<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.180> start<00:01:06.479> now<00:01:06.659> let's<00:01:06.840> get<00:01:06.930> side

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
right let's get start now let's get side

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.770 
right let's get start now let's get side
with<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:07.500> context<00:01:08.310> because<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.630> build

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
with some context because when you build

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.630 
with some context because when you build
a<00:01:09.990> Lego<00:01:10.200> set<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:11.220> here<00:01:11.369> from<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
a Lego set so this one here from the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.070 
a Lego set so this one here from the
edge<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.090> building<00:01:12.540> for<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.900> whole

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
edge of this building for this whole

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.450 
edge of this building for this whole
building<00:01:13.110> here<00:01:13.590> Plus<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.010> blue<00:01:14.280> building

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
building here Plus this blue building

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.480 
building here Plus this blue building
here<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.180> sort<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.110> modular<00:01:16.650> building<00:01:17.100> set

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
here is sort of one modular building set

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.280 
here is sort of one modular building set
this<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.090> half<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.810> came<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.140> two

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
this is half of one this came with two

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.780 
this is half of one this came with two
that<00:01:19.530> holds<00:01:19.890> cinema<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.310> there<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.580> another

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
that holds cinema of there is another

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.700 
that holds cinema of there is another
one<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.689> I've<00:01:21.780> added<00:01:21.990> these<00:01:22.200> roads<00:01:22.530> and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
one and I've added these roads and

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.520 
one and I've added these roads and
things<00:01:22.830> extra<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.600> big<00:01:25.080> modular

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
things extra so this is one big modular

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.190 
things extra so this is one big modular
set<00:01:25.710> about<00:01:25.950> 2300<00:01:26.909> pieces<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.450> set<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.900> that

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
set about 2300 pieces in a set like that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.190 
set about 2300 pieces in a set like that
you<00:01:28.619> get<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.829> few<00:01:29.040> spare<00:01:29.460> bits<00:01:29.729> because<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:30.689> do

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you get a few spare bits because they do

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.600 
you get a few spare bits because they do
things<00:01:31.409> they<00:01:31.619> measure<00:01:31.860> out<00:01:32.070> how<00:01:32.189> much<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.430> get

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
things they measure out how much you get

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.910 
things they measure out how much you get
by<00:01:32.759> weight<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.750> um<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.140> end<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.470> getting<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.770> few

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
by weight so um you end up getting a few

anyway<00:07:08.260> the<00:07:08.410> reason<00:07:08.560> I<00:07:08.740> really<00:07:09.190> like<00:07:09.310> this<00:07:09.490> one

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:09.640 
anyway the reason I really like this one

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.480 
anyway the reason I really like this one
is<00:07:09.820> it<00:07:09.940> sort<00:07:10.210> of<00:07:10.300> built<00:07:10.540> upside<00:07:11.020> down<00:07:11.460> some<00:07:12.460> of

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490 
is it sort of built upside down some of

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.740 
is it sort of built upside down some of
the<00:07:12.610> techniques<00:07:12.940> they<00:07:13.060> use<00:07:13.210> useful<00:07:13.390> build<00:07:13.690> it

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
the techniques they use useful build it

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.210 
the techniques they use useful build it
upside<00:07:13.990> down<00:07:14.020> then<00:07:14.260> flip<00:07:14.470> it<00:07:14.530> over<00:07:14.590> and<00:07:14.890> click

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220 
upside down then flip it over and click

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.370 
upside down then flip it over and click
it<00:07:15.370> in<00:07:15.520> and<00:07:15.760> the<00:07:16.750> amount<00:07:16.960> of<00:07:16.990> times<00:07:17.200> these

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:17.380 
it in and the amount of times these

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.900 
it in and the amount of times these
wheels<00:07:17.650> pinged<00:07:18.130> off<00:07:18.280> when<00:07:18.490> I<00:07:18.550> was<00:07:18.610> doing<00:07:18.730> that

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:18.910 
wheels pinged off when I was doing that

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.530 
wheels pinged off when I was doing that
was<00:07:18.970> hilarious

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:19.540 
was hilarious

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.300 
was hilarious

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.290 
I really didn't do any research for this
