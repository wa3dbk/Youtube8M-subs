to teach you how to GT the G turn is a

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.080 
to teach you how to GT the G turn is a
pretty<00:00:09.719> basic<00:00:09.960> trick<00:00:10.580> it's<00:00:11.580> one<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.880> first

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
probably right after 180s it's not

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.570 
probably right after 180s it's not
really<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.619> practically<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.279> can't<00:00:17.460> really

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
really that practically you can't really

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.730 
really that practically you can't really
do<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.789> off<00:00:18.000> too<00:00:18.180> much<00:00:18.359> stuff<00:00:18.660> but<00:00:19.439> it's<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.619> fun

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
little trick that you can link into

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.330 
little trick that you can link into
lines<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.570> it's<00:00:21.779> just<00:00:22.130> something<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.160> you

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
lines and it's just something that you

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
to start off you're going to want to

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.200 
to start off you're going to want to
practice<00:00:27.900> getting<00:00:28.349> your<00:00:28.740> back<00:00:28.949> unweighted<00:00:29.519> so

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
practice getting your back unweighted so

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.700 
practice getting your back unweighted so
obviously<00:00:30.720> don't<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.170> be<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.380> great<00:00:31.560> at

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
obviously don't have to be that great at

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.830 
obviously don't have to be that great at
those<00:00:31.890> manuals<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.579> just<00:00:32.820> practice<00:00:33.510> bringing

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
those manuals but just practice bringing

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.959 
those manuals but just practice bringing
your<00:00:34.079> legs<00:00:34.290> up<00:00:34.469> leaning<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.860> bit<00:00:34.890> forward<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
your legs up leaning a bit forward and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.850 
your legs up leaning a bit forward and
taking<00:00:36.180> your<00:00:36.360> wheel<00:00:36.540> off<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.750> ground<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.290> not

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
taking your wheel off the ground and not

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.270 
taking your wheel off the ground and not
to<00:00:38.040> start<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> trick<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:40.739> recommend<00:00:41.190> that

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
to start of the trick so recommend that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.430 
to start of the trick so recommend that
you<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.550> 180s<00:00:42.090> down<00:00:42.300> before<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.870> do<00:00:42.989> G<00:00:43.230> turns

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
you have 180s down before you do G turns

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.529 
you have 180s down before you do G turns
because<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.399> find<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.000> quite<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> bit<00:00:45.510> easier

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
because I find it is quite a bit easier

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.990 
because I find it is quite a bit easier
to<00:00:46.050> spin<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> 180<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.100> air<00:00:47.250> than<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.969> just

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
to spin a 180 in the air than to just

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.630 
to spin a 180 in the air than to just
spin<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.539> your<00:00:48.690> front<00:00:48.870> wheel<00:00:49.280> other<00:00:50.280> people

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
spin on your front wheel other people

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.100 
spin on your front wheel other people
find<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.969> bit<00:00:51.000> different<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:51.690> that's<00:00:51.899> what

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
find it a bit different but that's what

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.260 
find it a bit different but that's what
I<00:00:52.140> recommend<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.219> then<00:00:53.340> obviously<00:00:53.430> 4G<00:00:54.059> tunes

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
I recommend and then obviously 4G tunes

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.220 
I recommend and then obviously 4G tunes
as<00:00:54.420> well<00:00:54.600> you're<00:00:54.750> going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> want<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.140> have

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.870 
try this you're probably going to fall
over<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.619> bars<00:01:34.799> because<00:01:35.369> you're<00:01:35.549> leaning<00:01:35.820> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
over the bars because you're leaning a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.940 
over the bars because you're leaning a
bit<00:01:35.909> too<00:01:36.240> far<00:01:36.450> forward<00:01:36.780> or<00:01:37.020> you're<00:01:37.680> not<00:01:37.770> going

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
bit too far forward or you're not going

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.950 
bit too far forward or you're not going
to<00:01:38.040> make<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.189> full<00:01:38.430> spin<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.420> I'd<00:01:39.540> say<00:01:39.750> after

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
to make the full spin but I'd say after

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.690 
to make the full spin but I'd say after
a<00:01:39.990> day<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.619> practice<00:01:40.890> you're<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.460> get<00:01:41.549> it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
a day of practice you're going to get it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.569 
a day of practice you're going to get it
down<00:01:42.119> every<00:01:42.450> time<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:44.009> you're<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.460> know

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
down every time and you're going to know

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.130 
down every time and you're going to know
exactly<00:01:44.700> how<00:01:45.240> high<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.630> your<00:01:45.780> wheel<00:01:45.960> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
exactly how high to get your wheel and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.990 
exactly how high to get your wheel and
how<00:01:46.860> long<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.189> takes<00:01:47.369> for<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.610> spin<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
how long it takes for you to spin the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.110 
how long it takes for you to spin the
trick

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.370 

once<00:01:53.120> you<00:01:53.210> get<00:01:53.360> better<00:01:53.540> at<00:01:53.660> this<00:01:53.870> obviously

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
once you get better at this obviously

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.200 
once you get better at this obviously
just<00:01:55.070> like<00:01:55.190> a<00:01:55.220> 180<00:01:55.580> you're<00:01:55.790> going<00:01:55.910> to<00:01:55.970> want<00:01:56.120> to

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
stop carving into it so you're just

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.250 
stop carving into it so you're just
going<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.670> go<00:01:58.790> for<00:01:59.000> your<00:01:59.090> g<00:01:59.270> turn<00:01:59.480> you're<00:02:00.140> going
