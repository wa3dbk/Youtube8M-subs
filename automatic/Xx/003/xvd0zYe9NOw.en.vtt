00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.680

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
pretty good at his baths so I thought

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.690

giving<00:00:37.500> cider<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.860> bath<00:00:38.070> might<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> little

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
