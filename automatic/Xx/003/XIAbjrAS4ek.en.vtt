can fit comfortably in here so the

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.320 
can fit comfortably in here so the
sunglasses<00:05:08.860> case<00:05:09.220> does<00:05:09.490> take<00:05:09.700> up<00:05:09.850> about<00:05:09.970> half

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
of the space in here so that's something

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.480 
of the space in here so that's something
to<00:05:13.660> keep<00:05:13.930> in<00:05:14.110> mind<00:05:14.380> if<00:05:14.530> you're<00:05:14.680> interested<00:05:15.400> in
