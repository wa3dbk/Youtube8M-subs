00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
to be a part of the group what's very

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.650 
to be a part of the group what's very
appealing<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.170> me<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:08.490> document<00:00:08.880> an<00:00:09.330> entire

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
appealing to me is to document an entire

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.039 
appealing to me is to document an entire
ecosystem<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.559> look<00:00:10.950> at<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.280> landscape<00:00:12.049> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
ecosystem to look at the landscape the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.780 
ecosystem to look at the landscape the
different<00:00:13.440> changing<00:00:13.860> moods<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.429> landscape

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
different changing moods in a landscape

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.910 
different changing moods in a landscape
but<00:00:15.540> also<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.960> different<00:00:16.320> wildlife<00:00:16.440> species

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
but also the different wildlife species

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.460 
but also the different wildlife species
from<00:00:17.340> under<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.730> water<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> bird<00:00:19.080> species

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
from under the water to the bird species

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.950 
from under the water to the bird species
and<00:00:20.189> obviously<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.850> charismatic<00:00:21.210> mammals

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
and obviously to the charismatic mammals

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.140 
and obviously to the charismatic mammals
as<00:00:22.109> well<00:00:22.289> as<00:00:22.439> reptiles<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.369> amphibians<00:00:23.939> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
as well as reptiles and amphibians and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.259 
as well as reptiles and amphibians and
so<00:00:24.930> that's<00:00:25.199> challenging<00:00:26.010> obviously<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.939> get

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
so that's challenging obviously to get

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.089 
so that's challenging obviously to get
these<00:00:27.480> many<00:00:27.720> perspectives<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.859> have<00:00:28.980> to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
these many perspectives and you have to

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.259 
these many perspectives and you have to
work<00:00:29.250> with<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.460> lot<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.760> different<00:00:29.789> equipment

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
work with a lot of different equipment

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.220 
work with a lot of different equipment
but<00:00:31.140> basically<00:00:31.980> not<00:00:32.460> let<00:00:32.700> anything<00:00:33.630> take<00:00:33.899> away

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
but basically not let anything take away

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.500 
but basically not let anything take away
from<00:00:34.680> your<00:00:34.860> creativity<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:36.030> if<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.239> need<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
from your creativity so if you need to

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.910 
from your creativity so if you need to
get<00:00:36.630> under<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.020> water<00:00:37.230> well<00:00:37.500> that's<00:00:37.680> what<00:00:37.829> you

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
get under the water well that's what you

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.510 
get under the water well that's what you
have<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.219> do<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:39.210> document<00:00:39.719> something

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
have to do to document something

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.040 
have to do to document something
generally<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:41.670> also<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.210> me<00:00:42.360> important<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
generally it's also for me important to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.430 
generally it's also for me important to
get<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> true<00:00:43.920> feeling<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.700> place<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.320> be<00:00:46.320> out

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
get a true feeling for a place to be out

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.470 
get a true feeling for a place to be out
there<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> longer<00:00:47.100> period<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.610> time<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:48.329> not

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
there for a longer period of time to not

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.240 
there for a longer period of time to not
just<00:00:48.660> kind<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.050> buzz<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> day<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.190> then

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
just kind of buzz in for a day and then

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.060 
just kind of buzz in for a day and then
leave<00:00:50.579> again<00:00:50.960> so<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:51.989> often<00:00:52.320> spent<00:00:52.590> many<00:00:52.800> weeks

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
leave again so I often spent many weeks

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.709 
leave again so I often spent many weeks
in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> same<00:00:53.550> area<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:54.030> learn<00:00:54.180> about<00:00:54.329> light

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
in the same area to learn about light

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.840 
in the same area to learn about light
learn<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.590> movements<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.129> animals<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
learn about the movements of animals and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.090 
learn about the movements of animals and
that's<00:00:57.539> that's<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.170> bigger<00:00:58.379> part<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.920> why<00:00:59.070> I

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
that's that's a bigger part of why I

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.410 
that's that's a bigger part of why I
love<00:00:59.340> nature<00:00:59.579> photography<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.539> much<00:01:01.370> now

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
love nature photography so much now

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.579 
love nature photography so much now
that's<00:01:03.420> obviously<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.870> different<00:01:04.229> concept

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
that's obviously a different concept

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.219 
that's obviously a different concept
with<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> rave<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> rave<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.750> goal<00:01:06.960> is

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
with the rave with the rave the goal is

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.469 
with the rave with the rave the goal is
to<00:01:07.260> go<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.250> place<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
to go to a place and with the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.149 
to go to a place and with the
perspectives<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.470> number<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.770> different

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
perspectives of a number of different

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.020 
perspectives of a number of different
photographers<00:01:12.350> see<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:13.650> document<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.790> very

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
photographers see or document in a very

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.539 
photographers see or document in a very
short<00:01:15.090> amount<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.689> time<00:01:15.750> what's<00:01:16.740> what's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
short amount of time what's what's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.660 
short amount of time what's what's
visible<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.299> an<00:01:18.479> area<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.250> it's<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.369> different

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
visible in an area and it's a different

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.730 
visible in an area and it's a different
concept<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:22.080> has<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.290> work<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.619> lot

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
concept there one has to work a lot

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.640 
concept there one has to work a lot
quicker<00:01:23.009> yet<00:01:24.000> everything<00:01:24.960> depends<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
quicker yet everything depends on the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.050 
quicker yet everything depends on the
environment<00:01:25.770> there<00:01:26.340> anyway<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.759> know

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
environment there anyway you know

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.050 
environment there anyway you know
animals<00:01:27.869> need<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.170> present<00:01:28.350> themselves<00:01:29.060> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
animals need to present themselves the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.390 
animals need to present themselves the
moods<00:01:30.270> need<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.720> right<00:01:30.950> what's<00:01:31.950> obviously

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
moods need to be right what's obviously

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.210 
moods need to be right what's obviously
very<00:01:32.670> important<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> me<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.720> be

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
very important to me is to be

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.580 
very important to me is to be
photographing<00:01:35.220> true<00:01:36.000> wildlife<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:37.200> using

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
photographing true wildlife not using

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.039 
photographing true wildlife not using
any<00:01:37.710> game<00:01:38.159> farm<00:01:38.460> or<00:01:38.610> captive<00:01:39.030> animals<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.600> truly

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
any game farm or captive animals I truly

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.620 
any game farm or captive animals I truly
don't<00:01:40.890> believe<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.790> think<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.420> creates

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
don't believe in that I think it creates

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.410 
don't believe in that I think it creates
a<00:01:42.899> fake<00:01:43.110> image<00:01:43.470> your<00:01:43.710> fake<00:01:43.890> picture<00:01:44.420> it's

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
a fake image your fake picture it's

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.660 
a fake image your fake picture it's
wonderful<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.829> nature<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
wonderful to be out in nature and and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.240 
wonderful to be out in nature and and
just<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.420> document<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.439> observe<00:01:49.799> what's

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
just a document and observe what's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.460 
just a document and observe what's
around<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.119> think<00:01:51.540> there's<00:01:51.930> an<00:01:52.110> extra

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
around you but I think there's an extra

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
step that's possible and that is if you

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.740 
step that's possible and that is if you
move<00:01:55.380> behind<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.890> cause<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.030> see<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.450> you

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
move behind a cause if you see in you

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.230 
move behind a cause if you see in you
know<00:01:57.869> different<00:01:58.579> possibilities<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.820> make<00:01:59.969> to

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
know different possibilities to make to

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.020 
know different possibilities to make to
conservation<00:02:00.990> work<00:02:01.710> through<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.579> visual

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
conservation work through the visual

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.980 
conservation work through the visual
through<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.899> photography<00:02:04.049> itself<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.990> with

the photography that you create you know

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.930 
the photography that you create you know
often<00:02:10.259> over<00:02:10.500> years<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.489> actually<00:02:11.610> can

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
often over years that you actually can
