00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 I'm going to give some tips today to 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.099
 who is using a child in the two 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.990
 first layers f 2 l is what people 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.780
 draws lots of draws that are the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.540
 when you are going to make a 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.820
 couple and you still do not have paris ready 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.690
 you can use these empty spaces to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
 to help you 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.350
 only the first to the second and 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.760
 really do not know the first you do not 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.750
 have none ready and can use these 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.310
 spaces 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.560
 sometimes I've got two for 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.019
 example here in this case I am now 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.980
 a little foot here had a box here 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.920
 are side by side but unlike the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.250
 I shout that you usually learn to 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.559
 solve this here it does not affect the other 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.989
 father who is ready o father is here 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.300
 It's not ready that way that fits. 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.559
 in mind what you do it here it spins 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.980
 Twice Fits Rotates and you continue 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.850
 rotating to engage the rear wheel and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.530
 turns to and is not ready and there 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.879
 Do you want to fit this one? 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.000
 worry behind there 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.400
 right and down here to take two turns 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.250
 back there in cash already serves attended the birth and 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.020
 back and eventually moved back here but 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.810
 no matter who is not ready yet 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.960
 So it's things like that. 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.549
 one may have already thought it is not so 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.830
 complicated to find out but I'm going to 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.680
 others , sometimes we do not think 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.360
 only in very good cases that you need 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.579
 movement only to fit the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.250
 dad for example that case is 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.780
 very cool already playing here in place and 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.030
 I have to fit only the make of 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.240
 second tier has a really cool way 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.430
 if you have that empty back space 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.259
 here if you have not yet made this father of 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.579
 the other side is also opposite 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.799
 you can use a very good sequence 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.200
 which is the following you will rotate two 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.159
 times here on the right looks that 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.020
 party is ready would be here too 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:02.570
 We came here today are twice the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.590
 right and then the two turns up here 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.890
 because I'll take it off 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.200
 in this piece I want to put here 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.120
 swivel the two from top to bottom in case to piece 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.140
 here o 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.420
 and then what happens on that platform 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.280
 it was free going to happen 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.049
 Look what I gave him here. 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.269
 It's up but it's not even ready 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:28.019
 There is a problem and then you're ready and back. 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.790
 the two up here looks okay and then says 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.690
 Do not mess with this one here. 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.989
 nor the 116 in new attack on the front I want 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.140
 down and back there is open and empty 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:44.129
 're so cute twice gil the two 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.109
 headlights on the cachopo 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.299
 back on the right another legal case that 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.920
 also only has five movements is only the 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.400
 next I'll need to pair 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.709
 from behind and this front father still 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.290
 It's not ready, I have this 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.909
 freedom ahead and party 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.950
 here on top of the orange 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:08.879
 position here and that's what you can do 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.859
 in many ways, it is not 100 'mess' 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.349
 rest now if you have that freedom 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.489
 that in front to use this piece that 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.530
 you can do 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:23.190
 Look, you're going to spin it twice here. 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.639
 right side will spin once over 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.400
 here at anti-clock to bring the 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:33.299
 singer will accompany at the time the middle was 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.700
 down there to demand once here that 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:39.900
 this corner happens now I can 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.150
 join with the crosspiece from which it came 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.989
 I would also like to join there 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.829
 I together everything looks here and stealing and 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.459
 kill 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:53.760
 That moves these two here, but if he 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:58.709
 he needs to worry 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:00.060
 Okay , look again, I'll try until 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.480
 see those who are here have two of the 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.349
 navy going from lahej then again 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.109
 this so that this position also 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.780
 the colors are alternated here above me 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:16.320
 I want to fit back there twice 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.590
 to bring the crosspiece turn once 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.950
 up here to fit the corner with the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.969
 part of the cross the middle came here 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.349
 boxing and back there back 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:31.819
 remember that cool green way 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.819
 blue orange has also changed
