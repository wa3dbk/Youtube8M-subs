00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:03.290

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.290
 newcomer table of the year 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:13.829

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.829

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.339

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.890
 ticket alone 6 0 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.290
 but look 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.640
 where are our central defenders 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.000
 that's all 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.200
 after all, no danger already 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.380
 physically bards bardo 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.250
 tutor experience not 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.240

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.110
 no way so abroad sergei 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990
 Ignashevich once more 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.990
 in 2008 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.120
 one of the species 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.180
 and really kind of ordinary embarrassed his 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.900
 talk to drill published 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.840

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.190
 After all, Ash Sheikh noted that next to him 10 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.330

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.850
 attack on lj and almost scored if just 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.240
 rub 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 Berezovsky saved the team 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.190
 Pavlyuchenkov of us saves the team but 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.230
 Berezovsky did everything he could 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.250
 saw very clearly 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.780
 they are determined 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.050
 motion to center field showed 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.700
 to his compatriot 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.070
 plan 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.240
 the referee that the ball crossed the line from 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.340
 offside no 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.650
 of course of course the most day 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.650
 Berezovsky saving 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.680
 after a quick attack instantly 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.610
 let may in this match now 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.120

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.840
 clear transfer 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.859
 Semshova Semshov hangs the board 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:10.879
 brilliant combinations 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.319
 brilliant victory 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.179

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.309

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.309

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.929
 Assist I'm sitting in today's match 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:34.419
 well, finally it was in the city 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:36.959
 but take a step forward but 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.439
 defender 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.439
 to make artificial offside 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:46.009
 it all started with the fact that 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.009
 otherwise everything is fine 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.069
 through semshov semshov 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.569
 recall their rooms 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.569
 what it was 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.309
 is a penalty 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.309
 let's say since the marmot didn't 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.169
 Ovsepyan in politics went to the end 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.169
 from the native for himself gave a shoulder 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.439
 and Pavlyuchenko crossed himself 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:19.239
 Avenue 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.279
 I remove all 3 x 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.769
 those trick of the novel Pavlyuchenko 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.819
 outplayed outwitted the novel of Berezovsky 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.409
 Berezovsky made a move 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.929
 Pavlyuchenko struck 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:33.279
 exactly centered and we see three balls in three 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.699
 matches 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.699
 to be quite accurate three balls 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.909

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.279
 Pavlyuchenko brings the score to scored goals 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:50.979
