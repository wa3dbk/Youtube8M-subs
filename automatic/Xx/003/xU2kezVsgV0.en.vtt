half<00:02:06.009> away<00:02:06.459> into<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.149> cucumber<00:02:07.959> and<00:02:08.200> then<00:02:09.190> we

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
half away into the cucumber and then we

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.970 
half away into the cucumber and then we
twisted<00:02:09.819> like<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:10.410> when<00:02:11.410> you<00:02:11.530> pull<00:02:11.860> it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
twisted like that when you pull it

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.720 
twisted like that when you pull it
slightly<00:02:12.310> apart<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:15.099> I<00:02:15.220> thought<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:15.640> were

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730
