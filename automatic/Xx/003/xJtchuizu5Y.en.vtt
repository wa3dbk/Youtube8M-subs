00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.099 

I<00:00:12.320> think<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.160> Derby<00:00:14.690> Arsenal<00:00:15.690> Tottenham

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
I think is the Derby Arsenal Tottenham

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.650 
I think is the Derby Arsenal Tottenham
when<00:00:16.350> we<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.160> losing<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.699> Neela<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.210> halftime

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
when we was losing to Neela a halftime

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.830 
when we was losing to Neela a halftime
and<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.380> came<00:00:19.800> back<00:00:19.830> winning<00:00:20.430> free<00:00:20.640> -<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.090> think

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
and we came back winning free - I think

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.240 
and we came back winning free - I think
that's<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.619> best<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.250> best<00:00:23.519> memory<00:00:28.250> mode

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
that's the the best the best memory mode

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.510 
that's the the best the best memory mode
which<00:00:29.599> you<00:00:30.599> come<00:00:30.990> with<00:00:31.140> which<00:00:31.289> simply<00:00:32.160> because

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
which you come with which simply because

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.540 
which you come with which simply because
he<00:00:32.640> could<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.270> anything<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.100> it<00:00:35.100> was<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> real

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
he could do anything and it was a real

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.860 
he could do anything and it was a real
joy<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.660> pleasure<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.170> play<00:00:37.530> an<00:00:37.860> older<00:00:38.399> man

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.029 

the<00:00:42.870> slowest<00:00:43.640> probably<00:00:45.170> charge<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.320> new<00:00:46.500> gate<00:00:46.739> I

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the slowest probably charge a new gate I

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.130 
the slowest probably charge a new gate I
think<00:00:47.420> yeah<00:00:48.469> because<00:00:50.449> yeah<00:00:51.449> he<00:00:51.629> was<00:00:51.809> released

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
think yeah because yeah he was released

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.529 
think yeah because yeah he was released
for<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.410> very<00:00:52.620> playable<00:00:52.949> race<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:56.149> Howie

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
for the very playable race for Howie

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:06.030 
for the very playable race for Howie
yeah<00:00:58.820> definitely

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
technically with the body is so hard to
