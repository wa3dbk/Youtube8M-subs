flowing into the country nobody knows
the<00:00:51.449> answer<00:00:51.690> will<00:00:51.719> find<00:00:52.110> out<00:00:52.230> when<00:00:52.350> China<00:00:52.649> is

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the answer will find out when China is

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.290 
the answer will find out when China is
ready<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.100> tell<00:00:53.280> us<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.760> China<00:00:53.969> has<00:00:54.149> its

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
ready to tell us so China has its

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.510 
ready to tell us so China has its

reserves in gold about 1.6 percent do

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.709 
reserves in gold about 1.6 percent do
you<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.670> any<00:00:56.789> estimation<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.390> what<00:00:57.600> they

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
you have any estimation of what they

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.060 
you have any estimation of what they
might<00:00:57.750> raise<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.559> they<00:00:58.710> were<00:00:58.770> buying

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
might raise it to if they were buying

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.610 
might raise it to if they were buying
three<00:00:59.399> percent<00:00:59.820> two<00:01:00.059> percent<00:01:00.510> 100%<00:01:01.469> just

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
three percent two percent 100% just

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.280 
three percent two percent 100% just
seems<00:01:01.770> totally<00:01:02.190> oh<00:01:02.750> I<00:01:03.750> don't<00:01:03.840> think<00:01:04.019> anybody

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
seems totally oh I don't think anybody

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.299 
seems totally oh I don't think anybody
would<00:01:04.650> suggest<00:01:04.799> one<00:01:05.070> hundred<00:01:05.280> percent

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
would suggest one hundred percent

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.280 
would suggest one hundred percent
probably<00:01:05.790> not<00:01:05.909> even<00:01:06.180> me<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.390> I'm<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> fairly

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
probably not even me and I'm a fairly

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.070 
probably not even me and I'm a fairly
optimistic<00:01:07.439> person<00:01:08.130> about<00:01:08.460> gold<00:01:08.930> but<00:01:09.930> i<00:01:09.960> think

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
optimistic person about gold but i think

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
optimistic person about gold but i think
that<00:01:10.320> research<00:01:10.830> suggests<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.640> lot<00:01:11.880> more

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
that research suggests that a lot more

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.820 
that research suggests that a lot more
than<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.450> point<00:01:12.750> whatever<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.380> present

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
than one point whatever it is present

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.620 
than one point whatever it is present
right<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.100> would<00:01:14.520> make<00:01:14.700> sense<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.150> them<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
right now would make sense for them and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.020 
right now would make sense for them and
certainly<00:01:16.409> there's<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> lot<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.030> academic

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
certainly there's a lot of academic

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.330 
certainly there's a lot of academic
interest<00:01:18.450> both<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.290> china<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> rest

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
interest both in china and in the rest

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.190 
interest both in china and in the rest
of<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.549> world<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.330> thinks<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:21.840> ought<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
of the world that thinks they ought to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.859 
of the world that thinks they ought to
own<00:01:22.350> maybe<00:01:23.070> somewhere<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.790> round<00:01:24.630> ten

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
own maybe somewhere in the round ten

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.390 
own maybe somewhere in the round ten
percent<00:01:25.200> or<00:01:25.350> something<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.830> kind<00:01:26.130> i

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
percent or something of that kind i

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.980 
percent or something of that kind i
think<00:01:26.790> basically<00:01:27.000> everybody's<00:01:27.570> agreed<00:01:27.840> they

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
think basically everybody's agreed they

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.539 
think basically everybody's agreed they
should<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> lot<00:01:28.590> more<00:01:28.799> than<00:01:29.009> they<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.189> have

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
should have a lot more than they do have

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.690 
should have a lot more than they do have
right<00:01:30.090> now<00:01:30.299> especially<00:01:30.600> given<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.490> level<00:01:32.490> of

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
right now especially given the level of
