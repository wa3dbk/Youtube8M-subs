alright<00:00:01.199> now<00:00:01.500> we're<00:00:01.709> going<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:01.890> look<00:00:02.010> at

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
alright now we're going to look at

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.880 
alright now we're going to look at
project<00:00:02.760> all<00:00:03.049> and<00:00:04.049> I'm<00:00:04.230> going<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.440> kind<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.680> run

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
project all and I'm going to kind of run

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.330 
project all and I'm going to kind of run
through<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.220> same<00:00:05.430> thing<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.790> did<00:00:05.850> earlier

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
through the same thing I did earlier

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.780 
through the same thing I did earlier
just<00:00:08.340> for<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:09.030> brief<00:00:09.840> example<00:00:10.519> I'm<00:00:11.519> going<00:00:11.610> to

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
just for a brief example I'm going to

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.460 
just for a brief example I'm going to
take<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.330> Chris<00:00:13.940> ring<00:00:14.940> here<00:00:15.240> make<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.260> poly

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
take and Chris ring here make it a poly

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.260 
take and Chris ring here make it a poly
mesh<00:00:16.740> clone<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.480> then<00:00:18.480> go<00:00:18.750> into<00:00:19.970> let's<00:00:20.970> see

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
mesh clone it and then go into let's see

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.529 
mesh clone it and then go into let's see
a<00:00:22.050> sphere<00:00:22.710> sure<00:00:25.519> make<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> poly<00:00:26.820> mesh<00:00:27.060> clone<00:00:27.390> it

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
a sphere sure make a poly mesh clone it

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.130 
a sphere sure make a poly mesh clone it
go<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> sub<00:00:28.859> tools<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:30.170> let's<00:00:31.430> mount<00:00:33.140> by

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
go in the sub tools and let's mount by

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.920 
go in the sub tools and let's mount by
appending<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:37.700> ring<00:00:40.610> okay<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.879> then<00:00:42.840> I'm

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
appending the ring okay and then I'm

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.160 
appending the ring okay and then I'm
just<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> merge<00:00:43.500> down<00:00:44.570> well<00:00:45.570> wait<00:00:45.870> now

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
just going to merge down well wait now

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.709 
just going to merge down well wait now
i'm<00:00:46.320> going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> move<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> ring<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.070> little<00:00:47.190> bit

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
i'm going to move the ring a little bit

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:59.260 
i'm going to move the ring a little bit
let's<00:00:48.719> move<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.170> ring

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:07.880 

better<00:00:59.900> to<00:01:00.140> move<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.470> ball<00:01:00.500> probably

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.330 

alright<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.880> sometimes<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.390> did<00:01:09.540> before<00:01:10.340> so

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
alright so sometimes I did before so

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.160 
alright so sometimes I did before so
it's<00:01:11.460> very<00:01:11.670> simple<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.530> it<00:01:13.530> will<00:01:13.680> merge<00:01:13.890> down

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.070 

okay<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.800> time<00:01:20.159> however<00:01:20.780> i'm<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
okay this time however i'm going to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:34.750 
okay this time however i'm going to
ramesh<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.479> lower<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.750> resolution

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.090 

24

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
24

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.940 
24
so<00:01:37.640> I<00:01:37.700> unclick<00:01:38.510> tall<00:01:38.750> these<00:01:38.930> that<00:01:39.409> way<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.920> just

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
so I unclick tall these that way it just

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.390 
so I unclick tall these that way it just
Ramesh's<00:01:40.729> onto<00:01:41.060> itself<00:01:43.479> so<00:01:44.479> what<00:01:45.170> you<00:01:45.860> can<00:01:46.070> do

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
Ramesh's onto itself so what you can do

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.289 
Ramesh's onto itself so what you can do
with<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:46.850> is<00:01:47.619> make<00:01:48.619> sure<00:01:48.650> that<00:01:49.369> only<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.970> two

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
with this is make sure that only the two

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.430 
with this is make sure that only the two
tools<00:01:50.690> are<00:01:51.250> showing<00:01:52.250> it's<00:01:53.210> on<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.570> tool<00:01:54.049> that

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
tools are showing it's on the tool that

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.539 
tools are showing it's on the tool that
you<00:01:54.560> want<00:01:54.799> to<00:01:54.920> project<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:57.220> then<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:58.280> was<00:01:58.490> just

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
you want to project and then I was just

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.820 
you want to project and then I was just
going<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:58.940> hit<00:01:59.119> project<00:01:59.690> all<00:02:01.930> so<00:02:02.930> what<00:02:03.409> happens

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
going to hit project all so what happens

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.899 
going to hit project all so what happens
now<00:02:04.070> is<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.720> have<00:02:05.720> a<00:02:05.960> low<00:02:06.409> res<00:02:06.909> representation

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
now is I have a low res representation

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.460 
now is I have a low res representation
of<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.929> shape<00:02:09.259> that<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:10.100> made<00:02:10.369> up<00:02:10.630> top<00:02:11.630> so<00:02:12.350> these

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
of the shape that I made up top so these

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.770 
of the shape that I made up top so these
are<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.709> two<00:02:12.830> primitives<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:13.670> this<00:02:14.569> is<00:02:14.750> a

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
are the two primitives and this is a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.550 
are the two primitives and this is a
solid<00:02:15.290> chunk<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:16.390> polygonal<00:02:17.390> matter<00:02:17.810> now<00:02:18.319> and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
solid chunk of polygonal matter now and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.809 
solid chunk of polygonal matter now and
low<00:02:19.340> res<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:21.140> now<00:02:21.290> i<00:02:21.319> can<00:02:21.440> divide<00:02:21.950> up<00:02:22.220> now<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
low res so now i can divide up now the

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.990 
low res so now i can divide up now the
topology<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.600> awful<00:02:23.989> so<00:02:24.410> even<00:02:25.190> if<00:02:25.580> i<00:02:25.819> go

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
topology is awful so even if i go

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.059 
topology is awful so even if i go
dividing<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:28.760> might<00:02:28.970> work<00:02:29.150> out<00:02:29.330> pretty<00:02:29.540> good

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
dividing it might work out pretty good

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.120 
dividing it might work out pretty good
not<00:02:31.069> too<00:02:31.250> bad<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:32.690> there<00:02:33.080> we<00:02:33.200> go<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.739> ability

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
not too bad so there we go the ability

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.050 
not too bad so there we go the ability
to<00:02:35.110> take<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.140> match<00:02:36.880> project<00:02:37.880> all<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.860> then

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
to take a match project all and then

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.840 
to take a match project all and then
divide<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.090> up<00:02:41.299> with<00:02:41.980> pretty<00:02:42.980> good<00:02:43.160> results<00:02:43.700> so

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
divide it up with pretty good results so

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.630 
divide it up with pretty good results so
now<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.810> can<00:02:45.170> make<00:02:45.350> normal<00:02:46.160> maps<00:02:46.370> and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
now you can make normal maps and

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.039 
now you can make normal maps and
everything<00:02:46.970> else<00:02:47.150> because<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:47.600> can<00:02:47.750> go<00:02:47.900> down

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
everything else because you can go down

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.610 
everything else because you can go down
to<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.320> lower<00:02:48.590> res<00:02:48.950> all<00:02:49.790> right<00:02:50.000> enjoy<00:02:50.239> on<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:51.590> the
