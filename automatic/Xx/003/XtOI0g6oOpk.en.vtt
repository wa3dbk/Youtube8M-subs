RB<00:01:19.350> 2<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.770> all<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:19.950> stuff<00:01:20.119> he<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.570> okay<00:01:22.080> or<00:01:22.110> at

that<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> would<00:01:24.479> say<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.990> my<00:01:25.200> only<00:01:25.380> gripe<00:01:25.619> about

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740

that I would say is my only gripe about
him<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.939> supernova<00:01:27.479> does<00:01:27.689> not<00:01:27.869> have

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
him is that the supernova does not have

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.620 
him is that the supernova does not have
as<00:01:28.290> big<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.740> an<00:01:28.950> explosion<00:01:29.670> or<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:30.180> big<00:01:30.600> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
as big as an explosion or as big a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.200 
as big as an explosion or as big a
somewhat<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.439> an<00:01:31.530> impact<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.100> guess<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
somewhat of an impact I guess as the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.880 
somewhat of an impact I guess as the
actual<00:01:33.570> other<00:01:33.780> stuff<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.710> has<00:01:34.799> been

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
actual other stuff now this has been

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.440 
actual other stuff now this has been
kind<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.250> problem<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.640> I've<00:01:35.759> had<00:01:35.909> since<00:01:35.939> I

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
kind of a problem that I've had since I

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.780 
kind of a problem that I've had since I
saw<00:01:36.869> go<00:01:37.110> could<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> spirit<00:01:37.770> bomb<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.579> that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
saw go could do the spirit bomb for that

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.240 
saw go could do the spirit bomb for that
we've<00:01:39.299> gone<00:01:39.600> already<00:01:40.049> call<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.380> V<00:01:40.710> jump<00:01:40.979> video

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
we've gone already call it V jump video

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.450 
we've gone already call it V jump video
and<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:42.030> thought<00:01:43.020> why<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.439> there<00:01:43.920> not<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
and I thought why is there not really a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.240 
and I thought why is there not really a
big<00:01:44.759> explosion<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.439> spirit<00:01:46.829> bomb<00:01:46.979> or

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
big explosion for the spirit bomb or

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.730 
big explosion for the spirit bomb or
anything<00:01:48.030> else<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.899> supernova<00:01:49.409> still

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
anything else and the supernova still

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.469 
anything else and the supernova still
seems<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.220> not<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.640> any<00:01:50.820> sort<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.180> explosion

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
seems to not have any sort of explosion

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.929 
seems to not have any sort of explosion
on<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.110> thought<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.130> would<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.850> it

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
on it and I thought that it would but it

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.249 
on it and I thought that it would but it
doesn't<00:01:54.210> really<00:01:54.299> seem<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.720> or<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.049> least<00:01:55.170> we

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
doesn't really seem to or at least we

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.410 
doesn't really seem to or at least we
don't<00:01:55.439> see<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.340> was<00:01:56.820> hoping<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.180> that

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
don't see it and I was hoping that that

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.510 
don't see it and I was hoping that that
sort<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.689> thing<00:01:57.750> would<00:01:58.140> happen<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.310> seems

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
sort of thing would happen but it seems

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.130 
sort of thing would happen but it seems
like<00:01:59.579> it's<00:01:59.790> not<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.180> hopefully<00:02:00.810> they<00:02:00.930> iron

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
like it's not so hopefully they iron

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.749 
like it's not so hopefully they iron
that<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.409> before<00:02:01.649> release<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.219> just<00:02:02.399> want<00:02:02.579> to

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that out before release I just want to

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.429 
that out before release I just want to
some<00:02:03.240> sort<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.540> tiny<00:02:03.810> exploring<00:02:04.170> there<00:02:04.350> have

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
some sort of tiny exploring there have

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.929 
some sort of tiny exploring there have
to<00:02:04.530> be<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.649> huge<00:02:04.890> explosion<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.640> has<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.880> be

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
to be a huge explosion it just has to be

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.880 
to be a huge explosion it just has to be
somewhat<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.689> an<00:02:06.780> explosion<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.350> know<00:02:07.469> that

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
somewhat of an explosion so I know that

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.249 
somewhat of an explosion so I know that
it<00:02:08.039> hit<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.459> yeah<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.420> looks<00:02:09.660> awesome<00:02:09.840> so

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
it hit and yeah it looks awesome so

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.050 
it hit and yeah it looks awesome so
honestly<00:02:10.950> that's<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.730> all<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:11.879> got<00:02:12.000> to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
honestly that's really all you got to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.670 
honestly that's really all you got to
say<00:02:12.090> about<00:02:12.150> first<00:02:12.480> form<00:02:12.690> prese<00:02:12.930> future

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
say about first form prese future

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.770 
say about first form prese future
trunks<00:02:13.920> uh<00:02:14.069> he's<00:02:14.489> kind<00:02:14.519> of<00:02:14.849> different<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.540> I

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
trunks uh he's kind of different so I

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.020 
trunks uh he's kind of different so I
thought<00:02:16.439> that<00:02:16.500> future<00:02:17.310> trunks<00:02:17.459> would<00:02:17.700> just<00:02:17.909> be

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
thought that future trunks would just be

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.599 
thought that future trunks would just be
a<00:02:18.060> skin<00:02:18.450> or<00:02:18.629> at<00:02:18.840> least<00:02:19.079> a<00:02:19.260> skin<00:02:19.829> for<00:02:20.250> future

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
a skin or at least a skin for future

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.399 
a skin or at least a skin for future
trunks<00:02:20.790> would<00:02:21.120> be<00:02:21.359> time<00:02:21.840> for<00:02:22.019> chill<00:02:22.170> jumps

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
trunks would be time for chill jumps

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.750 
trunks would be time for chill jumps
because<00:02:22.500> they<00:02:22.769> are<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.040> same<00:02:23.189> person<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.730> I

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
because they are the same person so I

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.890 
because they are the same person so I
would<00:02:23.909> assume<00:02:24.000> they<00:02:24.540> would<00:02:24.629> have<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.870> same

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
would assume they would have the same

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.750 
would assume they would have the same
move<00:02:25.290> set<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:25.920> seems<00:02:26.159> like<00:02:26.340> they<00:02:26.489> don't

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
move set but it seems like they don't

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.039 
move set but it seems like they don't
which<00:02:27.239> is<00:02:27.450> something<00:02:27.599> that<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.870> actually

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
which is something that I actually

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.920 
which is something that I actually
thought<00:02:28.920> would<00:02:29.549> be<00:02:29.579> different<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.659> guess

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
thought would be different but I guess

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.629 
thought would be different but I guess
that<00:02:31.200> they<00:02:31.349> have<00:02:31.769> different<00:02:31.980> move<00:02:32.219> sets<00:02:32.430> one

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
that they have different move sets one

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.610 
that they have different move sets one
obviously<00:02:33.060> with<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.569> sort<00:02:33.870> only<00:02:34.230> using<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
obviously with the sort only using the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.610 
obviously with the sort only using the
sword<00:02:34.829> and<00:02:35.099> one<00:02:35.609> not<00:02:35.879> but<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.959> seems<00:02:37.260> like<00:02:37.439> they

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
sword and one not but it seems like they

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.379 
sword and one not but it seems like they
don't<00:02:37.889> have<00:02:38.159> the<00:02:38.579> same<00:02:38.790> moves<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.209> mainly

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
don't have the same moves that mainly

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.240 
don't have the same moves that mainly
only<00:02:39.629> because<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.739> seems<00:02:40.950> like<00:02:41.099> they

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
only because is that it seems like they

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.479 
only because is that it seems like they
had<00:02:41.790> different<00:02:42.510> actual<00:02:43.019> like<00:02:43.319> parts<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
had different actual like parts in the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.629 
had different actual like parts in the
roster<00:02:44.909> because<00:02:45.180> before<00:02:45.629> I<00:02:45.689> saw<00:02:46.340> time<00:02:47.340> patrol

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
roster because before I saw time patrol

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.670 
roster because before I saw time patrol
trunks<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.209> roster<00:02:48.689> but<00:02:48.870> now<00:02:49.049> I'm<00:02:49.349> seeing

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
trunks in the roster but now I'm seeing

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.559 
trunks in the roster but now I'm seeing
future<00:02:50.189> trunks<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.609> this<00:02:50.790> roster<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.299> I<00:02:51.359> don't

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
future trunks in this roster so I don't

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.569 
future trunks in this roster so I don't
know<00:02:51.659> if<00:02:51.870> he's<00:02:52.169> actually<00:02:52.409> a<00:02:52.560> skin<00:02:52.919> or<00:02:53.129> they're

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
know if he's actually a skin or they're

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:54.679 
know if he's actually a skin or they're
just<00:02:53.609> hiding<00:02:53.879> mat<00:02:54.239> or<00:02:54.359> something<00:02:54.389> like<00:02:54.629> that

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
just hiding mat or something like that

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.420 
just hiding mat or something like that
but<00:02:54.989> if<00:02:55.200> he's<00:02:55.530> just<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.829> skin<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.310> no

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
but if he's just a skin I have no

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.649 
but if he's just a skin I have no
problem<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.849> because<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.180> know<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.569> the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
that was sort of i equipped one on him

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.960 
that was sort of i equipped one on him
it<00:03:31.889> kind<00:03:32.129> of<00:03:32.159> be<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.280> little<00:03:32.310> bit<00:03:32.549> hard<00:03:32.760> though

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
it kind of be a little bit hard though

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.689 
it kind of be a little bit hard though
because<00:03:33.000> if<00:03:33.449> you<00:03:33.930> chose<00:03:34.370> chunks<00:03:35.370> his<00:03:35.489> fighting

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
because if you chose chunks his fighting

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.189 
because if you chose chunks his fighting
style<00:03:35.849> right<00:03:36.180> Future<00:03:36.479> Trunks<00:03:36.599> fighting<00:03:36.989> style

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
style right Future Trunks fighting style

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.520 
style right Future Trunks fighting style
and<00:03:37.319> his<00:03:37.979> fighting<00:03:38.519> style<00:03:38.699> is<00:03:39.060> very<00:03:39.569> very<00:03:40.109> very

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
and his fighting style is very very very

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.520 
and his fighting style is very very very
involved<00:03:41.340> with<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.669> sword<00:03:41.909> so<00:03:42.509> if<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.259> did

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
involved with the sword so if you did

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.920 
involved with the sword so if you did
that<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:44.009> would<00:03:44.129> kind<00:03:44.489> of<00:03:44.639> not<00:03:45.269> work<00:03:45.509> if<00:03:45.720> you

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
that it would kind of not work if you

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.319 
that it would kind of not work if you
didn't<00:03:46.259> have<00:03:46.349> the<00:03:46.470> sword<00:03:46.709> equipped<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.250> said<00:03:48.239> I

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
didn't have the sword equipped I said I

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.640 
didn't have the sword equipped I said I
mean<00:03:48.509> like<00:03:48.659> if<00:03:48.780> someone<00:03:49.019> didn't<00:03:49.259> have<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:49.470> sort

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
mean like if someone didn't have to sort

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.960 
mean like if someone didn't have to sort
of<00:03:49.709> cooked<00:03:49.859> how<00:03:50.009> would<00:03:50.159> they<00:03:50.310> attack<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.879> they

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
of cooked how would they attack and they

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.550 
of cooked how would they attack and they
chose<00:03:51.479> you<00:03:51.659> to<00:03:51.689> chunk<00:03:51.989> this<00:03:52.109> thing<00:03:52.259> would<00:03:52.409> they

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
chose you to chunk this thing would they

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.740 
chose you to chunk this thing would they
not<00:03:52.859> allow<00:03:53.129> you<00:03:53.159> to<00:03:53.400> select<00:03:53.759> it<00:03:54.060> if<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.359> don't

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
not allow you to select it if you don't

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.599 
not allow you to select it if you don't
have<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:54.959> sword<00:03:55.290> or<00:03:55.560> what<00:03:55.949> would<00:03:56.069> happen<00:03:56.400> there

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
have a sword or what would happen there

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.849 
have a sword or what would happen there
I<00:03:56.790> think<00:03:57.479> that<00:03:57.599> that<00:03:57.810> would<00:03:58.079> be<00:03:58.139> kind<00:03:58.530> of<00:03:58.650> tough

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
I think that that would be kind of tough

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.099 
I think that that would be kind of tough
to<00:03:58.919> actually<00:03:59.549> do<00:03:59.729> but<00:04:00.329> you<00:04:00.540> know<00:04:00.659> that's<00:04:00.870> just

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
to actually do but you know that's just

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.449 
to actually do but you know that's just
me<00:04:01.259> I'm<00:04:01.470> not<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.620> game<00:04:01.829> developer<00:04:01.979> I<00:04:02.220> don't<00:04:02.400> know

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
me I'm not a game developer I don't know

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.249 
me I'm not a game developer I don't know
how<00:04:02.549> hard<00:04:02.819> it<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.090> but<00:04:03.389> you<00:04:03.599> know<00:04:03.870> that's<00:04:04.139> just

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:04.259 
how hard it is but you know that's just

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:05.899 
how hard it is but you know that's just
all<00:04:04.470> i<00:04:04.500> gotta<00:04:04.680> say<00:04:04.709> about<00:04:04.919> that<00:04:05.040> now<00:04:05.519> next

really<00:04:17.190> see<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.489> much<00:04:17.549> else<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:18.030> em<00:04:18.150> but<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:18.900> do

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
really see that much else of em but I do

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.949 
really see that much else of em but I do
think<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:20.299> actually<00:04:21.299> we<00:04:21.359> did<00:04:21.509> see<00:04:21.719> some<00:04:21.750> of

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
think that actually we did see some of

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.620 
think that actually we did see some of
him<00:04:22.139> at<00:04:22.260> e3<00:04:22.440> but<00:04:23.190> honestly<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.090> think<00:04:24.270> that

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
him at e3 but honestly I think that

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.370 
him at e3 but honestly I think that
Super<00:04:24.840> Saiyan<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.139> Goku<00:04:25.409> is<00:04:25.440> really<00:04:26.130> real

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
Super Saiyan to Goku is really real

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.140 
Super Saiyan to Goku is really real
similar<00:04:26.620> Super<00:04:26.920> Saiyan<00:04:27.100> Goku<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.580> honestly

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
similar Super Saiyan Goku and honestly

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.030 
similar Super Saiyan Goku and honestly
it's<00:04:28.600> it's<00:04:28.960> not<00:04:29.200> that<00:04:29.380> big<00:04:29.500> of<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:29.650> deal<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:29.830> me

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
it's it's not that big of a deal to me

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.740 
it's it's not that big of a deal to me
because<00:04:30.130> Super<00:04:30.580> Saiyan<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:31.000> Goku<00:04:31.360> out<00:04:31.540> mean

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
that's kind of the skipped form for Goku

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.310 
that's kind of the skipped form for Goku
even<00:04:34.000> though<00:04:34.090> he<00:04:34.240> did<00:04:34.420> use<00:04:34.660> it<00:04:34.810> in<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.020> majin

move<00:04:48.040> sets<00:04:48.310> or<00:04:48.490> like<00:04:48.880> well<00:04:49.150> at<00:04:49.420> least<00:04:49.600> the

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
attacks like they did the Buddha case

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.310 
attacks like they did the Buddha case
series<00:04:51.580> then<00:04:52.090> that<00:04:52.390> would<00:04:52.510> be<00:04:52.540> somewhat<00:04:52.990> okay

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
series then that would be somewhat okay

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.200 
series then that would be somewhat okay
to<00:04:53.620> have<00:04:53.770> certain<00:04:54.100> moves<00:04:54.430> for<00:04:54.640> super<00:04:55.030> saiyan

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
to have certain moves for super saiyan

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.080 
to have certain moves for super saiyan
goku<00:04:55.450> like<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:56.340> meteor<00:04:57.340> moves<00:04:57.640> that<00:04:57.820> he<00:04:57.910> has

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
goku like the meteor moves that he has

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.450 
goku like the meteor moves that he has
the<00:04:58.390> meteor<00:04:58.990> physical<00:04:59.590> attack<00:04:59.830> moves<00:05:00.100> if<00:05:00.310> he

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
the meteor physical attack moves if he

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.710 
the meteor physical attack moves if he
had<00:05:00.610> some<00:05:00.850> of<00:05:00.970> those<00:05:01.060> maybe<00:05:01.390> that<00:05:01.600> would<00:05:01.690> be

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
had some of those maybe that would be

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.480 
had some of those maybe that would be
amazing<00:05:01.960> because<00:05:02.500> you<00:05:02.830> know<00:05:02.920> those<00:05:03.250> in

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
amazing because you know those in

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.980 
amazing because you know those in
xenoverse<00:05:03.790> would<00:05:04.030> work<00:05:04.210> pretty<00:05:04.360> well<00:05:04.510> even

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
xenoverse would work pretty well even

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.780 
xenoverse would work pretty well even
though<00:05:05.140> it's<00:05:05.470> all<00:05:05.650> in<00:05:05.830> real<00:05:05.950> time<00:05:06.160> still<00:05:06.640> could

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
though it's all in real time still could

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.870 
though it's all in real time still could
work<00:05:06.940> really<00:05:06.970> well<00:05:07.180> sort<00:05:07.780> of<00:05:07.840> like<00:05:07.930> how<00:05:08.170> his

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
work really well sort of like how his

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.000 
work really well sort of like how his
super<00:05:09.880> saiyan<00:05:10.150> 3<00:05:10.180> meteor<00:05:10.720> move<00:05:10.930> or<00:05:11.230> his

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
super saiyan 3 meteor move or his

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.010 
super saiyan 3 meteor move or his
physical<00:05:12.430> move<00:05:12.610> actually<00:05:13.210> worked<00:05:13.390> in<00:05:13.540> Raging

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
physical move actually worked in Raging

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.450 
physical move actually worked in Raging
Blast<00:05:14.110> even<00:05:14.440> though<00:05:14.530> most<00:05:14.830> of<00:05:14.980> it<00:05:15.100> was

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
Blast even though most of it was

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.970 
Blast even though most of it was
actually<00:05:16.330> real<00:05:16.810> time<00:05:17.110> instead<00:05:17.500> of<00:05:17.560> actually

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
actually real time instead of actually

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.210 
actually real time instead of actually
being<00:05:18.130> you<00:05:18.370> know<00:05:18.510> full-on<00:05:19.510> cutscene<00:05:20.440> so<00:05:20.890> I

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
being you know full-on cutscene so I

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.290 
being you know full-on cutscene so I
think<00:05:21.610> that<00:05:21.730> that<00:05:21.760> sort<00:05:21.940> of<00:05:22.030> thing<00:05:22.090> could<00:05:22.270> work

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
think that that sort of thing could work

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.340 
think that that sort of thing could work
in<00:05:22.480> the<00:05:22.540> universe<00:05:22.840> I<00:05:22.930> hope<00:05:23.080> that<00:05:23.260> they

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
in the universe I hope that they

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.200 
in the universe I hope that they
implement<00:05:23.740> those<00:05:23.890> and<00:05:24.190> yeah<00:05:24.910> that's<00:05:25.060> all

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
implement those and yeah that's all

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.430 
implement those and yeah that's all
really<00:05:25.390> gotta<00:05:25.600> say<00:05:25.720> for<00:05:25.840> all<00:05:25.900> these<00:05:26.020> gameplays

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
really gotta say for all these gameplays

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.950 
really gotta say for all these gameplays
now<00:05:26.650> about<00:05:27.250> the<00:05:27.460> demo<00:05:27.760> so<00:05:28.060> since<00:05:28.390> this<00:05:28.600> demos

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
now about the demo so since this demos

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.810 
now about the demo so since this demos
come<00:05:29.230> out<00:05:29.380> and<00:05:29.590> it's<00:05:29.920> about<00:05:30.040> it's<00:05:30.580> a<00:05:30.700> beginning

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
come out and it's about it's a beginning

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.400 
come out and it's about it's a beginning
of<00:05:31.150> well<00:05:31.510> I<00:05:31.540> guess<00:05:31.840> you<00:05:31.960> could<00:05:31.990> say<00:05:32.170> it's<00:05:32.320> the

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
of well I guess you could say it's the

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.100 
of well I guess you could say it's the
middle<00:05:32.620> of<00:05:32.860> january<00:05:33.430> i<00:05:33.640> think<00:05:34.240> that<00:05:34.450> they<00:05:34.690> may

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
middle of january i think that they may

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.740 
middle of january i think that they may
be<00:05:35.170> able<00:05:35.560> to<00:05:35.710> squeeze<00:05:36.130> a<00:05:36.160> demo<00:05:36.640> out<00:05:36.880> before<00:05:37.330> the

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
be able to squeeze a demo out before the

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.150 
be able to squeeze a demo out before the
game<00:05:37.900> comes<00:05:38.140> out<00:05:38.260> in<00:05:38.380> February<00:05:38.770> probably

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
game comes out in February probably

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.370 
game comes out in February probably
about<00:05:39.550> mid-february<00:05:39.910> or<00:05:40.600> if<00:05:40.810> not<00:05:40.930> beginning

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
about mid-february or if not beginning

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.900 
about mid-february or if not beginning
februari<00:05:41.890> I<00:05:41.950> think<00:05:42.160> that<00:05:42.280> they<00:05:42.400> could<00:05:42.460> squeeze

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
februari I think that they could squeeze

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.580 
februari I think that they could squeeze
out<00:05:43.060> a<00:05:43.090> demo<00:05:43.300> at<00:05:43.510> that<00:05:43.780> point<00:05:44.020> since<00:05:44.170> the<00:05:44.410> demo
