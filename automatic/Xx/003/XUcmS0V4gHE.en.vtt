00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.240
 singstar 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.340
 went well afterwards, of course 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.230
 equally individual qualities and we 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.080
 knew as a good organization 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.029
 that I had a very good side chance 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.759
 I think that were very efficient 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.759
 finish and where you quickly get to zero 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.070
 and it was also the rest position 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.040
 they also make the three one which adds to it 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.210
 and yet the feeling goes that they do 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.370
 maybe more the 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.930
 I think I can take it out of the competition 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.070
 that we do match checked 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.289
 and may 4 2 we can win yes 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.960
 it 's a team where we still are 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.559
 should be aware that they can 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.559
 always surprise 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.359
 I think it is together with our club 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.429
 has climbed out of the competition 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.589
 so I think it's right if you are 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.610
 a to are often bad a list of 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.610
 then it is beautiful 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.650
 I was actually expecting a cauldron 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.680
 have to say it's for our players 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.939
 that anyway and a sixth man in the stands 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.390
 we must have our best match of 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:24.460
 season 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.229
 well sure i am too extract 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.810
 tense because you know that needs 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.840
 happen but I think as soon as you enter the field 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.650
 write me down on a city ​​that's gone 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.180
 I have some tension 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.120
 I think the runs I think every 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.730
 player which has been in a camp musicians 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.150
 moments that much more making some all 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.660
 stay calm and good again 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.660
 put end 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.590
 you are motivated and keen on it 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.390
 what you got that title that embarrasses me one 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.729
 hand and how to end with two 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.330
 hands will and should just go 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.330
 happen Saturday
