bubbles<00:04:24.560> there<00:04:25.270> l<00:04:26.270> which<00:04:26.780> is<00:04:26.930> line<00:04:27.340> elevation

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
bubbles there l which is line elevation

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.370 
bubbles there l which is line elevation
last<00:04:28.760> movement<00:04:29.240> always<00:04:29.630> been<00:04:29.960> that<00:04:30.290> of

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
last movement always been that of

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.710 
last movement always been that of
depression<00:04:30.920> so<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.640> gearing<00:04:31.940> on<00:04:32.540> the

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
depression so the gearing on the

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.350 
depression so the gearing on the
elevation<00:04:33.050> hand<00:04:33.410> wheel<00:04:33.620> is<00:04:34.190> always<00:04:34.820> lower<00:04:35.180> it

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
elevation hand wheel is always lower it

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.510 
elevation hand wheel is always lower it
so<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.630> gives<00:04:35.960> less<00:04:36.170> wear<00:04:36.440> on<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:37.160> ordinance

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
so it gives less wear on the ordinance

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.810 
so it gives less wear on the ordinance
that<00:04:37.930> we're<00:04:38.930> that<00:04:39.470> big<00:04:39.950> but<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.160> nice<00:04:40.370> funky

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
that we're that big but a nice funky

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.290 
that we're that big but a nice funky
tank

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300

alright I'll only be switched by the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.800 
alright I'll only be switched by the
fire<00:04:43.040> control<00:04:43.370> box<00:04:43.700> on<00:04:43.910> there<00:04:44.120> right<00:04:44.540> so

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
fire control box on there right so

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.150 
fire control box on there right so
you've<00:04:44.900> got<00:04:44.930> a<00:04:45.050> fire<00:04:45.290> button<00:04:45.530> and<00:04:45.860> your<00:04:46.010> off

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
you've got a fire button and your off

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.520 
you've got a fire button and your off
switch<00:04:46.370> on<00:04:46.670> the<00:04:46.760> one<00:04:46.910> I<00:04:47.090> saw<00:04:47.300> yeah<00:04:47.630> just<00:04:48.050> to<00:04:48.380> the

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
switch on the one I saw yeah just to the

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.610 
switch on the one I saw yeah just to the
right<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:48.800> think<00:04:49.220> of<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.430> clock<00:04:49.670> now<00:04:50.470> on<00:04:51.470> this

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
right I think of the clock now on this
