00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.259 
and yes we got into the the thing so
let's<00:02:40.130> try<00:02:40.400> with<00:02:40.610> another<00:02:40.640> one

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
let's try with another one

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.640 
let's try with another one
I<00:02:41.440> notice<00:02:42.440> that<00:02:43.420> Tekkit<00:02:44.420> Lite<00:02:44.450> also<00:02:45.200> had<00:02:45.410> the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
I notice that Tekkit Lite also had the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.580 
I notice that Tekkit Lite also had the
same<00:02:45.860> problem<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:47.510> let's<00:02:47.660> open<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.079> up<00:02:48.440> and

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
same problem so let's open that up and

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.430 
same problem so let's open that up and
see<00:02:48.799> if<00:02:48.890> we<00:02:48.950> get<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.340> white<00:02:49.519> screen<00:02:49.849> and<00:02:50.480> yes

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
see if we get the white screen and yes

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.670 
see if we get the white screen and yes
there<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.099> is<00:02:53.019> staying<00:02:54.019> like<00:02:54.349> that<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:56.680> look

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
there it is staying like that and look

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.640 
there it is staying like that and look
right<00:02:57.890> here<00:02:58.099> has<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.849> same<00:02:59.180> problem<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.500> let's

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
right here has the same problem so let's

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.210
