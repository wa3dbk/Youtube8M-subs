00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.900
Here, marshmallow root.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.434
It is kind of like in a shredded for and I
add this to my conditioner.

00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:27.840
I am going to show what it looks like.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.090
I basically boil it and extract the mucilage,
it produces mucilage.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.980
Marshmallow root has about 37 percent start,
about 11 percent mucilage and about the same

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.070
amount of pectin and other ingredients as
well, other substances.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.610
So this is what it looks like it's like a....okay.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.600
The amount that I add, I don't have an exact
amount for a given amount of conditioner because

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.149
I've been just using different quantities
and adding it to different quantities of conditioner

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:10.310
so uh...

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.430
It's..usually what I do is I end up taking
about a quarter of a cup to half a cup of

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.500
water and I take a teaspoon, so about this
much of it.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:31.090
A teaspoon, maybe a little bit more and then
I basically add it to the water then boil

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:41.460
it and allow the marshmallow root to release
the gel and then I still put it through a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.350
nylon sock and squeeze and push out the gel
from the root and then I take that and just

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.920
take that and that is what I use an just use
an electric mixer and add it to conditioner.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.840
Here I am boiling one teaspoon of marshmallow
root and half a cup of water.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:09.081
Sometimes I use more sometimes I use less...I
am going to turn it down a little bit . It

00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:19.170
starts to release like a yellow liquid and
the liquid is kind of jelly and very slippery.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.860
The more root that I add the um, the more
kind of jelly of a consistency.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.069
I just play around with the quantities I don't
have a set quantity.

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.499
I am going to add this to a very small amount
of conditioner that's why I am just boiling

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:41.049
a small amount and I am going to go ahead
and turn it up again.

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.819
So I just turn it up an then turn it down.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:54.209
There are times where I boil more of it, like
a higher concentration of the root.

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.939
A foamy substance starts to foam up at the
top very similar to when I cook flax seeds

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.459
and I am going to extract gel from flax seeds.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.909
So here it is and I am just going to turn
it down again and I do this for several minutes,

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:19.359
I want to say once the water is hot about
seven or ten minutes or so just to give it

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.579
time.

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:28.840
I am probably going to add a little bit more
marshmallow root to it so that its jelly consistency

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.889
is more visible on..for this video.

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:45.419
Here I added a bit more water because it was
evaporating and more of the marshmallow root.

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:53.139
It's at a higher concentration here.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:58.739
The um weight of the water is starting to
change it's like a little thicker it thickens

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:12.019
even more once it cools so I am going to go
ahead and strain this.

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:39.340
I am going to take this and um, this amount
here and I am going to boil it again.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:49.560
It's uh slimy so it's got like a slimy, and
it's yellow, has like a yellow color to it.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.009
It's a very small amount because again I am
adding it to a very small amount of conditioner.

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:01.250
I am going to go ahead and boil again and
get a little bit more out.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.530
I want to make good use of the amount that
I have here.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.789
Here's the second round.

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:13.919
I took the same amount of marshmallow root
and I boiled it again in another half cup

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:24.259
of water for a few minutes and i am just going
to squeeze the water out, yellow is what's

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:34.719
left an it's very very slippery stuff, extremely
slippery.

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:41.400
There it is, it's organic marshmallow root
extract that I've extracted a lot of the mucilage

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.940
from it and I purchase organic marshmallow
root at a basically health food store.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:54.000
I am going to let this cool for a bit and
then I am going to add a conditioner to it.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.370
The conditioner I am adding to it is a conditioner
I purchased.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.319
I really like the ingredients in the conditioner
but unfortunately that conditioner does not

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:11.689
detangle so I need to add slip to it so that
it can work as a detangler so I am enhancing

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:39.069
a conditioner.

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:44.490
I can add a few drops of preservative or a
few drops of rosemary oil or tea tree oil

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.509
or whatever but this is going to be used up
very quickly and very soon so I probably won't

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:53.069
even do that and just store it in a container.

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:56.289
I am going to be storing it outside of the
refrigerator.

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:03.889
I will also be adding marshmallow root, this
marshmallow root extract to my homemade conditioner

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:06.330
as well and it's working really really well.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:15.090
It's making the conditioner extremely slippery
and it's creating a really um, a really nice

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:20.529
detangler, it has really nice detangling properties
and it feels really nice on the skin.

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:29.600
Again it looks chunky here but it's actually
very smooth, again I used an electric mixer,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:37.020
I will probably mix it a little bit more um
to get it a bit smoother. and once it cools

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.800
it will be ready to go.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.379
Okay here is the conditioner I just mixed
it up a bit more and it's back to a very smooth

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:45.900
creamy consistency.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.560
So here it is, it's just a matter of mixing
it enough.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:49.660
Okay.
