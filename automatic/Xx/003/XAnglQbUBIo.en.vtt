00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.830
 we start with the ingredients we are going to 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.300
 use mercadal cheese this is from 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.420
 menorca is a special cheese for 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.460
 batter and may be batter with casey 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.740
 that any cheese has to have a 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.900
 texture more or less average that is not very 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.220
 soft because if it does not melt and good 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.530
 I in this case, as I said 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.690
 to use this two eggs and bread crumbs 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.120
 home of mercadona that is the one that I'm going to 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.750
 use to batter first we will beat 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.750
 the eggs 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.019
 We cut the cheese and I'm going to 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.909
 to do in triangles has cost me a 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.440
 little bit because my cheese is square 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.239
 Well then, it has cost to take out the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.879
 triangles but if you buy cheese 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.010
 Round will be great and you will get the form 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.600
 perfect to tell you that the cheese has 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.909
 to be as I told you before a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.619
 medium texture can not be a very cheese 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.729
 soft because if it will not melt at 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:05.339
 fry it and cheese for example can see 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.409
 is ideal for this type of batter is 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.299
 the one that is most used but good I eat 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.220
 I could not catch the camembert cheese 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.420
 that I have used this but if you try the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.420
 Camembert sure you'll love it 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.710
 We went to make batter to batter and its 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.250
 normal and ordinary batter first 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.970
 passes the cheese for the egg and 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.979
 continuation for the breadcrumbs is a 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.720
 normal batter the only thing we're going to 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.210
 do it twice so you have more 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.909
 consistency and the cheese does not come out at 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.979
 fry it even though it has left me 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.340
 what I recommend that you bounce three 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.340
 times 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.320
 once the oil is hot 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.880
 so we will introduce the pieces of cheese 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.590
 batter in the pan and let's wait 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.600
 to brown when golden brown 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.800
 we can remove it since it does not have to be 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.800
 the cheese is made inside 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.280
 battered cheese is usually accompanied 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.440
 usually from some kind of jam to 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.090
 which you prefer but I'm going to 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.620
 use the seasonal raspberry 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.629
 because well there was no other and this is the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.120
 what I like most, let's go with him 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.030
 as you are seeing so I have put four 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.860
 cheeses this would be for two people two 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.750
 that if your per person and good I will 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.880
 put in the center a little bit of 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.890
 jam for whoever wants to accompany it 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.220
 So it's very rich and sure that it's going to 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.220
 like 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.280
 I encourage you to do so, you know that if 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.720
 you do it you can tag me in my photo 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.519

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.930
