an hour before my friends are not there

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.870 
an hour before my friends are not there

because I wanted it to be perfect but

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.179 
because I wanted it to be perfect but
yeah<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:17.240> what<00:01:17.390> I'm<00:01:17.509> actually<00:01:17.719> using<00:01:18.109> is<00:01:18.530> the

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
yeah so what I'm actually using is the

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.240 
yeah so what I'm actually using is the
88<00:01:19.729> shimmer<00:01:20.270> palette<00:01:20.469> this<00:01:21.469> is<00:01:21.619> a<00:01:21.649> fairly

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
88 shimmer palette this is a fairly

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.010 
88 shimmer palette this is a fairly
similar<00:01:22.789> to<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:23.030> quality<00:01:23.240> that<00:01:23.450> I<00:01:23.600> would<00:01:23.840> have

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
similar to the quality that I would have

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.859 
similar to the quality that I would have
used<00:01:24.320> back<00:01:25.070> then<00:01:25.100> um<00:01:25.670> this<00:01:26.390> is<00:01:26.570> actually

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
used back then um this is actually

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.209 
used back then um this is actually
probably<00:01:27.109> a<00:01:27.350> little<00:01:27.439> better<00:01:27.679> than<00:01:27.890> what<00:01:28.009> i<00:01:28.039> use

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
probably a little better than what i use

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:30.669 
probably a little better than what i use
back<00:01:28.490> then<00:01:28.670> but<00:01:28.880> i'm<00:01:29.240> really<00:01:29.810> only<00:01:30.109> using<00:01:30.590> two

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
have really bad eyebrows so like my

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.220 
have really bad eyebrows so like my
eyeballs<00:02:09.259> proved<00:02:10.030> more<00:02:11.030> down<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:11.810> didn't<00:02:12.049> it

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230

looks like I had no island um but it's

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.990 
looks like I had no island um but it's
just<00:02:15.319> because<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:15.560> didn't<00:02:15.890> really<00:02:16.129> get<00:02:16.819> that

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000

arch

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.979 
arch
and<00:02:17.989> I<00:02:18.110> did<00:02:18.440> when<00:02:18.590> I<00:02:18.650> was<00:02:18.680> older<00:02:19.099> but<00:02:19.569> yeah<00:02:20.569> so

and I did when I was older but yeah so

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.360 
and I did when I was older but yeah so
then<00:02:21.140> once<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:21.409> was<00:02:21.709> there<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.220> then<00:02:22.310> I

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
then once that was there and then I

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.559 
then once that was there and then I
think<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.790> put<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.030> little<00:02:23.180> bit<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:24.709> white<00:02:25.569> on

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
think I put a little bit of the white on

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.420 
think I put a little bit of the white on
my<00:02:26.840> inner<00:02:27.379> corner<00:02:28.239> as<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.299> highlight<00:02:30.220> took<00:02:31.220> a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
my inner corner as a highlight took a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.320 
my inner corner as a highlight took a
shimmery<00:02:32.269> black<00:02:32.599> and<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:34.910> remember<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.239> used

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
shimmery black and I remember I used

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.380 
shimmery black and I remember I used
like<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.840> paddle<00:02:36.500> brush<00:02:36.620> like<00:02:36.890> this<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.720> i<00:02:38.720> just

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
like a paddle brush like this and i just

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.960 
like a paddle brush like this and i just
applied<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.690> all<00:02:41.989> over<00:02:42.319> my<00:02:42.709> lid<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.790> then<00:02:43.819> I

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
applied that all over my lid and then I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.309 
applied that all over my lid and then I
really<00:02:44.180> just<00:02:44.360> remember<00:02:44.660> trying<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.989> blend

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
really just remember trying to blend

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.110 
really just remember trying to blend
that<00:02:45.590> out<00:02:45.650> so<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.340> they<00:02:46.370> marched<00:02:46.790> on<00:02:46.940> both

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
that out so that they marched on both

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.890 
that out so that they marched on both
sides<00:02:47.420> um<00:02:48.019> I<00:02:48.829> only<00:02:49.579> use<00:02:49.940> those<00:02:50.209> two<00:02:50.390> colors<00:02:50.540> oh

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
sides um I only use those two colors oh

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.979 
sides um I only use those two colors oh
so<00:02:51.879> you<00:02:52.879> know<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.030> just<00:02:53.329> kind<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.510> blended<00:02:53.870> it

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
so you know I just kind of blended it

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.650 
so you know I just kind of blended it
until<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.609> kind<00:02:55.609> of<00:02:55.730> did<00:02:55.940> what<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.180> want<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.540> to

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
until it kind of did what it want it to

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.509 
until it kind of did what it want it to
do<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.079> then<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.620> think<00:02:57.829> I<00:02:57.920> took<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.129> little<00:02:58.310> bit

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
do and then I think I took a little bit

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.490 
do and then I think I took a little bit
of<00:02:59.230> white<00:03:00.230> eyeshadow<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:01.129> lot<00:03:02.030> showing<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.599> just

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
kind of blended in the inner corner a

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.819 
kind of blended in the inner corner a
little<00:03:05.000> bit<00:03:05.269> more<00:03:05.390> do<00:03:05.989> you<00:03:06.079> remember<00:03:06.290> taking<00:03:06.650> a

with the pencil brush and i know i did
this<00:03:37.609> general<00:03:38.230> move<00:03:39.230> which<00:03:39.950> I'm<00:03:40.130> sure<00:03:40.989> was

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
this general move which I'm sure was

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.720 
this general move which I'm sure was
great<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.500> then<00:03:42.739> tried<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.069> blend<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.549> out

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730

great and then tried to blend it out
helmets<00:03:44.150> off<00:03:44.419> and<00:03:45.019> then<00:03:45.859> I<00:03:45.980> applied<00:03:46.310> like<00:03:46.510> 17

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.300 
helmets off and then I applied like 17
coats<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:47.900> eyelashes<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.709> sat<00:03:48.859> either<00:03:48.980> stuff
