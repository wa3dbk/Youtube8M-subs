played definitely one of my favorites at
the<00:00:21.420> moment<00:00:22.070> you<00:00:23.070> know<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.189> wasn't<00:00:23.490> really<00:00:23.580> sure

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
the moment you know I wasn't really sure

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.970 
the moment you know I wasn't really sure
about<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.119> maps<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.480> start<00:00:24.720> with<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:25.050> i<00:00:25.350> think

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
about the maps to start with but i think

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.929 
about the maps to start with but i think
this<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.990> slums<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.429> raid<00:00:29.429> i<00:00:29.460> think<00:00:29.820> it's

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
this and slums and raid i think it's

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.330 
this and slums and raid i think it's
called<00:00:30.230> definitely<00:00:31.230> some<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.529> my<00:00:31.710> favorites<00:00:32.160> i

things<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.140> they've<00:01:46.520> left<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.820> hip<00:01:48.720> fire<00:01:48.960> on

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
things like they've left the hip fire on

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.139 
things like they've left the hip fire on
SMGs<00:01:49.649> i<00:01:49.799> think<00:01:50.040> plus<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.850> they've<00:01:51.030> actually

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
SMGs i think plus know they've actually

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.410 
SMGs i think plus know they've actually
added<00:01:51.329> recoil<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.619> hit<00:01:52.740> firing<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.420> they've

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
added recoil to hit firing and they've

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.170 
added recoil to hit firing and they've
for<00:01:55.200> some<00:01:55.380> reason<00:01:55.710> made<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.549> harder<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.880> hip

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
for some reason made it harder to hip

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.359 
for some reason made it harder to hip
fire<00:01:57.420> when<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.659> snipe<00:01:58.079> i<00:01:58.350> guess<00:01:58.799> no<00:01:59.040> scopes

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
fire when you snipe i guess no scopes

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.469 
fire when you snipe i guess no scopes
would<00:01:59.579> weigh<00:02:00.420> 20<00:02:00.630> p<00:02:00.930> or<00:02:01.079> something<00:02:01.439> don't<00:02:02.280> know

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
would weigh 20 p or something don't know

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.940 
would weigh 20 p or something don't know
but<00:02:03.479> there's<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.689> few<00:02:03.840> soft<00:02:04.079> balancing<00:02:04.860> issues

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
but there's a few soft balancing issues

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.590 
but there's a few soft balancing issues
and<00:02:05.430> actually<00:02:06.030> one<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> great<00:02:06.570> things

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
and actually one of the great things

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.680 
and actually one of the great things
that<00:02:06.899> came<00:02:07.110> out<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.619> patch

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
that came out in this patch

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.240 
that came out in this patch
was<00:02:08.900> they<00:02:09.110> finally<00:02:09.470> brought<00:02:09.619> back<00:02:09.830> theater

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
was they finally brought back theater

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.940 
was they finally brought back theater
mode<00:02:10.810> now<00:02:11.810> theater<00:02:12.140> mode<00:02:12.230> went<00:02:12.440> down<00:02:12.620> because

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
mode now theater mode went down because

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.810 
mode now theater mode went down because
of<00:02:12.980> some<00:02:13.220> weird<00:02:13.460> like<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.750> hack<00:02:15.410> that<00:02:15.440> was<00:02:15.860> that

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
of some weird like a hack that was that

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.430 
of some weird like a hack that was that
come<00:02:17.030> about<00:02:17.120> as<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.450> result<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.840> people<00:02:18.170> being

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
come about as a result of people being

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.040 
come about as a result of people being
able<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.740> use<00:02:18.920> theater<00:02:19.340> mode<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:19.760> somehow<00:02:20.720> get

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
able to use theater mode and somehow get

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.740 
able to use theater mode and somehow get
up<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:22.100> max<00:02:22.610> level<00:02:22.820> of<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.150> prestige<00:02:23.540> or

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
up to the max level of that prestige or

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.960 
up to the max level of that prestige or
something<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.290> don't<00:02:25.040> know<00:02:25.250> how<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.490> works<00:02:25.640> but

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
something I don't know how it works but

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.880 
something I don't know how it works but
it<00:02:26.030> was<00:02:26.390> some<00:02:26.600> Infected<00:02:27.230> video<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.830> got

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
it was some Infected video that got

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.550 
it was some Infected video that got
spread<00:02:28.190> around<00:02:28.250> people<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.080> they<00:02:30.080> disabled

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
spread around people and they disabled

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.650 
spread around people and they disabled
theater<00:02:30.860> mode<00:02:30.980> hence<00:02:31.970> why<00:02:32.240> I<00:02:32.270> haven't<00:02:32.510> been

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
theater mode hence why I haven't been

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.300 
theater mode hence why I haven't been

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.900 
goes but the point is the sniping isn't
really<00:03:08.840> my<00:03:08.990> forte<00:03:09.230> if<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:09.770> like<00:03:09.980> I'm<00:03:10.670> more<00:03:10.850> of

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
really my forte if you like I'm more of

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.090 
really my forte if you like I'm more of
a<00:03:11.000> shotgunner<00:03:11.420> in<00:03:11.720> general<00:03:12.260> which<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.590> why<00:03:12.800> I

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
a shotgunner in general which is why I

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.570 
a shotgunner in general which is why I
have<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.290> first<00:03:15.290> shotgun<00:03:15.890> as<00:03:16.160> my<00:03:16.310> kind<00:03:16.489> of

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
have the first shotgun as my kind of

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.479 
have the first shotgun as my kind of
primary<00:03:17.060> gun<00:03:17.650> but<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:18.680> know<00:03:18.890> out<00:03:19.130> of<00:03:19.250> all<00:03:19.370> the

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
primary gun but you know out of all the

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.010 
primary gun but you know out of all the
snipers<00:03:19.910> I'd<00:03:20.120> say<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.450> ballista<00:03:20.900> is

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
snipers I'd say the ballista is

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.050 
snipers I'd say the ballista is
definitely<00:03:21.470> my<00:03:22.280> favorite<00:03:22.640> one<00:03:22.790> out<00:03:22.940> of<00:03:23.000> the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
definitely my favorite one out of the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.540 
definitely my favorite one out of the
ones<00:03:23.239> in<00:03:23.360> this<00:03:23.480> game<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:23.930> think<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.250> list<00:03:25.400> is

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
ones in this game I think the list is

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.880 
ones in this game I think the list is
the<00:03:25.640> only<00:03:25.790> one<00:03:26.000> that<00:03:26.150> can<00:03:26.330> get<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.890> iron

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
the only one that can get the iron

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.030 
the only one that can get the iron
sights<00:03:28.220> as<00:03:28.459> well<00:03:28.670> or<00:03:29.630> maybe<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.380> last<00:03:30.560> one<00:03:30.800> can

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
sights as well or maybe the last one can

was saying prestiging in this game it's

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.760 
was saying prestiging in this game it's
definitely<00:04:34.190> worth<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:34.520> in<00:04:34.670> my<00:04:34.700> opinion<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.770> by

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
definitely worth it in my opinion and by

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.680 
definitely worth it in my opinion and by
the<00:04:36.830> way<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.100> killstreaks<00:04:37.640> I've<00:04:38.330> become<00:04:38.660> very

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
the way the killstreaks I've become very

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.830 
the way the killstreaks I've become very
attached<00:04:39.170> to<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:40.610> AGR<00:04:40.880> for<00:04:41.120> a<00:04:41.150> start<00:04:41.450> is<00:04:41.630> one

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
attached to the AGR for a start is one

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.170 
attached to the AGR for a start is one
that<00:04:41.990> like<00:04:42.140> definitely<00:04:42.380> like<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:43.000> sentry<00:04:44.000> gun

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
that like definitely like the sentry gun

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.930 
that like definitely like the sentry gun
the<00:04:44.540> lightning<00:04:44.870> strike<00:04:45.200> and<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.890> counter<00:04:46.790> UAV

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
the lightning strike and the counter UAV

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.300 
the lightning strike and the counter UAV
actually<00:04:47.750> those<00:04:47.870> last<00:04:48.170> three<00:04:48.310> either

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
actually those last three either

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.750 
actually those last three either
gameplay<00:04:49.730> earlier<00:04:50.090> where<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:50.390> went<00:04:51.250> 46<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:52.520> 2

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
gameplay earlier where I went 46 and 2

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.210 
gameplay earlier where I went 46 and 2
on<00:04:52.970> a<00:04:53.000> regular<00:04:53.270> TDM<00:04:53.810> I<00:04:53.960> think<00:04:54.200> using<00:04:55.010> the

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
on a regular TDM I think using the

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.460 
on a regular TDM I think using the
vector<00:04:55.580> with<00:04:55.820> those<00:04:56.000> kill<00:04:56.270> streaks<00:04:56.600> and<00:04:56.780> let

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
vector with those kill streaks and let

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.900 
vector with those kill streaks and let
me<00:04:57.560> tell<00:04:57.740> you<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.040> amount<00:04:58.130> of<00:04:58.370> damage<00:04:58.760> a

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
me tell you the amount of damage a

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.940 
me tell you the amount of damage a
sentry<00:04:59.330> gun<00:04:59.480> can<00:04:59.690> lay<00:04:59.840> down<00:04:59.870> in<00:05:00.230> this<00:05:00.320> game<00:05:00.560> is

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
sentry gun can lay down in this game is

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.880 
sentry gun can lay down in this game is
ridiculous<00:05:01.730> like<00:05:02.510> any<00:05:03.290> of<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.530> previous

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
ridiculous like any of the previous

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.590 
ridiculous like any of the previous
games<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.400> didn't<00:05:04.850> really<00:05:04.940> have<00:05:05.090> much<00:05:05.120> faith<00:05:05.540> in

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
games I didn't really have much faith in

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.710 
games I didn't really have much faith in
the<00:05:05.870> century<00:05:06.230> gun<00:05:06.380> partly<00:05:07.160> because<00:05:07.450> it<00:05:08.450> didn't

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
the century gun partly because it didn't

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.120 
the century gun partly because it didn't
seem<00:05:08.870> as<00:05:08.960> powerful<00:05:09.380> for<00:05:09.560> some<00:05:09.710> reason<00:05:10.010> and

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
seem as powerful for some reason and

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.670 
seem as powerful for some reason and
partly<00:05:11.090> because<00:05:11.240> you<00:05:12.140> could<00:05:12.260> easily<00:05:12.380> destroy

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
partly because you could easily destroy

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.460 
partly because you could easily destroy
it<00:05:12.980> with<00:05:13.070> the<00:05:13.190> knife<00:05:14.110> but<00:05:15.110> now<00:05:15.230> that<00:05:15.350> they've

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
it with the knife but now that they've

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.960 
it with the knife but now that they've
given<00:05:15.590> more<00:05:15.830> protection<00:05:16.280> to<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.460> sentry<00:05:16.790> gun

all<00:05:51.830> honesty<00:05:52.160> it's<00:05:52.340> probably<00:05:52.580> best<00:05:52.760> just<00:05:52.910> to

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
all honesty it's probably best just to

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.450 
all honesty it's probably best just to
let<00:05:53.330> it<00:05:53.360> go<00:05:53.540> by<00:05:53.720> itself<00:05:54.020> and<00:05:54.370> run<00:05:55.370> around

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.400 
getting kills with your gun at the same
time<00:05:58.030> but<00:05:59.030> yet<00:05:59.240> that<00:05:59.450> is<00:05:59.480> pretty<00:06:00.230> much<00:06:00.350> the

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
time but yet that is pretty much the

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.470 
time but yet that is pretty much the

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
gameplay so coming towards the end here

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.600 
gameplay so coming towards the end here
by<00:06:03.350> the<00:06:03.410> way<00:06:03.530> the<00:06:03.710> AI<00:06:03.860> controlled<00:06:04.400> kill
