it it's unfiltered it's unfettered I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.219 
it it's unfiltered it's unfettered I
think<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.179> is<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.539> the<00:01:45.660> most<00:01:45.750> drinkable

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
think this is one of the most drinkable

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.779 
think this is one of the most drinkable
beers<00:01:46.440> around<00:01:46.619> right<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.009> could<00:01:47.369> sit<00:01:47.550> and<00:01:47.580> drink

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
beers around right I could sit and drink

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.010 
beers around right I could sit and drink
this<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.149> day<00:01:48.330> long<00:01:48.360> what's<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> alcohol

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
this all day long what's the alcohol

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.900 
this all day long what's the alcohol
content<00:01:49.349> on<00:01:49.709> yeah<00:01:50.039> you<00:01:50.459> know<00:01:50.550> somewhere

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
content on yeah you know somewhere

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.490 
content on yeah you know somewhere
around<00:01:51.000> five<00:01:51.330> yeah<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.990> right<00:01:52.110> around<00:01:52.229> five

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
around five yeah it's right around five

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.010 
around five yeah it's right around five
I<00:01:52.770> think<00:01:53.459> it<00:01:53.550> just<00:01:53.580> establish<00:01:54.360> such<00:01:54.599> a<00:01:54.630> such<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
I think it just establish such a such a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.870 
I think it just establish such a such a
niche<00:01:55.319> for<00:01:55.349> yourself<00:01:55.670> especially<00:01:56.670> right<00:01:56.849> here

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
niche for yourself especially right here

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.609 
niche for yourself especially right here
