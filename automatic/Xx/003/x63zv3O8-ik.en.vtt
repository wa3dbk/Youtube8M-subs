00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
to pitch bend up to 16% and then over

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.800 
to pitch bend up to 16% and then over
here<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:07.759> program<00:02:08.759> where<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.690> could

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
here you have program where you could

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.780 
here you have program where you could
choose<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.140> song<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.069> would<00:02:11.129> be<00:02:11.280> after<00:02:11.489> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
choose the song that would be after the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.509 
choose the song that would be after the
it's<00:02:11.879> playing<00:02:12.409> you<00:02:13.409> could<00:02:13.560> have<00:02:13.650> time<00:02:14.040> which

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
it's playing you could have time which

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.670 
it's playing you could have time which
you<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.730> time<00:02:15.030> elapse<00:02:15.360> time<00:02:15.689> remaining<00:02:16.500> and

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
you have time elapse time remaining and

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.599 
you have time elapse time remaining and
total<00:02:18.530> repeat<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.099> could<00:02:20.219> repeat<00:02:20.430> the

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
total repeat and so you could repeat the

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.599 
total repeat and so you could repeat the
song<00:02:21.739> single<00:02:22.739> or<00:02:22.829> continuous<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.489> can

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
song single or continuous so you can

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.880

play through the song once or can loop
it<00:02:26.069> continuously<00:02:26.939> and<00:02:27.420> then<00:02:28.200> your<00:02:28.319> opening

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650
