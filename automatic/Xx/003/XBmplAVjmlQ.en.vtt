destroyed racing poop which is from soul

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.680 
destroyed racing poop which is from soul
burn<00:01:28.780> which<00:01:29.290> is<00:01:29.470> more<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:30.460> frantic<00:01:31.090> kind<00:01:31.510> of

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
burn which is more the frantic kind of

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.500 
burn which is more the frantic kind of
shotgun<00:01:32.530> guitar<00:01:33.310> style<00:01:33.910> playing<00:01:34.210> that<00:01:34.420> you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
shotgun guitar style playing that you

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.270 
shotgun guitar style playing that you
use<00:01:34.690> with<00:01:34.900> a<00:01:34.960> seven<00:01:35.350> string<00:01:35.500> in<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.770> power

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:50.779 
use with a seven string in the power
cord<00:01:36.700> which<00:01:36.880> goes<00:01:37.120> like<00:01:37.210> this

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.230 

and<00:01:51.869> that's<00:01:52.869> one<00:01:53.439> so<00:01:54.070> that's<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.939> little<00:01:55.090> bit

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
and that's one so that's a little bit

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.090 
and that's one so that's a little bit
all<00:01:55.719> the<00:01:55.960> difference<00:01:56.350> you<00:01:56.500> got<00:01:56.680> the<00:01:56.799> chart

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
all the difference you got the chart

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.709 
all the difference you got the chart
there<00:01:57.310> but<00:01:57.579> you're<00:01:57.700> pretty<00:01:57.909> much<00:01:58.030> limited<00:01:58.659> to

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
there but you're pretty much limited to

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.450 
there but you're pretty much limited to
playing<00:01:59.610> but<00:02:00.610> here<00:02:00.820> you<00:02:00.909> can<00:02:00.969> go<00:02:01.240> like<00:02:02.460> two

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
playing but here you can go like two

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.289 
playing but here you can go like two
more<00:02:04.030> notes<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:04.719> still<00:02:05.289> keep<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:05.710> interesting

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
more notes and still keep it interesting

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.139 
more notes and still keep it interesting
so<00:02:07.299> that's<00:02:07.539> basically<00:02:08.019> why<00:02:08.590> we<00:02:08.860> love<00:02:09.819> playing

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
so that's basically why we love playing

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.670 
so that's basically why we love playing
eight<00:02:10.360> string<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:12.250> more<00:02:12.400> fun
