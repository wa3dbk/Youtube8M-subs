00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.520
 or 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.340
 and to all glitch lovers it's the 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.200
 bad boys and I hope you are all 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.820
 very well me it's going today we get 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.460
 found for the new glitch of the 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.800
 prestige duplication after patch 1.8 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.260
 discovered sometimes well a big j g to 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.510
 you so to make this glitch will have to 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.100
 do exactly as usual except 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.379
 that there will be an axis which in addition to 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.390
 realize on the computer with software 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.160
 net or 5 available in the registration 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.510
 so if you want to do this glick it 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.010
 will really have to take a ride in 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.890
 the description to take the software 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.540
 so that's really a trick 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.290
 in the description to look 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.670
 exactly the tutorial written so I 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.680
 will explain to you as usual 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.509
 you go to the account at 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.640
 duplicate you put your second 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.110
 joystick you go go to shop 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.750
 twice cross then breaks with the 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.550
 first you're gonna go gay and you 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.619
 activate the switch lake at this time 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.270
 as you saw in the video at this 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.770
 moment there you activate the lake will be located 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.720
 an error message you validate it with 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.200
 your first controller you take the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.720
 tale who goes who has the prestige to 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.140
 duplicate you wait for it to go 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.880
 log on 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.940
 so it can take time like this 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.979
 can be fast and then you stop him 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.080
 like like in the video exactly 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.580
 same as I have done so you 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.610
 saw him a I even put a little 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.080
 break so you 've validated peeled 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.550
 several error messages you go 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.160
 play online and will become go 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.950
 have the menu you take back the tale 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.619
 with the price with the prestigious hall 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.330
 is duplicated you wait again 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.490
 for you that for it to connect you 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.780
 and then you will go to validate all 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.890
 the messages again and then you go 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.140
 go online 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.670
 there you will be with the tale the tale that 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.330
 has the prestige you launch no matter 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.550
 which part 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.190
 and then or leave and then here you are 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.930
 will have prestige duplication so like 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.209
 you saw it in the video I have you 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.099
 I proved to you that it was still 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.510
 a point 8 so here I really 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.280
 explain quickly so it's not 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.840
 necessarily easy to understand like that 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.000
 but take a look at the description 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.530
 you're really happy 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.620
 it's really very very very very good 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.230
 explained so I really advise you 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.900
 really open this description is 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.940
 to see exactly how to do that 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.620
 then you will understand better later 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.450
 the video is in any case it's 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.190
 exactly as usual but with the 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.360
 lake switch anyway I hope these 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.490
 videos you liked 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.680
