00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
hey this one's about the oil burner

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.180 
hey this one's about the oil burner
flame<00:00:09.210> now<00:00:09.690> what<00:00:09.900> you're<00:00:10.049> looking<00:00:10.379> at<00:00:10.500> here<00:00:10.559> is

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
flame now what you're looking at here is

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.359 
flame now what you're looking at here is
a<00:00:11.850> combustion<00:00:12.510> chamber<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.170> heat<00:00:13.709> exchanger

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:14.369 
a combustion chamber and heat exchanger

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.790 
a combustion chamber and heat exchanger
for<00:00:15.090> an<00:00:15.150> oil<00:00:15.209> furnace<00:00:15.629> the<00:00:16.230> thing<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.619> says

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
for an oil furnace the thing that says

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.870 
for an oil furnace the thing that says
okay<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.960> combustion<00:00:19.529> chamber<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.279> part

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
okay is the combustion chamber and part

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.000 
okay is the combustion chamber and part
of<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.090> heat<00:00:21.210> exchanger<00:00:21.779> I'm<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.890> go

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
of the heat exchanger I'm going to go

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.800 
of the heat exchanger I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.490> cut<00:00:23.700> that<00:00:23.730> off<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.420> there<00:00:24.630> and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
ahead and cut that off of there and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.580 
ahead and cut that off of there and
we'll<00:00:25.680> look<00:00:25.890> inside<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.690> want<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.260> see

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
we'll look inside and I want you to see

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:38.770 
we'll look inside and I want you to see
the<00:00:28.890> way<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.400> flame<00:00:29.880> works

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:46.420 

you

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.750 

okay<00:00:47.430> tops<00:00:47.820> off<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:49.340> fires<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
okay tops off and fires in the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.920 
okay tops off and fires in the
combustion<00:00:51.150> chamber

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
combustion chamber

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.939 
combustion chamber
now<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:53.190> flame<00:00:54.050> has<00:00:55.050> got<00:00:55.290> an<00:00:55.350> awful<00:00:55.800> lot<00:00:55.890> of

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
now this flame has got an awful lot of

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.640 
now this flame has got an awful lot of
air<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.540> see<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.470> not<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
air in it you can see this is not a

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.350 
air in it you can see this is not a
flame<00:00:58.949> retention<00:00:59.460> burner<00:00:59.670> I'll<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.329> a

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
flame retention burner I'll do it with a

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.670 
flame retention burner I'll do it with a
flame<00:01:00.629> retention<00:01:01.110> burger<00:01:01.320> eat<00:01:01.559> later<00:01:03.229> but<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
flame retention burger eat later but the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.570 
flame retention burger eat later but the
flame<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.610> moving<00:01:06.270> out<00:01:07.070> curling<00:01:08.070> around<00:01:08.190> a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
flame is moving out curling around a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.010 
flame is moving out curling around a
little<00:01:08.700> bit<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> back<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.630> combustion

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
little bit in the back of the combustion

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.040 
little bit in the back of the combustion
chamber<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.009> I'm<00:01:11.100> gonna<00:01:11.310> start<00:01:11.580> adding<00:01:12.150> or

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
chamber and I'm gonna start adding or

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.010 
chamber and I'm gonna start adding or
taking<00:01:13.290> air<00:01:14.040> away<00:01:14.220> from<00:01:14.759> this<00:01:14.910> thing<00:01:15.150> there

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
taking air away from this thing there

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.870 
taking air away from this thing there
you<00:01:16.200> go<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.460> actually<00:01:17.940> a<00:01:18.330> darker<00:01:18.840> color

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
you go see it is actually a darker color

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.290 
you go see it is actually a darker color
and<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.600> flame<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.680> much<00:01:23.039> larger<00:01:23.789> now<00:01:24.149> I've

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
and the flame is much larger now I've

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.820 
and the flame is much larger now I've
turned<00:01:24.539> it<00:01:24.720> back<00:01:24.840> down<00:01:25.200> again

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
turned it back down again

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.980 
turned it back down again
and<00:01:25.920> I'm<00:01:26.520> gonna<00:01:26.700> cut<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.180> back<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> where

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
and I'm gonna cut it back to where

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.510 
and I'm gonna cut it back to where
there's<00:01:28.200> way<00:01:28.649> way<00:01:29.039> too<00:01:29.100> much<00:01:29.490> air<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:31.310> this<00:01:32.310> is

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
there's way way too much air in this is

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.690 
there's way way too much air in this is
a<00:01:32.550> really<00:01:33.060> bad<00:01:33.300> flame<00:01:33.890> this<00:01:34.890> flame<00:01:35.190> will<00:01:35.490> not

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
a really bad flame this flame will not

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.940 
a really bad flame this flame will not
produce<00:01:36.090> very<00:01:36.390> much<00:01:36.600> heat<00:01:36.899> because<00:01:37.770> there's

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
produce very much heat because there's

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.070 
produce very much heat because there's
way<00:01:38.220> too<00:01:38.280> much<00:01:38.670> air<00:01:39.060> coming<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.990> it

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
way too much air coming in it and it

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.130 
way too much air coming in it and it
cools<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.679> down<00:01:40.729> it's<00:01:41.729> extremely<00:01:42.630> important

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
cools it down it's extremely important

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.550 
cools it down it's extremely important
on<00:01:43.259> these<00:01:43.440> oil<00:01:43.710> furnaces<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.479> area<00:01:46.259> be

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
on these oil furnaces that this area be

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.520 
on these oil furnaces that this area be
hot<00:01:47.119> that's<00:01:48.119> what<00:01:48.330> that<00:01:48.509> combustion<00:01:48.929> chambers

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
hot that's what that combustion chambers

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.249 
hot that's what that combustion chambers
for<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.670> supposed<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> heat<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:51.300> and<00:01:51.599> glow<00:01:51.929> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
for is supposed to heat up and glow and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.630 
for is supposed to heat up and glow and
reflect<00:01:53.190> heat<00:01:53.369> back<00:01:53.640> into<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> flame<00:01:55.640> but

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
reflect heat back into the flame but

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.400 
reflect heat back into the flame but
when<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.000> put<00:01:57.270> too<00:01:57.630> much<00:01:58.819> primary<00:01:59.819> air<00:02:00.410> into

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
when you put too much primary air into

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.380 
when you put too much primary air into
it<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.860> guess<00:02:02.220> you'd<00:02:02.429> call<00:02:02.459> it<00:02:02.640> primary<00:02:03.000> air

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
it I guess you'd call it primary air

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.719 
it I guess you'd call it primary air
anyway

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
anyway

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.600 
anyway
yet<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.569> flame<00:02:06.840> gets<00:02:07.020> small<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.890> flame<00:02:08.340> gets

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
yet the flame gets small and flame gets

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.390 
yet the flame gets small and flame gets
cold<00:02:09.140> now<00:02:10.140> I'm<00:02:10.229> gonna<00:02:10.349> start<00:02:10.649> turning<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.190> back

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
cold now I'm gonna start turning it back

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.490 
cold now I'm gonna start turning it back
up<00:02:11.670> again

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
up again

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.570 
up again
okay<00:02:14.510> again<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.569> can<00:02:15.870> see<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.620> flame<00:02:17.370> is

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
okay again you can see the flame is

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.339 
okay again you can see the flame is
actually<00:02:17.760> putting<00:02:18.270> out<00:02:18.420> more<00:02:18.660> heat<00:02:19.050> now

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
actually putting out more heat now

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.160 
actually putting out more heat now
there's<00:02:19.770> more<00:02:20.010> flame<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.819> it's<00:02:21.720> not<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> good

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
there's more flame to it it's not a good

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.360 
there's more flame to it it's not a good
flame<00:02:22.590> because<00:02:23.130> they're<00:02:23.340> smoking<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:25.800> really

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
flame because they're smoking you really

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.100 
flame because they're smoking you really
can't<00:02:26.670> see<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.090> smoke

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.500 

there<00:02:30.710> is<00:02:31.010> smoke<00:02:31.430> in<00:02:31.460> it<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.000> that's<00:02:32.300> gonna

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
there is smoke in it and that's gonna

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.020 
there is smoke in it and that's gonna
plug<00:02:32.810> up<00:02:32.960> the<00:02:33.080> heat<00:02:33.260> exchanger<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.550> now<00:02:34.730> we<00:02:34.790> go

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
plug up the heat exchanger so now we go

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.110 
plug up the heat exchanger so now we go
back<00:02:35.060> again<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.400> we're<00:02:37.400> getting<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.850> cold

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
back again and we're getting a cold

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.290 
back again and we're getting a cold
flame<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.750> there<00:02:38.930> again<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:40.280> I'm<00:02:40.910> gonna<00:02:41.030> shut

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
flame in there again and I'm gonna shut

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.440 
flame in there again and I'm gonna shut
it<00:02:41.330> off<00:02:41.540> here<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.930> say<00:02:42.110> now<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.800> flame<00:02:43.280> off<00:02:43.610> you

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
it off here to say now the flame off you

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.770 
it off here to say now the flame off you
can<00:02:44.630> see<00:02:44.960> and<00:02:45.350> I've<00:02:46.130> slowed<00:02:46.460> this<00:02:46.700> down<00:02:47.060> but

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
can see and I've slowed this down but

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.280 
can see and I've slowed this down but
you<00:02:48.290> can<00:02:48.440> see<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.860> glow<00:02:49.130> from<00:02:49.550> that

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
you can see the glow from that

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.930 
you can see the glow from that
combustion<00:02:51.290> chamber<00:02:51.770> that<00:02:52.490> combustion

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
combustion chamber that combustion

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.110 
combustion chamber that combustion
chamber<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.750> supposed<00:02:54.410> to<00:02:54.650> reflect<00:02:54.950> heat<00:02:55.460> back

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
chamber is supposed to reflect heat back

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.840 
chamber is supposed to reflect heat back
into<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.690> fire<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:58.900> complete<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.080> burn<00:03:00.290> that

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
into the fire and complete the burn that

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.370 
into the fire and complete the burn that
atomize<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:01.880> atomized<00:03:02.720> oil<00:03:03.580> needs<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.790> be

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
atomize the atomized oil needs to be

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.229 
atomize the atomized oil needs to be
evaporated<00:03:06.380> before<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:06.980> can<00:03:07.130> burn<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:07.880> what<00:03:08.120> it

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
evaporated before it can burn so what it

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.540 
evaporated before it can burn so what it
does<00:03:08.450> is<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.050> reflects<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:09.680> heat<00:03:10.010> back<00:03:10.040> in

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
does is it reflects that heat back in

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.100 
does is it reflects that heat back in
there<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:11.150> want<00:03:11.360> as<00:03:11.480> much<00:03:11.780> heat<00:03:12.080> as

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
there and you want as much heat as

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.400 
there and you want as much heat as
possible<00:03:12.850> in<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.360> flame<00:03:14.690> because<00:03:15.050> you'll

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
possible in the flame because you'll

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.770 
possible in the flame because you'll
want<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.770> make<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.190> most<00:03:16.489> complete<00:03:17.030> burn<00:03:17.450> you

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
want to make the most complete burn you

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.740 
want to make the most complete burn you
can<00:03:17.989> get<00:03:18.520> now<00:03:19.520> this<00:03:19.730> is<00:03:19.910> extended<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.540> lot

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
can get now this is extended a lot

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.920 
can get now this is extended a lot
longer<00:03:21.050> than<00:03:21.380> normally<00:03:22.010> would<00:03:22.310> stay<00:03:23.060> glowing

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
longer than normally would stay glowing

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.600 
longer than normally would stay glowing
but<00:03:24.230> these<00:03:24.440> things<00:03:24.739> should<00:03:25.070> they<00:03:25.550> should

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
but these things should they should

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.210 
but these things should they should
start<00:03:26.090> glowing<00:03:26.420> within<00:03:26.900> about<00:03:27.020> 30<00:03:27.500> seconds<00:03:28.070> of

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
start glowing within about 30 seconds of

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.070 
start glowing within about 30 seconds of
the<00:03:29.030> burger<00:03:29.360> coming<00:03:29.690> on<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:32.480> start<00:03:32.750> reflecting

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
the burger coming on to start reflecting

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.880 
the burger coming on to start reflecting
that<00:03:33.560> heat<00:03:33.830> back<00:03:34.190> into<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.640> fire
