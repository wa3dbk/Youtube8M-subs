00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.540
 speak up 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.360
 Do you realize that there is still enough 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.760
 drinking liquids with the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.650
 if this is good or if it is bad if 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.140
 This does not disturb 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.039
 Let's talk here. Let's see if it's 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.080
 good or not 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.930
 good no doubt that travels more 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.750
 This though not this technique does not 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.809
 fattening to drink liquids with non-food 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.399
 It has nothing to do with waking up or losing weight. 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.800
 in the pool on the value issue 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.350
 well know if you make a 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.539
 average of three thousand calories and you take 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.289
 water during meals or will not give 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.049
 the same 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.929
 What happens is the following to a diet 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:51.510
 of 3 thousand calories and takes orange juice 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.159
 without counting these three thousand calories 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.129
 So you're getting three, you 're already 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.889
 rising 3 500 and that does make a difference 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.019
 Yes, it can gain weight but it was a diet 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:04.080
 poorly prepared was not accounted for 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.810
 which should be increased 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.689
 belly is increased by a 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.119
 very simple reason to take a bladder and 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.780
 put it is three bananas in time by 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.340
 example 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.649
 now take that same bunk places 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.299
 three bananas and half a liter of 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.829
 subsoil whatever you want 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.289
 which will have a larger volume with 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.450
 sure here's more stuff in there then 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.880
 it is obvious to understand why it increases 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.210
 belly but raises belly forever 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.749
 also do not just see exactly how the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.460
 bladder is our stomach it can 

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:37.049
 increase and decrease or when 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.039
 you have spent time phasing it 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.229
 start going out 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.420
 He's coming back to normal in the belly. 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.450
 stay inside that's only temporary 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.999
 thing of maximum two hours is 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.579
 depending on what you eat of course a 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:52.380
 problem is that sometimes we will say that 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.630
 Your stomach is that big and you? 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.920
 eat will pay tomorrow you take water and 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.389
 It's going to that size. 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.369
 only when this water goes away and 

00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:01.020
 back to that original size and 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.539
 stay a little bigger 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.569
 I'm a little bigger in the next 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.170
 meal will make you eat more if 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.420
 you 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.819
 the person who does not count calories 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.700
 weighs 71 eating out with him 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.430
 according to the will of the people who have 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.620
 diet will I eat 300 grams of 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.260
 potatoes 200 grams of chicken and can 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.660
 staying in shape or not staying does not matter 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.069
 there is no difference now if a point 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.980
 quite interesting 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.900
 excess of vehicles dilutes the sucking 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.530
 that liquid is inside the stomach 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.620
 that is, it will decrease the potential of 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.260
 hydrogen or ph also has the 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.680
 pool and the girl who are enzymes and 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.350
 diluted diluting is that 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.569
 gastric you mess up you leave more 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.140
 delayed digestion may cause 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.269
 gas reflux is actually lenses fact 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.090
 many types of problems 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.790
 okay but laws that I spoke of over if 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.890
 you consume there 500 grams of food in 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.180
 a liter of water is sure to give a 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.330
 type of problem 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.590
 now if you click here eat and consume 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.320
 l 100 200 not more than 300 ml together with 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.030
 of any type of liquid not 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.820
 Are you going to have the best kind of problem? 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.650
 Of course, if 100 to 300 ml I remember how much 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.200
 Consumption depends on whether you are a guy 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.120
 too loud if you're a very low guy 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.130
 you will probably have a difference 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.170
 Stomach Stomach Size Will Be Yes 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.720
 others did not convince as soon as 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.079
 smaller than consuming less quantity for 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.910
 not have to be made negative to 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.730
 Do not want to send anything you have to avoid. 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.070
 liquid 30 minutes before the meal or 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.320
 I'm going to eat two in the afternoon one 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.989
 email sent me my last drink of water 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.359
 of rain after the meal 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.329
 depends on the contribution of the meal was one 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.440
 Solid meal expects at least two 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.260
 hours that is the time that makes a 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.630
 legal gastric emptying is less 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.670
 missing a weight loss diet 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.859
 I'm just a little bit like it 's possible 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.560
 after an hour without any problem 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.690
