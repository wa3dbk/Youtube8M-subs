00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
exactly going to do this there's maybe

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.219

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
they were able to get nitrous on the

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.480 
they were able to get nitrous on the
nitrous<00:04:25.870> they<00:04:25.990> can<00:04:26.169> use<00:04:26.350> to<00:04:26.560> get<00:04:26.680> a<00:04:26.860> one-time

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490

boost and

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.879 
boost and
every<00:04:28.259> time<00:04:28.409> they<00:04:28.560> went<00:04:28.650> through<00:04:28.830> a

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
every time they went through a

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.589 
every time they went through a
checkpoint<00:04:29.129> they<00:04:29.729> would<00:04:29.909> get<00:04:30.000> more<00:04:30.150> nitrous

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599
