better<00:00:27.840> as<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> team<00:00:28.170> but<00:00:28.529> i<00:00:28.590> think<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.849> know

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
offensively you know i think we'll move

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.470

protection all those things it worked

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.429 
protection all those things it worked
out<00:01:32.400> well<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.030> that's<00:01:33.810> that's<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
out well and and that's that's the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.499 
out well and and that's that's the
that's<00:01:34.799> how<00:01:35.040> important<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.820> position

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
that's how important that that position

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.620 
that's how important that that position
is<00:01:36.829> because<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.250> know<00:01:38.369> all<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.240> know<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.390> get

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
is because you know all you know you get

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.700 
is because you know all you know you get
a<00:01:39.659> two<00:01:39.840> or<00:01:39.869> three<00:01:40.079> field<00:01:40.290> goals<00:01:40.320> they<00:01:40.500> start

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
a two or three field goals they start

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.410 
a two or three field goals they start
adding<00:01:40.890> up<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.250> they<00:01:41.790> had<00:01:41.970> started<00:01:42.210> having

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
adding up and they had started having

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.030 
adding up and they had started having
significance<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.200> terms<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.619> whether<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
significance in terms of whether it's a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.710 
significance in terms of whether it's a
two<00:01:44.220> score<00:01:44.369> game<00:01:44.579> three<00:01:45.000> score<00:01:45.240> game<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.600> so

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
two score game three score game and so

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.080 
two score game three score game and so
on<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:47.340> know<00:01:47.460> when<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.670> come<00:01:47.880> away<00:01:48.000> with

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
two captains out and they were each for

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.660 
two captains out and they were each for
place<00:04:00.959> by<00:04:01.170> freshman<00:04:01.739> one<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.010> redshirt<00:04:02.430> Maddie

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
place by freshman one a redshirt Maddie

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.000 
place by freshman one a redshirt Maddie
another<00:04:03.090> true<00:04:03.360> freshman<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:03.870> airy<00:04:04.019> on<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.470> I
