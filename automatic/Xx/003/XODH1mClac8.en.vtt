start with a sound that has nowhere

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.950 
start with a sound that has nowhere
graphic<00:01:32.799> equalizer<00:01:33.190> engaged<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:33.940> it's<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.420> flat

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
graphic equalizer engaged so it's a flat

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.249 
graphic equalizer engaged so it's a flat
sound<00:01:35.259> nothing<00:01:35.830> boosted<00:01:36.220> nothing<00:01:36.759> cut<00:01:37.259> here

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
sound nothing boosted nothing cut here

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:51.270 
sound nothing boosted nothing cut here
is<00:01:38.440> my<00:01:38.740> regular<00:01:39.460> sound

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.190 

and<00:01:52.409> first<00:01:53.409> I'm<00:01:53.650> gonna<00:01:54.240> work<00:01:55.240> on<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.570> base

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
and first I'm gonna work on the base

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.740 
and first I'm gonna work on the base
frequency<00:01:56.979> so<00:01:57.220> here<00:01:57.490> I<00:01:57.520> have<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:59.909> base<00:02:00.909> cut<00:02:01.360> and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
frequency so here I have a base cut and

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.260 
frequency so here I have a base cut and
start<00:02:01.990> with<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.140> cutting<00:02:03.040> it<00:02:03.430> really<00:02:03.700> taking

that's<00:03:45.790> what<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.930> real<00:03:48.660> emphasis<00:03:49.660> of<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.870> good

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
that's what the real emphasis of a good

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.140 
that's what the real emphasis of a good
electric<00:03:50.709> guitar<00:03:51.010> sound<00:03:51.340> is<00:03:51.549> so<00:03:51.610> when<00:03:52.060> you

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
electric guitar sound is so when you

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.840 
electric guitar sound is so when you
take<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:52.420> away<00:03:52.780> it<00:03:53.280> basically<00:03:54.280> kills

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
take that away it basically kills

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
take that away it basically kills
everything<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:56.890> here<00:03:57.099> is<00:03:57.280> with<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> mid<00:03:58.450> cut

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
everything so here is with a mid cut

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:09.900 
everything so here is with a mid cut
okay<00:04:00.000> lowered

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:26.000 

you

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.080 

yeah<00:04:27.010> very<00:04:27.370> thin<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.870> if<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.710> want<00:04:29.890> to<00:04:30.130> be

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
yeah very thin and if you want to be

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.420 
yeah very thin and if you want to be
hard<00:04:31.330> in<00:04:31.480> a<00:04:31.570> band<00:04:31.840> especially<00:04:32.350> because<00:04:33.160> there

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
hard in a band especially because there

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.530 
hard in a band especially because there
you<00:04:33.550> have<00:04:33.760> everyone's<00:04:34.690> fighting<00:04:35.370> for

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
you have everyone's fighting for

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.920 
you have everyone's fighting for
frequency<00:04:38.100> space<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:39.700> like<00:04:40.060> vocals<00:04:40.660> and

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
frequency space and like vocals and

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.470 
frequency space and like vocals and
keyboards<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:41.860> guitar<00:04:41.890> they<00:04:42.370> are<00:04:42.520> all<00:04:42.820> in<00:04:43.390> the

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
keyboards and guitar they are all in the

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.650 
keyboards and guitar they are all in the
mid-range<00:04:44.220> see<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.700> you<00:04:45.880> want<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.240> be<00:04:46.510> hard

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
mid-range see and you want to be hard

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.880 
mid-range see and you want to be hard
most<00:04:46.990> of<00:04:47.230> course<00:04:47.770> your<00:04:48.220> guitarist<00:04:48.730> and<00:04:49.890> so

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
most of course your guitarist and so

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.960 
most of course your guitarist and so
then<00:04:51.070> you<00:04:51.190> need<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:52.020> boost<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.320> mids<00:04:53.560> and<00:04:53.970> this

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
then you need to boost the mids and this

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.870 
then you need to boost the mids and this
is<00:04:55.120> also<00:04:55.300> a<00:04:55.510> trick<00:04:55.900> that's<00:04:56.110> used<00:04:56.380> for<00:04:56.880> soloing

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
is also a trick that's used for soloing

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.750 
is also a trick that's used for soloing
to<00:04:58.690> just<00:04:58.960> let<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.830> guitar<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.250> shine<00:05:00.730> through

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
to just let the guitar it shine through

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.570 
to just let the guitar it shine through
in<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.270> mix<00:05:01.450> used<00:05:01.900> by<00:05:02.110> guys<00:05:02.620> like<00:05:02.680> /<00:05:03.250> for

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
in the mix used by guys like / for

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.190 
in the mix used by guys like / for
instance<00:05:03.910> uses<00:05:04.480> exactly<00:05:05.380> this<00:05:05.650> a<00:05:06.150> mid-range

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
instance uses exactly this a mid-range

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.200 
instance uses exactly this a mid-range
boost<00:05:08.200> on<00:05:08.650> a<00:05:08.710> graphic<00:05:09.400> equalizer<00:05:09.550> para

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
boost on a graphic equalizer para

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.780 
boost on a graphic equalizer para
usually<00:05:12.330> okay<00:05:13.330> here<00:05:13.810> this<00:05:14.110> am<00:05:14.350> it<00:05:15.040> boosts<00:05:15.640> and

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
usually okay here this am it boosts and

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:27.820 
usually okay here this am it boosts and
hired<00:05:16.770> pushed<00:05:17.770> mid-range

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:36.239 

Oh

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:36.249 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:43.460 

Oh

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.770 

okay<00:05:44.470> who<00:05:44.740> do<00:05:44.890> you<00:05:44.980> think<00:05:45.010> will<00:05:45.430> be<00:05:46.300> hard<00:05:46.510> most

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
okay who do you think will be hard most

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.980 
okay who do you think will be hard most
in<00:05:46.960> the<00:05:47.050> band<00:05:47.200> the<00:05:47.350> guy<00:05:47.500> with<00:05:47.710> a<00:05:47.740> low<00:05:48.750> mid<00:05:49.750> range

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
in the band the guy with a low mid range

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.120 
in the band the guy with a low mid range
of<00:05:50.200> the<00:05:50.350> high<00:05:50.530> mid<00:05:51.190> range<00:05:51.430> yep<00:05:53.010> it's<00:05:54.010> very

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
of the high mid range yep it's very

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.800 
of the high mid range yep it's very
simple<00:05:54.450> okay<00:05:55.450> finally<00:05:55.960> for<00:05:56.290> high<00:05:56.560> frequencies

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
simple okay finally for high frequencies

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.780 
simple okay finally for high frequencies
here<00:05:58.810> we<00:05:59.020> have<00:05:59.170> a<00:05:59.970> high<00:06:00.970> cut<00:06:01.450> where<00:06:01.780> you

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
here we have a high cut where you

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.040 
here we have a high cut where you
basically<00:06:03.790> taking<00:06:04.570> all<00:06:04.720> the<00:06:04.900> high

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
basically taking all the high

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.370 
basically taking all the high
frequencies<00:06:05.710> way<00:06:06.150> and<00:06:07.150> that<00:06:07.480> get<00:06:07.660> gives<00:06:08.140> you<00:06:08.350> a

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
frequencies way and that get gives you a

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.800 
frequencies way and that get gives you a
rather<00:06:08.620> on<00:06:08.890> loaf<00:06:09.460> I<00:06:09.820> and<00:06:11.610> not<00:06:12.610> very<00:06:12.940> modern

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
rather on loaf I and not very modern

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.410 
rather on loaf I and not very modern
sound<00:06:14.230> and<00:06:14.770> that<00:06:15.040> some<00:06:15.790> people<00:06:16.060> use<00:06:16.210> this

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
sound and that some people use this

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:49.480 
sound and that some people use this
action<00:06:16.900> yep<00:06:17.260> here<00:06:17.680> we<00:06:17.710> go<00:06:17.860> hi<00:06:18.700> cut

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:35.930 
maybe not in such a pleasant way here
these<00:07:34.680> frequencies<00:07:35.340> you<00:07:35.460> have<00:07:35.610> all<00:07:35.759> the

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:35.940 
these frequencies you have all the

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:41.629 
these frequencies you have all the
noises<00:07:36.150> that<00:07:36.569> annoy<00:07:37.500> us<00:07:38.150> and<00:07:39.150> basically<00:07:40.639> okay
