the following one we went for such

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.410 
the following one we went for such
design<00:01:08.620> everything<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.550> as<00:01:09.790> you<00:01:09.940> can<00:01:10.090> see<00:01:10.240> from

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
design everything is as you can see from

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.340 
design everything is as you can see from
potted<00:01:10.900> to<00:01:11.410> easily<00:01:11.860> integrate<00:01:12.510> 306<00:01:13.510> even<00:01:14.050> in

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
potted to easily integrate 306 even in

small<00:01:14.920> rooms<00:01:15.160> so<00:01:15.700> right<00:01:16.000> from<00:01:16.300> 12<00:01:16.660> square

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
small rooms so right from 12 square

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.540 
small rooms so right from 12 square
meters<00:01:17.110> rooms<00:01:17.670> 306<00:01:18.670> are<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.510> perfect<00:01:19.780> tool<00:01:20.550> in

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
meters rooms 306 are the perfect tool in

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.760 
meters rooms 306 are the perfect tool in
terms<00:01:21.880> of<00:01:22.000> design<00:01:22.450> also<00:01:22.750> something<00:01:23.320> very

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
terms of design also something very

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.860 
terms of design also something very
convenient<00:01:24.190> to<00:01:24.640> optimize<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.390> speaker's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
convenient to optimize the speaker's

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.590 
convenient to optimize the speaker's
integration<00:01:26.470> within<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:26.920> room<00:01:27.100> is<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.390> fact

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
integration within the room is the fact

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.750 
integration within the room is the fact
that<00:01:28.660> you<00:01:28.840> can<00:01:29.020> rotate<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.740> tweets<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.340> meet

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
that you can rotate the tweets and meet

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.620 
that you can rotate the tweets and meet
plates<00:01:31.650> 360<00:01:32.650> degree<00:01:32.950> per<00:01:33.160> step<00:01:33.460> of<00:01:33.640> 90<00:01:34.330> degrees

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
plates 360 degree per step of 90 degrees

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.220 
plates 360 degree per step of 90 degrees
that's<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:35.140> say<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:35.560> can<00:01:35.950> either<00:01:36.190> use<00:01:36.870> 306<00:01:37.870> or

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
that's to say you can either use 306 or

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.480 
that's to say you can either use 306 or
ism<00:01:38.710> tool<00:01:38.890> like<00:01:39.130> that<00:01:39.160> or<00:01:39.930> vertical<00:01:40.930> as<00:01:41.110> well

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
ism tool like that or vertical as well

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.060 
ism tool like that or vertical as well
so<00:01:42.490> this<00:01:42.910> is<00:01:42.970> also<00:01:43.720> on<00:01:43.870> our<00:01:43.900> key<00:01:44.620> benefits

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
so this is also on our key benefits

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.580 
so this is also on our key benefits

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
technologies that allows you to either

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.340 
technologies that allows you to either
use<00:02:33.950> three<00:02:34.250> or<00:02:34.430> six<00:02:34.670> on<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.480> freeway<00:02:35.930> design

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
use three or six on the freeway design

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.970 
use three or six on the freeway design
that's<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.070> say<00:02:37.250> 35<00:02:37.850> Earth's<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.540> 40<00:02:38.870> K<00:02:39.050> or<00:02:39.260> if

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
that's to say 35 Earth's to 40 K or if

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.820 
that's to say 35 Earth's to 40 K or if
you<00:02:40.250> click<00:02:40.550> on<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:41.300> foot<00:02:41.510> switch<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:42.410> will

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
you click on the foot switch you will

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.850 
you click on the foot switch you will
activate<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.520> two-way<00:02:44.030> design<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:44.810> this<00:02:45.470> part

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
activate the two-way design so this part

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.600 
activate the two-way design so this part
only<00:02:46.280> 90<00:02:47.270> Earth's<00:02:47.510> 20<00:02:48.020> K<00:02:48.200> obviously<00:02:49.190> on<00:02:49.370> the

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
only 90 Earth's 20 K obviously on the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.870 
only 90 Earth's 20 K obviously on the
back<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.940> these<00:02:50.090> plates<00:02:50.920> this<00:02:51.920> path<00:02:52.550> is

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
back of these plates this path is

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.300 
back of these plates this path is
totally<00:02:53.360> sealed<00:02:53.690> from<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.470> subwoofer<00:02:55.040> part

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
totally sealed from the subwoofer part

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.000 
totally sealed from the subwoofer part
so<00:02:55.489> there<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.760> no<00:02:56.000> passive<00:02:56.450> functioning

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
so there is no passive functioning

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.640 
so there is no passive functioning
between<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.160> drivers<00:02:58.690> these<00:02:59.690> are<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.380> key

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
between the drivers these are the key

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.190 
between the drivers these are the key
points<00:03:01.220> about<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.550> 306<00:03:02.090> visit<00:03:02.810> gear<00:03:02.989> for

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
points about the 306 visit gear for
