00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.169
 really hard 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.329
 and it is also quite thick 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.649
 19 millimeters thick around 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.519
 and also quite wide at the same time 50 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.229
 Minmetal's ear 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.700
 more like men's heart for women's hands 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.710
 but often they are not so good 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.630
 to hold 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.270

 Speed ​​and otherwise also the Kita St and 11 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.440
 unfortunately not in it 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.080
 not built in 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.930
 accordingly again EPIA is still hot and real so fast 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.730
 Internet 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.090
 it is not comforting for that 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.870
 so not even here 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.290
 in which 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.460
 Go to news folder 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.760
 Howman know the keyboard down here 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.760
 Kastner believes that you do not have a very good one 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.560
 a Roux and already clearly separated from each other 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.420
 However, they are already explained 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.420
 but have a reasonable bigger Bergman has to be 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.530
 in spite of desire 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.610
 yes I have to say so we have a very pleasant pressure point there 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.730
 very good box up here 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.690

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.020
 Tenants also from time to time have typed now around 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.030

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.310
 From the processing for me in total, mobile phone is not quite as high 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.879

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.129
 Unfortunately the top essay lead 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.419
 what's going on a bit back and forth 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:22.859
 the brain 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.659
 Of course that is a bit silly if it breaks " 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.979
 and also back here that would have to be victorious at the nuclear wreck to the dealership 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.519
 would have to 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.699
 Snakes basic pattern 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.069
 Of course this is a matter of taste so the phone makes a total 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.679
 a little bit the impression that Samsung has now 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:44.429
