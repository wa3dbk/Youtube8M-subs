00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.870
 in this episode heartily influence TV 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.320
 the new apple imac in it one 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.320
 half an inch 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.400
 the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.060
 welcome to heart in which for tv 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.250
 apple has a new version of the 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.779
 imac 21 and a half inches 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.340
 and then came in here and I asked you 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.779
 what is the big difference with the 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.430
 Pastor did not receive an answer that I 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.470
 really totally did not expect he is the 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.149
 buyer has cheaper you that is one 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.590
 actually a thunderstorm at the same over 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.940
 already have a product with him 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.440
 what becomes cheaper or it alone 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.770
 they last a while, they become a little 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.270
 faster 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.300
 yes yes look and in itself we think so 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.250
 very logical choice than the standard 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.820
 imac 21.5 inches where we got it where we now 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.340
 have left 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.840
 yes that was actually provided 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.460
 standard of one of the quad core 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.740
 processor are best also core i5 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.860
 processor in itself a very nice tasty 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.840
 fast processor it also costs in 1329 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.720
 what they have done now they have 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.440
 new model introduced 1129 euros 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.239
 cost that 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.369
 and there is a dual core i5 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.100
 processor in yes the joke is if you even 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.710
 going to normal retail stores 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.560
 So the media market and BCC are that kind 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.420
 stores there actually don't become PCs 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.030
 sold more than a thousand euros 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.170
 except from a brand namely apple but 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.729
 you see that even apple that is actually 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.439
 realizing maybe we should 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.880
 we want to make something even cheaper 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.200
 wider target group can handle fast yes okay 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.240
 that is also a bit of the question of work 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.770
 I what does that normal user need 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.880
 watch as you look at the typical ones 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.880
 use it as a system like this 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.109
 is going to buy and then will not necessarily be whole 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.729
 are very thinking for me 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.109
 must have a super high and graphic card 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.009
 need on my very heavy 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.659
 Processor 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.009
 yes such a test also core i5 son evil 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.990
 buyers and his quite powerful he the 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.490
 well what is actually done here 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.109
 is that they technique a little bit 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.920
 resembles the macbook team 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:52.270
 stopped so a core i5 4260 hours yes t 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.789
 so she is actually one 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.200
 cell process such as a fall like 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.819
 well by full this so for you we 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.319
 came up with ultrabooks but also fits perfectly 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.880
 here yes and if you look at it 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.740
 performance level of that chip yes that is 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.109
 just fine is intel hd graphics 5000 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.609
 no that is also great to work with 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.979
 is not very special and not 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.990
 fantastic but yes for the 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.920
 application of such a machine is possible there 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.510
 you fine with that 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.520
 Leo dressed have combined such with 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.340
 a 500 gigabyte hold disk in that 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.849
 expensive version is a one terabyte 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.160
 versions 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.450
 look if you are just looking for a machine that 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.030
 can put on a desk 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.740
 the modern slang is as you can see 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.290
 Yeah so 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.070
 and have a beautiful design then yes 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.840
 it is fine in itself 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.490
 it simply remains an expensive device the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.500
 don't have to talk about it for long 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.180
 because at that moment by up to 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.160
 then I might be the sour PC 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.020
 but he is indeed 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.140
 be cheaper there is more than 100 euros 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.730
 from now it costs eleven 129 euros but whatever 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.670
 you get is indeed just a double 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.320
 chorus laptop processor and standard 500 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.420
 gigabyte hard drive you eat i want you 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.340
 the graphics well I have to admit it 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.880
 screen is of no quality 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.550
 Brands 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.150
 but it is similar in specs well not really 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.590
 special 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.420
 it's not very special and look 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.580
 i have to be look k-design is it 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.260
 with you yes you have to wood or you get out of the reeds 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.570
 but hope people will find it quite 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.520
 TV can be very nice for the day 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.900
 the sales figures that you lie don't matter 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.280
 it also covers terms 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.480
 user friendliness of the 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.950
 OS challenge you can 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.360
 also have a very long time left 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.160
 comes standard with 8 gigabytes 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.260
 you cannot use their gray memory 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.670
 but let's say well archives 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.360
 especially for this target group more 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.610
 then sufficient 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.440
 yes it's an it's an interesting one 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.450
 configuration but also if you are within it 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.800
 you have to watch the apple program 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.090
 even a little behind the ears 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.200
 scratching and I just grabbed it 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.150
 I think 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.230
 which other laptop have 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.280
 they actually have a different product 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.990
 they are also in the program 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.920
 cheap is prince too according to apple 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.040
 concepts of cheap 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.900
 yes they macbook air 11 11 inch which i 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.760
 this is the cheapest 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.160
 laptop that has apple and I like it 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.780
 cheapest apple product with screen of 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.490
 macos o'briens you possibly have the mac 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.980
 mini but yes look if you look at this 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.750
 in deficit this costs nine us 29 euros this 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.130
 is the version with a 128 gigabyte 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.330
 SSD on board 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.280
 yes and there is quite a bit of it 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.410
 someone is about when you go it goes 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.730
 see what the experience is between these 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.650
 two devices 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.810
 yes then you just notice that he is hard 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.940
 disk that are inside that that if you 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.740
 have seen an SSD once and are 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.790
 very slow indeed I think so 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.530
 personally very unfortunate 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.210
 and if you look then look well 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.440
 this costs nine 129 euros 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.810
 well me for example you here one 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.070
 nice sexy external hard drive 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.190
 from van toshiba 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.840
 which fits nicely with 500 g 50 euros 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.790
 Well you also have other brands 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.860
 combine screen almost there and you have 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.570
 also a very nice workplace and 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.550
 and much faster a combination yes well 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.870
 just for the whisper joke 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.700
 we have been the one for years 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.300
 some apples and pears just compare 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.860
 that is what you call this technology 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.780
 a version with you still needs 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.110
 easier to take with you is me 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.640
 started cheaper faster and indeed 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.230
 put screen next to one is how we 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.790
 lucky hours of yes certainly because of 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.710
 the fact that it is your SSD 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.360
 okay then there is none that psg mouth to 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.130
 copper and lead ipe screen at core 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.320
 got surrounded in price comparison 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.750
 125 under 50 euros you can fine screen 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.930
 can even buy another inch and large 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.190
 take 24 once you go even after pressing ok 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.500
 keyboard and mouse at apple that are 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.760
 standard also quite expensive so if you 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.740
 choose what else you can do that from 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.790
 seller have yes then he can get it 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.710
 also just take it with you 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.390
 yes well it still just a moment back to 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.580
 the new imac what i am looking forward to 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.440
 actually goes on to say that two 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.180
 years ago the story has always been 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.560
 Those PC manufacturers all mark it 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.750
 they don't understand if you need a good one already 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.100
 a man wants is really only one 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.620
 choice for the past two years 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.900
 here often sat with everyone 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.640
 various PC manufacturers water 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.680
 at least they had to admit it 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.020
 Slowly does go forward a little then 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.380
 a bit better product on the market 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.720
 And so the question of is this thing 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.030
 say its place at the top by now 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.950
 is it threatened or is it always 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.210
 just less how you all one and then 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.220
 won't throw right either 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.780
 Well look if you are an all-in-one 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.120
 want to put together the way you want to 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.190
 the store goes and says well I choose 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.410
 for the SD version or with it 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.870
 or whether that combination of hard disk and 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.160
 a ssd you that you offer that app then 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.300
 can be very beautiful all-in-ones 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.890
 compile 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.630
 I have to say that even when you go 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.980
 see what the average PC manufacturer 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.020
 so set it as a standard trick 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.670
 not so very exciting but it 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.140
 more and more choice is coming that 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.030
 box indeed because last for example 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.530
 that and maschine studio that indicates 42 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.000
 is also a bit bigger than it is 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.320
 once a tea and screen on 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.910
 Now you have weather is for example one 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.290
 standard ssd in so there are 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.910
 been very interesting and that is 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.530
 also not a bad one that screen 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.150
 whole no so yes this is something to choose 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.380
 I have to say he stays a point 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.180
 of course you mean important 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.729
 or not but for the time being apple and ivory 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.620
 their location 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.969
 touchscreen no touchscreen but yes it is 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.210
 very nice eps screen 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:39.770
 yes and just very slim design for this 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.870
 Something for everyone and with it came to it 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.270
 end of this episode of heart again 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.740
 for tv we are there every monday 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.539
 Wednesday and Friday 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.099
 thanks for looking and see you 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:50.870
 next time 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:53.120
 this angle at which we actually almost 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.439
 it is impossible that we always see something 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.189
 at the market for storage with ipe 

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:56.479
 screens 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:57.529
 yes normal for us a bit kind 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:58.879
 weatherman we usually have nothing 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.589
 Protecting someone also stands as a one 

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:02.059
 and product is here but it goes this one 

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:04.009
 times just very good also the 

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:05.029
 vertical viewing angle is pretty good but it 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:06.379
 is not a touchscreen 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:08.330
 you see that with most windows 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:11.110
 certainly in salmans in this price range 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.110
 yes that 's nice
