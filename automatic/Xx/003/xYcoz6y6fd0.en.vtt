00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
different leather and I did notice a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.539 
different leather and I did notice a
little<00:01:29.939> difference<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:32.310> proclamation

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
little difference and the proclamation

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.620 
little difference and the proclamation
Bible<00:01:33.329> has<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.650> Highland<00:01:34.650> ghost<00:01:34.890> skin<00:01:35.630> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
Bible has the Highland ghost skin and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.330 
Bible has the Highland ghost skin and
the<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> ESV<00:01:38.250> says<00:01:39.090> go<00:01:39.390> skin<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the one on the ESV says go skin and you

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.609 
the one on the ESV says go skin and you
can<00:01:41.490> definitely<00:01:41.640> tell<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.420> one<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
can definitely tell that this one the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.929 
can definitely tell that this one the
texture<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.130> little<00:01:44.430> bit<00:01:44.520> different<00:01:44.880> it

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
texture is a little bit different it

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.219 
texture is a little bit different it
feels<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> little<00:01:45.659> bit<00:01:45.750> more<00:01:45.869> raised

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
feels like it's a little bit more raised

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.560 
feels like it's a little bit more raised
and<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> little<00:01:47.790> bit<00:01:47.970> softer<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and this one is a little bit softer and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.109 
and this one is a little bit softer and
a<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.780> bit<00:01:48.990> smoother<00:01:49.610> I<00:01:50.610> wouldn't<00:01:51.030> say

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
a little bit smoother I wouldn't say

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.520 
a little bit smoother I wouldn't say
it's<00:01:51.240> really<00:01:51.479> softer<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.229> feels

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
it's really softer it just feels

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.249 
it's really softer it just feels
smoother<00:01:53.130> actually<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.750> one<00:01:54.930> feels<00:01:55.140> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
smoother actually and this one feels a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.389 
smoother actually and this one feels a
little<00:01:55.350> bit<00:01:55.590> different<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.040> probably<00:01:56.189> just

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
little bit different and probably just

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.100 
little bit different and probably just
because<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.820> has<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> little<00:01:57.240> bit<00:01:57.390> more<00:01:57.450> raised

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
because it has a little bit more raised

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.160 
because it has a little bit more raised
edges<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.860> really<00:01:59.850> like<00:02:00.030> them<00:02:00.270> both<00:02:00.479> one<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.990> not

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
edges I really like them both one is not

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.600 
edges I really like them both one is not
better<00:02:01.380> than<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.799> other<00:02:01.829> they're<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.549> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
better than the other they're just a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.910 
better than the other they're just a

this<00:02:41.430> red<00:02:41.880> cloth<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.660> try<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.900> make<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.140> a

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
this red cloth to try to make it a

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.100 
this red cloth to try to make it a
little<00:02:43.500> bit<00:02:43.650> easier<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.069> see<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.459> colors<00:02:44.819> and

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
little bit easier to see the colors and

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.110 
little bit easier to see the colors and
I'm<00:02:46.110> gonna<00:02:46.290> hold<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.709> camera<00:02:46.739> in<00:02:47.130> my<00:02:47.220> hand<00:02:47.610> for

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
I'm gonna hold the camera in my hand for

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.449 
I'm gonna hold the camera in my hand for
my<00:02:48.239> ESP<00:02:48.690> review<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.080> held<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.680> tripod<00:02:50.220> and

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
my ESP review I held it in a tripod and

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.890 
my ESP review I held it in a tripod and
I<00:02:50.519> think<00:02:50.730> at<00:02:50.819> times<00:02:50.850> maybe<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.480> couldn't<00:02:51.720> see

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
I think at times maybe you couldn't see

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.110 
I think at times maybe you couldn't see
the<00:02:51.989> color<00:02:52.200> very<00:02:52.500> well<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.580> font<00:02:53.880> very

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
the color very well and the font very

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.210 
the color very well and the font very
well<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:55.110> might<00:02:55.260> be<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.440> little<00:02:55.709> shaky<00:02:55.860> this

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
well so it might be a little shaky this

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.380 
well so it might be a little shaky this
way<00:02:56.400> but<00:02:56.610> I'm<00:02:56.700> gonna<00:02:56.850> try<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.030> give<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.330> a

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
a blog post where it says that it was a

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.409 
a blog post where it says that it was a
35<00:06:03.770> weight<00:06:04.010> paper<00:06:04.280> on<00:06:04.640> the<00:06:04.790> old<00:06:04.940> ones<00:06:05.180> and
