00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.980
 to the guys how are you welcome 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.820
 let's start with a hippie hairstyle 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.820
 very move it 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.190
 and then let's go from our hair 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.450
 the medium and then do not dare very well 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.760
 he is addicted because he is super 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.230
 important when making the 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.739
 braids girls 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:41.440
 and let's take a lock of hair and 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.440
 We are going to divide it into three portions 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.580
 and we are going to be making a braid 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.850
 French fed on only one side of 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.210
 your right in the middle of your remains in 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.210
 medium 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.570
 you will always be feeding is the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.570
 cadejo nothing but the one that is toward the 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.850
 direction of your neck the lock is left 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.770
 your face is going to go alone but what 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.290
 you are going to get in the middle of your 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.820
 hair that instead of this for all the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.820
 shore is going to be in the middle 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.610
 if you want you to stay up from the 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.150
 back try to go straight and the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.150
 hair is only going to get up if you do not want 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.150
 normal 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.170
 I will take the direction towards 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.170
 down that straighter 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.869
 and then on the other side we do exactly 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.869
 the same 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.450
 you can also use a comb 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.509
 so that they are more precise 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.149
 amounts of hair you drink and from that 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.149
 way the braid is more straight 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.280
 the dreams 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.370
 dreams 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.130
 two 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.110
 and when we finish we will join 23 appointments 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.480
 now practice you can put a monkey 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.780
 if they want another option is to make a 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.170
 small 3a and pass it by our forehead 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.730
 in the form of a band that is super egypt and 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.040
 girls 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.560
 that is also optional is another option 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.140
 I'm giving it and they put it under 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.130
 of the hair so that you do not notice 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.540
 the last option is the two braids and 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.540
 apart to make you need little girls 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.900
 it would be very very nice it was also a 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.900
 very very red touch 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:39.050
 this has been all boy I hope that you 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.050
 have liked kisses see you soon 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.630
