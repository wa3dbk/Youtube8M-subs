00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
thinking with this which is kind of cool

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.760 
thinking with this which is kind of cool
though<00:01:15.509> some<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.930> them<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> lot<00:01:16.470> some<00:01:16.740> of

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
though some of them have a lot some of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.230 
though some of them have a lot some of
them<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> seven<00:01:17.610> hundred<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
them have up to a seven hundred and

them have up to a seven hundred and
seventy<00:01:18.780> thousand<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.369> not<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
seventy thousand of just one not the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.609 
seventy thousand of just one not the
other<00:01:21.360> though<00:01:21.720> uh<00:01:22.310> i<00:01:23.360> think<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:25.170> i<00:01:25.350> were<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.560> put

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
other though uh i think if i were to put

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.920 
other though uh i think if i were to put
my<00:01:25.890> finger<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.610> i<00:01:26.970> was<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.390> know<00:01:27.570> there's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
my finger on it i was I know there's

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.450 
my finger on it i was I know there's
been<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.110> lot<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.350> complaints<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.040> campaign

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
been a lot of complaints on the campaign

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.609 
been a lot of complaints on the campaign
it's<00:01:29.759> not<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:30.689> need<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> add<00:01:31.079> more<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
it's not really they need to add more to

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.249 
it's not really they need to add more to
it<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.920> think<00:01:32.340> maybe<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.030> them<00:01:33.299> holding<00:01:34.079> us

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
it I think maybe this is them holding us

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.109 
it I think maybe this is them holding us
off<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.920> maybe<00:01:35.130> something<00:01:35.520> that's<00:01:35.640> coming<00:01:36.000> up

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
off for maybe something that's coming up

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.840 
off for maybe something that's coming up
maybe<00:01:36.390> they<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.600> wanted<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.220> ease<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
maybe they just wanted to ease the
