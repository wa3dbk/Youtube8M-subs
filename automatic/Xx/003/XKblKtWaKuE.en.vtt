00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.920
Hey I'm Greg with Hoss Tools.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.000
We're going to be using our new Seeder today
to plant a cove crop in our garden, and we'll

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.040
be planting red crimson clover.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.070
Clover is a great cover crop because it's
a legume.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.860
It adds nitrogen back to the soil.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.650
Also it has a lot of organic matter in the
leaves and stuff that you add back to your

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.010
soil which helps a lot.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.260
Some misconceptions about clover is with the
inoculates.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.279
A lot of people don't understand the inoculates.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.550
And the one we're using today is a coated
clover which makes it really easy because

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.949
the inoculate is actually coated on to that
clover and we don't have to worry about having

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.061
to get the inoculate on there.

00:00:43.061 --> 00:00:46.120
Because that can be kind of a messy situation.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.890
The inoculate that you buy separate that comes
in a bag is kind of like really find dust.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.360
And getting it to stick to those seeds is
kind of tricky.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.170
You can use Coca Cola or you can use water.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.180
You can use some other things, but you have
to get the consistency just right and then

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.970
at that, you still have some problems sometimes.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.680
And those powdered inoculates don't last as
long when they go into the soil as the coated

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.680
ones do.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.480
The coated inoculates will last somewhere
in the vicinity of three weeks.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.250
So that's the reason I would prefer using
the coated inoculates.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.670
Also it helps evenly distribute it throughout
the seeds and it works a lot better in the

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.670
planter.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.150
If you get any kind of moisture in a lot of
the mechanical planters, you're asking for

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.150
problems.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.840
And that's another reason why I like the coated
seeds.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.630
The inoculates, a lot of people think, has
something to do with germination.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.960
But it has absolutely nothing to do with germination.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.800
The inoculate is a beneficial bacteria that
helps that clover attract and retain nitrogen.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.300
So if you're planting clover just strictly
for a cover crop and you don't care that much

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.490
about the nitrogen -- or you're planting it
in a food plot just for wildlife to eat or

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.049
whatever, it's not essential that you use
the inoculate.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.000
I always use the inoculate because we don't
know if we've got enough of that beneficial

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
bacteria or not.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.590
If you've got enough beneficial bacteria in
your soil, then the inoculate is not needed.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.980
But for safety precautions, we always use
the inoculate when we can.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.730
Have I ever planted without the inoculate?

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.730
Yes I have -- and got a good stand.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.170
If you've got soils that have had clovers
in them in the past, you could probably get

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.460
by without using the inoculate.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.530
But no more than it costs, it's a good idea
to use it.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.209
So I made me a plate to plant the clover.

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.120
I just took a number one plate and I drilled
it out because I want to plant the clover

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.810
really close together.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.760
So I put a few more holes in there and I'm
planting about 1 1/2" apart.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.110
I drilled out the holes a little bit because
I'm dealing with a coated seed as you can

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.110
see here.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.710
And that coated seed makes the seed a little
bit bigger.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.690
So I had to match my seed up to my seed plate,
so it took me five minutes at the most to

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.730
drill that plate out and to get my spacing
where I wanted it.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.319
As you can see here, there are leaves, there's
some organic matter and there's some grass

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.200
here in the garden.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.700
And that's the great thing about our new Seeder.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.890
With this rolling coulter down here that opens
the furrow, it's going to roll right over

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.890
that.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.050
So if you've got a little trash or it's not
completely level or whatever, it's going to

00:03:20.050 --> 00:05:05.310
work fine for this type of planting.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.090
So it took us just a few minutes with our
Hoss Seeder to plant the clover in the garden

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.090
spot.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.779
October is the best time in south Georgia
to plant clover.

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:18.139
You get a better germination in October than
you do in any other time of the year because

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.779
clover is a winter annual.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.409
The red crimson we planted today is really
good for bees.

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.050
It seems to bloom early in the spring.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.539
It has a pretty color to it.

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.370
It's the same one that you've probably seen
on the right away years ago that grows and

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.059
looks like strawberries.

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:36.990
Another good one that we like is the white
dutch.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.870
The white dutch clover has a lot more heat
tolerance to it and it will grow on into the

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.870
summer.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.199
I have seen it grow pretty much all summer
long.

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:46.490
It thrives in the spring time.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.500
So if you've got a situation where you need
to grow in more heat, consider the white dutch.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.000
Otherwise a lot of the other clovers will
do just fine.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.759
