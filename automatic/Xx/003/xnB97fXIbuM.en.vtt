00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
going to talk about the breath as a

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.280 
going to talk about the breath as a
source<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.090> energy<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:12.870> were<00:00:12.960> also<00:00:13.110> going

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
source of energy and we were also going

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.379 
source of energy and we were also going
to<00:00:13.349> talk<00:00:13.530> about<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.860> cerebral<00:00:14.580> spinal<00:00:14.700> system

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
to talk about the cerebral spinal system

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.840 
to talk about the cerebral spinal system
the<00:00:16.199> organo<00:00:16.560> vegetative<00:00:17.340> system<00:00:17.730> is

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
the organo vegetative system is

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.670 
the organo vegetative system is
stimulated<00:00:18.420> by<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.600> meat<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.230> coffee<00:00:19.470> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
stimulated by the meat the coffee the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.300 
stimulated by the meat the coffee the
sugar<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.939> breads<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.830> what<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.189> does

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
sugar the breads and it and what it does

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.099 
sugar the breads and it and what it does
is<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.390> body<00:00:24.600> says<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.990> is

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
is that this is the body says this is

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.230 
is that this is the body says this is
weird<00:00:25.380> stuff<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:26.550> boosts<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
weird stuff and it just boosts the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.880 
weird stuff and it just boosts the
metabolism<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.990> get<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.230> out<00:00:28.349> that's<00:00:28.710> why

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
metabolism to get it out that's why

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.420 
metabolism to get it out that's why
people<00:00:29.550> love<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.880> meat<00:00:30.380> it<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.980> raises<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
people love the meat it is it raises the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.120 
people love the meat it is it raises the
metabolism<00:00:32.940> by<00:00:33.239> 25<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.989> 40<00:00:34.320> percent<00:00:34.739> because

metabolism by 25 to 40 percent because

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.979 
metabolism by 25 to 40 percent because
the<00:00:35.399> body<00:00:35.550> says<00:00:35.790> wow<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.450> weird<00:00:36.660> this

the body says wow this is weird this

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.410 
the body says wow this is weird this
stuff<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.469> decomposing<00:00:38.219> flesh<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:39.030> every

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
stuff is decomposing flesh and every

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.290 
stuff is decomposing flesh and every
living<00:00:39.930> cell<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.680> your<00:00:40.710> body<00:00:40.910> knows<00:00:41.910> that

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
living cell in your body knows that

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.630 
living cell in your body knows that
there<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.600> mass<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.290> dead<00:00:43.620> cells<00:00:43.980> sitting

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
there is a mass of dead cells sitting

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.029 
there is a mass of dead cells sitting
inside<00:00:44.789> your<00:00:45.300> small<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.260> large<00:00:46.440> intestine

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
inside your small and large intestine

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.459 
inside your small and large intestine
and<00:00:47.210> it<00:00:48.210> says<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.539> got<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.750> get<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.200> out<00:00:49.440> of

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and it says we got to get this out of

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.740 
and it says we got to get this out of
here<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.160> raises<00:00:50.430> up<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> metabolism<00:00:51.120> and

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
here so it raises up the metabolism and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.299 
here so it raises up the metabolism and
you<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> boost<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.500> say<00:00:52.680> well<00:00:52.860> me<00:00:52.980> gives<00:00:53.219> me

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you get a boost you say well me gives me

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.119 
you get a boost you say well me gives me
energy<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:55.020> one<00:00:55.199> sense<00:00:55.500> you're<00:00:55.710> right<00:00:55.920> but

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
energy and in one sense you're right but

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.860 
energy and in one sense you're right but
it's<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.699> kind<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.120> energy<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.660> you

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
it's not the kind of energy that you

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.529 
it's not the kind of energy that you
want<00:00:58.219> now<00:00:59.219> that's<00:00:59.460> why<00:00:59.699> we've<00:00:59.910> got<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> 12

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
want now that's why we've got the 12

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.599 
want now that's why we've got the 12

develop breasts and having their periods

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.130 
develop breasts and having their periods
and<00:01:05.880> that's<00:01:06.390> normal<00:01:07.140> because<00:01:07.950> meat<00:01:08.490> and

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
and that's normal because meat and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.340 
and that's normal because meat and
stimulants<00:01:10.430> stimulate<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:12.150> growth<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.689> in

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
stimulants stimulate the growth and in

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.350 
stimulants stimulate the growth and in
any<00:01:13.590> living<00:01:13.890> organism<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.640> any<00:01:14.820> scientists

any living organism and any scientists

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.530 
any living organism and any scientists
will<00:01:15.509> tell<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.909> longer<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.299> it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
will tell you that the longer that it

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.270 
will tell you that the longer that it
takes<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:19.049> an<00:01:19.110> organism<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.830> reach<00:01:20.009> maturity

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
takes for an organism to reach maturity

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.810 
takes for an organism to reach maturity
is<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.030> length<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.600> animal's<00:01:22.500> life<00:01:22.820> so

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
is the length of that animal's life so

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.760 
is the length of that animal's life so
when<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> little<00:01:24.840> vegetarian<00:01:25.409> or

exercise okay so it's just you've got
more<00:03:05.030> energy<00:03:05.709> than<00:03:06.709> from<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.010> raw<00:03:07.160> food

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
more energy than from the raw food

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.699 
more energy than from the raw food
because<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.390> lot<00:03:08.629> of<00:03:08.660> times<00:03:08.900> we<00:03:09.079> would<00:03:09.230> pass<00:03:09.410> out

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
because a lot of times we would pass out

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.620 
because a lot of times we would pass out
from<00:03:09.889> the<00:03:10.040> heavier<00:03:10.310> cooked<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:11.090> be<00:03:11.329> more<00:03:11.480> like

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
from the heavier cooked it be more like

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.920 
from the heavier cooked it be more like
a<00:03:11.660> sedative<00:03:14.290> what<00:03:15.290> about

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
a sedative what about

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.740 
a sedative what about
combining<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.530> mining<00:03:17.890> fruit<00:03:18.189> because<00:03:19.060> you

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
combining the mining fruit because you

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.360 
combining the mining fruit because you
know<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.319> world<00:03:20.530> I'll<00:03:20.769> always<00:03:20.890> try<00:03:21.310> to

but I see some drinks haven't bananas
with<00:03:39.690> kale<00:03:39.930> help<00:03:40.800> me<00:03:41.210> understand<00:03:42.210> well<00:03:42.780> that's

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
with kale help me understand well that's

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.890 
with kale help me understand well that's
when<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.740> blend<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.520> creates<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.570> bit<00:03:45.720> more

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
when you blend it it creates a bit more

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.610 
when you blend it it creates a bit more
of<00:03:45.990> a<00:03:46.080> synergy<00:03:46.880> but<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.060> rule<00:03:48.450> is<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.990> simpler

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
of a synergy but the rule is the simpler

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.160 
of a synergy but the rule is the simpler
the<00:03:49.650> better<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:50.880> more<00:03:51.120> simple<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.870> eat

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
the better the more simple you eat

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.920 
the better the more simple you eat
monomials<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.310> better<00:03:53.580> so<00:03:54.390> I'm<00:03:54.480> going<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.660> sum

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
monomials the better so I'm going to sum

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.250 
monomials the better so I'm going to sum
up<00:03:54.960> real<00:03:55.380> quick<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:56.330> wish<00:03:57.330> we<00:03:57.450> had<00:03:57.540> more<00:03:57.690> time<00:03:57.750> we
