00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 How can you know the popular program 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.620
 is ed and has been run by a lot 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.139
 time however between October 7 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.049
 and October 21, 2003 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.690
 episode 34 was aired 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.699
 week earlier than planned by some 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.010
 reason I'm the only person that I know 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.320
 also some people from the office 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.689
 they knew that the main writer had 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.269
 been sick with a cold and instead of 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.070
 go ahead and do episode 34 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.520
 it was decided to re -transmit the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.809
 episode 1 at five in the morning 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.700
 Western several people reported 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.100
 a very disturbing new episode 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.040
 debuting by cartoon network and 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 some children were enough 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.030
 unfortunate to see it apparently 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.620
 the quality of the episode was mediocre 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.200
 when compared to the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.750
 regular standards the animation was 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.600
 cut and lacked fluidity the sound 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.850
 crackling inaudible reports of a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.280
 line sliding up and down like 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.649
 the one of a defective tape of vhs tape 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.570
 the scenarios were also received 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.909
 they were described as exaggeratedly 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.570
 dark and depressive unchanged 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.180
 money 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.400
 and of stormy appearance the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.340
 characters also behaved weird 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.290
 instead of the normal clumsy and vivacious 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.360
 personalities inspired the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.030
 viewers complained that they seemed 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.040
 extremely agitated for free 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.710
 hateful among them and constantly 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.690
 sobbing between the dialogues the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.210
 protagonist also had an annoying 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.580
 I wish and nobody knows why but he spoke 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.520
 with a sexual tone and that bothered even more 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.320
 to the viewers I was one of those 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.390
 viewers 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.970
 the episode started with him and walking 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.850
 down the street with him notice that the third 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.380
 there was not an angular shot coming 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.880
 from the front according to the two 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.910
 characters were walking towards the 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.009
 viewer Eddie brought that look 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.280
 furious when things go wrong 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.410
 with red eyes around the iris it 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.360
 I looked absolutely decayed and it was 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.850
 practically dragged by eddie with 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.220
 tears in the eyes which were seen 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.740
 lazy and pointing in different 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.539
 directions out 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.209
 kevin the antagonist of the series 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.050
 he appeared cycling to the 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.360
 sets 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.340
 the scene was put bag and listened 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.620
 low moans of day before kevin 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.470
 hit him which never happened given that 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.990
 the screen faded to black then 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.330
 the screen went back on and kevin 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.160
 again he was heading towards him and the view 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.720
 it was so fuzzy that the only thing I saw 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.690
 it was a kind of green mass 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.450
 heading towards a yellow one again 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.160
 that moan came down only this time it sounded 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.590
 as if the microphone was 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.410
 decomposed and it sounded a lot static 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.390
 overshadowing the moan a lot 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.430
 sequence in which an animation of 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.830
 plasticine of sleeping in bed 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.930
 Eddie honestly could have followed 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.900
 it was only the abruptness of the change but I 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.190
 I shuddered and jumped off the armchair 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.680
 waking up xxi fumbled awkwardly 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.690
 around the circular chamber with the 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.270
 quick ticking of the steps being the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.230
 only sound the sounds of the steps 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.750
 they were very clear 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.000
 as he is seen from above is giving 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.480
 around the room there was no 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.820
 doors he started screaming he sounded like 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.650
 a furious otter as he moved 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.110
 around the cell of a room 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.450
 faster and faster until the screen 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.489
 it began to get blurred again the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.790
 purple room was swallowed by a 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.470
 orange blur an extreme close up 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.390
 the door of the house followed by eddie 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.180
 he followed in absolute silence for a 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.190
 maddeningly long mind at least 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.100
 two minutes of dead silence and one 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.440
 door then we will streamline in a 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.140
 office of something probably oral 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.510
 the image of Jimmy obstructed by a 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.340
 pendant lamp and now in a very loud voice 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.160
 while Sara tries to calm him down in a 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.650
 Unusually warm way hurts me 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.690
 Xala hurts suddenly the door 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.750
 opens violently and a new 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.820
 character a dentist his face not 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.650
 I saw because it was high enough 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.270
 to be off camera 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.790
 Sara was escorted out of the 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.370
 room and we went back with Jim and his 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.650
 dental braces were shattered the 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.810
 front bent up pulling his 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.630
 lip at such an angle that it seemed capable 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.750
 to tear the front of his gums 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.489
 dripping blood and had no teeth the 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.410
 most disturbing part was that there was 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.480
 apparently lost the arms and 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.150
 legs and I was sitting like a 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.830
 paraplegic I almost cried when I got to the 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.690
 conclusion that the others had 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.690
 crushed and beaten 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.460
 the brakes the camera remained on its 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.340
 face shattered by a few 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.800
 seconds like a silent photograph 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.070
 as always from there came the 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.470
 commercial after that we are assaulted 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.960
 for a scene with a very hairy role in 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.720
 his dark shed feast him 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.820
 a cow repeatedly the visual pattern 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.740
 it repeats itself over and over and it gets 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.650
 blurred again while the scene was 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.990
 fade is born is now reading a 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.110
 magazine on your sofa the quality of the 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.650
 image is now perfect eddie is alone 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.200
 now 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.810
 sinéad the quality gets more bad 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.850
 although before and he keeps walking with the 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.280
 sun now illuminating in some way the 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.740
 environment while he smiles and starts 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.840
 run the door shows again and 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.210
 we see through the eyes ed and while 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.430
 reach the knob and open the door 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.139
 his house is beautiful and bright but a 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.330
 horrible violin sound fills the 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.550
 scene the only audio in this scene 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.910
 since he arrives at the house and opens the 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.710
 door to her room where there 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.930
 hong and appears under the armchair of is born 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.630
 Crawling on four legs comically 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.060
 and jumps behind her I laughed because 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.849
 someone forgot to draw their eyes and I thought 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.039
 in a mole suddenly stopped laughing at 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.470
 see that he begins to swallow his head 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.930
 still born in a caricatural way but 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.030
 different the two stay like this until 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.610
 that nothing starts kicking and struggling 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.400
 I do not even keep it that way until it stays 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.560
 stiff follows an extreme approach to its 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.710
 face that reveals ones extremely 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.570
 small human eyes double now is 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.120
 lying on Eddie's floor no longer in 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.220
 plasticine animation the camera showed 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.409
 eddie's house for all the rest of the 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.880
 episode like three minutes and the 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:17.539
 next program began to 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.539
 be transmitted
