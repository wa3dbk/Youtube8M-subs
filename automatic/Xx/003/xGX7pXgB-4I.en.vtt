00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.130
 and hello all these technologies and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.910
 today I will introduce you to the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.820
 iphone 5 case ultra thin air series 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.649
 so with this shell you will have 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.449
 several small accessories that you 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.280
 have a protective film for the phase 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.900
 to know of your iphone 5 a little 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.989
 cloth so it is often supplied 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.579
 but it's always nice to see a 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.980
 protections for buttons as I 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.079
 had never seen and here a little 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.780
 accessory that will attach directly 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.210
 on the iphone 5 case so we go 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.859
 start right away with the hull that 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.019
 is made of polycarbonate 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.239
 so I really find it a very 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.170
 very good quality 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.469
 while max has it right now 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.840
 the iphone so you take this sort of 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.750
 plastic bamboo you have a sense 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.090
 for that you will see if you buy it 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.600
 so that's it I put it inside 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.280
 like this here 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.580
 and now I can put the iphone 5 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.810
 inside so once the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.100
 hull the bets we really 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.900
 the impression of not having 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.840
 protection on the iphone so that's 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.909
 really a positive point 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.860
 in addition it is transparent so it 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.439
 let your iphone 5 appear 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.820
 Frankly it's just great awesome 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.970
 slight superfine I love then then 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.040
 we are far here the plastic film 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.229
 so that I can not show you that 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.670
 art is already one of south to film pile 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.990
 plastic it will do a lot but 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.719
 otherwise it's really very simple to 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.060
 to install you take something 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.920
 finally you install it like these is 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.350
 chased the air bubbles you take 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.030
 a kind of his parents something 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.740
 of dishes and you chase the air on them 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.469
 sides and frankly that installs everything 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.030
 only then a little cloth so that's it 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.680
 avoid cleaning each time 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.200
 iphone 5 with its oise always better 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.509
 and home button protections so 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.360
 that at your house show it so I 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.450
 lay black it seems to me more 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.450
 logic 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.970
 like those here and there I come m yet 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.250
 inside 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.050
 So that's really what happened 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.380
 all by yourself you saw him no worries 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.819
 on that I told you you do it 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.420
 button so it's a little thicker 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.390
 certainly but it's always more pleasant 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.080
 to have full protections lo 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.440
 so this kit of accessories is at the price 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.569
 of 21 euros 99 on iphone steurs point 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.180
 fr so there will be a link in the 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.769
 description with all this and frankly 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.930
 it is a protection that I 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.540
 advise if you want to stay 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.700
 discreet with your hull while keeping 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.140
 shock resistance as well as a 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.099
 beautiful transparency that really leaves 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.260
 your iphone 5 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.280
 very very beautiful here it will be all I 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.340
 tell you soon to the past a good 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.340
 day
