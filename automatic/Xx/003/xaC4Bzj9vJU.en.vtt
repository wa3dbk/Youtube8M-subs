have a really specific color that you
mixed<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:36.270> could<00:00:36.510> go<00:00:36.629> back<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:36.989> royal<00:00:37.290> icing

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
try to fill that but it's not going to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.340 
try to fill that but it's not going to
be<00:00:41.910> exact<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.420> here's<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.720> really<00:00:42.899> great<00:00:43.140> tip

that I have all I do is I take the same
fondant<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.989> cut<00:00:46.290> off<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.040> used<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.850> I

fondant that I cut off that I used and I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.080 
fondant that I cut off that I used and I

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
put it in a bowl with a little bit of

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.420 
put it in a bowl with a little bit of
water<00:00:51.450> a<00:00:51.600> couple<00:00:51.870> drops<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> time<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.920> I'll

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
water a couple drops at a time and I'll

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.700 
water a couple drops at a time and I'll
just<00:00:53.610> keep<00:00:53.790> smoothing<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.450> out<00:00:54.600> until<00:00:55.530> it's

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
just keep smoothing it out until it's

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.619 
just keep smoothing it out until it's
like<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.040> consistency<00:00:56.790> of<00:00:56.820> icing<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.570> you

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
like the consistency of icing and you

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.819 
like the consistency of icing and you
want<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> make<00:00:57.989> sure<00:00:58.020> that's<00:00:58.260> mixed<00:00:58.649> really

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
want to make sure that's mixed really

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.069 
want to make sure that's mixed really
well<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.550> nice<00:00:59.940> and<00:00:59.969> smooth<00:01:00.450> and<00:01:00.570> Pipal

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
well so it is nice and smooth and Pipal

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.369 
well so it is nice and smooth and Pipal
not<00:01:01.590> too<00:01:01.860> thin<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.610> runny<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.960> thin

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
not too thin so that it's runny but thin

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.200 
not too thin so that it's runny but thin
enough<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.129> pipe<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.060> it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
enough so that you can pipe it and it

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.820 
enough so that you can pipe it and it
comes<00:01:06.420> out<00:01:06.720> nicely<00:01:07.020> I'll<00:01:07.259> pipe<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.590> little<00:01:07.740> bit

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
comes out nicely I'll pipe a little bit

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.020 
comes out nicely I'll pipe a little bit
here<00:01:08.009> on<00:01:08.039> the<00:01:08.220> edge<00:01:08.340> here<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.759> can<00:01:08.850> see

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
here on the edge here so you can see

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.850 
here on the edge here so you can see
that<00:01:09.149> it's<00:01:09.300> going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.020> hold<00:01:10.259> its<00:01:10.410> shape<00:01:10.470> nicely

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
that it's going to hold its shape nicely

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.370 
that it's going to hold its shape nicely
and<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.119> thin<00:01:12.450> down<00:01:12.660> fondant<00:01:13.229> with

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
and that is just thin down fondant with

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.840 
and that is just thin down fondant with
water<00:01:13.649> I<00:01:13.770> didn't<00:01:14.009> add<00:01:14.069> anything<00:01:14.310> else<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
water I didn't add anything else to it

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.460 
water I didn't add anything else to it
okay<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.539> the<00:01:15.720> first<00:01:15.929> thing<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.170> want<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> do

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
okay so the first thing you want to do

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.440 
okay so the first thing you want to do
so<00:01:16.649> I<00:01:16.679> made<00:01:17.039> a<00:01:17.069> little<00:01:17.250> tear<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.940> what<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
so I made a little tear here what you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.699 
so I made a little tear here what you
want<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.660> do<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.840> kind<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.080> use<00:01:19.229> your<00:01:19.350> fondant

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:19.709 
want to do is kind of use your fondant

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:21.440 
want to do is kind of use your fondant
smoother<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.160> pull<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.520> fondant<00:01:20.910> towards

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
smoother and pull the fondant towards

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.900 
smoother and pull the fondant towards
the<00:01:21.660> tear<00:01:21.959> from<00:01:22.350> either<00:01:22.560> side<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.700> you

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
the tear from either side so that you

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.850 
the tear from either side so that you
make<00:01:24.179> that<00:01:24.209> little<00:01:24.479> cavity<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.110> small<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.740> you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
make that little cavity as small as you

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.859 
make that little cavity as small as you
possibly<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.910> that's<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.569> first<00:01:27.780> thing

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
possibly can so that's the first thing

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.540 
possibly can so that's the first thing
that<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.140> want<00:01:28.319> to<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.740> then<00:01:29.190> next<00:01:29.399> you're

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
that you want to do and then next you're

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.910 
that you want to do and then next you're
going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> take<00:01:29.910> your<00:01:30.149> piping<00:01:30.740> icing<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.770> you

going to take your piping icing that you

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.740 
going to take your piping icing that you
just<00:01:32.220> made<00:01:32.369> out<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> fondant<00:01:32.819> and<00:01:33.149> you're<00:01:33.630> just

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
just made out of fondant and you're just

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.620 
just made out of fondant and you're just
going<00:01:33.899> to<00:01:33.929> fill<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.470> little<00:01:34.619> cavity<00:01:35.390> okay<00:01:36.390> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
going to fill the little cavity okay and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.900 
going to fill the little cavity okay and
then<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.530> with<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> little<00:01:38.099> bit<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.670> water

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
then just with a little bit more water

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.249 
then just with a little bit more water
not<00:01:39.179> too<00:01:39.330> much<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.539> don't<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.869> make<00:01:39.929> this<00:01:40.050> too

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
not too much you don't to make this too

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.510 
not too much you don't to make this too
soggy<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.800> just<00:01:40.950> kind<00:01:41.099> of<00:01:41.160> wet<00:01:41.369> your

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
soggy but just kind of wet your

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.550 
soggy but just kind of wet your
fingertips<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.149> slides<00:01:42.569> over<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.020> you're

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
fingertips so that slides over it you're

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.020 
fingertips so that slides over it you're
going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.709> kind<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.009> spackle<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.640> into<00:01:44.789> place

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
going to kind of spackle that into place

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.430 
going to kind of spackle that into place
and<00:01:45.209> it's<00:01:45.300> really<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.810> hide<00:01:45.959> that<00:01:45.990> tear

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
and it's really going to hide that tear

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.940 
and it's really going to hide that tear
nicely<00:01:47.450> this<00:01:48.450> also<00:01:48.810> works<00:01:49.200> really<00:01:49.289> great<00:01:49.619> so

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
nicely this also works really great so

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.320 
nicely this also works really great so
like<00:01:50.099> here<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> left<00:01:50.580> it<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.789> little<00:01:50.940> bit<00:01:51.119> high

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
like here I left it a little bit high

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.930 
like here I left it a little bit high
and<00:01:51.690> now<00:01:52.649> I'm<00:01:52.800> forced<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.310> put<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.550> border<00:01:53.819> there

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
and now I'm forced to put a border there

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.400 
and now I'm forced to put a border there
but<00:01:54.270> if<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.450> don't<00:01:54.630> want<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.929> put<00:01:55.050> a<00:01:55.080> border

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
but if I don't want to put a border

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.190 
but if I don't want to put a border
there<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:56.250> use<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.550> same<00:01:56.899> piping<00:01:57.899> icing

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
there just use that same piping icing

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.540 
there just use that same piping icing
that<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.349> just<00:01:58.590> made<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.009> kind<00:01:59.160> of<00:01:59.280> fill<00:01:59.520> that

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
that you just made to kind of fill that

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.630 
that you just made to kind of fill that
gap<00:01:59.910> and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:01.050> using<00:02:01.679> the<00:02:01.800> same<00:02:02.039> method<00:02:02.489> with

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
gap and then using the same method with

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.910 
gap and then using the same method with
the<00:02:02.789> water<00:02:03.050> again<00:02:04.050> not<00:02:04.259> too<00:02:04.440> much<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.830> enough

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the water again not too much just enough

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.830 
the water again not too much just enough
to<00:02:05.130> make<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.280> smooth<00:02:05.670> you're<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.569> fill

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
to make it smooth you're going to fill

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.180 
to make it smooth you're going to fill
that<00:02:06.989> out<00:02:07.050> now<00:02:07.319> it's<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.530> little<00:02:07.619> bit<00:02:07.830> shiny

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
that out now it's a little bit shiny

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.559 
that out now it's a little bit shiny
right<00:02:08.459> now<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:08.880> as<00:02:08.940> soon<00:02:09.000> as<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.239> water

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
right now but as soon as that water

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.690 
right now but as soon as that water
dries<00:02:10.050> it's<00:02:10.739> going<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.009> be<00:02:11.099> nice<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.310> smooth

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
dries it's going to be nice and smooth

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.720 
dries it's going to be nice and smooth
and<00:02:11.880> it's<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.150> look<00:02:12.239> seamless<00:02:12.480> kin<00:02:13.730> all

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
and it's going to look seamless kin all

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.280 
and it's going to look seamless kin all
right<00:02:14.849> so<00:02:14.970> I'm<00:02:15.060> just<00:02:15.270> finishing<00:02:15.540> off<00:02:16.019> this

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
right so I'm just finishing off this

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.050 
right so I'm just finishing off this
last<00:02:16.680> bit<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.189> border<00:02:17.519> here<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:17.969> then

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
last bit of this border here and then

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.520 
last bit of this border here and then
you<00:02:18.150> also<00:02:18.299> want<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.750> nice<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.170> clean<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:19.469> I'm

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
you also want that nice and clean so I'm

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.990 
you also want that nice and clean so I'm
just<00:02:19.620> going<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:19.799> take<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> nice

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
just going to take a nice

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.700 
just going to take a nice
paintbrush<00:02:21.420> with<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.080> little<00:02:22.380> bit<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.500> water

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
paintbrush with a little bit of water

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.620 
paintbrush with a little bit of water
dabbing<00:02:23.160> off<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.400> excess<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.420> can<00:02:24.510> just

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
dabbing off the excess and you can just

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.150 
dabbing off the excess and you can just
go<00:02:24.750> back<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.110> clean<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.590> up<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:26.010> make<00:02:26.130> sure

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
go back and clean that up to make sure

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.630 
go back and clean that up to make sure
it's<00:02:26.430> nice<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.150> straight<00:02:28.050> edged<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.890> again

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
it's nice and straight edged and again

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.250 
it's nice and straight edged and again
this<00:02:29.880> water<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.300> going<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.480> dry<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.960> shine

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
this water is going to dry in the shine

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.020 
this water is going to dry in the shine
will<00:02:31.440> go<00:02:31.560> away<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.980> matches<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.610> rest<00:02:32.820> of

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
will go away so that matches the rest of

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.690 
will go away so that matches the rest of
the<00:02:33.150> fondant<00:02:33.660> but<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.680> think<00:02:34.950> if<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.160> use<00:02:35.190> your

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
the fondant but I think if you use your

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.430 
the fondant but I think if you use your
fondant<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.480> actually<00:02:36.960> used<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.290> the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
fondant that you actually used on the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.170 
fondant that you actually used on the
cake<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.800> just<00:02:37.950> thin<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.100> down<00:02:38.310> with<00:02:38.520> water<00:02:38.730> to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
cake and just thin it down with water to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.000 
cake and just thin it down with water to
use<00:02:39.360> as<00:02:39.510> your<00:02:39.630> pipeable<00:02:39.990> icing<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.530> fix<00:02:40.740> tears

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
use as your pipeable icing to fix tears

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.040 
use as your pipeable icing to fix tears
it's<00:02:41.520> going<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:42.000> perfect<00:02:42.570> match<00:02:42.630> instead

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
it's going to be a perfect match instead

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.510 
it's going to be a perfect match instead
of<00:02:43.140> trying<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.530> go<00:02:43.650> back<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.040> match<00:02:44.220> like<00:02:44.490> a

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
of trying to go back and match like a

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.699 
of trying to go back and match like a
royal<00:02:44.820> icing<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.300> fill<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:45.570> those<00:02:45.690> gaps<00:02:45.750> again

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
royal icing to fill in those gaps again

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.010 
royal icing to fill in those gaps again
the<00:02:47.160> perfect<00:02:47.670> situation<00:02:48.330> would<00:02:48.690> be<00:02:48.810> not<00:02:48.990> to

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
the perfect situation would be not to

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.330 
the perfect situation would be not to
make<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.350> tear<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.650> first<00:02:49.860> place<00:02:50.100> but<00:02:50.250> if

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
make the tear in the first place but if

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.160 
make the tear in the first place but if
you<00:02:50.430> do<00:02:50.580> come<00:02:50.790> across<00:02:50.880> these<00:02:51.240> tears<00:02:51.570> there's<00:02:52.110> a

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
you do come across these tears there's a
