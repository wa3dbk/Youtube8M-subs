00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
like medium high and then super high it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.779 
like medium high and then super high it
really<00:01:42.619> depends<00:01:43.039> on<00:01:43.069> your<00:01:43.279> internet

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
really depends on your internet

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.999 
really depends on your internet
connection<00:01:44.450> but<00:01:45.020> from<00:01:45.529> here<00:01:45.679> you<00:01:45.740> just<00:01:45.919> want

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
connection but from here you just want

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.429 
connection but from here you just want
to<00:01:46.189> get<00:01:46.369> X<00:01:46.609> like<00:01:46.880> open<00:01:47.209> and<00:01:47.419> just<00:01:47.659> use<00:01:48.139> it<00:01:48.169> and

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
to get X like open and just use it and

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.839 
to get X like open and just use it and
it<00:01:48.590> should<00:01:48.799> put<00:01:49.039> you<00:01:49.130> up<00:01:49.249> into<00:01:49.459> the<00:01:49.609> clouds

00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:49.849 
it should put you up into the clouds

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:52.959 
it should put you up into the clouds
like<00:01:50.060> this<00:01:50.299> don't<00:01:51.169> press<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.619> or<00:01:51.649> b<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.279> if

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
like this don't press a or b and if

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.550 
like this don't press a or b and if
you're<00:01:53.119> doing<00:01:53.329> it<00:01:53.509> right<00:01:53.659> it<00:01:53.840> should<00:01:53.869> put<00:01:54.380> you

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
you're doing it right it should put you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.519 
you're doing it right it should put you
into<00:01:55.099> the<00:01:55.310> job<00:01:55.849> itself<00:01:56.299> if<00:01:56.539> it<00:01:56.989> puts<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.349> into

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:57.529 
into the job itself if it puts you into

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:59.559 
into the job itself if it puts you into
an<00:01:57.829> online<00:01:58.039> session<00:01:58.669> you<00:01:58.819> have<00:01:59.029> done<00:01:59.270> it<00:01:59.419> wrong

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
an online session you have done it wrong

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
sure there is no world record if there

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.790 
sure there is no world record if there
is<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.510> world<00:02:23.750> record<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.170> have<00:02:24.320> done<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.650> wrong

anything to do the whole steps over

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.300 
anything to do the whole steps over

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
again but basically what we're going to

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.010 
again but basically what we're going to
be<00:02:28.430> doing<00:02:28.700> here<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.390> need<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.570> make<00:02:29.810> your

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
be doing here is you need to make your

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.440 
be doing here is you need to make your
first<00:02:30.380> lap<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.890> longest<00:02:31.340> lap<00:02:31.520> because<00:02:31.880> in<00:02:32.090> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
first lap the longest lap because in the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.030 
first lap the longest lap because in the
future<00:02:32.630> laps<00:02:32.990> we're<00:02:33.170> going<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.500> be<00:02:33.620> beating

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
future laps we're going to be beating

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.400 
future laps we're going to be beating
this<00:02:34.250> lap<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:34.820> when<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:35.780> beat<00:02:35.960> a<00:02:36.080> lap<00:02:36.290> you

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
this lap and when you beat a lap you

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.410 
this lap and when you beat a lap you
actually<00:02:36.680> get<00:02:36.770> more<00:02:36.980> RP<00:02:37.370> for<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.090> seeing

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
actually get more RP for it and seeing

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.810 
actually get more RP for it and seeing
it<00:02:38.570> is<00:02:38.660> actually<00:02:39.200> double<00:02:39.590> RP<00:02:39.830> you<00:02:40.580> get<00:02:40.790> a

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
it is actually double RP you get a

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.910 
it is actually double RP you get a
crap-ton<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.510> RP<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.410> is<00:02:42.500> kind<00:02:42.740> of<00:02:42.800> a

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
crap-ton of RP and it is kind of a

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.980 
crap-ton of RP and it is kind of a
glitch<00:02:43.160> with<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.520> x<00:02:43.940> lag<00:02:44.210> but<00:02:44.630> as<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:44.840> can<00:02:44.930> see

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
glitch with the x lag but as you can see

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.830 
glitch with the x lag but as you can see
our<00:02:45.380> first<00:02:45.710> lap<00:02:45.980> was<00:02:46.010> 33<00:02:46.760> seconds<00:02:47.210> and<00:02:47.600> you

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
our first lap was 33 seconds and you

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.300 
our first lap was 33 seconds and you
basically<00:02:48.020> want<00:02:48.320> to<00:02:48.380> make<00:02:48.440> your<00:02:48.770> next<00:02:49.040> lap

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
sure the nuts you basically be in the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.800 
sure the nuts you basically be in the
world<00:02:51.230> record<00:02:51.470> every<00:02:52.070> single<00:02:52.490> time<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:53.210> yeah

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
world record every single time and yeah

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
lap as it is easier to beat and as you

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.650 
lap as it is easier to beat and as you
can<00:02:58.460> see<00:02:58.520> every<00:02:58.910> time<00:02:58.940> we<00:02:59.180> complete<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.480> lap

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
can see every time we complete a lap

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.590 
can see every time we complete a lap
holy<00:03:00.020> Jesus<00:03:00.710> look<00:03:00.950> at<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:01.280> RP<00:03:01.730> is<00:03:01.940> frickin
