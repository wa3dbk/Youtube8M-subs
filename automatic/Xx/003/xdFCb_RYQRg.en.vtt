00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:12.170
 now we make the shoes of 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:14.719
 puppets of this infamous goose 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.270
 polystyrene as polystyrene balls 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.970
 we use one for each shoe 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.830
 five centimeter ball and one 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:29.960
 ball of four centimeters in 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:37.260
 polystyrene we are going to eliminate let's say 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:41.000
 half of the ball's sphere more or less 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.000
 so of each ball 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:59.130
 5 same thing as the big one 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:06.210
 here there is a sign that denotes half 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:06.210
 sphere we must cut the life exists 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:16.740
 we eliminate the one with the circle so 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:24.690
 we have a more perfect ball than 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.690
 need now let's go glue 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.090
 and if two parts 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.670
 let's say polystyrene melts 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.500
 with hot glue but we if we go 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.550
 quickly and above all if not 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.700
 let's put a lot of glue we can do 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.700
 damage 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.100
 because the polystyrene is eaten 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.100
 from hot glue 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.990
 but you are very little 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.180
 we are two minutes 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:14.530
 now let's get rid of it 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:19.580
 something of the ball that is more or less 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:23.560
 let's say that meta meta ball is this e 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.560
 we are always going to remove half 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.370
 I am a positive self because there is one 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.370
 something that still does not come out hurriedly 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.859
 we need it so let's keep it here 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:06.840
 let's take the oven and the new one 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:09.180
 of rehn cali material very suitable for 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.320
 make so many things dolls dolls 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.870
 also bags between two sheets of paper 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:23.640
 let's heat up the more or less a 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:27.450
 10 10 square with the iron in motion 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:37.230
 because material must practically be 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:40.400
 heat but not burn when 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.440
 we see that a little is curling up 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.120
 material time 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.630
 we take little carmine we send you of the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.630
 nearby 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.080
 it can happen that if the funds are not 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:07.030
 warmed up well instead of giving up yes 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.030
 break we repeat the operation 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.350
 Italian the process 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.539
 hot glue in the 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:46.500
 we find ourselves expecting you're a 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.910
 passage a little delicate because 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.910
 we risk getting burned 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.060
 the accounts with whom 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.060
 if I see under magazine 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:48.300
 now place another piece on one piece 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:54.720
 piece of smoke the shoe 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:57.990
 I tend first to some glue under everything 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.990
 positioning it like this 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:11.020
 we cut along the contour 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.020
 shoes 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.400
 so let's get a little more precise 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.870
 pasting first and then cutting out 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.479
 let's take a comic strip is 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.370
 clipped with antique scissors 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:33.430
 we start from the back side of the 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:39.300
 shoe so the joint will not come on 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.300
 front and let's go cover 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.590
 the whole 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.510
 we see the process 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:30.669
 shoes more the same thing repeats 

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:30.669
 let's do with another story
