00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.610
 into the answer because I again 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.769
 quite loose because everyone each translucent yet 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.910
 everyone on television only sees three 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.730
 people on the field 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.650
 the disclosure may have just made what 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.449
 you can speak the second tonne too 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.010
 be common out there that I've been so 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.570
 clearly they do not cook a game 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.100
 it's like having one like that 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.560
 Maybe we are rich for you 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.779
 is still ahead 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.699
 it is not possible it is incomprehensible then 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.640
 also for this this arrogance with with 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.350
 the player faces under and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.730
 So says please about what we're talking 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.590
 about what you get football at all 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.710
 Bundesliga football Bundesliga only now 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.149
 to their three single 86 minute away 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.950
 seduced in halo and then comes one 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.510
 shit thing from the umpire 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.680
 maybe still thought that must be different 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.780
 but make up for it from Hoffnungheim 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.129
 not we recognize windows or 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.039
 same referee comes today 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.850
 Again the form of an insurance policy 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.230
 pull 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.149
 so he has that many are 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.160
 crucial scene of the game because of 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.570
 which this fucking scene conclusive 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.829
 without the people of your game and the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.930
 is the crucial scene of the game 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.820
 do you play really good game? 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.130
 you dead is absolutely safe there and then 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.409
 he catches such a thing and then says 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.390
 He so I on display looks each other 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.250
 let the crisis be less nibble and 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.180
 not even cleaning after 45 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.740
 minutes replay 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.390
 so if i find such a one 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.500
 I am tense on the offside decision 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.380
 do you see to relieve 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.520
 you have to rethink and not really 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.930
 I go and then in the square sometimes 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.909
 how the reactions are and then behind 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.000
 out then yellow cards to throw 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.500
 getting sharper than captain 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.720
 really 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.900
 we all together try to hold and 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.760
 then dismiss with words 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.900
 I can understand what emotions 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.729
 So as I said, I'm not placing 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.590
 normally not been fan of grenades 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.090
 but these heels i'm sorry 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.560
 if I hear there is one 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.630
 Camera attitude must therefore I believe 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.979
 it's around 40,000 and our entire 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.600
 team with just after that right 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.040
 can excite and then only 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.930
 dismissed that with the yellow card for 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.260
 all words you had contact to the ship 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.150
 they have the wanted one to stop 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.700
 Mobile phone contracts sure try this 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.080
 what else does it bring as I said there is 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.030
 apparently some attitude that 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.120
 because somewhere where you can say but how 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.440
 said that regardless of one can 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.190
 but I make mistakes like that 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.720
 reactions are 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.950
 then I have to be experienced 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.690
 referee interesting to remember there must 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.030
 I still distribute yellow cards 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.739
 for things that are easy in such a way 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.020
 a lot of games with us too 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.450
 it's a game and that's it 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.730
 brutal is cut off I want that 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.320
 not quite fair you can do because 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.480
 As I said the team has today 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.620
 Everything thrown in the balance what you 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.570
 She has good football 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.910
 then you really are playing 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.140
 thrown in and then you will 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.640
 finally with the offside gate around the 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.480
 brought rewarding work, and that the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.430
 the pain portal very bitter for the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.110
 first fc nuremberg and the frustration it 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.180
 certainly traceable on the 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.980
 you might ever have another side 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.620
 six minutes better then 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.350
 uses energy customers scarce 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.860
 overhang 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.860
 to bring the time
