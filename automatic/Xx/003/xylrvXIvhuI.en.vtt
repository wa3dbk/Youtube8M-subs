today<00:00:06.550> I'd<00:00:06.640> like<00:00:06.700> to<00:00:06.850> show<00:00:07.000> you<00:00:07.060> a<00:00:07.150> little

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.330 
today I'd like to show you a little

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.540 
today I'd like to show you a little
cheat<00:00:07.660> trick<00:00:07.930> in<00:00:08.559> case<00:00:08.769> your<00:00:08.980> bobber<00:00:09.190> stop

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:09.550 
cheat trick in case your bobber stop

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.280 
cheat trick in case your bobber stop
ever<00:00:09.790> wears<00:00:10.030> out<00:00:10.300> on<00:00:10.480> you<00:00:10.630> instead<00:00:10.870> of<00:00:11.080> having

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
ever wears out on you instead of having

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.230 
ever wears out on you instead of having
to<00:00:11.440> rip<00:00:11.620> all<00:00:11.769> your<00:00:11.950> gear<00:00:12.130> apart<00:00:12.490> you<00:00:12.940> can<00:00:13.090> just

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
to rip all your gear apart you can just

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.580 
to rip all your gear apart you can just
replace<00:00:13.510> the<00:00:13.780> bobber<00:00:13.990> stop

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
replace the bobber stop

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.009 
replace the bobber stop
so<00:00:15.400> the<00:00:15.580> bobber<00:00:15.760> stop<00:00:16.059> runs<00:00:16.299> on<00:00:16.480> the<00:00:16.599> mainline

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:17.019 
so the bobber stop runs on the mainline

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.540 
so the bobber stop runs on the mainline
and<00:00:17.410> that's<00:00:17.650> what<00:00:17.770> we're<00:00:17.890> going<00:00:18.010> to<00:00:18.070> represent

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
and that's what we're going to represent

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.100 
and that's what we're going to represent
here<00:00:18.699> with<00:00:18.940> this<00:00:19.119> purple<00:00:19.510> line<00:00:19.660> as<00:00:19.900> the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
here with this purple line as the

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.340 
here with this purple line as the
mainline<00:00:20.560> in<00:00:20.859> this<00:00:21.640> white<00:00:21.880> cord<00:00:22.240> as<00:00:22.449> the<00:00:23.170> new

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
mainline in this white cord as the new

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.790 
mainline in this white cord as the new
bobber<00:00:23.590> stop<00:00:24.270> so<00:00:25.270> simply<00:00:25.600> the<00:00:25.840> bobber<00:00:26.260> stop<00:00:26.560> is

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
bobber stop so simply the bobber stop is

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.429 
bobber stop so simply the bobber stop is
a<00:00:27.310> simple<00:00:27.939> uni<00:00:28.240> knot

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
a simple uni knot

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.209 
a simple uni knot
the<00:00:30.279> easiest<00:00:30.609> way<00:00:30.820> to<00:00:30.849> do<00:00:31.060> it<00:00:31.210> is<00:00:31.390> just<00:00:32.219> what

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
the easiest way to do it is just what

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.090 
the easiest way to do it is just what
you<00:00:33.280> want<00:00:33.460> to<00:00:33.550> do<00:00:33.639> is<00:00:33.760> make<00:00:34.179> one<00:00:34.210> circle<00:00:35.100> with

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
you want to do is make one circle with

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.020 
you want to do is make one circle with
the<00:00:36.280> line<00:00:36.489> and<00:00:36.819> then<00:00:37.569> both<00:00:37.960> ends<00:00:38.559> are<00:00:38.710> going<00:00:38.769> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the line and then both ends are going to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.430 
the line and then both ends are going to
come<00:00:40.030> back<00:00:40.210> and<00:00:40.420> forth<00:00:40.600> it<00:00:40.809> along<00:00:41.109> the<00:00:41.260> main

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
come back and forth it along the main

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.239 
come back and forth it along the main
line<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.620> let's<00:00:44.859> start<00:00:46.559> make<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:47.739> one<00:00:47.949> loop

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
line so let's start make the one loop

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:52.289 
line so let's start make the one loop
and<00:00:49.109> then<00:00:50.109> it's<00:00:50.289> six<00:00:51.069> wraps<00:00:51.429> through<00:00:52.120> the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
and then it's six wraps through the

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:55.349 
and then it's six wraps through the
center<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:53.039> around<00:00:54.039> the<00:00:54.309> outside<00:00:54.850> of<00:00:55.179> your

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
center and around the outside of your

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:06.460 
center and around the outside of your
main<00:00:55.510> line

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.190 

and<00:01:06.560> then<00:01:07.160> all<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:08.030> have<00:01:08.120> to<00:01:08.180> do<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.570> pull<00:01:08.900> both

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
and then all you have to do is pull both

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.740 
and then all you have to do is pull both
tag<00:01:09.590> ends<00:01:10.100> of<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:12.170> white<00:01:12.380> cord<00:01:13.570> this<00:01:14.570> is<00:01:14.630> a

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
tag ends of the white cord this is a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:23.789 
tag ends of the white cord this is a
little<00:01:15.140> heavy<00:01:15.350> line<00:01:15.620> but

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.709 

and<00:01:24.799> just<00:01:25.009> tighten<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:25.399> down<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:26.450> they<00:01:26.539> should

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
and just tighten it down and they should

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.809 
and just tighten it down and they should
be<00:01:26.990> able<00:01:27.079> to<00:01:27.229> slide<00:01:27.439> your<00:01:27.740> unis<00:01:28.280> not<00:01:28.429> your

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
be able to slide your unis not your

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:30.489 
be able to slide your unis not your
bobber<00:01:29.030> stop<00:01:29.359> back<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:29.899> forth<00:01:30.079> along<00:01:30.289> your

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:30.499 
bobber stop back and forth along your

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.940 
bobber stop back and forth along your
mainline

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
mainline

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.969 
mainline
to<00:01:31.789> adjust<00:01:32.119> to<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.479> depth<00:01:32.689> of<00:01:32.869> your<00:01:33.020> jig<00:01:35.829> so<00:01:36.829> if

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
to adjust to the depth of your jig so if

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.410 
to adjust to the depth of your jig so if
your<00:01:37.130> bobber<00:01:37.310> stop<00:01:37.609> Evert<00:01:37.909> when<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.119> starts<00:01:38.390> to

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
your bobber stop Evert when it starts to

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.510 
your bobber stop Evert when it starts to
wear<00:01:38.600> out<00:01:38.780> it'll<00:01:38.990> fray<00:01:39.469> sometimes<00:01:40.340> they'll

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
wear out it'll fray sometimes they'll

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.990 
wear out it'll fray sometimes they'll
just<00:01:40.700> totally<00:01:41.090> come<00:01:41.299> unraveled

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
just totally come unraveled

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.969 
just totally come unraveled
so<00:01:44.000> rather<00:01:44.209> than<00:01:44.439> ripping<00:01:45.439> all<00:01:45.649> your<00:01:45.829> gear

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
so rather than ripping all your gear

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.520 
so rather than ripping all your gear
apart<00:01:46.310> just<00:01:46.729> tie<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.000> simple<00:01:47.450> uni<00:01:47.810> onto<00:01:48.409> your

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
apart just tie the simple uni onto your

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.359 
apart just tie the simple uni onto your
mainline<00:01:50.020> what<00:01:51.020> works<00:01:51.259> well<00:01:51.500> is<00:01:51.679> a<00:01:52.009> small

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
mainline what works well is a small

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.699 
mainline what works well is a small
piece<00:01:52.579> of<00:01:52.609> Dacron<00:01:53.240> or<00:01:53.630> any<00:01:53.990> type<00:01:54.259> of<00:01:54.289> a<00:01:54.500> braid

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
piece of Dacron or any type of a braid

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.709 
piece of Dacron or any type of a braid
fishing<00:01:55.130> line<00:01:55.310> I've<00:01:55.849> used<00:01:56.149> dental<00:01:56.360> floss

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
fishing line I've used dental floss

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.319 
fishing line I've used dental floss
before<00:01:56.959> and<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.259> works<00:01:57.409> great<00:01:58.329> eventually

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
before and it works great eventually

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.020 
before and it works great eventually
these<00:01:59.659> will<00:01:59.840> wear<00:02:00.079> out<00:02:00.399> they<00:02:01.399> won't<00:02:01.520> type<00:02:01.849> they

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
these will wear out they won't type they

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.800 
these will wear out they won't type they
won't<00:02:02.209> hold

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
won't hold

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.749 
won't hold
they'll<00:02:03.530> just<00:02:03.770> slide<00:02:03.950> back<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.310> forth<00:02:04.369> real

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
they'll just slide back and forth real

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.580 
they'll just slide back and forth real
easy<00:02:04.969> it's<00:02:05.719> like<00:02:05.899> I<00:02:05.989> said<00:02:06.200> rather<00:02:06.439> than

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
easy it's like I said rather than

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.859 
easy it's like I said rather than
ripping<00:02:06.829> everything<00:02:07.189> apart<00:02:07.479> take<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.660> cheat

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
ripping everything apart take the cheat

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.519 
ripping everything apart take the cheat
and<00:02:09.049> just<00:02:09.229> tie<00:02:09.379> a<00:02:09.769> single<00:02:10.190> unique
