stuff like that or all the characters
have<00:01:15.960> different<00:01:16.020> symbols<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.640> there's<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
have different symbols I think there's a

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.060 
have different symbols I think there's a
a<00:01:20.070> different<00:01:20.670> different<00:01:21.090> types<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
a different different types of the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.800 
a different different types of the
symbols<00:01:23.070> there<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.460> each<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.360> them<00:01:24.509> open

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
symbols there and each of them open

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.780 
symbols there and each of them open
different<00:01:25.049> sections<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.740> world<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
different sections of the world so you

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.969 
different sections of the world so you
might<00:01:26.939> need<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.119> fire<00:01:27.330> part<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.990> fireman<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.740> open

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
might need a fire part a fireman to open

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.499 
might need a fire part a fireman to open
the<00:01:29.040> fire<00:01:29.220> parts<00:01:29.520> or<00:01:29.670> what<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> guy<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> open<00:01:30.299> the

as you notice here when you put the guys

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.130 
as you notice here when you put the guys
on<00:05:04.760> they'll<00:05:04.910> have<00:05:05.120> little<00:05:05.240> symbols<00:05:05.720> like<00:05:05.930> he

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
on they'll have little symbols like he

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.350 
on they'll have little symbols like he
had<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.410> earth<00:05:06.530> symbol<00:05:07.070> the<00:05:07.730> fire<00:05:07.910> symbol

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
had the earth symbol the fire symbol

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.150 
had the earth symbol the fire symbol
stuff<00:05:08.600> like<00:05:08.720> that<00:05:08.930> or<00:05:09.050> all<00:05:09.470> these<00:05:09.770> characters

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
stuff like that or all these characters

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.390 
stuff like that or all these characters
have<00:05:10.310> different<00:05:10.340> symbols<00:05:10.910> I<00:05:11.210> think<00:05:11.960> there's<00:05:12.140> a

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
have different symbols I think there's a

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.580 
have different symbols I think there's a
maybe<00:05:13.400> six<00:05:14.030> or<00:05:14.210> eight<00:05:14.420> different<00:05:14.780> different

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
maybe six or eight different different

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.670 
maybe six or eight different different
types<00:05:15.800> of<00:05:16.010> the<00:05:16.390> symbols<00:05:17.390> there<00:05:17.600> and<00:05:17.780> each<00:05:18.470> of

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
types of the symbols there and each of

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.050 
types of the symbols there and each of
them<00:05:18.830> open<00:05:19.130> different<00:05:19.430> sections<00:05:19.700> of<00:05:19.820> the

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
them open different sections of the

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.940 
them open different sections of the
world<00:05:20.270> so<00:05:20.660> you<00:05:21.110> might<00:05:21.260> need<00:05:21.380> a<00:05:21.440> fire<00:05:21.650> part

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
world so you might need a fire part
