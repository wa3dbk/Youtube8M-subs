 student that eat with high rotor everything 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.380
 the day but you can turn it into a 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.290
 very familiar dish because you fall with 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.870
 it snores at the table and is super fresh and 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.380

 be in natural oil and I like the 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.750
 natural 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:53.200
 of oil simply with that too 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.430
 could choose one of the three but 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.840
 you imagine that you are going to combine them 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.010
 of the red today I do the green one to the one of 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.350

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.260
 just incorporate everything in here 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.750
 so that it is very rich and tasty be 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.250
 simply the student had already 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.250

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:20.810

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.080
 base then I had this pumpkin 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.780

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.689
