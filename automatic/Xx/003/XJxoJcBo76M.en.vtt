00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.750
 at this end with today's release we 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.150
 let's talk about the flashlight that will 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.219
 use baby in game fnaf 4 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.410
 be sure to put likes if you want 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.849
 see more videos on this game and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.400
 let's begin 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.400
 watching the trailer, you can immediately understand that 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.100
 the only light source requires 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.310
 be a flashlight if you turn it off then 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.099
 any room will be completely dark 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.800
 there was no such thing in any part of fnaf 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.320
 and I think that with this innovation the game 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.920
 will be much worse than ever 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.170
 don't know what you see when you turn it on 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.390
 flashlight and judging by the trailer 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.539
 turn it on and off until 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.030
 remote and often notice that on 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.559
 screen no charge indicator 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.840
 flashlight batteries 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.260
 that means it will work 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.020
 constantly on the thriller can be easily 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.329
 suggest future gameplay which would 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.879
 occur as follows in general 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.580
 Our arsenal will be a flashlight with 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.909
 unlimited energy let 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.720
 it can not shut off completely and it 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.360
 cool 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.450
 however, if you keep it on for a long time 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.659
 it will flash and then turn off. 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.150
 turn it on immediately will not work this too 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.090
 cool because at this moment you can 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.090
 get a ton of adrenaline and to have it 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.720
 grumbles will have to wait some time 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.540
 well to the flashlight hi yourself and start again 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.330
 work 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.670
 that's why with thrillers games when 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.920
 the child lit the corridor then he shouted hey 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.990
 shouted a flashlight so that he would not 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.820
 disconnected 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.340
 flicker will be the indicator 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.860
 flashlight and as soon as it starts 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.050
 flicker you need to turn it off immediately on 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.320
 few seconds and then use 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.140
 again I think that this version of the gameplay 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.740
 expects you 4 parts fnaf 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.820
 since the moment you turn off the flashlight 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.150
 it gets completely dark 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.940
 sometimes you don't know what to see in 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.290
 The moment of turning on the flashlight is this 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.560
 new effect 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.650
 do 4 part of a lot worse 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.110
 I hope you liked the release and write to 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.209

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.220

 flashlight in the new part of fnaf necessarily
