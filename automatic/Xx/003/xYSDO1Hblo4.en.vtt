00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.199 
so very nice looking again very detailed
for<00:02:11.870> articulation<00:02:12.440> his<00:02:12.709> head<00:02:12.770> can<00:02:13.459> rotate<00:02:13.610> 360

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
for articulation his head can rotate 360

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.330 
for articulation his head can rotate 360
degrees<00:02:14.450> go<00:02:14.959> up<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.290> down<00:02:15.470> its<00:02:15.950> arms<00:02:16.069> can

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
degrees go up and down its arms can

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.940 
degrees go up and down its arms can
rotate<00:02:16.400> 360<00:02:17.000> degrees<00:02:17.440> but<00:02:18.440> if<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.620> do<00:02:18.770> that

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
rotate 360 degrees but if you do that

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.130 
rotate 360 degrees but if you do that
his<00:02:19.370> shoulder<00:02:20.150> armor<00:02:20.630> will<00:02:20.810> pop<00:02:21.020> off<00:02:21.940> if<00:02:22.940> you

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
his shoulder armor will pop off if you

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
his shoulder armor will pop off if you
move<00:02:24.140> them<00:02:24.380> out<00:02:24.650> there<00:02:25.459> will<00:02:25.610> also<00:02:25.700> pop<00:02:26.030> off<00:02:26.239> so

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
move them out there will also pop off so

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.710 
move them out there will also pop off so
does<00:02:28.160> have<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.550> same<00:02:28.940> problem<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.390> the

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
does have the same problem that the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.500 
does have the same problem that the
movie<00:02:30.050> Iron<00:02:30.319> Man<00:02:30.500> figures<00:02:30.920> did<00:02:31.160> but<00:02:31.489> not<00:02:32.300> too

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
movie Iron Man figures did but not too

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.229 
movie Iron Man figures did but not too
bad<00:02:32.739> you<00:02:33.739> can<00:02:33.860> bend<00:02:34.040> at<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.190> elbow<00:02:34.670> where<00:02:35.120> to

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
bad you can bend at the elbow where to

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.780 
bad you can bend at the elbow where to
360<00:02:35.900> degrees<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.350> elbow<00:02:36.739> wrist<00:02:37.400> can<00:02:37.580> or<00:02:37.670> to

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
360 degrees to the elbow wrist can or to

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.870 
360 degrees to the elbow wrist can or to
360<00:02:38.480> degrees<00:02:38.780> so<00:02:39.590> upper<00:02:39.769> body<00:02:39.950> can<00:02:40.160> rotate<00:02:40.400> 360

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
360 degrees so upper body can rotate 360

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.930 
360 degrees so upper body can rotate 360
degrees<00:02:41.090> as<00:02:41.480> well<00:02:41.660> as<00:02:41.720> go<00:02:41.840> forward<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.319> back

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
degrees as well as go forward and back

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.550 
degrees as well as go forward and back
its<00:02:43.940> legs<00:02:44.150> can<00:02:44.390> we<00:02:44.450> go<00:02:44.540> forward<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.050> back<00:02:45.260> out

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
its legs can we go forward and back out

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.790 
its legs can we go forward and back out
from<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.010> body<00:02:46.190> bend<00:02:47.090> at<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.269> knee<00:02:47.540> for<00:02:48.050> 360

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
from the body bend at the knee for 360

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.800 
from the body bend at the knee for 360
degrees<00:02:49.130> at<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.370> knee<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:49.790> his<00:02:50.360> feet<00:02:50.569> can

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
degrees at the knee and his feet can

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.350 
degrees at the knee and his feet can
pivot<00:02:51.050> up<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:51.620> down<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:51.980> rotate<00:02:52.610> 360<00:02:53.330> degrees

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
pivot up and down and rotate 360 degrees

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.540 
pivot up and down and rotate 360 degrees
so<00:02:53.870> he<00:02:54.650> has<00:02:54.769> pretty<00:02:55.100> good<00:02:55.250> articulation

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
so he has pretty good articulation

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.900 
so he has pretty good articulation
surprisingly<00:02:56.420> not<00:02:56.660> as<00:02:56.780> much<00:02:56.930> as<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.910> classic

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
surprisingly not as much as the classic

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.660 
surprisingly not as much as the classic
iron<00:02:59.090> man<00:02:59.739> but<00:03:00.739> still<00:03:01.010> good<00:03:01.370> amount<00:03:01.610> of

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
iron man but still good amount of

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.370 
iron man but still good amount of
articulation<00:03:02.360> enough<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:02.930> put<00:03:03.080> them<00:03:03.170> in<00:03:03.260> some

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
articulation enough to put them in some

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.000 
articulation enough to put them in some
pretty<00:03:03.500> cool<00:03:03.680> poses<00:03:03.950> for<00:03:04.340> display<00:03:05.739> for<00:03:06.739> size

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
pretty cool poses for display for size

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.460 
pretty cool poses for display for size
comparison<00:03:07.390> here<00:03:08.390> is<00:03:08.630> next<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.080> classic

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470

bumblebee he's a little bit taller than
bumblebee<00:03:44.510> also<00:03:44.780> so<00:03:45.380> he's<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.590> pretty

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
bumblebee also so he's a pretty

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.750 
bumblebee also so he's a pretty
good-sized<00:03:46.190> video<00:03:46.609> um<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:48.350> also<00:03:48.620> i<00:03:48.920> forgot<00:03:49.459> to

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
good-sized video um and also i forgot to

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.870 
good-sized video um and also i forgot to
show<00:03:49.910> this<00:03:50.079> but<00:03:51.079> you<00:03:51.260> can<00:03:51.290> still<00:03:51.880> obviously

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
show this but you can still obviously

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.530 
show this but you can still obviously

click this repulsor blast thing onto his
arm<00:03:56.660> but<00:03:56.870> again<00:03:57.109> like<00:03:57.980> i<00:03:58.100> said<00:03:58.130> it's<00:03:58.519> pretty

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
arm but again like i said it's pretty

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.699 
arm but again like i said it's pretty
much<00:03:59.150> worthless<00:03:59.540> if<00:03:59.930> you're<00:04:00.109> playing<00:04:00.290> with<00:04:00.500> it

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
much worthless if you're playing with it

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.530 
much worthless if you're playing with it
if<00:04:01.160> you're<00:04:01.340> applying<00:04:01.640> it<00:04:01.850> looks<00:04:02.090> pretty<00:04:02.329> cool

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
if you're applying it looks pretty cool

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.949 
if you're applying it looks pretty cool
but<00:04:02.870> yeah<00:04:03.200> um<00:04:03.940> overall<00:04:04.940> i'll<00:04:05.329> probably<00:04:05.780> have

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
but yeah um overall i'll probably have

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.479 
but yeah um overall i'll probably have
to<00:04:06.019> give<00:04:06.200> this<00:04:06.319> figure<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.769> four<00:04:07.130> and<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.250> half<00:04:07.280> of

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
to give this figure a four and a half of

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.319 
to give this figure a four and a half of
the<00:04:07.549> five<00:04:08.079> i<00:04:09.079> wish<00:04:09.799> they<00:04:10.010> would<00:04:10.160> have<00:04:10.250> not<00:04:11.090> had

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
the five i wish they would have not had

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.360 
the five i wish they would have not had
