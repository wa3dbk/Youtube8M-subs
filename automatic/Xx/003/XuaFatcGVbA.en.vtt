00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
because they do something that we can't

because they do something that we can't
do<00:00:38.700> they<00:00:39.239> hear<00:00:39.450> all<00:00:39.629> these<00:00:39.780> distinctions<00:00:40.260> and

used in our native languages maybe how

used in our native languages maybe how
they<00:00:45.840> learn<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.559> way<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:46.890> speak<00:00:47.309> to

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
they learn it is the way we speak to

they learn it is the way we speak to
them<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.300> know<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.930> know

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
them and and I know that you know

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.660 
them and and I know that you know
whenever<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.829> hear<00:00:50.010> mothers<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.550> fathers

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
whenever you hear mothers and fathers

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.459 
whenever you hear mothers and fathers
speak<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.300> their<00:00:51.449> kids<00:00:51.719> there<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.110> very

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
speak to their kids there is a very

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.110 
speak to their kids there is a very
distinctive<00:00:53.129> speech<00:00:53.430> pattern<00:00:53.820> there's<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
distinctive speech pattern there's a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.799 
distinctive speech pattern there's a
sort<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.449> singsong<00:00:54.989> hello<00:00:55.829> baby<00:00:56.570> why<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.629> we

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
sort of singsong hello baby why do we

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.110 
sort of singsong hello baby why do we
why<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.260> do<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.590> how<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.609> probably

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
why do we do that how we do it probably

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.810 
why do we do that how we do it probably
unconsciously<00:01:01.050> yeah<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.890> know<00:01:02.190> intuitively

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
unconsciously yeah we know intuitively

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.880 
unconsciously yeah we know intuitively
that<00:01:03.329> children<00:01:03.660> are<00:01:03.809> not<00:01:03.989> able<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.409> hear

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
that children are not able to hear

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.039 
that children are not able to hear
complex<00:01:05.790> sentences<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.810> do<00:01:06.930> is

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
complex sentences and so what we do is

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.840 
complex sentences and so what we do is
simplify<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.590> language<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.220> make<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.369> very

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
simplify the language and make it very

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.450 
simplify the language and make it very
interesting<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.659> listen<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.070> increase

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
interesting to listen to so we increase

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.490 
interesting to listen to so we increase
the<00:01:11.640> pitch<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.330> speak<00:01:12.570> more<00:01:12.780> slowly<00:01:12.960> and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the pitch and we speak more slowly and

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.649 
the pitch and we speak more slowly and
we<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:14.010> very<00:01:14.520> exaggerated<00:01:15.150> intonation

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
we have very exaggerated intonation

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.990 
we have very exaggerated intonation
contours<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.979> conditioning<00:01:17.490> them<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
contours so that is conditioning them to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.850 
contours so that is conditioning them to
the<00:01:18.180> language<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.869> whatever<00:01:19.200> culture<00:01:19.710> they're

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the language of whatever culture they're

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.789 
the language of whatever culture they're
in<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.850> increases<00:01:21.630> their<00:01:21.990> attention<00:01:22.530> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
in it it increases their attention to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.890 
in it it increases their attention to
what<00:01:23.400> we're<00:01:23.549> saying<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.210> how<00:01:24.390> we're<00:01:24.600> saying

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
what we're saying and how we're saying

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.050 
what we're saying and how we're saying
it<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.290> both<00:01:25.530> emotionally<00:01:26.280> satisfying<00:01:26.820> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it it's both emotionally satisfying and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.090 
it it's both emotionally satisfying and
it<00:01:27.570> has<00:01:27.750> linguistic<00:01:28.409> information<00:01:28.920> that's

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
it has linguistic information that's

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.039 
it has linguistic information that's
simpler<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:29.820> their<00:01:29.939> brains<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.360> process<00:01:30.780> is

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
simpler for their brains to process is

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.109 
simpler for their brains to process is
it<00:01:31.470> also<00:01:31.619> true<00:01:31.799> your<00:01:32.130> research<00:01:32.490> suggests<00:01:33.000> that

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
it also true your research suggests that

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
it also true your research suggests that
babies<00:01:33.720> are<00:01:33.750> actually<00:01:34.170> much<00:01:34.470> better<00:01:34.710> than

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
babies are actually much better than

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.010 
babies are actually much better than

examples<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.040> have<00:01:44.070> from<00:01:44.909> 0<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.299> 7

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
examples that we have from 0 to 7

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.359 
examples that we have from 0 to 7
children<00:01:46.200> are<00:01:46.320> phenomenal<00:01:47.040> at<00:01:47.220> their

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
children are phenomenal at their

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.910 
children are phenomenal at their
abilities<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.850> simply<00:01:48.270> absorb<00:01:48.920> information

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
abilities to simply absorb information

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.160 
abilities to simply absorb information
about<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> language<00:01:51.090> by<00:01:51.240> listening<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.869> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
about a language by listening to it and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.780 
about a language by listening to it and
as<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.680> move<00:01:52.829> towards<00:01:53.189> puberty<00:01:53.640> that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
as you move towards puberty that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.270 
as you move towards puberty that
completely<00:01:54.509> changes<00:01:55.049> after<00:01:55.680> puberty<00:01:55.890> it's

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
completely changes after puberty it's

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.280 
completely changes after puberty it's
much<00:01:56.640> much<00:01:56.909> more<00:01:57.119> difficult<00:01:57.270> well<00:01:57.869> no<00:01:58.049> wonder

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
much much more difficult well no wonder

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.260 
much much more difficult well no wonder
I<00:01:58.439> have<00:01:58.649> such<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.860> hard<00:01:59.130> time<00:01:59.159> learning<00:01:59.790> Spanish

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
I have such a hard time learning Spanish

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.499 
I have such a hard time learning Spanish
or<00:02:00.630> French<00:02:00.680> yes<00:02:01.680> that's<00:02:01.979> true<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.640> what

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
or French yes that's true and what

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.030 
or French yes that's true and what
babies<00:02:03.840> are<00:02:03.990> doing<00:02:04.290> one<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.590> reasons<00:02:04.890> it's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
babies are doing one of the reasons it's

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.440 
babies are doing one of the reasons it's
so<00:02:05.100> interesting<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.640> study<00:02:05.939> them<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.270> we'll

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
so interesting to study them is we'll

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.999 
so interesting to study them is we'll
learn<00:02:06.659> some<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.200> magic<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.860> they're

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
learn some of the magic that they're

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.949 
learn some of the magic that they're
applying<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:09.090> language<00:02:09.929> learning

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
applying to that language learning

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.309 
applying to that language learning
information<00:02:10.670> early<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.910> maybe<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.870> can<00:02:13.110> do

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
information early and maybe we can do

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.790 
information early and maybe we can do
something<00:02:13.560> too

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
something too

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.010 
something too
helped<00:02:13.950> adults<00:02:14.310> learn<00:02:14.520> later<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.210> life<00:02:15.360> well

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
helped adults learn later in life well

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.750 
helped adults learn later in life well
if<00:02:16.200> there's<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.650> window<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.100> opportunity

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
if there's the window of opportunity

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.730 
if there's the window of opportunity
does<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.210> mean<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.930> at<00:02:19.140> some<00:02:19.350> point<00:02:19.590> that

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
does that mean that at some point that

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.190 
does that mean that at some point that
window<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.100> gonna<00:02:20.250> slam<00:02:20.610> shut<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.570> definitely

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
window is gonna slam shut it definitely

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.990 
window is gonna slam shut it definitely
narrows<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.920> doesn't<00:02:23.310> mean<00:02:23.520> it's<00:02:23.700> impossible

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
narrows it doesn't mean it's impossible

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.490 
narrows it doesn't mean it's impossible
but<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.510> narrows<00:02:24.870> if<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.140> think<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.440> the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
but it narrows if you think of the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.520 
but it narrows if you think of the
physiology<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.490> brain<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.720> synapses<00:02:28.380> in

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
physiology of the brain that synapses in

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.690 
physiology of the brain that synapses in
the<00:02:28.560> first<00:02:28.830> three<00:02:29.010> years<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.280> life<00:02:29.520> are

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
the first three years of life are

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.420 
the first three years of life are
growing<00:02:30.240> in<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.480> huge<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.230> fast<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.860> rapid<00:02:32.250> way

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
growing in a huge and fast and rapid way

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.220 
growing in a huge and fast and rapid way
fin<00:02:32.910> absence<00:02:33.270> being<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> synapses<00:02:33.960> are<00:02:34.110> the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
fin absence being the synapses are the

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.230 
fin absence being the synapses are the
connections<00:02:34.680> between<00:02:34.860> neurons<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:36.060> that's

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
connections between neurons and that's

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.030 
connections between neurons and that's
the<00:02:36.450> way<00:02:36.540> information<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.200> communicated<00:02:37.410> and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
the way information is communicated and

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.190 
the way information is communicated and
so<00:02:38.430> at<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.670> age<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.970> three<00:02:39.300> children<00:02:40.080> have

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
so at the age of three children have

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.290 
so at the age of three children have
three<00:02:40.470> times<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.980> synapses<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.700> we<00:02:41.910> have<00:02:42.120> as

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
three times the synapses that we have as

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.930 
three times the synapses that we have as
adults<00:02:42.450> as<00:02:43.230> they<00:02:43.530> move<00:02:43.770> from<00:02:43.950> babyhood<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.790> the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
adults as they move from babyhood to the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.340 
adults as they move from babyhood to the
teenage<00:02:45.300> years<00:02:45.480> when<00:02:45.780> another<00:02:46.020> major

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
teenage years when another major

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.750 
teenage years when another major
revolution<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.160> going<00:02:47.220> on

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
revolution is going on

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.480 
revolution is going on
they<00:02:48.000> prune<00:02:48.450> synapses<00:02:49.380> as<00:02:49.590> we<00:02:49.800> prune<00:02:50.160> rose

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
they prune synapses as we prune rose

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.000 
they prune synapses as we prune rose
bushes<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:51.480> make<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.930> remaining<00:02:52.500> connections

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
bushes to make the remaining connections

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.090 
bushes to make the remaining connections
more<00:02:53.430> strong<00:02:53.850> they<00:02:54.840> are<00:02:54.870> pruning<00:02:55.410> synapses

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
more strong they are pruning synapses

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.100 
more strong they are pruning synapses
that<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:56.520> been<00:02:56.550> used<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.660> they<00:02:57.780> actually

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
that have not been used so they actually

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.780 
that have not been used so they actually
have<00:02:58.200> more<00:02:58.410> synapses<00:02:58.710> than<00:02:59.100> Cronos<00:02:59.460> how<00:02:59.640> many

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
have more synapses than Cronos how many

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.030 
have more synapses than Cronos how many
to<00:02:59.910> solutely<00:03:00.360> many<00:03:00.570> that's<00:03:01.050> why<00:03:01.290> opposite<00:03:01.950> of

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
to solutely many that's why opposite of

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.920 
to solutely many that's why opposite of
what<00:03:02.190> we<00:03:02.310> think<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.910> three-year-old<00:03:03.570> is

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
what we think the three-year-old is

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.110 
what we think the three-year-old is
ready<00:03:04.230> for<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.590> world<00:03:04.830> all<00:03:05.190> possibilities

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
ready for the world all possibilities

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.080 
ready for the world all possibilities
and<00:03:06.420> yet<00:03:06.960> to<00:03:07.260> focus<00:03:07.890> on<00:03:08.100> particular<00:03:08.820> to

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
and yet to focus on particular to

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.120 
and yet to focus on particular to
develop<00:03:09.420> expertise<00:03:10.050> in<00:03:10.230> any<00:03:10.350> one<00:03:10.560> language<00:03:10.770> or

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
develop expertise in any one language or

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.790 
develop expertise in any one language or
area<00:03:11.520> just<00:03:12.510> as<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.840> take<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.140> plant<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.740> you

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
area just as you take a plant and you

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.190 
area just as you take a plant and you
prune<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.850> want<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.360> plant<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.750> develop

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
prune it you want that plant to develop

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.140 
prune it you want that plant to develop
strength<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.160> remaining<00:03:17.460> connections

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
strength in the remaining connections

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.000 
strength in the remaining connections
and<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.720> brain<00:03:18.959> is<00:03:19.140> really<00:03:19.380> undergoing

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
and so the brain is really undergoing

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.100 
and so the brain is really undergoing
major<00:03:20.370> revolution<00:03:21.209> now<00:03:21.450> some<00:03:21.660> parents<00:03:21.810> might

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
major revolution now some parents might

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.600 
major revolution now some parents might
think<00:03:22.350> well<00:03:22.500> maybe<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.770> should<00:03:23.010> just<00:03:23.250> stick<00:03:23.430> my

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
think well maybe I should just stick my

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.729 
think well maybe I should just stick my
babies<00:03:24.330> in<00:03:24.540> front<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.870> video<00:03:25.200> have<00:03:25.530> them

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
babies in front of a video have them

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.370 
babies in front of a video have them
learn<00:03:25.950> Chinese<00:03:26.550> or<00:03:26.820> Spanish<00:03:27.300> from<00:03:27.480> from<00:03:28.050> the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
learn Chinese or Spanish from from the

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.690 
learn Chinese or Spanish from from the
time<00:03:28.560> they're<00:03:28.739> really<00:03:28.890> really<00:03:29.160> young<00:03:29.459> does

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
time they're really really young does

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.130 
time they're really really young does
that<00:03:29.850> work<00:03:30.060> well<00:03:30.390> there<00:03:30.690> again<00:03:30.720> the

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
that work well there again the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.050 
that work well there again the
experiments<00:03:31.709> give<00:03:31.890> us<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.220> answer<00:03:32.610> we've

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
experiments give us the answer we've

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.120 
experiments give us the answer we've
done<00:03:33.330> experiments<00:03:33.750> where<00:03:34.140> babies<00:03:34.830> at<00:03:34.980> nine

about books and toys we see that in live
situations<00:03:45.030> they<00:03:45.630> learn<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.440> much<00:03:46.739> in<00:03:47.489> that

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550
