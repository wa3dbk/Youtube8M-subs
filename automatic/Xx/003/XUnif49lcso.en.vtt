00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.420
 for the cane followed by a match 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:10.470
 complicated difficult where the result to 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.610
 end was unexpected and a sadness 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:17.570
 because one can not find him 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.970
 the result we try to give the best 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.840
 but good are gusts that one has to 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.759
 put the chest 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.760
 I am 33 years old I have spent many things 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.530
 in my life as for 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.160
 so as not to put on his chest this is a fan 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:36.750
 of the contagious club my teammates have 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.510
 eager to reverse this if not 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.610
 annoys those insults that you do not have to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.680
 understand the people who come half 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.710
 hit that is hopeful in this 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.140
 team and will finish a game 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.140
 final that is that we are 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.790
 explanations I do not tell you we're hurt 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:00.380
 very hurt because reality we wanted 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.630
 that ricardo starts the golden stage 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.420
 winning as a local in the people is a 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.310
 party 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.070
 and the party like all the parties but 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.290
 well we could not 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.670
 It infects inside the court what 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.460
 that come looking for let's continue 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.280
 working as I tell you to put the chest 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.380
 to this to accompany the leadership 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.890
 that is making a great big effort 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.110
 for maintaining this campus because 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.229
 I knew growing you do not have to pay or 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.970
 pay that the players are the ones 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.890
 we entered the field and that there is 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.840
 separate what football is what it is 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.670
 the club you have to separate the leaders 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.400
 of what football is we take care of 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.229
 of our thing but good people 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.300
 have peace of mind that you enjoy 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.009
 growing in the results are going to go to 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.390
 come because we 're going to if we're 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.160
 working hard we will continue 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.440
 working harder or we're going to try to 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.330
 take out that plus we each have for 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.210
 reverse this because I tell them the truth 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.340
 that we are very sad and good this 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.369
 to speak for me that I am 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.320
 going through a more delicate moment because 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.690
 I do not like to lose because I'm a fan of 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.000
 club because it hurts more than more than 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.050
 no one losing a game like that 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.120
 lost 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.540
 they have identified what the problem is 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:16.590
 of soccer that is happening 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.510
 lately you 're looking for football 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.550
 how nice football is this that you can 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.010
 lose at the last minute that you can 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.200
 win as with the luck you had 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.870
 because they had hit the stick they had 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.630
 missed a penalty and if one goes with a 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.000
 triumph perhaps opaque something that the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.510
 reality within the field was not that of 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.460
 result because yes I think if today one 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.500
 I saw the result of the team I think 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.960
 I'm with short is he told me to take 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.420
 the triumph but well we could not have 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.220
 won with a little bit of that fortune that 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.800
 one wants to have sometimes but good 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.850
 escaped with as if he did not escape the two 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.430
 previous matches must be done 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.530
 charge of what we have been doing 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.750
 working tomorrow getting back to training 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.090
 that good of schoolboys and continue to follow 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.070
 dreaming to continue with this with this 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.860
 project hopefully we can reverse 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.570
 17 dates are not that morning each 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.850
 one goes home today in miami almost not 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.160
 we play in temple and I have we have 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.750
 to put the chest until June and see what 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.930
 that what comes out we are still hopeful 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.740
 we keep thinking positive because in 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.910
 football is nice this you're 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.810
 down and tomorrow can be up like this 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.810
 that we are going to continue laburando
