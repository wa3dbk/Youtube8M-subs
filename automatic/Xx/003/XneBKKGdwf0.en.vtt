this<00:00:02.190> is<00:00:02.310> like<00:00:02.520> 240z<00:00:03.149> running<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:03.990> standard<00:00:04.440> 2.4

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:05.480 
this is like 240z running a standard 2.4

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:13.180 
this is like 240z running a standard 2.4
l<00:00:06.480> series<00:00:07.020> motor<00:00:08.780> and<00:00:09.780> over<00:00:10.019> here<00:00:11.030> we<00:00:12.030> have<00:00:12.210> a

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
l series motor and over here we have a

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:22.519 
l series motor and over here we have a

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
2.8 l 28 motor running on 240z carbs the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.800 
2.8 l 28 motor running on 240z carbs the
motor<00:00:22.769> was<00:00:22.980> donated<00:00:23.580> by<00:00:24.320> club<00:00:25.320> members<00:00:25.740> and

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
motor was donated by club members and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.849 
motor was donated by club members and
the<00:00:27.810> carburetors<00:00:28.349> were<00:00:28.410> loaned<00:00:28.710> by<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> member

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
the carburetors were loaned by a member

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.180 
the carburetors were loaned by a member
I've<00:00:31.859> cut<00:00:32.279> sections<00:00:33.149> from<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.950> engine<00:00:34.950> so

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
I've cut sections from the engine so

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.709 
I've cut sections from the engine so
that<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.790> seen<00:00:36.500> moving<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.540> that

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
that it can be seen moving so that

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.040 
that it can be seen moving so that
perhaps<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.500> seen<00:00:40.710> moving<00:00:41.390> at<00:00:42.390> some<00:00:42.719> stage

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
perhaps can be seen moving at some stage

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.750 
perhaps can be seen moving at some stage
I<00:00:43.320> want<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:45.050> go<00:00:46.050> further<00:00:46.320> than<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.039> there

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
I want to go further than that so there

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.479 
I want to go further than that so there
is<00:00:47.879> more<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.300> exposed<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.340> have<00:00:50.340> been

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
is more of it exposed and have been

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:04.969 
is more of it exposed and have been
moving<00:00:50.700> parts<00:00:51.120> grease

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.740 

there's<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.229> hunk<00:01:07.229> cutout<00:01:07.649> of<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.890> head<00:01:08.630> so<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
there's a hunk cutout of the head so the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.709 
there's a hunk cutout of the head so the
valves<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.289> be<00:01:10.350> seen<00:01:10.680> moving<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.990> numbers

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
valves can be seen moving in numbers

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:19.039 
valves can be seen moving in numbers
four<00:01:15.719> and<00:01:15.750> six<00:01:16.229> Pistons<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:17.219> other<00:01:17.460> men<00:01:18.049> it

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
four and six Pistons going other men it

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.399 
four and six Pistons going other men it
actually<00:01:19.469> runs<00:01:20.420> quite<00:01:21.420> nicely<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:22.049> numbers

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
actually runs quite nicely on numbers

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.419 
actually runs quite nicely on numbers
one<00:01:22.590> two<00:01:22.829> and<00:01:22.950> three<00:01:24.649> I'll<00:01:25.649> switch<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.220> and

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
one two and three I'll switch it on and

00:01:26.429 --> 00:02:30.900 
one two and three I'll switch it on and
see<00:01:27.149> if<00:01:27.210> it'll<00:01:27.390> go

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:03:31.250 

definitely<00:02:31.910> on<00:02:32.030> number<00:02:32.330> one<00:02:32.480> two<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.750> three

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.210 

at<00:03:32.260> some<00:03:32.530> stage<00:03:32.650> on<00:03:33.010> to<00:03:34.650> cut<00:03:35.650> into<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:35.980> block

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
at some stage on to cut into the block

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.780 
at some stage on to cut into the block
and<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:38.580> oil<00:03:39.580> pump<00:03:41.040> section<00:03:42.040> or<00:03:42.250> these<00:03:42.459> or

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
and the oil pump section or these or

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.059 
and the oil pump section or these or
this<00:03:42.940> area<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:45.750> Gries<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:47.019> con<00:03:47.200> rods<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.769> the

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
this area and Gries the con rods and the

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.490 
this area and Gries the con rods and the
main<00:03:48.250> bearings<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:49.090> have<00:03:50.080> it<00:03:50.170> running<00:03:50.379> like

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
main bearings and have it running like

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.910 
main bearings and have it running like
that<00:03:50.890> we'll<00:03:51.610> see<00:03:51.790> what
