00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.410
 save some files when we 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.230
 we unlocked our device with the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.960
 sap application as everyone knows as 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.940

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.860
 a log to another telephone company 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.370
 we have to do the process of sant 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.600
 from the beginning to the end and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.460
 good to save 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.860
 these files we no longer have to do 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.260
 that process we simply introduce the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.310
 card that we want to use and 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.980

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.160

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.130
 with winrar we give ok ok we can close the 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.280
 watch if we want and if we go to the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.989
 network folder we can not appreciate that 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.350
 here we have what is the file 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.270
 saved and I get 2 because this one has 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.819
 double done but you are going to be 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.110
 a single file in winrar and in which 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.110
 if we unzip it
