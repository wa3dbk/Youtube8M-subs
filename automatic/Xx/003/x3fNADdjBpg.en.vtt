00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:06.190 

today<00:00:04.859> we're<00:00:05.009> replacing<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.580> upstream

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
today we're replacing the upstream

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.320 
today we're replacing the upstream
oxygen<00:00:07.200> sensor<00:00:07.529> on<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.340> 98<00:00:08.730> Chevy<00:00:08.820> Cavalier

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
oxygen sensor on a 98 Chevy Cavalier

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.240 
oxygen sensor on a 98 Chevy Cavalier
which<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.110> also<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.710> Pontiac<00:00:11.460> Sunfire<00:00:13.040> so<00:00:14.040> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
which is also a Pontiac Sunfire so the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.920 
which is also a Pontiac Sunfire so the
upstream<00:00:15.080> oxygen<00:00:16.080> sensor<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:17.660> right<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:20.930> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
upstream oxygen sensor is right on the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.679 
upstream oxygen sensor is right on the
end<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> exhaust<00:00:22.769> manifold<00:00:24.230> right<00:00:25.230> there

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
end of the exhaust manifold right there

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.839 
end of the exhaust manifold right there
so<00:00:27.689> an<00:00:28.380> easy<00:00:28.590> way<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.890> do<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.519> get<00:00:29.670> one

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
so an easy way to do this is to get one

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.840 
so an easy way to do this is to get one
of<00:00:29.970> these<00:00:30.090> oxygen<00:00:30.929> sensor<00:00:31.380> sockets<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.640> lets

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
of these oxygen sensor sockets it lets

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.870 
of these oxygen sensor sockets it lets
you<00:00:33.000> put<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.420> wire<00:00:33.829> inside<00:00:34.829> here<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.700> can

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
you put the wire inside here so you can

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.370 
you put the wire inside here so you can
use<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> socket<00:00:36.360> they<00:00:36.630> get<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> sensor<00:00:37.200> out

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
use the socket they get the sensor out

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.319 
use the socket they get the sensor out
you<00:00:38.070> don't<00:00:38.219> need<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.030> can<00:00:39.120> just

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
you don't need to do this you can just

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.549 
you don't need to do this you can just
use<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.690> regular<00:00:39.930> box<00:00:40.320> wrench<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:42.379> this<00:00:43.379> is

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
use a regular box wrench but this is

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.260 
use a regular box wrench but this is
definitely<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.309> easiest<00:00:44.610> way<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.120> is

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
definitely the easiest way so this is

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.360 
definitely the easiest way so this is
what<00:00:45.390> I'm<00:00:45.510> gonna<00:00:45.719> do<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.250> there's<00:00:47.250> an

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
what I'm gonna do so there's an

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.630 
what I'm gonna do so there's an
electrical<00:00:47.820> connector<00:00:48.180> right<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:49.489> that<00:00:50.489> it

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
electrical connector right here that it

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:02.299 
electrical connector right here that it
attaches<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:52.789> I'm<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.940> gonna<00:00:55.280> pull<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.430> off

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
here's our new one comes to a string -

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.670 
here's our new one comes to a string -
and<00:01:40.240> this<00:01:41.240> has<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.840> little<00:01:42.170> crimp<00:01:42.440> thing

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
and this has a little crimp thing

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.730 
and this has a little crimp thing
already<00:01:43.039> on<00:01:43.190> it<00:01:43.369> what<00:01:43.670> we<00:01:43.759> need<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:43.970> do<00:01:44.149> is<00:01:44.740> we

already on it what we need to do is we

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.249 
already on it what we need to do is we
need<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:45.970> transfer<00:01:46.970> this<00:01:47.259> electrical

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
need to transfer this electrical

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.029 
need to transfer this electrical
connector<00:01:48.680> onto<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.850> new<00:01:50.000> one<00:01:50.770> so<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:51.860> want

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
connector onto the new one so you want

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.249 
connector onto the new one so you want
to<00:01:52.130> cut<00:01:52.280> off<00:01:52.310> good<00:01:53.210> amount<00:01:53.479> of<00:01:53.509> wire<00:01:53.690> say<00:01:54.110> like

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
to cut off good amount of wire say like

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:54.850 
to cut off good amount of wire say like
right<00:01:54.409> there

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
right there

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:05.520 
right there
maybe<00:01:55.729> a<00:01:55.789> little<00:01:55.880> bit<00:01:56.060> more<00:01:57.759> let's<00:01:58.759> do<00:01:58.970> that

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.749 

these<00:02:06.530> nippers<00:02:07.009> suck<00:02:07.460> there<00:02:07.880> we<00:02:07.940> go

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
these nippers suck there we go

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.729 
these nippers suck there we go
so<00:02:10.759> now<00:02:11.140> we're<00:02:12.140> gonna<00:02:12.459> strip<00:02:13.459> some<00:02:13.670> wire<00:02:13.910> off

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
so now we're gonna strip some wire off

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.920 
so now we're gonna strip some wire off
putting<00:02:15.739> it<00:02:15.950> in<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.220> appropriate<00:02:16.549> sized<00:02:17.269> hole

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.470 

no<00:02:20.930> jokes

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.980 

there<00:02:28.480> we<00:02:28.569> go

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
there we go

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.780 
there we go
you<00:02:29.620> don't<00:02:29.770> want<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:29.950> strip<00:02:30.130> too<00:02:30.340> much<00:02:30.550> off<00:02:31.380> and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
you don't want to strip too much off and

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.460 
you don't want to strip too much off and
now<00:02:33.790> we<00:02:34.350> put<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.470> exposed<00:02:36.010> wire<00:02:36.540> into<00:02:37.540> the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
now we put this exposed wire into the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:52.020 
now we put this exposed wire into the
little<00:02:39.900> crimper<00:02:47.310> well<00:02:48.600> that's<00:02:49.600> good<00:02:50.250> now<00:02:51.250> we

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
little crimper well that's good now we

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.890 
little crimper well that's good now we
just<00:02:52.270> crimp<00:02:52.900> this<00:02:53.170> down<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:57.540> let's<00:02:58.540> do<00:02:58.750> that

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
just crimp this down and let's do that

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:07.970 
just crimp this down and let's do that
now

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.250 

give<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.190> tug<00:03:09.430> test<00:03:10.560> okay<00:03:12.629> so<00:03:13.629> our<00:03:13.840> shrink

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
give it the tug test okay so our shrink

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.300 
give it the tug test okay so our shrink
tube<00:03:14.500> over<00:03:14.769> this<00:03:14.920> okay<00:03:15.879> so<00:03:16.799> so<00:03:17.799> I<00:03:17.830> don't<00:03:18.040> have

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
tube over this okay so so I don't have

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.070 
tube over this okay so so I don't have
right<00:03:18.940> now<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.120> don't<00:03:19.269> have<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.510> heat<00:03:19.810> gun<00:03:20.019> or

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
right now I don't have a heat gun or

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.070 
right now I don't have a heat gun or
lighter<00:03:21.010> on<00:03:21.280> me<00:03:21.459> so<00:03:22.000> I'm<00:03:22.150> gonna<00:03:22.330> cheat<00:03:23.049> a

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
lighter on me so I'm gonna cheat a

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.970 
lighter on me so I'm gonna cheat a
little<00:03:23.260> bit<00:03:23.409> and<00:03:23.940> use<00:03:24.940> my<00:03:25.390> soldering<00:03:25.720> iron<00:03:26.170> to

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
little bit and use my soldering iron to

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.300 
little bit and use my soldering iron to
shrink<00:03:27.310> this<00:03:28.180> heat<00:03:28.480> shrink<00:03:28.780> tubing<00:03:32.310> my

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
shrink this heat shrink tubing my

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.020 
shrink this heat shrink tubing my
soldering<00:03:33.700> gun<00:03:34.030> rather<00:03:38.430> okay<00:03:39.430> definitely

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
soldering gun rather okay definitely

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.580 
soldering gun rather okay definitely
goes<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.420> show<00:03:40.690> you<00:03:40.750> have<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.140> right<00:03:41.319> tools

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
goes to show you have the right tools

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.339 
goes to show you have the right tools
for<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.829> right<00:03:41.890> job<00:03:44.069> let's<00:03:45.069> put<00:03:45.190> this<00:03:45.280> back<00:03:45.489> in

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
for the right job let's put this back in

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.680 
for the right job let's put this back in
okay<00:03:47.349> now<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.220> new<00:03:48.400> o2<00:03:48.760> sensor<00:03:49.180> comes<00:03:49.450> with<00:03:49.660> a

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
okay now the new o2 sensor comes with a

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.660 
okay now the new o2 sensor comes with a
little<00:03:49.959> bit<00:03:50.079> of<00:03:50.170> anti-seize<00:03:50.319> on<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:51.160> so<00:03:51.609> I'm

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
little bit of anti-seize on it so I'm

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.220 
little bit of anti-seize on it so I'm
just<00:03:51.730> gonna<00:03:51.909> leave<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:52.150> like<00:03:52.359> this<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.840> think

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230
