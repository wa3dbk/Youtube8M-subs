believe and I'd have to say this is the
nicest<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.350> two<00:00:22.529> mainly<00:00:23.160> because<00:00:23.310> it

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
nicest of the two mainly because it

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.980 
nicest of the two mainly because it
doesn't<00:00:23.760> have<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.910> same<00:00:24.150> chunk<00:00:24.570> as<00:00:24.779> the

doesn't have the same chunk as the
innovate<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.650> actually<00:00:25.980> really<00:00:26.189> really

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
innovate it's actually really really
