00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 girls beauty sim huge hi i 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.850
 I am very glad that you looked at my channel 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.799
 watch this video today i want 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.929
 talk about such a little sore 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.509
 We all know the topic since January 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.910
 prices went up very much if you come in 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.490
 in the store you look at the cost of vegetables 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.859
 that head is just spinning and I understand 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.949
 that some eggplant are now 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.369
 more expensive than meat and very often come to me 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.189
 such questions Katya how do you save as 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.219
 you with a budget case and a lot 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.620
 spend on cosmetics and of course the most 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.320
 constantly asked frequently asked 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.760
 the question is of course how much do you get 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.489
 probably start with the fact that I'm not very 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.219
 an economical person I honestly say i don't 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.719
 I can save and thanks to this roller 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.570
 I hope that in the comments you 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.940
 share your tips 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.219
 economical advice how do you cope 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.039
 with this crisis how did you learn 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.199
 or learn to save today we are with you 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.390
 speculate how to learn to save and 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.579
 how to learn to save money i think 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.589
 right now this time period is 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.450
 topic as relevant as ever especially for 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.880
 us girls, let's give such a small 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.280
 prehistory why i'm not thrifty the most 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.530
 on myself why am I a creepy squander to if 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.600
 I have an extra pocket in my wallet 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.560
 grandfather necessarily on anything and not 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.810
 spend i was born rather not what 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.600
 poor family and we had a budget 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.920
 bound I couldn't 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.200
 once again ask the parents to me 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.270
 and bought something and mom was not in 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.049
 mostly extra money for something to me 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.060
 It allows my dad miner those who 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.030
 born and in the mining family know how 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.530
 it was hard in the 90s how not to pay 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.619
 salary and 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.869
 carved out an extra wallet possible to 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.299
 somehow work somewhere to find some 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.890
 extra money and I have it somewhere for 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.399
 put in my head what ever 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.590
 when i grow up i will go to work either 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.079
 when my husband will work I can 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.810
 afford well if not all then at least 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.340
 most part when i already went out 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.430
 work when I got an education 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.229
 cool i got money 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.450
 subconsciously somewhere in the head itself 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.520
 put off that my baby never in 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.260
 life is gone will not need and 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.189
 Now when I had 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.500
 child I can honestly say that I am her 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.810
 I indulge though perhaps this is not yet 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.970
 understand just one and a half years old and I 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.450
 I understand that now it is necessary 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.510
 stops better the child will live in 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.610
 there is someone a shortage of toys there is something else and 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.769
 over time will be aware 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.610
 what can that not be asked what is not 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.470
 ask will also be aware 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.599
 in some elementary purchases at the end 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.970
 ends will not be a spoiled child and 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.129
 so due to my childhood now I 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.590
 I try to buy myself today in what myself 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.079
 do not deny it originated from me 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.269
 somewhere in his head, and wean ourselves girl 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.639
 very very hard other students what 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.829
 there are reasons why we can not 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.930
 force yourself to save or postpone 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.299
 save some money 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.920
 probably the easiest way for us to say bindo 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.599
 it's impossible to constantly have any 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.389
 expenses so the first by itself 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.909
 common cause that worries 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.829
 I guess every person is with me 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.720
 very low salary so mini 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.940
 it will just save me money 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.040
 it seems complete nonsense to talk about 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.590
 that only those who have a girl only 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.840
 they can just put it off 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.970
 some paradox the more money there is 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.160
 the more you want it checked on yourself 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.579
 I personally think if a person is about 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.859
 calculate your expenses 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.709
 income enter any notepad where 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.810
 will paint what he bought and at the end 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.489
 months just look in this notebook and 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.410
 we delete extra points 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.989
 we will simply save ours 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.769
 their salary costs 57 percent 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.650
 of girls 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.599
 gradually polygon chk decree each 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.430
 month we will just cross out these 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.680
 unnecessary expenses and imagine how much 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.720
 money we can save for this 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.780
 our task turns out to be ours 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.129
 keep the usual way of life but 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.310
 a little bit for less cost 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:08.040
 the next paragraph which touched me 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.560
 touched a very long time ago probably 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.979
 since student days I once 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.569
 I tried to postpone the girl because I 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:17.489
 besides studying , she also worked 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.380
 additionally it was very hard and 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.239
 I wanted and I wanted to dress 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.479
 bring some new phone from me 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.270
 This gadget they and began even autumn 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:29.580
 ash is long ago and I only have time 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.280
 heal some money for a month or two i see 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.099
 and I had some amount of money and I 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.409
 headlong running and and spend because 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.630
 I know that somewhere in my head I have 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:41.520
 a list of whom wanted a prison 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.029
 now hanging on the closet which 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.039
 replenished every day but I carry an oval 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:49.169
 all some Wishlist I urgently urgently 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.880
 you need to buy them because u 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.740
 I have some sum deferred 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.570
 money for a rainy day we have to give 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.580
 realize that there are some 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.800
 Wishlist Regular have any 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.659
 irregular which refers for example to 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.550
 Irregular Wishlist for example this 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:05.520
 some kind of disease is some kind of 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.830
 unscheduled trip is the same vacation on 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.050
 the sea she is looking for the sea the day you need both of you 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.330
 very important to actually plan 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.820
 our expenses since student days 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.610
 when my colleagues got paid I 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.680
 heard before with or dialogues that they 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.560
 lay it out just by an envelope on 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.990
 written example disease or 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.770
 some other utilities 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.200
 grocery shopping then we are something swordsman 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.159
 what do you touch cosmetics that is if we 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.289
 spend from this 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.930
 of a certain envelope 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.789
 coin she we should already understand that in 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.000
 this month we have nothing shines from 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:43.770
 This item is another very important thing 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.080
 which probably applies to all this 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.150
 that our accumulation is by no means 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.250
 you can not keep at home, remember that these 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.200
 savings never bring in 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.080
 we are probably no income 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.690
 useful such as savings is some 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.909
 bar bank account or bank 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.590
 contribution but of course I did not go into the subject 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.930
 and and in this is a complete dunce 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.240
 but I know that if I smudged the day 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.960
 either on the card or us I am somewhere in 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.460
 book lies on a rainy day then i 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.930
 I will definitely spend it 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.120
 also some say that very 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.740
 useful to put money in the bank but me 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.139
 it seems a little scary 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.360
 now very popular in credit 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.330
 but I think it's such a terrible lure 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.580
 and and if god forbid we are overdue 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.979
 forget to put the girl either on me 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.810
 salary came either something else or we 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.009
 took a very large amount of money apple 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.400
 the gun is not strong 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:37.889
 but the temptation was so strong and 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.749
 damn it seems to me it is very scary and we 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.539
 think aha if we have a credit 

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:45.180
 a card on us helps out a difficult moment so 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:47.129
 what for to save though I have such 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.590
 credit card it comes with the original 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:51.870
 period and it is very good if 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.789
 God forbid in a family with relatives either 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.949
 somewhere else friends had some 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:57.840
 emergency we can love 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:00.560
 a moment to help some girls if 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.539
 you must get such cards 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.689
 be sure to study the conditions 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.639
 of use 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:07.979
 girls today I shared with you 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:11.460
 such kind of reflections because 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:14.039
 Indeed, the period is not very 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.080
 good and as our president says that 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:17.909
 it will still last about three years and 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.979
 I'm scared to think what prices we have 

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:22.589
 will be in a year because absolutely 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:25.050
 I recently went to the children's store and and 

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:26.520
 I wanted to buy daughters next doll 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.129
 we love Masha a lot 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.490
 cartoon Masha and the bear and if necessary 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:34.439
 the new year has become 2,000 rubles but I am not 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.659
 took when I literally three days ago 

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:40.710
 went to this store and found that 

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:43.020
 this is a wave worth 3,800 i was just 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.639
 shocked and I'm afraid to imagine what prices 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.439
 will be at the end of the year I will 

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:48.149
 to finish his discourse his 

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:50.430
 i really hope that this 

00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:52.409
 the video was interesting and useful for you 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.210
 be sure to join me in 

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:56.460
 reasoning in the comments will be very 

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.199
 glad let's chat but today 

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.569
