00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
picture settings i can change the shape

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.580 
picture settings i can change the shape
of<00:03:29.400> my<00:03:29.430> picture<00:03:29.879> so<00:03:30.540> i<00:03:30.569> can<00:03:30.750> have<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.900> circle<00:03:31.379> a

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.650 
of my picture so i can have a circle a
cylinder<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:33.019> diamond<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.260> gear<00:03:35.209> rounded<00:03:36.209> which

cylinder a diamond a gear rounded which

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.449 
cylinder a diamond a gear rounded which
just<00:03:36.959> changes<00:03:37.379> the<00:03:37.410> edges<00:03:37.889> to<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.069> rounded

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
just changes the edges to a rounded

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.240 
just changes the edges to a rounded
points<00:03:39.389> or<00:03:39.569> a<00:03:39.709> square<00:03:40.709> which<00:03:40.889> is<00:03:40.919> the<00:03:41.099> default

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
points or a square which is the default

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.699 
points or a square which is the default
and<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.030> can<00:03:42.209> also<00:03:42.449> change<00:03:42.690> Lee<00:03:43.049> picture<00:03:43.440> size

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
and I can also change Lee picture size

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.740 
and I can also change Lee picture size
of<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.160> one<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.430> pictures<00:03:44.699> larger<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:45.329> can

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
of the one of the pictures larger I can

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.900 
of the one of the pictures larger I can
do<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.230> can<00:03:46.799> add<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> reflection<00:03:47.549> so<00:03:47.669> as<00:03:47.790> you

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
do that I can add a reflection so as you

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.220 
do that I can add a reflection so as you
can<00:03:48.000> see<00:03:48.120> on<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.299> bottom<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.750> pictures<00:03:49.079> i

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
can see on the bottom of the pictures i

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.659 
can see on the bottom of the pictures i
can<00:03:49.379> add<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> reflection<00:03:50.010> or<00:03:50.040> delete<00:03:50.549> that

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
can add a reflection or delete that

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.879 
can add a reflection or delete that
reflection<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:51.780> it's<00:03:51.900> kind<00:03:52.109> of<00:03:52.199> like<00:03:52.319> a<00:03:52.379> touch

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
reflection so it's kind of like a touch

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.789 
reflection so it's kind of like a touch
flo<00:03:53.129> 3d<00:03:53.790> sort<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.150> image<00:03:54.299> i<00:03:54.629> also<00:03:55.500> change<00:03:55.769> the

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
flo 3d sort of image i also change the

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.979 
flo 3d sort of image i also change the
transparency<00:03:56.159> so<00:03:57.150> if<00:03:57.209> i<00:03:57.269> wanted<00:03:57.449> them<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.900> be

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
transparency so if i wanted them to be

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.110 
transparency so if i wanted them to be
more<00:03:58.169> transparent<00:03:58.409> i<00:03:58.949> can<00:03:59.760> do<00:03:59.819> that<00:03:59.849> as<00:04:00.090> well

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
more transparent i can do that as well

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.240 
more transparent i can do that as well
so<00:04:00.510> as<00:04:00.629> you<00:04:00.720> can<00:04:00.810> see<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.079> becomes<00:04:01.769> more<00:04:02.040> unless

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
so as you can see it becomes more unless

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.920 
so as you can see it becomes more unless
transparent<00:04:02.849> you<00:04:03.299> can<00:04:03.359> also<00:04:03.540> change<00:04:03.810> the

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
transparent you can also change the

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.300 
transparent you can also change the
motion<00:04:04.319> settings<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:04.799> if<00:04:04.889> we<00:04:04.949> wanted<00:04:05.159> the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
motion settings so if we wanted the

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.399 
motion settings so if we wanted the
scroll<00:04:06.060> range<00:04:06.329> to<00:04:06.540> be<00:04:06.659> increased<00:04:06.989> i<00:04:07.139> can<00:04:07.290> do

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
scroll range to be increased i can do

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.449 
scroll range to be increased i can do
that<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:08.750> change<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.840> scroll<00:04:10.109> speed<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.919> like

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
that and change the scroll speed I like

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.530 
that and change the scroll speed I like
it<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.639> way<00:04:11.669> it<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.879> right<00:04:12.060> now<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.389> I'm<00:04:12.449> just

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
it the way it is right now so I'm just

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.119 
it the way it is right now so I'm just
gonna<00:04:12.629> leave<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:12.870> can<00:04:13.620> also<00:04:13.769> can<00:04:14.010> also

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
gonna leave that can also can also

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.099 
gonna leave that can also can also
change<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.519> index<00:04:14.940> tracking<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.540> progressive

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
change the index tracking to progressive

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.629 
change the index tracking to progressive
or<00:04:16.289> predictive<00:04:17.159> and<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.989> have<00:04:19.349> the

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
or predictive and I have the

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.740 
or predictive and I have the
optimization<00:04:20.639> set<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:21.000> automatic<00:04:21.539> but<00:04:21.690> you

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
optimization set to automatic but you

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.120 
optimization set to automatic but you
can<00:04:21.870> have<00:04:21.989> best<00:04:22.289> picture<00:04:22.650> quality<00:04:23.010> or

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
can have best picture quality or

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.860 
can have best picture quality or
smoother<00:04:23.460> motion<00:04:23.580> times<00:04:24.479> going<00:04:24.659> to<00:04:24.719> click

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
smoother motion times going to click

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.540 
smoother motion times going to click
done<00:04:25.080> we'll<00:04:26.039> go<00:04:26.130> into<00:04:26.250> some<00:04:26.400> of<00:04:26.490> the

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
done we'll go into some of the

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.960 
done we'll go into some of the
preference

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
preference

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.000 
preference
is<00:04:27.090> right<00:04:27.270> now<00:04:27.410> so<00:04:28.410> you<00:04:28.440> can<00:04:28.680> have<00:04:28.860> the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
is right now so you can have the

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.100 
is right now so you can have the
rendering<00:04:29.370> set<00:04:29.580> at<00:04:29.760> fast<00:04:30.030> mode<00:04:30.300> or<00:04:30.540> safe<00:04:30.570> mode

i<00:04:31.140> have<00:04:31.380> it<00:04:31.470> set<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.680> fast<00:04:31.980> mode<00:04:32.220> right<00:04:32.340> now

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
i have it set to fast mode right now

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.610 
i have it set to fast mode right now
because<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:32.970> pretty<00:04:33.180> fast<00:04:33.360> device<00:04:33.660> can<00:04:34.500> also

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
because the pretty fast device can also

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.580 
because the pretty fast device can also
disable<00:04:35.040> prompt<00:04:35.460> sounds<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.960> 3d<00:04:37.350> user
