00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.500
 old waste sponge 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.180
 but 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:24.330
 seat and stools 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:26.650
 glued shield array on you sawing 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.769
 pattern reserve 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.769
 him 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.070
 direct copying near the spa is not 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.400
 round dances can be stuck on 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:42.200
 double-sided tape or you can simply 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.510
 reject the cheeks of pilots 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.510
 I pounded with studs 15 millimeters 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.019
 much easier and faster it glowed 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.019
 from cinnamon and take off 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.680
 natural that such a person lower 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.680
 sits again 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.650
 this is a seat for their stool if stress 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.220
 from the claim array of eyelashes 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:31.790
 the oak stool was made similar 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.280
 way we are now 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.540
 it took up its duties and 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.629
 no longer present at filming data 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:46.540
 cutter I will chamfer on loud everything 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:49.150
 money stools such pology 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.210
 radius 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.460
 she reminds me of something 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.410
 prizes 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:01.380
 Russians went well, change 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:05.490
 I will shoot in two passes now cutter 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.950
 lowered working positions she 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.270
 slightly underestimated from 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.270
 plane became the sole 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:21.080
 first filming here is the main shoot first 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:27.660
 passage 2 floor will be your finish 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:29.590
 I choose a profile by lifting 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:36.480
 we will begin 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.480
 go from the end of the treatment of the ends went 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.900
 now there will be a final milling 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.040
 selected full profile 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:42.280
 here even now there is a slight hint 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.030
 such a step that when grinding 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.139
 because 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:53.849
 clean and stay so beautiful 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:53.849
 smooth gathering is such a profile 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.410
 Mama 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:30.450
 the stool is collected dry this whole thing will be 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:33.510
 polished then after gluing delicious 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:36.350
 assemblies are finally checked for 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.350
 resilience 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:50.790
 convenient place for this to check 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:53.150
 this plane of joining has become here 

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.150
 cap 

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.770
 but something like this
