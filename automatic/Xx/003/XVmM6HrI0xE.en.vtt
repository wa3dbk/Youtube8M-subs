you

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.490 

well<00:00:22.000> here<00:00:22.210> we<00:00:22.330> are<00:00:22.360> and<00:00:22.720> say<00:00:23.200> the<00:00:23.350> nerve

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
well here we are and say the nerve

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.560 
well here we are and say the nerve
center<00:00:23.980> of<00:00:24.010> the<00:00:24.220> Red<00:00:24.430> Bulls<00:00:24.640> simulator<00:00:25.150> now

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
center of the Red Bulls simulator now

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.750 
center of the Red Bulls simulator now
this<00:00:26.110> is<00:00:26.260> much<00:00:26.740> more<00:00:26.980> than<00:00:27.040> just<00:00:27.189> a<00:00:27.340> glorified

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
this is much more than just a glorified

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.519 
this is much more than just a glorified
game<00:00:28.060> what<00:00:28.390> makes<00:00:28.599> this<00:00:28.750> so<00:00:28.930> special<00:00:28.960> is<00:00:29.500> the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
game what makes this so special is the

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.650 
game what makes this so special is the
fact<00:00:29.800> that<00:00:29.890> it<00:00:30.369> operates<00:00:30.790> as<00:00:30.970> an<00:00:31.090> electric

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
fact that it operates as an electric

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.200 
fact that it operates as an electric
actuators<00:00:32.500> here<00:00:32.800> which<00:00:33.309> pumps<00:00:33.730> in<00:00:33.850> all<00:00:34.000> of<00:00:34.120> the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
actuators here which pumps in all of the

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.729 
actuators here which pumps in all of the
limits<00:00:34.660> that<00:00:34.840> would<00:00:34.989> have<00:00:35.110> been<00:00:35.199> recorded

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
limits that would have been recorded

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.160 
limits that would have been recorded
from<00:00:35.860> actual<00:00:36.340> track<00:00:36.580> data<00:00:36.850> and<00:00:37.239> puts<00:00:37.900> that<00:00:38.050> up

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
from actual track data and puts that up

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.299 
from actual track data and puts that up
through<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.470> seat<00:00:38.620> of<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:38.770> pants<00:00:38.980> when<00:00:39.220> the

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
through the seat of the pants when the

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:40.740 
through the seat of the pants when the
driver<00:00:39.520> is<00:00:39.640> in<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:39.879> simulator<00:00:40.360> so<00:00:40.510> he<00:00:40.629> can

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
driver is in the simulator so he can

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.540 
driver is in the simulator so he can
fuel<00:00:41.110> the<00:00:41.290> bombs<00:00:41.500> that<00:00:41.770> are<00:00:41.830> actually<00:00:42.190> o<00:00:42.220> on

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
fuel the bombs that are actually o on

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.590 
fuel the bombs that are actually o on
track<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:43.180> that's<00:00:43.600> the<00:00:43.840> key<00:00:44.020> difference<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
track and that's the key difference the

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.380 
track and that's the key difference the
lack<00:00:46.720> of<00:00:46.870> testing<00:00:47.230> now<00:00:47.410> we<00:00:47.620> have<00:00:47.800> to<00:00:48.040> use<00:00:48.820> tools

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
lack of testing now we have to use tools

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.930 
lack of testing now we have to use tools
like<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:49.840> simulator<00:00:50.260> to<00:00:50.559> give<00:00:51.309> ourselves<00:00:51.430> in

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
like the simulator to give ourselves in

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.479 
like the simulator to give ourselves in
the<00:00:52.180> edge<00:00:52.269> on<00:00:52.510> other<00:00:52.690> teams<00:00:53.019> we<00:00:53.379> use<00:00:53.500> it<00:00:53.680> for<00:00:53.710> if

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
the edge on other teams we use it for if

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.520 
the edge on other teams we use it for if
we<00:00:54.699> want<00:00:54.879> to<00:00:55.030> test<00:00:55.720> out<00:00:55.930> a<00:00:55.960> new<00:00:56.019> mechanical

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
we want to test out a new mechanical

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.649 
we want to test out a new mechanical
part<00:00:56.739> or<00:00:56.979> new<00:00:57.100> aerodynamical<00:00:57.729> part<00:00:57.970> will<00:00:58.449> use

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
part or new aerodynamical part will use

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.630 
part or new aerodynamical part will use
will<00:00:58.870> model<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.290> components<00:00:59.979> and<00:01:00.309> then<00:01:00.519> will

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
will model the components and then will

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.820 
will model the components and then will
put<00:01:00.760> them<00:01:00.909> into<00:01:01.059> into<00:01:02.019> our<00:01:02.170> simulator<00:01:02.589> get<00:01:02.799> a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
put them into into our simulator get a

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.680 
put them into into our simulator get a
driver<00:01:03.070> on<00:01:03.250> board<00:01:03.519> get<00:01:03.909> the<00:01:04.000> feedback<00:01:04.360> get<00:01:04.659> a

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
driver on board get the feedback get a

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.020 
driver on board get the feedback get a
date<00:01:04.900> obviously<00:01:05.860> one<00:01:06.130> of<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.280> key<00:01:06.310> inputs<00:01:06.850> for

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
date obviously one of the key inputs for

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.580 
date obviously one of the key inputs for
that<00:01:07.120> data<00:01:07.360> is<00:01:07.600> to<00:01:07.720> see<00:01:07.870> well<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:08.170> feeds<00:01:08.500> back

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
that data is to see well it feeds back

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.410 
that data is to see well it feeds back
the<00:01:08.920> information<00:01:09.100> that's<00:01:09.580> displayed<00:01:09.610> since<00:01:10.330> I

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
the information that's displayed since I

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.180 
the information that's displayed since I
retired<00:01:10.720> there's<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.140> few<00:01:11.350> extra<00:01:11.470> knobs<00:01:12.010> and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
retired there's a few extra knobs and

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.190 
retired there's a few extra knobs and
buttons<00:01:12.250> on<00:01:12.670> here<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:13.000> very<00:01:13.600> obvious<00:01:13.990> one<00:01:14.140> that

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
buttons on here a very obvious one that

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.190 
buttons on here a very obvious one that
we<00:01:14.440> can<00:01:14.560> all<00:01:14.619> see<00:01:14.799> here<00:01:15.119> cares<00:01:16.119> what<00:01:16.810> I<00:01:16.840> want<00:01:17.110> to

we can all see here cares what I want to

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.539 
we can all see here cares what I want to
try<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.440> experience<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.130> explain<00:01:18.369> to<00:01:18.400> the

try and experience and explain to the
audience<00:01:18.640> is<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.240> driving<00:01:19.750> Monaco<00:01:20.080> is

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
audience is that driving Monaco is

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.070 
audience is that driving Monaco is
difficult<00:01:20.680> enough

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
difficult enough

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.990

then no karma yeah I think that what's
too<00:02:38.520> bad<00:02:38.550> back<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.300> engine<00:02:39.630> six<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.230> mix<00:02:40.740> it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
too bad back to engine six and mix it

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.950 
too bad back to engine six and mix it
well<00:02:41.100> now<00:02:41.430> that's<00:02:42.030> really<00:02:42.330> gets<00:02:42.480> difficult

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960
