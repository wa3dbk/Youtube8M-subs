99<00:02:04.939> okay<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:06.049> obviously<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.469> side<00:02:06.710> on<00:02:06.979> a

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
99 okay so obviously the side on a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.900 
99 okay so obviously the side on a
direct<00:02:08.330> hit<00:02:08.569> like<00:02:08.840> this<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.470> again<00:02:10.220> if<00:02:10.429> you're

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
direct hit like this and again if you're

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.800 
direct hit like this and again if you're
stationed<00:02:11.480> here<00:02:12.250> don't<00:02:13.250> shoot<00:02:13.430> they're

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
stationed here don't shoot they're

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.960 
stationed here don't shoot they're
literally<00:02:14.810> scoot<00:02:15.230> over<00:02:15.440> two<00:02:15.590> feet<00:02:15.800> shoot<00:02:16.640> here

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
literally scoot over two feet shoot here

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.970 
literally scoot over two feet shoot here
it's<00:02:17.510> all<00:02:17.780> about<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.170> angle<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.590> tag<00:02:18.800> this

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
it's all about the angle you tag this

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.259 
it's all about the angle you tag this
thing<00:02:19.040> at<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:19.550> let's<00:02:19.610> take<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.849> look<00:02:20.060> at<00:02:20.180> the

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
thing at so let's take a look at the

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.740 
thing at so let's take a look at the
next<00:02:20.390> boat<00:02:21.459> up<00:02:22.459> next<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.819> a<00:02:22.849> scanner<00:02:23.239> bull<00:02:23.569> and

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
next boat up next is a scanner bull and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.440 
next boat up next is a scanner bull and
this<00:02:24.110> thing<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:24.739> little<00:02:25.160> bit<00:02:25.310> tricky<00:02:25.880> the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
this thing is a little bit tricky the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.509 
this thing is a little bit tricky the
way<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.870> works<00:02:27.170> I'm<00:02:27.440> going<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.769> splain<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.069> in<00:02:28.370> a

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
way it works I'm going to splain it in a

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.430 
way it works I'm going to splain it in a
second<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.090> not<00:02:29.300> like<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.720> mavs<00:02:29.959> or<00:02:30.080> tug<00:02:30.260> so

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
second it's not like the mavs or tug so

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.080 
second it's not like the mavs or tug so
let's<00:02:30.650> look<00:02:30.830> at<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.099> thing<00:02:31.370> Point<00:02:31.970> Blank

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
let's look at this thing Point Blank

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.449 
let's look at this thing Point Blank
headshot<00:02:32.810> it's<00:02:33.470> got<00:02:33.620> some<00:02:33.830> drop<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.370> and

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
headshot it's got some drop to it and

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.949 
headshot it's got some drop to it and
see<00:02:34.610> if<00:02:34.700> it's<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:35.590> way<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.650> kill<00:02:36.890> people<00:02:37.250> no<00:02:38.060> it's

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
see if it's a way to kill people no it's

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.930 
see if it's a way to kill people no it's
going<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.170> do<00:02:39.290> 48<00:02:39.709> out<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:39.980> headshot<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.519> even

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
going to do 48 out of headshot and even

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.430 
going to do 48 out of headshot and even
that<00:02:41.209> hit<00:02:41.450> him<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.660> chest<00:02:41.750> will<00:02:42.170> probably

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
that hit him in the chest will probably

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.789 
that hit him in the chest will probably
did<00:02:42.530> 23<00:02:42.830> 24<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:44.239> let's<00:02:44.870> talk<00:02:45.110> about<00:02:45.170> how<00:02:45.590> this

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
did 23 24 so let's talk about how this

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.809 
did 23 24 so let's talk about how this
thing<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.010> unlike<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:47.630> mavs<00:02:47.900> or<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:49.250> tug<00:02:49.459> so

plays<00:03:50.840> out<00:03:51.019> like<00:03:51.079> the<00:03:51.380> Mavs<00:03:51.590> or<00:03:51.859> the<00:03:52.130> tugs<00:03:53.260> okay

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
plays out like the Mavs or the tugs okay

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.390 
plays out like the Mavs or the tugs okay
so<00:03:54.319> the<00:03:54.470> last<00:03:54.590> two<00:03:54.769> things<00:03:54.950> we<00:03:55.040> have<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.220> cover

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
so the last two things we have to cover

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.449 
so the last two things we have to cover
is<00:03:55.609> a<00:03:55.639> standard<00:03:56.239> bolt<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:57.500> sniper<00:03:57.799> bolt<00:03:58.190> and

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
is a standard bolt the sniper bolt and

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.099 
is a standard bolt the sniper bolt and
suppression<00:03:58.970> mechanism<00:03:59.599> Madi<00:03:59.810> go<00:03:59.959> ahead

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
suppression mechanism Madi go ahead

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.379 
suppression mechanism Madi go ahead
start<00:04:00.200> light<00:04:00.500> me<00:04:00.650> up<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:01.489> let's<00:04:01.670> watch<00:04:01.940> where

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
start light me up and let's watch where

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.660 
start light me up and let's watch where
these<00:04:02.480> go<00:04:02.690> this<00:04:02.900> is<00:04:03.019> standard<00:04:03.349> bolt<00:04:03.620> way<00:04:04.609> to

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
these go this is standard bolt way to

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.280 
these go this is standard bolt way to

i'm reloading go ahead again ye that was
pretty<00:04:20.180> far<00:04:20.420> off<00:04:20.450> so<00:04:20.959> these<00:04:21.350> are<00:04:21.410> affected<00:04:22.190> by

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
pretty far off so these are affected by

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.850 
pretty far off so these are affected by
suppression<00:04:22.850> but<00:04:23.450> you<00:04:23.900> will<00:04:24.020> sometimes<00:04:24.500> land

suppression but you will sometimes land

find<00:04:47.510> is<00:04:47.900> these<00:04:48.320> are<00:04:48.380> affected<00:04:49.040> by

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
find is these are affected by

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.020 
find is these are affected by
suppression<00:04:49.610> go<00:04:49.700> ahead<00:04:49.910> me<00:04:50.000> again<00:04:51.640> but<00:04:52.640> the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
suppression go ahead me again but the

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.610 
suppression go ahead me again but the
sniper<00:04:53.300> one<00:04:53.570> obviously<00:04:53.990> it's<00:04:54.260> going<00:04:54.410> to<00:04:54.470> be

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
sniper one obviously it's going to be

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.930 
sniper one obviously it's going to be
let<00:04:54.770> me<00:04:54.800> back<00:04:54.980> up<00:04:55.010> a<00:04:55.220> little<00:04:55.340> bit<00:04:55.580> do<00:04:55.760> it<00:04:55.820> one

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
let me back up a little bit do it one

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.490 
let me back up a little bit do it one
less<00:04:56.120> time<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.780> sniper<00:04:56.990> one<00:04:57.200> obviously

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
less time the sniper one obviously

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.080 
less time the sniper one obviously
you're<00:04:57.920> going<00:04:58.040> to<00:04:58.100> be<00:04:58.160> using<00:04:58.280> this<00:04:58.550> for<00:04:58.760> longer

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
you're going to be using this for longer

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.900 
you're going to be using this for longer
ranges<00:04:59.540> so<00:05:00.230> just<00:05:00.680> keep<00:05:00.800> that<00:05:00.860> in<00:05:01.010> mind<00:05:01.280> these

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
ranges so just keep that in mind these

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.790 
ranges so just keep that in mind these
aren't<00:05:02.240> perfectly<00:05:02.870> accurate<00:05:03.169> winter

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
aren't perfectly accurate winter

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.940 
aren't perfectly accurate winter
suppression<00:05:04.280> especially<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.240> stock<00:05:05.480> bolt

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
suppression especially the stock bolt

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.950 
suppression especially the stock bolt
see<00:05:06.950> that<00:05:07.130> one<00:05:07.280> that<00:05:07.550> was<00:05:07.730> a<00:05:07.760> bad<00:05:08.000> one<00:05:08.150> so

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
see that one that was a bad one so

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.120 
see that one that was a bad one so
they're<00:05:09.260> not<00:05:09.350> going<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:09.560> go<00:05:09.650> where<00:05:09.830> you<00:05:09.919> want

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
they're not going to go where you want

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.740 
they're not going to go where you want
them<00:05:10.250> to<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.669> sniper<00:05:10.910> bolt<00:05:11.180> seems<00:05:11.450> to<00:05:11.600> be<00:05:11.720> a

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
them to the sniper bolt seems to be a

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.780 
them to the sniper bolt seems to be a
little<00:05:11.990> less<00:05:12.200> affected<00:05:12.770> by<00:05:12.919> suppression

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
little less affected by suppression

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.180 
little less affected by suppression
there's<00:05:14.030> another<00:05:14.270> bad<00:05:14.510> one<00:05:14.800> so<00:05:15.800> let's<00:05:16.040> take<00:05:16.160> a

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
there's another bad one so let's take a

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.980 
there's another bad one so let's take a
look<00:05:16.370> at<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.520> damage<00:05:16.730> that<00:05:17.090> these<00:05:17.660> two<00:05:17.810> bolts

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
look at the damage that these two bolts

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.920 
look at the damage that these two bolts
do<00:05:18.290> and<00:05:18.530> some<00:05:19.010> of<00:05:19.100> the<00:05:19.160> drop<00:05:19.370> off<00:05:19.630> so<00:05:20.630> obviously

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
do and some of the drop off so obviously

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.780 
do and some of the drop off so obviously
I<00:05:21.020> talked<00:05:21.260> about<00:05:21.350> the<00:05:21.560> drop<00:05:21.770> off<00:05:21.919> of<00:05:22.100> the<00:05:22.520> stock

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
I talked about the drop off of the stock

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.140 
I talked about the drop off of the stock
bolt<00:05:23.090> which<00:05:23.240> I'm<00:05:23.419> back<00:05:23.630> on<00:05:23.660> to<00:05:24.080> hear<00:05:24.970> keep<00:05:25.970> that

bolt which I'm back on to hear keep that

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.850 
bolt which I'm back on to hear keep that
in<00:05:26.300> mind<00:05:26.510> let's<00:05:26.960> just<00:05:27.169> shoot<00:05:27.260> high<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.740> see

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
in mind let's just shoot high and see

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.640 
in mind let's just shoot high and see
where<00:05:28.010> this<00:05:28.100> goes<00:05:28.990> quite<00:05:29.990> a<00:05:30.020> bit<00:05:30.110> of<00:05:30.290> drop<00:05:30.470> offs

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
where this goes quite a bit of drop offs

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.490 
where this goes quite a bit of drop offs
low<00:05:31.070> trajectory<00:05:31.250> so<00:05:32.240> let's<00:05:32.570> shoot<00:05:32.720> a<00:05:32.960> Maddie

now so why would you need the sniper
rifle<00:06:04.130> both<00:06:04.790> simply<00:06:05.720> the<00:06:06.460> trajectory<00:06:07.460> speed

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
rifle both simply the trajectory speed

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.260 
rifle both simply the trajectory speed
and<00:06:08.030> the<00:06:08.600> lack<00:06:08.840> of<00:06:09.050> drop<00:06:09.790> look<00:06:10.790> at<00:06:10.910> that<00:06:11.060> little
