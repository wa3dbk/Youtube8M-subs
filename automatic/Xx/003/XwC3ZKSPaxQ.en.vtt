00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.560
 that's it, we'll start from 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.320
 followed by the first then I have 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.430

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:53.180
 the first is the late web color of 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.440
 the range of numbers 184 is what 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.020
 month is actually it's a pretty raped 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.760
 blue night in metal party and it is 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.230
 frankly this new collection 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.370
 that they went out but came to go 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.300

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:13.270
 then I have the number 185 nortÃ¨ne light 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.770
 so it's a pretty turquoise green and 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.540
 the really pretty frankly when I 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.280
 blots everyone tells me but at 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.840
 the less he is beautiful voice and 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.970
 frankly I find that the colors 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.380
 what they did for this new 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.310
 color range was really going 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:30.190
 sublime 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:33.370
 so that's after I have number 180 a 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:38.110
 launched the task and we say then this is 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.400
 a nice green neon yellow in fact the 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.350
 mecque bunkers opened higher 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.140
 in fact it's between yellow and blue and 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.720
 green it is super beautiful and this one when 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:51.960
 I put 10 black with a male is blurred 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:55.360
 the super you have then I have the number 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.060
 182 is flounder soil and it's a 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.440
 nice orange and go for it but it is very 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.380
 pretty on the nails 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.920
 frankly this one with jeans and a 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:11.240

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.950

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.130
 last two darling that I come 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.299
 to affirm that there is a morning and 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.209
 went off again the day off 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.190
 nero effect actually alone at the level of the 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.080
 light actually as soon as it gets dark by 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.790
 example in nightclub and barrett them 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.400
 with the facts do not know me 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.230
 get out that's going to flash it's going to be plachy 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.800
 and it will bring out my super class 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.600
 so this one is the number 188 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.580
 electric pink is then like you 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.680
 see he's very very flashy and 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.840
 frankly I love it I have them 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.280
 landed that yesterday I wanted to buy 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.020
 others but I could not find any 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.090
 other colors for now because 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.710
 that it is there is a fair to go out 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.510
 so suddenly I found that these two 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.760
 colors there is in any case it's a 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.320
 flashy yellow and pink and frankly I 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.760
 really looking forward to testing in a nightclub 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.490
 then the second one I bought in 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.200
 the same collection is 180 years old 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.550
 red fixed then this one is a 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.280
 orange but fluo 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.520
 he is very very very fluo and we see 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.770
 very well what application that's okay 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.510
 to be flashy at night and I love this 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.740
 color plus I think it's okay with 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.210
 everything and for the summer 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.770

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.220
 to be great I can not wait to get them 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.099
