one because I decided to do in two
separately<00:00:36.230> because<00:00:36.470> they<00:00:36.650> are<00:00:36.770> two<00:00:36.980> separate

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
separately because they are two separate

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.020

that pretty much everything about it I
just<00:00:53.120> love<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:53.990> gimmick<00:00:54.260> in<00:00:54.380> this<00:00:54.500> one<00:00:54.680> is

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
through and you've got a wall stand on

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.250 
through and you've got a wall stand on
that<00:00:58.910> stump<00:00:59.270> there<00:00:59.510> and<00:00:59.750> you've<00:01:00.110> got<00:01:00.200> to

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
that stump there and you've got to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.319 
that stump there and you've got to
change<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.710> seasons<00:01:01.160> so<00:01:01.490> it's<00:01:01.970> currently

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
autumn if I change this to winter then

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.069 
autumn if I change this to winter then
the<00:01:04.909> water<00:01:05.089> will<00:01:05.239> be<00:01:05.390> forced<00:01:05.689> over<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:06.020> I

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:06.079 
the water will be forced over and I

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.290 
the water will be forced over and I
could<00:01:06.229> walk<00:01:06.439> over<00:01:06.799> it<00:01:06.940> unless<00:01:07.940> one<00:01:08.120> it's<00:01:08.240> like

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
could walk over it unless one it's like

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.760 
could walk over it unless one it's like
stupidly<00:01:08.810> deep<00:01:09.050> water<00:01:09.320> or<00:01:09.500> something<00:01:09.650> like

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
stupidly deep water or something like

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.550 
stupidly deep water or something like
that<00:01:09.830> there's<00:01:10.730> a<00:01:10.909> summer<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.690> spring<00:01:12.020> it

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
that there's a summer the spring it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.160 
that there's a summer the spring it
really<00:01:13.250> does<00:01:13.400> have<00:01:13.580> all<00:01:13.790> four<00:01:14.120> seasons<00:01:14.170> that

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
really does have all four seasons that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.720 
really does have all four seasons that
just<00:01:15.440> in<00:01:15.530> case<00:01:15.710> you<00:01:15.830> worked<00:01:16.010> out<00:01:16.190> in<00:01:16.340> that<00:01:16.460> and

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
just in case you worked out in that and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.969 
just in case you worked out in that and
every<00:01:17.450> season<00:01:17.659> is<00:01:17.900> completely<00:01:18.409> different<00:01:18.830> and

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
every season is completely different and

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.630 
every season is completely different and
it<00:01:19.070> means<00:01:19.640> that<00:01:20.000> you've<00:01:20.479> got<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.720> walk<00:01:20.870> around

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
it means that you've got to walk around

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.580 
it means that you've got to walk around
finding<00:01:22.640> certain<00:01:23.240> points<00:01:23.870> to<00:01:24.140> be<00:01:24.290> able<00:01:24.470> to

finding certain points to be able to

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.550 
finding certain points to be able to

create like a bit of a Tony adore the
it's<00:04:20.959> just<00:04:21.260> really<00:04:21.440> cool<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:22.070> amount<00:04:22.280> of

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
it's just really cool the amount of

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.070 
it's just really cool the amount of
versatility<00:04:22.730> you've<00:04:23.060> got<00:04:23.270> in<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.660> items<00:04:23.960> in

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
versatility you've got in the items in

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.900 
versatility you've got in the items in
the<00:04:24.140> game<00:04:24.230> I<00:04:24.590> mean<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.040> embassies<00:04:25.580> you've

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
the game I mean the embassies you've

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.450 
the game I mean the embassies you've
just<00:04:26.120> seen<00:04:26.270> there<00:04:26.570> burns<00:04:26.870> like<00:04:27.229> rotten<00:04:28.190> tree

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
so that I could then get a piece

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.960 
so that I could then get a piece
heart<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:31.190> piece<00:04:31.370> of<00:04:31.550> hearts<00:04:31.820> are

rings<00:04:43.160> on<00:04:43.580> this<00:04:43.760> game<00:04:44.030> is<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.510> worm<00:04:44.660> in<00:04:44.840> ages

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
rings on this game is the worm in ages

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.080 
rings on this game is the worm in ages
and<00:04:45.320> it's<00:04:45.560> as<00:04:46.040> far<00:04:46.250> as<00:04:46.310> I'm<00:04:46.400> aware<00:04:46.460> it<00:04:46.760> is<00:04:46.820> like

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
and it's as far as I'm aware it is like

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.300 
and it's as far as I'm aware it is like
very<00:04:47.419> much<00:04:47.600> identical<00:04:48.320> it's<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:48.800> think<00:04:49.130> there's

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
very much identical it's I think there's

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.860 
very much identical it's I think there's
one<00:04:49.520> or<00:04:49.669> two<00:04:49.700> with<00:04:50.120> rings<00:04:50.419> that<00:04:50.540> were<00:04:50.690> unique

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
one or two with rings that were unique

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.590 
one or two with rings that were unique
to<00:04:51.310> ages<00:04:52.310> and<00:04:52.460> seasons<00:04:52.910> but<00:04:53.090> other<00:04:53.330> than<00:04:53.540> that

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
to ages and seasons but other than that

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.990 
to ages and seasons but other than that
little<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:54.050> CM<00:04:54.350> and<00:04:54.560> that's<00:04:55.160> kind<00:04:55.550> of<00:04:55.669> a<00:04:55.760> guess

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
little the CM and that's kind of a guess

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.850 
little the CM and that's kind of a guess
because<00:04:56.419> I'll<00:04:56.600> be<00:04:56.630> honest<00:04:57.020> are<00:04:57.169> never<00:04:57.500> really

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
because I'll be honest are never really

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.770 
because I'll be honest are never really
could<00:04:58.220> be<00:04:58.250> cared<00:04:58.610> enough<00:04:58.850> to<00:04:58.910> collect<00:04:59.540> the

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
could be cared enough to collect the

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.450 
could be cared enough to collect the
Rings<00:04:59.990> there's<00:05:00.680> a<00:05:00.770> lot<00:05:00.919> of<00:05:00.950> people<00:05:01.310> out<00:05:01.400> there

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
Rings there's a lot of people out there

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.130 
Rings there's a lot of people out there
who<00:05:01.850> think<00:05:02.150> that<00:05:02.210> you<00:05:02.390> don't<00:05:02.570> beat<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:02.960> game

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
who think that you don't beat the game

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.990 
who think that you don't beat the game
fully<00:05:03.440> until<00:05:03.770> you<00:05:03.890> get<00:05:04.070> all<00:05:04.220> of<00:05:04.250> them<00:05:04.580> but<00:05:04.790> I

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
fully until you get all of them but I

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.450 
fully until you get all of them but I
honestly<00:05:05.180> think<00:05:05.630> I<00:05:05.900> don't<00:05:06.740> have<00:05:06.950> time<00:05:07.190> for

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
honestly think I don't have time for

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.830 
honestly think I don't have time for
this<00:05:07.490> I'd<00:05:07.790> rather<00:05:08.000> be<00:05:08.210> playing<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.660> game

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
this I'd rather be playing the game

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.050 
this I'd rather be playing the game
rather<00:05:09.140> than<00:05:09.260> collecting<00:05:09.919> all<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.700> different

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
rather than collecting all the different

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.600 
rather than collecting all the different
things<00:05:11.300> of<00:05:11.780> which<00:05:12.020> I'll<00:05:12.260> like<00:05:12.530> maybe<00:05:12.860> use<00:05:13.220> two

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
things of which I'll like maybe use two

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.580 
things of which I'll like maybe use two
of<00:05:13.790> them<00:05:14.000> total<00:05:14.300> so<00:05:14.900> out<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.169> life<00:05:15.380> of<00:05:15.530> the

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
of them total so out the life of the

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.590 
of them total so out the life of the
game<00:05:15.800> and<00:05:16.070> that's<00:05:16.460> so<00:05:16.940> that's<00:05:17.180> pretty<00:05:17.450> much

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
game and that's so that's pretty much

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.650 
game and that's so that's pretty much
what<00:05:17.750> i<00:05:17.780> did<00:05:18.020> and<00:05:18.200> i<00:05:19.070> just<00:05:19.400> found<00:05:19.910> two<00:05:20.270> or<00:05:20.450> three

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
of getting them a couple years apart and

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.070 
of getting them a couple years apart and
but<00:06:16.370> not<00:06:16.850> pretty<00:06:17.060> much<00:06:17.180> I've<00:06:17.330> mentioned<00:06:17.600> as<00:06:17.960> it

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
but not pretty much I've mentioned as it

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.540 
but not pretty much I've mentioned as it
was<00:06:18.169> everything<00:06:18.500> I<00:06:18.680> can't<00:06:18.950> mention<00:06:19.130> about<00:06:19.400> the

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
was everything I can't mention about the

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.250 
was everything I can't mention about the
game<00:06:19.700> without<00:06:19.850> warbling<00:06:20.450> on<00:06:20.660> even<00:06:20.960> more<00:06:20.990> than

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
game without warbling on even more than

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.020 
game without warbling on even more than
I<00:06:21.380> already<00:06:21.410> have<00:06:21.680> done<00:06:21.979> it's<00:06:22.490> bad<00:06:22.760> enough<00:06:22.789> that

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
I already have done it's bad enough that

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.880 
I already have done it's bad enough that
over<00:06:23.360> the<00:06:23.450> two<00:06:23.630> vids<00:06:23.900> I've<00:06:24.169> managed<00:06:24.560> to<00:06:24.740> do

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
over the two vids I've managed to do

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.570 
over the two vids I've managed to do
about<00:06:25.039> 18<00:06:25.669> minutes<00:06:25.910> of<00:06:26.150> just<00:06:26.270> waffling<00:06:26.510> on<00:06:26.810> so

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
about 18 minutes of just waffling on so

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.430 
about 18 minutes of just waffling on so
just<00:06:28.580> to<00:06:28.700> sum<00:06:28.850> up<00:06:28.880> graphically<00:06:29.690> musically<00:06:30.410> the

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
just to sum up graphically musically the

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.550 
just to sum up graphically musically the
both<00:06:30.800> sound<00:06:31.100> great<00:06:31.280> and<00:06:32.200> both<00:06:33.200> of<00:06:33.229> them<00:06:33.410> are

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
both sound great and both of them are

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.290 
both sound great and both of them are
totally<00:06:33.860> different<00:06:34.010> both<00:06:34.789> of<00:06:34.940> them<00:06:35.000> are<00:06:35.120> well

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
totally different both of them are well

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.420 
totally different both of them are well
worth<00:06:35.450> the<00:06:35.510> player<00:06:35.870> maybe<00:06:36.680> if<00:06:37.039> you're<00:06:37.310> going

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
worth the player maybe if you're going

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.370 
worth the player maybe if you're going
to<00:06:37.490> get<00:06:37.640> one<00:06:37.970> over<00:06:38.000> the<00:06:38.450> other<00:06:38.570> to<00:06:38.750> begin<00:06:39.140> with

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
to get one over the other to begin with

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.070 
to get one over the other to begin with
seasons<00:06:40.220> is<00:06:40.370> definitely<00:06:40.820> the<00:06:40.909> better<00:06:41.060> gium<00:06:41.419> so

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
seasons is definitely the better gium so

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.540 
seasons is definitely the better gium so
I<00:06:42.110> don't<00:06:42.380> know<00:06:42.500> if<00:06:42.560> you<00:06:42.650> want<00:06:42.830> to<00:06:42.890> start<00:06:43.159> with<00:06:43.220> C

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
I don't know if you want to start with C

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.160 
I don't know if you want to start with C
reasons<00:06:43.790> and<00:06:43.940> finish<00:06:44.210> with<00:06:44.300> ages<00:06:44.720> or<00:06:44.870> start

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170 
reasons and finish with ages or start

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.290 
reasons and finish with ages or start
with<00:06:45.290> ages<00:06:45.530> and<00:06:45.650> furniture<00:06:45.920> seasons<00:06:46.340> but<00:06:47.000> it

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
with ages and furniture seasons but it

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.670 
with ages and furniture seasons but it
is<00:06:47.450> worth<00:06:47.630> getting<00:06:48.020> both<00:06:48.200> in<00:06:48.380> the<00:06:48.500> long<00:06:48.650> run

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
is worth getting both in the long run

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.220 
is worth getting both in the long run
and<00:06:49.190> that<00:06:50.060> is<00:06:50.210> pretty<00:06:50.450> much<00:06:50.570> all<00:06:50.810> I<00:06:50.870> can<00:06:51.080> see

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
and that is pretty much all I can see

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.650 
and that is pretty much all I can see
