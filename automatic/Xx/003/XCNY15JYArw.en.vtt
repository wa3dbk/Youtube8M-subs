it's like a papery look and it's
actually<00:00:17.730> really<00:00:18.210> smart<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.900> think<00:00:19.529> it's

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
actually really smart I think it's

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.010 
actually really smart I think it's
really<00:00:20.160> really<00:00:20.340> cool<00:00:20.550> go<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.570> crafting

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
really really cool go to the crafting

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.290 
really really cool go to the crafting
bench<00:00:22.170> exactly<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> same<00:00:23.400> really<00:00:24.150> really

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
bench exactly the same really really

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.029 
bench exactly the same really really
really<00:00:24.390> cool<00:00:24.779> little<00:00:25.050> area<00:00:25.260> going<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:25.890> there

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
really cool little area going on there

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.179 
really cool little area going on there
and<00:00:26.269> the<00:00:27.269> break<00:00:27.539> unlike<00:00:28.140> items<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.830> stuff<00:00:28.890> is

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
and the break unlike items and stuff is

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.980 
and the break unlike items and stuff is
very<00:00:29.429> simple<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.939> think<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> same<00:00:30.689> break

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
very simple I think it's the same break

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.470 
very simple I think it's the same break
as<00:00:31.199> regular<00:00:31.619> minecraft<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:33.030> not<00:00:33.210> not

as regular minecraft it's not not

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.540 
as regular minecraft it's not not
anything<00:00:33.750> different<00:00:34.440> really<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.309> still

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
anything different really but it's still

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.850 
anything different really but it's still
pretty<00:00:35.610> cool<00:00:36.079> and<00:00:37.079> if<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.469> go<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.829> our

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
pretty cool and if we go to our

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.549 
pretty cool and if we go to our
inventory<00:00:38.820> we've<00:00:39.480> got<00:00:39.719> our<00:00:39.750> little<00:00:40.170> area

again<00:00:40.770> continuing<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> theme<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
again continuing the theme of like a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.979 
again continuing the theme of like a
papery<00:00:42.960> saw<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.879> thing<00:00:44.879> going<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.239> there<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
papery saw of thing going on there and

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.880 
papery saw of thing going on there and
then<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> game<00:00:46.739> menu<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.719> a

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
then on the game menu it's a it's like a

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.000 
then on the game menu it's a it's like a
raise<00:00:50.360> it's<00:00:51.360> okay<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:52.199> mind<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.680> menu

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010

it's<00:00:53.129> all<00:00:53.280> right<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.300> think<00:00:54.690> they

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
it's all right but and I think they

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.049 
it's all right but and I think they
could<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:54.989> done<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.140> little<00:00:55.260> more<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.559> those

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
could have done a little more to those

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.630 
could have done a little more to those
fairly<00:00:57.059> plain<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.660> same<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.640> double

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
fairly plain and same for the double

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.700 
fairly plain and same for the double
double<00:00:59.820> double<00:00:59.940> de<00:01:00.149> same<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> main<00:01:01.530> menu

double double de same for the main menu

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.889 
double double de same for the main menu
it's<00:01:01.980> pretty<00:01:02.280> much<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.550> same<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:02.969> moving<00:01:03.690> on

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
really smooth the break seems to go on

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.020 
really smooth the break seems to go on
like<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:45.409> really<00:01:46.409> weird<00:01:46.740> fashion<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.490> proper

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030

weird break but is quite cool I high
like<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> brokenness<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.259> different

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
like the brokenness but it's different

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.080 
like the brokenness but it's different
so<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.930> invent<00:01:54.930> our<00:01:55.200> inventory<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.310> it's

very<00:01:57.329> very<00:01:57.630> very<00:01:58.469> very<00:01:58.590> similar<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> rest

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
very very very very similar to the rest

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.910 
very very very very similar to the rest
of<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.820> it's<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.240> red<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.810> red<00:02:01.229> which<00:02:01.740> is

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
of it it's a red and red which is

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130 
of it it's a red and red which is
actually<00:02:02.070> really<00:02:02.340> cool<00:02:02.460> as<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.450> said<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.689> like<00:02:03.930> it

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
actually really cool as I said I like it

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.649 
actually really cool as I said I like it
and<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> game<00:02:05.399> menu<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:06.270> looks<00:02:06.479> really

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
and on the game menu it looks really

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.940 
and on the game menu it looks really
sweet<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.229> when<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.469> hover<00:02:07.619> over<00:02:07.799> that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
sweet like when you hover over that

sweet like when you hover over that
everything<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.879> gives<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.330> really

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
everything and it gives like really

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.020 
everything and it gives like really
light<00:02:10.470> right<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.830> think<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.190> looks<00:02:11.310> awesome<00:02:11.430> I

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030

really like that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.400 
really like that
and<00:02:14.010> if<00:02:14.580> we<00:02:14.610> score<00:02:15.240> them<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.780> gaming<00:02:16.140> menu

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
and if we score them to the gaming menu

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.920 
and if we score them to the gaming menu
here<00:02:16.590> we<00:02:16.680> go<00:02:17.150> yeah<00:02:18.150> that's<00:02:18.420> basically<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
here we go yeah that's basically the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.420 
here we go yeah that's basically the
same<00:02:19.140> as<00:02:19.200> everything<00:02:19.620> else<00:02:19.709> but<00:02:20.040> once<00:02:20.250> again

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
same as everything else but once again

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.130 
same as everything else but once again
they've<00:02:21.120> done<00:02:21.390> really<00:02:21.599> well<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.900> keep<00:02:22.050> with

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
they've done really well to keep with

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.170 
they've done really well to keep with
the<00:02:22.200> theme<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.560> it's<00:02:22.650> really<00:02:22.830> nice<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.790> this

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
the theme and it's really nice so this

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.210 
the theme and it's really nice so this
is<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.360> Y<00:02:24.599> Yuki<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.260> think<00:02:25.500> it's<00:02:25.650> white<00:02:25.890> way

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
is the Y Yuki and I think it's white way

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.250 
is the Y Yuki and I think it's white way
you<00:02:26.280> keep<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.819> dinner<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.020> quite<00:02:28.230> a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
you keep a dinner and this is quite a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.460 
you keep a dinner and this is quite a
cool<00:02:28.410> texture<00:02:28.709> pack<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.660> it's<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:31.170> colors

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
cool texture pack and it's the colors

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.140 
cool texture pack and it's the colors
are<00:02:31.590> quite<00:02:31.739> cool<00:02:31.980> run<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.310> decided<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.910> squirm

about<00:02:33.450> for<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.720> while<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.170> one<00:02:34.350> well<00:02:34.860> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
about for a while on this one well the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.830 
about for a while on this one well the
colors<00:02:35.190> are<00:02:35.310> quite<00:02:35.459> cool<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.239> I<00:02:36.540> really

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
colors are quite cool on it and I really

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.430 
colors are quite cool on it and I really
like<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.170> one<00:02:37.700> they<00:02:38.700> really<00:02:39.180> like<00:02:39.450> the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
like this one they really like the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.070 
like this one they really like the
actual<00:02:41.130> objects<00:02:41.940> like<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.209> furnace<00:02:42.569> crafting

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
actual objects like the furnace crafting

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.120

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
when you make a texture pack right these

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.710 
when you make a texture pack right these
people<00:02:56.519> make<00:02:56.640> texture<00:02:57.000> packs<00:02:57.209> out<00:02:57.330> really

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
people make texture packs out really

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.539
