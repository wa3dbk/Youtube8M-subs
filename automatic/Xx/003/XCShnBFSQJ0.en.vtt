00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.939
 Yellow Line Talk is in the area of 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.600
 again bringing another review for you 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.500
 Today's gun is a 3 to 3 g 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.869
 on request to leave the user in 2012 and more 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.679
 22 people made liquid in the comment 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.079
 his 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.739
 thanks guys on the part of the band age 3 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.410
 to 3 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.180
 then it is manufactured in Germany, it has 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.940
 ammunition capacity it 20 bullets 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.120
 the charger plus a bullet in the camera 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.510
 the hit her father is 551 from the movie in 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.020
 another and she has the uncle types of 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.570
 high fire and 15 short download time 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.820
 it is 2 seconds with the charger 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.920
 and if you do not have ammunition and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.869
 a charger with time goes up to 3 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.140
 critical point the maximum damage of ge 3334 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.380
 reaching 8 meters and reaching the minimum 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.860
 from eight meters it decays 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.600
 reaching a minimum of 22 to 50 meters 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.720
 galley is a weapon you release 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.939
 doing for her and for her being a weapon 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.570
 released on the body many people think 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.869
 like this 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.369
 I'm going to get this April I'm going to detonate because 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.610
 really long after you learn 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.650
 to play with it is you become a 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.520
 expert matador 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.310
 however it is not an easy weapon of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.149
 play once she has the smallest 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.000
 rhythm makes the game and also one of the 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.549
 smaller ammunition capacities then 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.700
 you have to learn first 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.060
 make all the bullets counted second 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.180
 place you need to learn to master the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.149
 remember the utah because it has the largest 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.829
 recall the vertical game also 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.929
 point 45 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:15.390
 that means that 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.969
 and you need to take the time to 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.709
 to dominate this weapon, and you too 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:25.620
 You need to be very patient because 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:29.189
 who plays is to see 3d and is a certain time 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.069
 who already has a reference in the game knows 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:35.629
 that after you learn to play with 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:39.239
 a weapon and the process of learning 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:42.569
 You master a gun is not easy. 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.730
 so besides being easy is you 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.419
 often ends up frustrating 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.079
 and you need to devote much time to 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.569
 that 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:55.319
 so I do not recommend this weapon 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.519
 for who is starting the first is 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.230
 picks up a gun is easier to play and 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.730
 watch other reviews if this is the 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.700
 first time you're seeing 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.870
 watch other devils is see what 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:13.169
 weapons is going to fit into your playing style 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.349
 and use of the weapons that were 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:17.239
 eating for the starter 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:22.199
 definitely does not start playing 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:24.209
 sad character is now from the 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.669
 When you have mastered this weapon, she 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.629
 makes it an extremely efficient weapon 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:35.010
 It's whoever watches my reviews knows 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:38.370
 I really care about the condition of the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.909
 fito acional weapon what does the sea mean 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.709
 but good is a then not 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.379
 necessarily be good but have a weapon 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.019
 decent and a gun that you can and 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:52.470
 get well in any kind of situation 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.629
 and unfortunately this is not the case with 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.349
 3 to 3 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.189
 the combat continues with one less than 20 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:04.199
 meters 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:07.019
 you will be and a serious one at such funds is 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:09.239
 I'm saying this in the case of 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:13.409
 You did not learn to play with 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:16.199
 gun and such but it is still so she is not 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:19.260
 a weapon to you and it 's not a weapon 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:22.590
 recommended for you to play in combat 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:26.550
 A doctor is there, you will pass like this. 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.820
 as highest in 34 damage're right it 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.350
 has 34 damage but she has the pace was 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.230
 very low 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.780
 there is the time to kill with 3 to 3 today 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.750
 is much longer than the time that you 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.800
 takes to kill the enemy with an elliott 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.710
 16 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.440
 let's say the weapon of the moment already then 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.930
 so, yes, does she have her sides? 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.820
 positive, she is extremely efficient at 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.920
 long distance since the damage 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.550
 her minimum is 22 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.300
 So it's you have to learn to know. 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.590
 what is the strength of the weapon and the 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.070
 definitely the strong point of the 3 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.180
 3 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:08.880
 it's a long way off and there's another 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.660
 average catch 3 to 3 at the speed of 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.760
 her arval is 500 meters per second 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.780
 This means that it is the smallest 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.720
 pan speed Cachu assault 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.140
 This is going to take with you too. 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.110
 that I anticipated it to anticipate 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:32.700
 cn movements otherwise you 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:35.010
 You'll miss the shot so that's why I 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.530
 I do not think you should play with this 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.570
 gun again I say do not play with 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.190
 this weapon from the beginning 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.680
 learn the game is only 20 marketing to 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:50.480
 learn the movement there and after a 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:56.490
 some time in a certain experience you 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:06:00.840
 decide to use this is what time she 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:04.140
 I think it is so I'm congratulations 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:08.220
 For those who do well with this gun to 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:11.820
 Who can kill a lot to pass but I 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:15.990
 I know people from players who are mato 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.900
 too much with her but it's not my case I 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.450
 For me it is not an efficient weapon in 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:27.360
 my hand it does not fit my style 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:29.220
 game is and for that and I give there the note 3 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.360
 kg 3 to 3 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.950
 but it's not to say as I already said 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.500
 that does not mean that it is a weapon 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.800
 with it is a weapon that you need 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:44.490
 stay time and patience things your two 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:48.600
 things that I do not have much is but it is 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:52.020
 Other than that guys keep it in mind is 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:56.100
 do not pull and do not have kids and heroes with 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:59.820
 this is regarding iaa TouchWiz I 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.760
 I recommend that you use the snake here is the 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.530
 my aim you can use 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:08.520
 actually mamma mia who has a 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:11.310
 sure as the code or even 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:17.220
 apply here has a slightly smaller than the 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:19.830
 rope and as there is the main part is a 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.960
 I do not recommend that you use Miguel 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:25.740
 since you will end up increasing the 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.880
 record was caution is not commanded the 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.910
 used 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:33.720
 in it and in the videos there I used the flash 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.860
 I cherish that there gave me greater control of 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:40.800
 vertical record 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:43.410
 As stated above, the law is to devote 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.990
 some time and patience to learn in 

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:49.229
 dakar but from the moment you 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:51.930
 learned to position yourself with her 

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:53.310
 It will work out extremely well, people. 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:57.419
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:07:53.310 --> 00:08:00.690
 review if you like it do not forget to 

00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:03.450
 do not forget to put 

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:05.760
 underneath the gun that you want next 

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:08.669
 review with a hug for everyone there 

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.930
 butt good week for points worth 

00:08:08.669 --> 00:08:12.229
 said 

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.229
 went
