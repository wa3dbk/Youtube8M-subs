the wheel wells brought this down did
this<00:01:29.750> here<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.429> it's<00:01:31.550> even<00:01:31.729> with<00:01:31.789> the<00:01:31.909> rockers

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
this here so it's even with the rockers

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.469 
this here so it's even with the rockers
laid<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:33.619> plastic<00:01:34.130> out<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:34.940> I<00:01:35.000> can<00:01:35.149> roll<00:01:35.300> this

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
laid this plastic out so I can roll this

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.320 
laid this plastic out so I can roll this
cart<00:01:35.810> on<00:01:36.770> top<00:01:37.130> of<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.909> then<00:01:38.090> I'll<00:01:38.210> bring

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
cart on top of it and then I'll bring

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.389 
cart on top of it and then I'll bring
the<00:01:38.450> plastic<00:01:38.659> up<00:01:39.140> on<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.500> sides<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.039> tape<00:01:40.220> it
