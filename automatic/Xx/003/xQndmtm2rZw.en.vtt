12<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.820> 24<00:00:42.239> f/4<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.770> version<00:00:44.190> 2<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.910> this

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
12 to 24 f/4 it's a version 2 of this

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.779 
12 to 24 f/4 it's a version 2 of this
Lance<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.809> first<00:00:46.079> one<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.829> pretty<00:00:47.250> much<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
Lance the first one it's pretty much the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.340 
Lance the first one it's pretty much the
same<00:00:48.000> except<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.020> think<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.860> first<00:00:50.129> one

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
same except that I think the first one

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.010 
same except that I think the first one
it<00:00:52.350> doesn't<00:00:53.039> focus<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.730> your<00:00:54.210> camera<00:00:54.570> doesn't

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
it doesn't focus if your camera doesn't

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.010 
it doesn't focus if your camera doesn't
have<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.620> built-in<00:00:56.329> autofocus<00:00:57.329> motor<00:00:57.570> like

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
have a built-in autofocus motor like

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.599 
have a built-in autofocus motor like
that

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
that

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.680 
that
the<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.270> Nikon<00:01:00.739> d3100<00:01:02.539> d5000

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the the Nikon d3100 d5000

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.670 
the the Nikon d3100 d5000
DS<00:01:04.199> 60<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.510> D<00:01:06.510> 40<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:08.330> think<00:01:09.350> some<00:01:10.350> other

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
DS 60 and D 40 and I think some other

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.190 
DS 60 and D 40 and I think some other
camera<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.909> price<00:01:12.180> difference<00:01:12.570> between<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
camera the price difference between the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.249 
camera the price difference between the
two<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> hundred<00:01:14.670> bucks<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.259> why

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
two is just like a hundred bucks so why

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.580 
two is just like a hundred bucks so why
not<00:01:16.500> go<00:01:16.830> with<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.189> newer<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.790> right<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.590> anyway

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
not go with a newer one right so anyway

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.179 
not go with a newer one right so anyway
so<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:23.119> this<00:01:24.119> lens<00:01:24.960> fits<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.560> Nikon

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
so this is for this lens fits with Nikon

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.899 
so this is for this lens fits with Nikon
cameras<00:01:27.439> as<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.500> guys<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.430> you've<00:01:29.579> seen

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
cameras as you guys know if you've seen

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.480 
cameras as you guys know if you've seen
my<00:01:30.090> past<00:01:30.390> video<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> Nikon<00:01:32.360> d7000<00:01:33.390> and

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
my past video I have a Nikon d7000 and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.520 
my past video I have a Nikon d7000 and
then<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.990> filter<00:01:37.290> size<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:39.180> lens<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.720> 77

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
then the filter size of this lens is 77

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.219 
then the filter size of this lens is 77
millimeter<00:01:41.009> which<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.729> also<00:01:42.570> decided<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
millimeter which I also decided to

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.090 
millimeter which I also decided to
purchase<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.979> UV<00:01:44.579> filter<00:01:44.689> and<00:01:48.530> let's<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:49.920> this

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
purchase a UV filter and let's get this

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.020 
purchase a UV filter and let's get this
thing<00:01:50.159> open

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
thing open

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.929 
thing open
so<00:01:51.180> as<00:01:51.420> soon<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.810> open<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.110> box<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:53.610> see

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
so as soon as you open the box you see

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.469 
so as soon as you open the box you see
the<00:01:54.689> manual<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:58.850> certificate<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.939> warranty

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the manual and certificate of warranty

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.649 
the manual and certificate of warranty
which<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.579> lens<00:02:03.119> comes<00:02:03.450> with<00:02:03.630> a

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
which is I think this lens comes with a

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:13.690 
which is I think this lens comes with a
three<00:02:04.110> year<00:02:04.399> three<00:02:05.399> years<00:02:05.729> limited<00:02:06.240> warranty

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.810 

so<00:02:17.360> as<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.600> can<00:02:18.750> see<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.800> lens<00:02:20.130> hood<00:02:20.580> is

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
so as you can see the lens hood is

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.630 
so as you can see the lens hood is
already<00:02:21.480> attached<00:02:21.930> on<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:23.150> it's<00:02:24.150> like<00:02:25.640> that

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
already attached on it it's like that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.710 
already attached on it it's like that
old<00:02:26.670> type<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.510> lens<00:02:28.050> hood<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.790> then<00:02:32.720> here's

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
old type of lens hood and then here's

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.910 
old type of lens hood and then here's
the<00:02:33.960> front<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.530> lens

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.880 

pretty<00:02:37.920> nice<00:02:38.220> right<00:02:38.880> there<00:02:39.650> 12<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.950> 24<00:02:41.570> and

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
pretty nice right there 12 to 24 and

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.090 
pretty nice right there 12 to 24 and
then<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.700> has<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.390> scale<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.290> index<00:02:46.860> right

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
then it has a scale and index right

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.040 
then it has a scale and index right
there<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:47.910> then<00:02:49.880> this<00:02:50.880> thing<00:02:51.240> here<00:02:51.570> like<00:02:51.810> if

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
there and then this thing here like if

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.940

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.560 
you were not at the moment like it's in
autofocus<00:02:55.950> if<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.520> want<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.120> switch<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.390> to

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
autofocus if you want to switch it to

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.730 
autofocus if you want to switch it to
manual<00:02:58.530> focus<00:02:59.000> you<00:03:00.000> just<00:03:00.500> put<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:01.680> thing

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
manual focus you just put this thing

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.880 
manual focus you just put this thing
down<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.940> then<00:03:03.090> if<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.570> want<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:04.200> back<00:03:04.620> to
