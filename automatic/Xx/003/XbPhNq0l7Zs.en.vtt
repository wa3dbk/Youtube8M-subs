00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.769
 hello friends today we are here because we 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.019
 you asked for social networks that 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.680
 we teach you the parts that make up the 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.710
 new hitler 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.910
 Well we start with the wheels 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:26.359
 wheel is a wheel of 85 years and has what 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.390
 that would be the aluminum core the 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.080
 core is radios as you can see and 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.510
 takes a bearing to 29 the brake is a 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.449
 flex brake with which does not carry a spring 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.549
 or nothing we avoid all the noises then 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.070
 we have the table 

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:45.949
 the killer incorporates the table that carries 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.900
 is the iguana that is a table already at a level 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.850
 but to be able to iron different 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.030
 tricks backflips the tricks you want 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.699
 is a table that the pipette the pipette 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.519
 that links here a part of what 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.490
 would be the pipette is rectangular is a 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.220
 reinforced aluminum table 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.920
 As you can see the table also comes with the 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.770
 claw of the silk screen logo here and it's 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.330
 laser cut to make it look the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.010
 color of the fork in this case of 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.410
 a fork of red color 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.200
 the fork is a steel fork in 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.990
 this case as I say red to 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.630
 closed and reinforced for 100 wheels 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.640
 then we would have what is the clan the 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.790
 plan comes with the bestial wolf logo 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.730
 screen-printed and it's a plan of three 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.860
 screws and they are three screws 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.410
 reinforced we would have the handlebars that 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.400
 comes with the bestial wolf sticker a 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:44.510
 handlebar of 32 millimeters in diameter and 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.790
 with a total width of 50 centimeters the 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.310
 total height of what makes up what 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.100
 is the handlebar are 58 centimeters 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.290
 the sleeves in this case are about 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.899
 hoses that we have put that are very 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.939
 pleasant to the touch and go in shape 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.479
 circular with some sleeves that 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:07.090
 they really are very good, well, this 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.580
 It is the killer I hope you liked it 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.420
 and plan to throw many tricks with the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.420
 state
