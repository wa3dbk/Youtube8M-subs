00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.080 
too yeah I was a little different like a
play<00:01:44.110> your<00:01:44.680> position<00:01:44.860> middle<00:01:45.370> linebacker<00:01:45.760> and

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
play your position middle linebacker and

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.660 
play your position middle linebacker and
some<00:01:46.780> people<00:01:47.110> who<00:01:47.170> criticize<00:01:47.320> him<00:01:48.010> in<00:01:48.250> the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
some people who criticize him in the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.090 
some people who criticize him in the
past<00:01:48.940> for<00:01:49.540> not<00:01:49.690> plan<00:01:49.960> mean<00:01:50.590> enough<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.040> that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
past for not plan mean enough and that

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.100 
past for not plan mean enough and that
was<00:01:51.250> your<00:01:51.400> thing<00:01:51.460> you<00:01:51.909> hate<00:01:52.240> me<00:01:52.479> play<00:01:52.810> fears

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
was your thing you hate me play fears

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.110 
was your thing you hate me play fears
when<00:01:53.680> you<00:01:53.740> think<00:01:53.950> of<00:01:53.979> his<00:01:54.130> game<00:01:54.310> well<00:01:54.580> I<00:01:54.610> think

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
when you think of his game well I think

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.030 
when you think of his game well I think
it's<00:01:55.510> fine<00:01:55.810> within<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.290> rule<00:01:56.500> because<00:01:56.890> the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
it's fine within the rule because the

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.130 
it's fine within the rule because the
rules<00:01:57.310> have<00:01:57.520> changed

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
rules have changed

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.340 
rules have changed
so<00:01:58.320> much<00:01:59.270> defensive<00:02:00.270> players<00:02:00.720> are<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.170> think

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
so much defensive players are I think

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.990 
so much defensive players are I think
they're<00:02:01.710> trying<00:02:02.010> to<00:02:02.130> put<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.550> handcuffs<00:02:03.000> on

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
they're trying to put the handcuffs on

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.110 
they're trying to put the handcuffs on
them<00:02:03.890> you<00:02:04.890> know<00:02:04.979> there's<00:02:05.190> no<00:02:05.610> offensive

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
them you know there's no offensive

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.090 
them you know there's no offensive
lineman<00:02:06.510> can<00:02:06.690> hold<00:02:06.990> now<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:07.560> everything<00:02:07.890> else

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
lineman can hold now and everything else

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.190 
lineman can hold now and everything else
so<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.420> become<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> little<00:02:10.080> bit

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
so it's it's become a little bit

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.710 
so it's it's become a little bit
difficult<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.430> compare<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.209> way<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.360> was

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
difficult and to compare the way I was

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.990 
difficult and to compare the way I was
playing<00:02:13.020> during<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.560> era<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:14.550> what<00:02:14.730> Brian

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
playing during that era to what Brian

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.060 
playing during that era to what Brian
has<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.510> put<00:02:15.720> up<00:02:15.750> with<00:02:15.870> it's<00:02:16.530> really<00:02:16.680> not<00:02:16.860> fair

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
has to put up with it's really not fair

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.680 
has to put up with it's really not fair
to<00:02:17.220> him<00:02:17.340> well<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.790> got<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.000> same<00:02:18.240> haircut<00:02:18.450> at

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
to him well you got the same haircut at

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.260 
to him well you got the same haircut at
least<00:02:18.870> now<00:02:19.020> yeah<00:02:19.760> what<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.850> think<00:02:21.030> about<00:02:21.060> this

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
least now yeah what you think about this

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.270 
least now yeah what you think about this
year's<00:02:21.540> team<00:02:21.810> especially<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.680> difference<00:02:23.130> in

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
year's team especially the difference in

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.729 
year's team especially the difference in
the<00:02:23.310> change<00:02:23.580> Alfred<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.720> think<00:02:25.590> what's

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
the change Alfred I I think what's

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.740 
the change Alfred I I think what's
happening<00:02:26.220> what<00:02:26.940> happens<00:02:27.270> two<00:02:27.420> teams<00:02:27.690> that

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
happening what happens two teams that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.140 
happening what happens two teams that
get<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> Super<00:02:28.560> Bowl<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.610> next<00:02:29.970> year

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
you really got to be lucky with injuries

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.130 
you really got to be lucky with injuries
in<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.670> just<00:02:32.850> seems<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.360> Bears<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.690> bit<00:02:33.900> hit
