00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:40.340 

well<00:00:39.179> it's<00:00:39.300> basically<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.690> scheme<00:00:39.989> for

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
well it's basically a scheme for

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.139 
well it's basically a scheme for
university<00:00:41.219> students<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
university students to have the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.060 
university students to have the
opportunity<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.690> play<00:00:42.780> cricket<00:00:43.079> or<00:00:43.710> actually

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
opportunity to play cricket or actually

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.229 
opportunity to play cricket or actually
a<00:00:44.100> professional<00:00:44.370> level<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> semi-professional

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
a professional level a semi-professional

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.509 
a professional level a semi-professional
level<00:00:45.659> so<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.710> example<00:00:47.159> I<00:00:47.190> suppose<00:00:47.339> the

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
level so for example I suppose the

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.369 
level so for example I suppose the
highlight<00:00:47.909> of<00:00:48.149> our<00:00:48.390> seasons<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> opportunity

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
highlight of our seasons the opportunity

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.130 
highlight of our seasons the opportunity
to<00:00:49.500> play<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:49.769> counties<00:00:50.159> so<00:00:50.609> this<00:00:51.359> year<00:00:51.629> we

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
to play for counties so this year we

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.410 
to play for counties so this year we
played<00:00:52.350> whist<00:00:52.589> assure<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.190> Kent<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:53.969> example

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
played whist assure and Kent for example

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.389 
played whist assure and Kent for example
and<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.409> had<00:00:55.530> some<00:00:55.680> good<00:00:55.799> results<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.250> those

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
and we had some good results in those

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.130 
and we had some good results in those
matches<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.000> that's<00:00:57.149> kind<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> main

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
matches but that's kind of like the main

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.619 
matches but that's kind of like the main
drive<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.159> scheme<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.850> allows<00:01:00.059> students

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
