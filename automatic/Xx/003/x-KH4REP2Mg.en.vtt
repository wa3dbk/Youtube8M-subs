00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.430
 our goal is to locate the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.270
 extra 6 Jun shut up 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.180
 and then becoming more powerful knows but is not 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.180
 a joke to find the extra quiet 7 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.339
 I'll take care of it and you'll see and I'll make it 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.339

 [Music] 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.060
 how it was 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.369
 hello to me then don't tell me there are 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.399
 news for me you want to know about that 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.310
 affair true what you want me to tell you 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.009
 you were right I informed you know 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.440
 however the question is becoming 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.650
 complicated you see as soon as it became known 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.030
 that the former among seven were stolen 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.280
 many informants have launched themselves 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.230
 on the trail of those obvious pages 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.660
 they understood that you can earn 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.120
 yes but you do n't have to worry because in 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.799
 many have already retired and you know the 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.260
 because it's true 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.230
 talk about the disappearances we know 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.880
 who disappeared I knew rai for now 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.470
 that should be involved a 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:38.849
 I always thank you for the guardian 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.080
 friend be very careful 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:45.540
 sorry but for those who took me for a 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.540
 young but I'm sorry for that 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.460
 [Music] 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.210
 thanks for being here nothing we do 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.990
 point of the situation you started in 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.310
 8 and now both colors had to be investigated 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.530
 on the identity of a mysterious woman 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.830
 that I thought was in possession of the former 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.060
 37 would have had them from a spy of the great 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.420
 re to me who stole them from 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.220
 a woman's library of gibran was 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.980
 so clever to eliminate the spy without 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.210
 no help what else can you tell me 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.490
 just nothing 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.050
 unfortunately too much time has passed and have 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.630
 some information is now impossible 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.060
 on top of that with the destruction of cipral 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.460
 we can't follow any tracks 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.500
 but one thing we understood asking questions 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.120
 on this matter it is very dangerous 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.190
 we must accept the fact that no one 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.490
 can give us information on how 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.940
 locate the extra 7 no one except the 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.730
 do not believe thief 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.950
 [Music] 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.790
 ok I finished you can go 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.310
 what will you do 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.690
 the preliminary investigation is closed at 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.690
 next I will think by myself 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.370
 finally we arrived 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.900
 no 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:16.670
 the exact phoenix ruins here we will find 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.670
 I hope at least some answers 

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:27.260
 what a wonderful place I didn't know that 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.790
 there was a city practically in 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.310
 this place was the very famous 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.980
 city â€‹â€‹of excited and diverse luminance 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.120
 passages of the book of principle but it was 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.970
 abandoned when it failed 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.580
 water tell me krug 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.610
 if I'm not mistaken your ancestors came from 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.830
 lumina hope what but you how do you do a 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.950
 to know I also know that you were born there 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.290
 same day of show is correct not you 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.650
 we said something is wrong 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.670
 he is right because we are here I can only 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.210
 tell you that it is for the eclipse 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.210
 let's take a look inside 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.410
 be careful to get off the ladder is 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.410
 very stiff 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.800
 it scared me what's going on 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.800
 look at her down 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.770
 what would it be is taken from the book of 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:47.550
 principle is represented birth 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:58.459
 shadows in this world look 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:58.459
 [Music] 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.840
 Sanremo this step can be 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.790
 open only with the powers of shadows 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.470
 row you find something that is the 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.040
 shadow conjurers can see 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.040
 here we go 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.230
 no no 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.810
 she is happy 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.070

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.329

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.329
 [Music] 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:47.050
 I had the feeling you were coming 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.990
 it's already been a long time since the last one 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.150
 once you have moved away from this place 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.350
 but I see that you have not had difficulty in 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.420
 find your way back 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.750
 well there is a good reason that justifies 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:02.800
 my return you refer to the extra 7a 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:05.170
 he knew but sure and you more than anyone 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.050
 else you should not underestimate mine 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.060
 information network did you forget that 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.290
 nothing happens here that I will have 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.750
 knowledge 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.820
 no, of course not and that is precisely the reason 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.250
 for which I returned 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.990
 I'll tell you what I need a list of all of them 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.370
 people who have come into output 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.370
 from the city these days 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:35.360
 I agree but I want to know the 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.400
 because a few days ago I received the 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.009
 proposal to search for the extra 7 and ho 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.539
 accepted the assignment but five among the 

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:44.319
 my best men are tragically 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:44.319
 disappeared
