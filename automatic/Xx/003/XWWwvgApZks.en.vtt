00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
GPU graphics cards and it is all about

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.980 
GPU graphics cards and it is all about
well<00:00:23.340> it's<00:00:23.490> all<00:00:23.580> about<00:00:23.789> looks<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.539> all<00:00:24.720> about

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
well it's all about looks it's all about

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.019 
well it's all about looks it's all about
performance<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:25.859> all<00:00:26.039> about<00:00:26.340> power

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
performance it's all about power

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.679 
performance it's all about power
consumption<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.930> all<00:00:28.080> about<00:00:28.289> features<00:00:29.689> it's

consumption it's all about features it's

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.420 
consumption it's all about features it's
basically<00:00:31.080> all<00:00:31.410> about<00:00:31.679> all<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.949> those<00:00:32.099> things

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
basically all about all of those things

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.880 
basically all about all of those things
so<00:00:33.270> let's<00:00:33.450> start<00:00:33.750> with<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.050> card<00:00:34.320> physically

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
so let's start with the card physically

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.430 
so let's start with the card physically
if<00:00:35.100> you've<00:00:35.340> ever<00:00:35.489> seen<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> GTX<00:00:36.300> Titan<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.960> GTX

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
if you've ever seen a GTX Titan the GTX

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.350 
if you've ever seen a GTX Titan the GTX
780<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> look<00:00:38.460> pretty<00:00:38.820> familiar<00:00:39.000> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
780 is going to look pretty familiar to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.500 
780 is going to look pretty familiar to
you<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:40.079> uses<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.620> same<00:00:40.800> gorgeous<00:00:41.510> aluminum

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
you it uses the same gorgeous aluminum

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.660 
you it uses the same gorgeous aluminum
cooler<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.440> actually<00:00:43.770> see<00:00:44.280> through<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
cooler you can actually see through the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.729 
cooler you can actually see through the
poly<00:00:44.879> carbonate<00:00:45.420> window<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.899> aluminum<00:00:46.379> fins

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
poly carbonate window the aluminum fins

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.510 
poly carbonate window the aluminum fins
it<00:00:47.039> has<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.670> same<00:00:48.000> quiet<00:00:48.870> sound<00:00:49.590> dampened<00:00:50.160> fan

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
it has the same quiet sound dampened fan

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.029 
it has the same quiet sound dampened fan
but<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.480> guys<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:52.020> comes<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.739> new

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
but get this guys it comes with a new

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.130 
but get this guys it comes with a new
fan<00:00:53.370> profile<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.120> actually<00:00:54.539> prevents<00:00:54.989> it

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
fan profile that actually prevents it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.740 
fan profile that actually prevents it
from<00:00:55.590> ramping<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.670> ramping<00:00:57.149> down<00:00:57.180> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
from ramping up and ramping down and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.410 
from ramping up and ramping down and
keeps<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.350> much<00:00:58.710> more<00:00:58.980> level<00:00:59.399> sounding<00:01:00.239> in

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
keeps it much more level sounding in

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.500 
keeps it much more level sounding in
addition<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.680> being<00:01:01.859> quiet<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.820> has<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> PCI

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
addition to being quiet it has a PCI

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.130 
addition to being quiet it has a PCI
Express<00:01:03.840> 3.0<00:01:04.710> interface<00:01:05.090> uses<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.630> pin<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
smoothness so it used to be the way we

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.469

game GeForce experience looks to
mitigate<00:05:39.330> that<00:05:39.539> they're<00:05:39.990> also<00:05:40.169> adding<00:05:40.650> some

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
mitigate that they're also adding some

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.409 
mitigate that they're also adding some
really<00:05:40.979> cool<00:05:41.340> functionality<00:05:41.820> with<00:05:42.180> shadow

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
really cool functionality with shadow

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:43.730 
really cool functionality with shadow
play<00:05:42.720> okay<00:05:42.960> I'm<00:05:43.050> even<00:05:43.199> touch<00:05:43.289> the<00:05:43.470> card<00:05:43.650> now

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
play okay I'm even touch the card now

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.219 
play okay I'm even touch the card now
because<00:05:44.190> it<00:05:44.310> uses<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:44.729> built-in<00:05:45.229> h.264

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229

of<00:05:51.300> gameplay<00:05:51.659> and<00:05:51.930> it<00:05:52.260> does<00:05:52.440> this<00:05:52.620> with<00:05:52.800> only

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
of gameplay and it does this with only

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.710 
of gameplay and it does this with only
about<00:05:53.099> a<00:05:53.220> five<00:05:53.490> percent<00:05:53.970> performance<00:05:54.539> hit

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
about a five percent performance hit

about a five percent performance hit
according<00:05:55.020> to<00:05:55.199> the<00:05:55.380> numbers<00:05:55.650> I've<00:05:55.800> seen<00:05:56.130> which

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
according to the numbers I've seen which

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.490 
according to the numbers I've seen which
is<00:05:56.909> very<00:05:57.240> cool<00:05:57.509> because<00:05:57.780> that's<00:05:58.050> a<00:05:58.139> lot<00:05:58.289> less

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
is very cool because that's a lot less

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.800 
is very cool because that's a lot less
than<00:05:58.530> fraps<00:05:58.949> and<00:05:59.190> because<00:06:00.090> it's<00:06:00.270> encoding<00:06:00.720> in

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
than fraps and because it's encoding in

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:01.670 
than fraps and because it's encoding in
h.264

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
h.264

the<00:06:02.039> files<00:06:02.250> are<00:06:02.460> much<00:06:02.699> smaller<00:06:03.030> than<00:06:03.300> the

the files are much smaller than the

fraps<00:06:06.030> it<00:06:06.630> looks<00:06:06.840> like<00:06:07.080> there's<00:06:07.289> going<00:06:07.409> to<00:06:07.470> be

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
fraps it looks like there's going to be

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.860 
fraps it looks like there's going to be
a<00:06:07.650> manual<00:06:08.190> mode<00:06:08.340> button<00:06:08.729> as<00:06:08.909> well<00:06:09.180> so<00:06:09.630> it<00:06:09.720> can

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
a manual mode button as well so it can

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.110 
a manual mode button as well so it can
be<00:06:09.960> up<00:06:10.110> to<00:06:10.320> 20<00:06:10.740> minutes<00:06:10.889> of<00:06:11.190> of<00:06:11.340> whatever's

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
going on in auto mode or you can

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.950 
going on in auto mode or you can
manually<00:06:14.220> record<00:06:14.729> and<00:06:14.940> I<00:06:15.240> mean<00:06:15.389> who<00:06:15.539> knows<00:06:15.750> and

on<00:06:31.289> the<00:06:31.530> market<00:06:31.889> and<00:06:32.039> normally<00:06:32.880> when<00:06:33.030> I'd<00:06:33.180> say

on the market and normally when I'd say

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:35.330 
on the market and normally when I'd say
something<00:06:33.840> like<00:06:33.960> that<00:06:34.229> about<00:06:34.440> a<00:06:34.500> 780<00:06:35.039> it<00:06:35.190> would

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
something like that about a 780 it would

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.460 
something like that about a 780 it would
be<00:06:35.460> because<00:06:35.639> maybe
