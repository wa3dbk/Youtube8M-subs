00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.540
 let's in touched hands with the 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.540
 defending 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.370
 this is terrible friends a position 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.370
 fierce as we had not seen 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.420
 trevor shoots like a bullet from the

 starting line goes to the head 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.930
 but Peter reaches it 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.930
 go wheel to wheel 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.220
 now 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.860
 the trevor car moves to the axle 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.840
 central and peter is thrown into the wall of 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.049
 concrete at 260 kilometers per hour 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.770
 then it turns spectacularly in a 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.770
 rain of sparks 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.700
 has rolled down the cement track giving 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.560
 Awesome tumbling is an accident 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.750
 absolutely devastating is to be expected 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.740
 that the security elements there are not 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.740
 movement to the interior 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.080
 so 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.659
 someone from the audience notices a detail 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.270
 disturbing 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.560
 Peter's helmet is on the asphalt 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.560
 everyone fears the worst 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.530
 and the lifeguards find it with the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.600
 head well placed between your shoulders 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.340
 fractured 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.560
 that's it will be fine but your record is 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.040
 curiously negative 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.950
 beware of zero catastrophe in less 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.229
 of ten seconds a clean game 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.090
 reformed with great start this mind 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.489
 It's very close 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.489
 clear touched by the defense
