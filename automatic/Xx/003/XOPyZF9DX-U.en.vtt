00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.690
 hello children how are i am sarah and 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.580
 good in Mexico September is the month 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.679
 I'm going to do makeup 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.269
 very adopt to these dates so 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.910
 important to us Mexicans 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.310
 and I wanted to do a very subtle makeup 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.109
 that represents the values of mexico and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.900
 the flag but that also does not look so 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.640
 exaggerated talk like it we go to 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.279
 start by marking the eye socket with 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.869
 a bronze shadow and with a clean brush 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.450
 let's blur everything we finish 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:42.480
 of doing I'm going to delineate the eyelid 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:44.100
 up with a green eyeliner if you 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.420
 they fixed girls I made a super delineated 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.860
 thick but what I want to do is 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.020
 delineate with black below so that 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.120
 then be double delineated I will 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.350
 delineate with gel and a brush if you 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.570
 you want to do with pencil and it's easier 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.059
 for you you can do it but the joke is 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.469
 that we delineate half of what we already 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.960
 I have put on the green towards 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.190
 inside and this little triangle that remained 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.290
 I will encourage 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.619
 and we ended up making the lashes 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.390
 and putting the wheels like it's a look 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.440
 super mexican let's use lipstick 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.430
