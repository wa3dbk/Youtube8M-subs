if<00:00:02.449> you<00:00:03.449> recall<00:00:03.810> in<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.230> last<00:00:04.799> movie<00:00:05.490> you

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
if you recall in the last movie you

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.670 
if you recall in the last movie you
created<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.359> series<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.750> controllers<00:00:07.410> for<00:00:07.620> the

spine to refresh your memory the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.650 
spine to refresh your memory the
instructions<00:00:11.759> were<00:00:11.910> such<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.599> were

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
instructions were such that you were

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.629 
instructions were such that you were
asked<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.080> freeze<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.650> transforms<00:00:13.920> on<00:00:14.519> the

asked to freeze the transforms on the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.120 
asked to freeze the transforms on the
various<00:00:15.000> shapes<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.540> then<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.650> were<00:00:16.740> asked

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
various shapes and then you were asked

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.830 
various shapes and then you were asked
to<00:00:17.220> link<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.580> spine<00:00:17.820> controllers<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.720> the

main hip controller is from the ground
this<00:00:50.969> happens<00:00:51.480> because<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:52.110> how<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
this happens because of how the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.189 
this happens because of how the
hierarchical<00:00:53.039> linkage<00:00:53.640> was<00:00:53.820> evaluated<00:00:54.629> after

hierarchical linkage was evaluated after

hierarchical linkage was evaluated after
the<00:00:55.920> freeze<00:00:56.190> transforms<00:00:58.190> press<00:00:59.190> ctrl<00:00:59.609> Z<00:00:59.820> to

the freeze transforms press ctrl Z to

the freeze transforms press ctrl Z to
undo<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.359> operation<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:02.399> trick<00:01:02.670> then<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.120> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
undo the operation the trick then is to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.780 
undo the operation the trick then is to
create<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> hierarchy<00:01:04.379> first<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.070> then

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
create the hierarchy first and then

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.140 
create the hierarchy first and then
freeze<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.390> transforms<00:01:07.070> this<00:01:08.070> way<00:01:08.369> when<00:01:09.030> you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
freeze the transforms this way when you

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.840 
freeze the transforms this way when you
transform<00:01:09.600> back<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.049> zero<00:01:10.700> everything<00:01:11.700> would

transform back to zero everything would
