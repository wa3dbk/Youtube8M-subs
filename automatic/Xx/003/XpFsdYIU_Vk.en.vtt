lower legs foam roller stretching is a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.950 
lower legs foam roller stretching is a
great<00:00:23.220> way<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.760> get<00:00:24.090> loosened<00:00:24.449> up<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.779> feel

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
great way to get loosened up to feel

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.029 
great way to get loosened up to feel
better<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.470> because<00:00:25.680> he's<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:25.980> to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
better so because he's going to

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.500 
better so because he's going to
demonstrate<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.550> couple<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:27.000> these<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.420> we're

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
demonstrate a couple of these and we're

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.839 
demonstrate a couple of these and we're
going<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.660> start<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.400> shins

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
going to start with the shins

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.380 
going to start with the shins
so<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.359> front<00:00:31.080> part<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.009> leg<00:00:32.390> muscles

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
so that front part of the leg muscles

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.310 
so that front part of the leg muscles
are<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:34.350> there<00:00:34.739> or<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.130> tibialis<00:00:35.670> anterior

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
are in there or the tibialis anterior

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.709 
are in there or the tibialis anterior
and<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.770> know<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> common<00:00:38.520> problem<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.390> we'll

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
and you know a common problem that we'll

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.690 
and you know a common problem that we'll
notice<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.800> something<00:00:41.489> called

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
notice with this is something called

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.360 
notice with this is something called
shin<00:00:42.030> splints<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.140> really<00:00:43.370> mobilize

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
shin splints but you can really mobilize

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.190 
shin splints but you can really mobilize
the<00:00:44.820> lower<00:00:45.000> part<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> leg<00:00:45.690> nicely

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
planting the hands getting the shins

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.260 
planting the hands getting the shins
right<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> foam<00:00:49.410> roller<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.270> rolling

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
right on the foam roller and rolling

slowly back and forth a foam roller

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.330 
slowly back and forth a foam roller
stretching<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.320> important<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> remember<00:00:56.010> that

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
stretching is important to remember that

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.119 
stretching is important to remember that
30<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.420> 90<00:00:57.449> seconds<00:00:58.289> per<00:00:58.440> body<00:00:58.649> part<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.010> all

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
30 to 90 seconds per body part is all

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.970 
30 to 90 seconds per body part is all
you<00:00:59.280> need<00:00:59.460> if<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.239> spend<00:01:00.539> 5<00:01:00.750> 2<00:01:00.930> minute<00:01:01.170> 5<00:01:01.379> 10<00:01:01.620> 10

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
you need if you spend 5 2 minute 5 10 10

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.439 
you need if you spend 5 2 minute 5 10 10
minutes<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.430> each<00:01:02.550> area<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.059> are<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> be

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
minutes on each area you are going to be

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.210 
minutes on each area you are going to be
too<00:01:03.660> sore<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.110> actually<00:01:04.439> caused<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.979> little

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
too sore and actually caused a little

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.100 
too sore and actually caused a little
bit<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.400> injury<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> great<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.080> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
bit of injury so this is a great way to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.600 
bit of injury so this is a great way to
get<00:01:07.350> those<00:01:07.560> front<00:01:08.070> part<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.369> shins

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
get those front part of the shins

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.570 
get those front part of the shins
loosened<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.720> we're<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.049> go<00:01:10.229> to

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
loosened up now we're going to go to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.700 
loosened up now we're going to go to
another<00:01:11.580> stretch<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
another stretch and this is for the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.700 
another stretch and this is for the
calves<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:15.600> muscles<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> back<00:01:16.170> part

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
calves so the muscles on the back part

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.280 
calves so the muscles on the back part
of<00:01:16.770> our<00:01:16.890> leg<00:01:17.130> there's<00:01:17.369> two<00:01:17.610> muscles<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.840> here

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
of our leg there's two muscles in here

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.130 
of our leg there's two muscles in here
one<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.400> called<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.820> gastrocnemius<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.990> one

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
one is called the gastrocnemius and one

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.469 
one is called the gastrocnemius and one
is<00:01:22.229> called<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.560> soleus<00:01:23.180> one<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.330> those

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
is called the soleus one of those

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.539 
is called the soleus one of those
muscles<00:01:24.930> crosses<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.710> knee<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.310> doesn't

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
muscles crosses the knee and one doesn't

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.370 
muscles crosses the knee and one doesn't
so<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.939> want<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.180> make<00:01:27.330> sure<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.570> go<00:01:27.780> clear

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
so you want to make sure you go clear

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.920 
so you want to make sure you go clear
from<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> Achilles<00:01:29.070> tendon<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.420> little<00:01:30.720> bit

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
from the Achilles tendon up a little bit

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.880 
from the Achilles tendon up a little bit
past<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> knee<00:01:31.680> when<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.400> stretch

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
past the knee when you do this stretch

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.649 
past the knee when you do this stretch
this<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.430> really<00:01:35.820> sore<00:01:36.119> our<00:01:36.299> calves

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
this one can be really sore our calves

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.990 
this one can be really sore our calves
especially<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.710> we've<00:01:37.920> been<00:01:37.950> hiking<00:01:38.610> or

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
especially if we've been hiking or

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.450 
especially if we've been hiking or

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
moving up and down hills walking in

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.889 
moving up and down hills walking in
those<00:01:41.640> high<00:01:41.850> heels<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.509> really<00:01:42.750> be

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
those high heels they can really be

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.260 
those high heels they can really be
tender<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.790> start<00:01:45.000> easy
