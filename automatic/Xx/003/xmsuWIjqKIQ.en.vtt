00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
pretty bad cold worst one so far this

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.840 
pretty bad cold worst one so far this
season<00:01:27.649> all<00:01:28.649> right<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.520> greenhouse

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
season all right in the greenhouse

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.480 
season all right in the greenhouse
what's<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> temperature<00:01:33.590> just<00:01:34.590> above<00:01:34.829> zero

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
what's the temperature just above zero

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.800 
what's the temperature just above zero
inside<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.030> greenhouse<00:01:36.149> just<00:01:36.630> above

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
inside the greenhouse just above

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.840 
inside the greenhouse just above
freezing<00:01:36.960> which<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.100> guess<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> good<00:01:38.520> thing<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
freezing which I guess a good thing is

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.600 
freezing which I guess a good thing is
it<00:01:39.149> got<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.079> snow<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> melt<00:01:40.619> off<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.219> top<00:01:41.430> of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
it got the snow to melt off the top of

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.510 
it got the snow to melt off the top of
the<00:01:41.670> greenhouse<00:01:42.200> can<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.259> guys<00:01:43.380> see<00:01:43.710> how<00:01:44.039> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the greenhouse can you guys see how the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.510 
the greenhouse can you guys see how the
plastic<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.299> kind<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:46.340> bowing<00:01:47.340> there

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
plastic is kind of bowing there

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.620 
plastic is kind of bowing there
structurally<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.520> greenhouse<00:01:51.030> hasn't<00:01:51.420> stood

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
structurally the greenhouse hasn't stood

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.069 
structurally the greenhouse hasn't stood
up<00:01:51.810> well<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.799> heavy<00:01:53.070> snow<00:01:53.579> when<00:01:54.509> there's<00:01:55.020> a

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
up well to the heavy snow when there's a

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.730 
up well to the heavy snow when there's a
really<00:01:55.289> heavy<00:01:55.880> snowfalls<00:01:57.289> just<00:01:58.289> hasn't<00:01:58.590> stood

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
really heavy snowfalls just hasn't stood

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.529 
really heavy snowfalls just hasn't stood
up<00:01:58.890> well<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.429> need<00:01:59.609> to<00:01:59.820> reinforce<00:02:00.119> this

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
up well we need to reinforce this

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.440 
up well we need to reinforce this
greenhouse<00:02:01.109> structure<00:02:01.530> much<00:02:01.920> better<00:02:02.450> for

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
greenhouse structure much better for

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.719 
greenhouse structure much better for
next<00:02:03.600> year<00:02:04.049> at<00:02:04.679> the<00:02:04.770> moment<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:05.609> can

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
next year at the moment it's all we can

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.710 
next year at the moment it's all we can
do<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.090> keep<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.420> thing<00:02:06.630> standing

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
do just to keep this thing standing

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.720 
do just to keep this thing standing
because<00:02:09.720> it's<00:02:10.050> not<00:02:10.400> structurally<00:02:11.400> up<00:02:11.550> there

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
because it's not structurally up there

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.150 
because it's not structurally up there
very<00:02:11.880> tight<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.480> makes<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:13.320> valley<00:02:13.650> for<00:02:13.950> more

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
very tight it makes it valley for more

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.360 
very tight it makes it valley for more
which<00:02:14.490> makes<00:02:14.760> it

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
which makes it

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.660 
which makes it
want<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.090> fall<00:02:16.209> down<00:02:16.239> even<00:02:16.780> more<00:02:17.549> more<00:02:18.549> snow

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
want to fall down even more more snow

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.899 
want to fall down even more more snow
gathers<00:02:19.299> up<00:02:19.450> there<00:02:19.659> I<00:02:20.069> wipe<00:02:21.069> it<00:02:21.220> off<00:02:21.340> as<00:02:21.549> best<00:02:21.730> I

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
gathers up there I wipe it off as best I

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.199 
gathers up there I wipe it off as best I
can<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.299> just<00:02:22.870> use<00:02:23.049> this<00:02:23.200> rake<00:02:23.920> here<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.489> brush

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
can I just use this rake here to brush

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.199 
can I just use this rake here to brush
it<00:02:25.239> off<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.750> stuff<00:02:26.760> inside<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.909> greenhouse

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.460 

anything<00:02:31.209> that's<00:02:31.390> growing<00:02:31.629> is<00:02:31.959> growing<00:02:32.440> very

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
anything that's growing is growing very

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.369 
anything that's growing is growing very
slowly<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:34.299> carrots<00:02:34.750> there<00:02:34.959> have<00:02:35.140> hardly

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
slowly the carrots there have hardly

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.759 
slowly the carrots there have hardly
grown<00:02:35.739> oh<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.780> grass<00:02:37.989> keeps<00:02:38.319> growing<00:02:38.650> though

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
grown oh the grass keeps growing though

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:48.150 
grown oh the grass keeps growing though
right<00:02:40.739> yeah<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:47.140> purpley<00:02:47.590> plant<00:02:47.950> there

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
right yeah the purpley plant there

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.240 
right yeah the purpley plant there
that's<00:02:48.400> beat<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.329> then<00:02:49.709> spinach<00:02:50.709> there<00:02:50.980> it's

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
that's beat and then spinach there it's

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.440 
that's beat and then spinach there it's
coming<00:02:52.379> actually<00:02:53.379> grown<00:02:53.590> more<00:02:53.829> than<00:02:54.450> more

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
coming actually grown more than more

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.369 
coming actually grown more than more
