00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
which is really what I'm doing is seeing

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.670 
which is really what I'm doing is seeing
how<00:03:40.860> you're<00:03:41.130> applying<00:03:41.459> these<00:03:42.150> basic<00:03:43.110> tools<00:03:43.350> of

how you're applying these basic tools of

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.920 
how you're applying these basic tools of
Industry<00:03:44.070> structure<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:45.600> resource

Industry structure and the resource

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.979 
Industry structure and the resource
theory<00:03:46.500> as<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.340> way<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.940> thinking<00:03:48.150> about<00:03:48.480> a

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
theory as a way of thinking about a

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:55.740 
theory as a way of thinking about a
company<00:03:49.860> in<00:03:49.920> its<00:03:50.040> position<00:03:50.660> strategically

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.720 

I<00:03:55.810> think<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.380> presentation<00:03:56.710> went<00:03:57.190> well<00:03:57.400> I

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
I think the presentation went well I

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.120 
I think the presentation went well I
think<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.990> fact<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.290> I<00:03:59.380> work<00:03:59.860> for<00:04:00.070> the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
think the fact that I work for the

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.120 
think the fact that I work for the
company<00:04:00.930> perhaps<00:04:01.930> gives<00:04:02.200> me<00:04:02.350> somewhat<00:04:02.890> of<00:04:02.920> a

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
company perhaps gives me somewhat of a

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.680 
company perhaps gives me somewhat of a
competitive<00:04:03.730> advantage<00:04:03.820> but<00:04:04.300> at<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.510> same

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
competitive advantage but at the same

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.720 
competitive advantage but at the same
time<00:04:04.960> wouldn't<00:04:05.770> be<00:04:05.860> as<00:04:05.950> good<00:04:06.130> if<00:04:06.280> I<00:04:06.490> didn't

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
time wouldn't be as good if I didn't

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.340 
time wouldn't be as good if I didn't
acknowledge<00:04:06.850> obviously<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.780> efforts<00:04:08.080> of<00:04:08.200> my
