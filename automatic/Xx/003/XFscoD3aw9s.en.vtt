00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:11.660
 By the way, everyone of cats and cats-this lens is ne 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:15.000
 I tried to attach f 1.8 of 85 people for a while now 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.789
 Power supply 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.970
 Well then hey 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.430
 I have never heard of this shutter anywhere in the world . 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.600
 Below you try a little off shutter or Oh 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.600
 Do Aso memory card 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.950
 I'm embarrassed, but I 've been born a substitute called cf card and won once 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:45.010
 I that there is no 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.010
 I'm a guy, so I'd like to buy a bit per month next month 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:58.170
 Cf cf card caught 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.170
 It's did not say I sd card Well Iiya 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.310
 How is the body 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.390
 Already 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.500
 En and hontansu 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.500
 I have now with 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.570
 Well then again Tengen article 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.320
 This because they become the example you and Aso or the mode program auto 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.220
 Opening a try trying a tactic 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.220
 Then first cut the first sutter 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.490
 Is this 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.490
 This is the first guy 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.380
 I was a bit blurry 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.960
 3,600 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:57.650
 Tens of thousands of pixels 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.650
 Hear directly below is I So let's go closer to the little once the microphone Kanee' 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.450
 Did you hear that? 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.570
 It looks like the wolf was too low 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.570
 It has become ç£¯ 100 and this one too 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.770
 I raised it to around 400 because it is indoors and again 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.680
 Also something not as impression of the shutter sound 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.330
 The scan mirror shock is not much 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.740
 Less 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:44.960
 I wonder 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.330
 A real without 's I feel it' s such a d 7000 something like that Kashon's feeling 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.680
 I wonder 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.190
 I between tiny thin iron plate like a day 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.060
 It is a sound like a was returned gold 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.060
 Let's try it again 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.440
 Naa Taka heard 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.700
 Body 1 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.920
 After all 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:12.280
 After all small 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.280
 Though it is one round compared with the camera which I bought so far 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.940
 Shield is a pretty 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.140
 In the middle 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.390
 Is 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:27.990
 That's right, ordinary aps c's middle class key 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:33.040
 It's about 140 teardrops for about the same amount 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:36.050
 As you can see from the top, it looks like the same as d 700 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.220
 It feels fat 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.220
 It is a fat impression 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:50.580
 We go when the body is what way embezzle 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.580
 I'm looking forward to seeing the change in volume 5 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.950
 More and more 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.950
 Let's go and have a live view 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:15.770
 After all if the number of people decreases 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.739
 After all tension does not have the first tension 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.139
 What I also also not talking alone thinking 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.900
 Something now 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.900
 I heard something like 5 speed sounds from the next room 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:36.960
 I next gold that same University Naa is not a next door are thought Datte doing what you doing 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.960
 I'm new first grader but yes 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.930
 What do you not do by yourself in the room 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:51.310
 I think I can not hear enough to hear the details of the story 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.060
 May be suspected now 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.060
 For example mean that 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.199
 I wonder that it is felt that wearing of the lens steering 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.070
 I am wearing 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.610
 Somehow when I'm there it came with software 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.630
 You are welcome 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:32.830
 Is this 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:34.400
 I heard that a bull called nx 2 can or can not do simple video editing 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.590
 I don't know 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.590
 Well I'm going to edit this video 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:45.999
 I think you would like to doing over time 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.860
 I can not do such editing even though I'm editing 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:50.770
 Hmm 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:54.430
 See Hey Hey 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:06:00.240
 This is for the first time in a year and a half 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.240
 Hey I was I bought a new one that say digital single-lens reflex 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:09.070
 I wonder 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:14.970
 After all, say I unwrapped Video Review doing this 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.970
 If you do it, you will see a completely different new product . 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:26.350
 It might be a bit dark because there is not enough light, though 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.780
 Flickr or something okay I'm not here in this area 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:32.569
 All right 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:36.550
 I do not wear straps basically 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:36.550
 If it sells at an auction from this company, it is stupid 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:50.449
 What I want to review in Osu is not at all already, but now it will be a little in advance 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.569
 It Well 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:56.429
 Header it's Well likely 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:56.429
 Well, opening has ended safely 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.210
 Everyone 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:09.590
 What this 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:13.230
 There is no money for this god camera . 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:17.220
 It was a little helpful 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:24.290
 Well, for this reason, it's just sold out because everyone is more 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:24.290
 It feels good to give me something like this kind of open review video 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:30.180
 Splashed Well this time 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:35.360
 See you all 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:41.080
 Also that I will also ask of Nenma if there is to meet crawl 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:47.370
 Actually, I 'm not very good at being a single person 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:52.009
 I briefly wrote the progress such that the current ones the real is 

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:55.129
 It says that it is not necessary to be prepared 

00:07:52.009 --> 00:08:02.780
 Well that's all right everyone 

00:07:55.129 --> 00:08:07.810
 Also the next d 800 form of the movie may also be up so that time is ah 

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:07.810
 I would like to give up your right-hand system .
