that one of the things they love to do

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:04.379 
that one of the things they love to do
is<00:06:02.709> to<00:06:02.919> be<00:06:03.039> cooled<00:06:03.309> off<00:06:03.550> when<00:06:03.759> he<00:06:03.819> gets<00:06:03.909> too<00:06:04.179> hot

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
is to be cooled off when he gets too hot

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:14.369 
is to be cooled off when he gets too hot
it<00:06:05.399> should<00:06:06.399> cool<00:06:06.789> down

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.139 

normally<00:06:15.379> valence<00:06:15.949> Uzi<00:06:16.399> would<00:06:16.580> be<00:06:16.789> cooling

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:17.149 
normally valence Uzi would be cooling

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:19.089 
normally valence Uzi would be cooling
themselves<00:06:17.299> off<00:06:17.779> with<00:06:18.049> with<00:06:18.319> mud<00:06:18.529> baths<00:06:18.769> as

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
themselves off with with mud baths as

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.819 
themselves off with with mud baths as
pigs<00:06:19.429> do<00:06:19.729> but<00:06:20.179> their<00:06:20.389> recently<00:06:20.779> stayed<00:06:21.169> and

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:21.829 
pigs do but their recently stayed and

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:23.859 
pigs do but their recently stayed and
the<00:06:22.159> stitches<00:06:22.639> hadn't<00:06:22.999> healed<00:06:23.209> yet<00:06:23.449> so<00:06:23.509> we

00:06:23.859 --> 00:06:23.869 
the stitches hadn't healed yet so we

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:27.399 
the stitches hadn't healed yet so we
wanted<00:06:24.110> to<00:06:24.229> keep<00:06:24.349> them<00:06:24.559> clean<00:06:26.169> so<00:06:27.169> when<00:06:27.289> it

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.409 
wanted to keep them clean so when it

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.609 
wanted to keep them clean so when it
gets<00:06:27.559> real<00:06:27.769> hot<00:06:27.799> here<00:06:28.399> I<00:06:28.839> make<00:06:29.839> these<00:06:29.989> big<00:06:30.319> huge

00:06:30.609 --> 00:06:30.619 
gets real hot here I make these big huge

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:36.429 
gets real hot here I make these big huge
ice<00:06:30.860> cube<00:06:31.249> blocks<00:06:31.669> in<00:06:32.029> our<00:06:32.299> freezer<00:06:35.139> and<00:06:36.139> I

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:36.439 
ice cube blocks in our freezer and I

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:40.089 
ice cube blocks in our freezer and I
call<00:06:36.679> them<00:06:36.829> over<00:06:36.949> to<00:06:37.159> me<00:06:37.959> and<00:06:38.959> I<00:06:39.379> just<00:06:39.409> rub<00:06:39.979> them

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:42.949 
down with ice cubes and they thoroughly

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.939 
down with ice cubes and they thoroughly
thoroughly<00:06:43.489> enjoy<00:06:44.059> it<00:06:44.089> as<00:06:45.079> I<00:06:45.529> think<00:06:45.559> almost
