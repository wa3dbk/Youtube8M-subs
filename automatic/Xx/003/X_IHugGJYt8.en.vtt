00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
fine so yeah probably just like kind of

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.700 
fine so yeah probably just like kind of
rambling<00:04:32.390> on<00:04:32.600> without<00:04:32.960> like<00:04:33.170> really<00:04:33.470> a<00:04:33.500> point

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
rambling on without like really a point

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.940 
rambling on without like really a point
but<00:04:34.630> it<00:04:35.630> was<00:04:35.780> just<00:04:35.930> like<00:04:36.230> kind<00:04:36.500> of<00:04:36.560> important

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
but it was just like kind of important

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.290 
but it was just like kind of important
for<00:04:36.980> me<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:37.340> like<00:04:37.520> get<00:04:37.700> this<00:04:37.880> out<00:04:38.090> there

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
for me to like get this out there

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.560 
for me to like get this out there
because<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:39.650> think<00:04:40.580> it<00:04:40.820> has<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:40.970> lot<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.240> do<00:04:41.450> with

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
because I think it has a lot to do with

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.260 
because I think it has a lot to do with
envy<00:04:41.930> so<00:04:42.430> you<00:04:43.430> know<00:04:43.640> as<00:04:43.820> a<00:04:43.850> man<00:04:44.030> I'm<00:04:44.180> not

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
envy so you know as a man I'm not

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.840 
envy so you know as a man I'm not
feeling<00:04:44.330> envious<00:04:44.990> person<00:04:45.460> she's<00:04:46.460> just<00:04:46.640> seeing

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
feeling envious person she's just seeing

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.130 
feeling envious person she's just seeing
that<00:04:47.030> she<00:04:47.120> like<00:04:47.270> surpassed<00:04:47.750> by<00:04:47.930> three

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
that she like surpassed by three

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.330 
that she like surpassed by three
thousand<00:04:48.440> six<00:04:48.620> hundred<00:04:48.710> dollars<00:04:49.070> and<00:04:49.250> like

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
thousand six hundred dollars and like

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.000 
thousand six hundred dollars and like
one<00:04:49.580> night<00:04:49.820> is<00:04:50.060> pretty<00:04:50.450> insane<00:04:50.870> just<00:04:51.800> like

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
one night is pretty insane just like

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.680 
one night is pretty insane just like
well<00:04:52.400> I<00:04:52.430> should<00:04:52.730> have<00:04:52.850> thought<00:04:53.060> of<00:04:53.210> it<00:04:53.360> now<00:04:53.540> of

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
well I should have thought of it now of

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.860 
well I should have thought of it now of
course<00:04:53.750> given<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:56.000> you<00:04:56.330> probably<00:04:56.660> don't

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
course given I and you probably don't

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.080 
course given I and you probably don't
have<00:04:56.960> like<00:04:57.290> the<00:04:57.470> subscriber<00:04:57.920> base<00:04:57.980> of<00:04:58.280> 100,000

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
have like the subscriber base of 100,000

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.830 
have like the subscriber base of 100,000
and<00:04:59.380> therefore<00:05:00.380> likely<00:05:00.650> wouldn't<00:05:01.100> beach<00:05:01.310> like

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
and therefore likely wouldn't beach like

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.200 
and therefore likely wouldn't beach like
$3,600<00:05:02.840> in<00:05:03.050> like<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:03.410> first<00:05:03.650> night<00:05:03.910> but<00:05:04.910> still

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
$3,600 in like the first night but still

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.610 
$3,600 in like the first night but still
I<00:05:05.240> think<00:05:05.570> it<00:05:05.660> still<00:05:05.900> has<00:05:06.080> a<00:05:06.110> lot<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.320> do<00:05:06.500> with

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
I think it still has a lot to do with

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.900 
I think it still has a lot to do with
envy<00:05:06.890> that<00:05:07.010> you're<00:05:07.130> like<00:05:07.250> why<00:05:07.460> didn't<00:05:07.790> I<00:05:07.850> get
