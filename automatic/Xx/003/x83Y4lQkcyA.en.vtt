don't mind if they show then they hold a
little<00:00:44.760> bit<00:00:44.850> better<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.510> you're<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
little bit better so you're going to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.540 
little bit better so you're going to
start<00:00:46.110> by<00:00:46.379> putting<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:46.890> hair<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.280> ponytail

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
start by putting your hair in a ponytail

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.910 
start by putting your hair in a ponytail
sort<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.629> red<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> back<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.559> your<00:00:49.710> head

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
sort of red in the back of your head

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.740 
sort of red in the back of your head
this<00:00:50.430> actually<00:00:50.969> works<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.300> little<00:00:51.420> bit<00:00:51.600> better

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
this actually works a little bit better

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.299 
this actually works a little bit better
if<00:00:52.050> your<00:00:52.230> hair<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.440> kind<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.829> gross<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.219> dirty

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
