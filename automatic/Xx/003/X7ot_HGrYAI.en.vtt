00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
there will be more than one wonder

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
weapon within this brand new map which

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.690 
weapon within this brand new map which
is<00:02:27.960> awesome<00:02:28.170> but<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.530> also<00:02:28.650> says<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.070> harness

is awesome but it also says that harness
supernatural<00:02:30.270> powers<00:02:31.110> now<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.260> would<00:02:31.530> have

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
supernatural powers now I would have

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.930 
supernatural powers now I would have
thought<00:02:31.740> that<00:02:31.800> all<00:02:32.070> wonder<00:02:32.430> weapons<00:02:32.790> would

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
thought that all wonder weapons would

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.280 
thought that all wonder weapons would
have<00:02:33.030> harness<00:02:33.330> supernatural<00:02:33.510> powers<00:02:34.200> you

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
have harness supernatural powers you

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.200 
have harness supernatural powers you
know<00:02:34.320> they're<00:02:34.860> not<00:02:34.890> normal<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.760> things<00:02:36.030> that

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
know they're not normal the things that

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.330 
know they're not normal the things that
can't<00:02:36.480> be<00:02:36.540> explained<00:02:36.990> by<00:02:37.050> science<00:02:37.440> but<00:02:38.250> then

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
can't be explained by science but then

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.680 
can't be explained by science but then
if<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:38.550> think<00:02:38.760> about<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.210> Wunderwaffe

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
if you think about it the Wunderwaffe

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.540 
if you think about it the Wunderwaffe
had<00:02:39.930> electricity<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.860> few<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.220> our<00:02:41.310> guns

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
had electricity and the few of our guns

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.460 
had electricity and the few of our guns
had<00:02:41.970> other<00:02:42.210> things<00:02:42.450> but<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:42.960> these<00:02:43.080> wonder

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
had other things but so these wonder

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.870 
had other things but so these wonder
weapons<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:43.860> were<00:02:43.950> getting<00:02:44.160> in<00:02:44.250> dlc<00:02:44.700> for

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
weapons that were getting in dlc for

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.850 
weapons that were getting in dlc for
origins<00:02:45.420> must<00:02:45.930> be<00:02:46.080> so<00:02:46.290> powerful<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.800> know

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
origins must be so powerful you know

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.320 
origins must be so powerful you know
they<00:02:47.100> must<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.370> unique<00:02:47.730> things<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.210> we've

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
they must be unique things that we've

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.690 
they must be unique things that we've
never<00:02:48.450> seen<00:02:48.600> before<00:02:48.780> things<00:02:49.650> are<00:02:50.040> implemented

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
never seen before things are implemented

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.860 
never seen before things are implemented
in<00:02:50.790> these<00:02:50.820> weapons<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.420> cannot<00:02:51.810> be

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
in these weapons that cannot be

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.110 
in these weapons that cannot be
explained<00:02:52.470> by<00:02:52.560> science<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.160> use<00:02:53.520> just

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
explained by science that use just

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.060 
explained by science that use just
element<00:02:54.570> 115<00:02:54.930> all<00:02:55.320> other<00:02:55.470> things<00:02:55.740> like<00:02:55.890> that

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
element 115 all other things like that

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.530 
element 115 all other things like that
so<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.430> think<00:02:56.790> these<00:02:56.880> wonder<00:02:57.210> weapons<00:02:57.480> are

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
so I think these wonder weapons are

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.000 
so I think these wonder weapons are
going<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.720> be<00:02:57.780> super<00:02:58.020> overpowered<00:02:58.680> super

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
going to be super overpowered super

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.120 
going to be super overpowered super

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.760 
power-ups so that's awesome we've got
some<00:03:06.180> kind<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.510> new<00:03:06.720> drone<00:03:07.050> in<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.410> map<00:03:07.650> we've

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
some kind of new drone in this map we've

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.800 
some kind of new drone in this map we've
got<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.950> mark<00:03:08.220> IV<00:03:08.670> tank<00:03:09.030> which<00:03:09.210> is<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.390> very<00:03:09.720> old

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
got a mark IV tank which is a very old

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.210 
got a mark IV tank which is a very old
town<00:03:10.170> called<00:03:10.410> put<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> picture<00:03:10.770> of<00:03:10.950> one<00:03:11.100> on

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
town called put a picture of one on

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.710 
town called put a picture of one on
screen<00:03:11.490> now<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:12.150> that's<00:03:12.300> going<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.510> be<00:03:12.570> awesome

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
screen now so that's going to be awesome

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.300 
screen now so that's going to be awesome
i<00:03:12.990> was<00:03:13.110> thinking<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:13.560> maybe<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:14.010> could<00:03:14.190> be

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
i was thinking that maybe this could be

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.830 
i was thinking that maybe this could be
the<00:03:14.400> mode<00:03:14.550> of<00:03:14.580> transport<00:03:15.240> i<00:03:15.330> think<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.630> map

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
the mode of transport i think this map

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.600 
the mode of transport i think this map
will<00:03:15.960> be<00:03:16.020> massive<00:03:16.320> basically<00:03:17.220> because<00:03:17.460> we've

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
will be massive basically because we've

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.370 
will be massive basically because we've
got<00:03:17.700> robot<00:03:18.150> sunny<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.660> know<00:03:18.750> they<00:03:18.930> won't<00:03:19.110> suit

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
got robot sunny you know they won't suit

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.080 
got robot sunny you know they won't suit
a<00:03:19.500> small<00:03:19.800> map<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.460> i<00:03:20.490> think<00:03:20.610> we'd<00:03:20.850> have<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.060> have

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
a small map so i think we'd have to have

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.790 
a small map so i think we'd have to have
a<00:03:21.240> massive<00:03:21.480> map<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.990> suit<00:03:22.200> these<00:03:22.350> massive

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
a massive map to suit these massive

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.740 
a massive map to suit these massive
robots<00:03:22.980> roaming<00:03:23.490> around<00:03:23.610> this<00:03:23.850> map<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.270> i

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
robots roaming around this map and i

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.240 
robots roaming around this map and i
think<00:03:24.990> that<00:03:25.110> a<00:03:25.140> tank<00:03:25.440> could<00:03:25.710> be<00:03:25.890> an<00:03:26.010> awesome

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
think that a tank could be an awesome

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.370 
think that a tank could be an awesome
mode<00:03:26.580> of<00:03:26.730> transport<00:03:27.270> own<00:03:27.480> along<00:03:28.080> with<00:03:28.260> you

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
mode of transport own along with you

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.750 
mode of transport own along with you
know<00:03:28.500> an<00:03:28.620> awesome<00:03:28.800> way<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.190> actually<00:03:29.580> take

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
know an awesome way to actually take

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.310 
know an awesome way to actually take
these<00:03:29.910> robots<00:03:30.300> down<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:30.720> could<00:03:31.020> possibly

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
these robots down so that could possibly

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.740 
these robots down so that could possibly
a<00:03:31.410> mode<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.650> transport<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.460> it<00:03:33.000> also<00:03:33.120> says<00:03:33.510> as

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
a mode of transport and it also says as

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.870 
a mode of transport and it also says as
well<00:03:34.020> as<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.260> newport<00:03:34.920> machine<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.490> a<00:03:35.520> brand-new

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
well as a newport machine so a brand-new

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.670 
well as a newport machine so a brand-new
per<00:03:36.090> machine<00:03:36.330> is<00:03:36.540> coming<00:03:36.810> obviously<00:03:36.900> we<00:03:37.530> able

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
per machine is coming obviously we able

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.170 
per machine is coming obviously we able
to<00:03:37.740> thought<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.460> brand<00:03:38.790> new<00:03:38.850> power-ups

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
to thought that and brand new power-ups

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.520 
to thought that and brand new power-ups
so<00:03:39.540> that's<00:03:39.690> going<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.870> be<00:03:39.930> interesting<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.410> see

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
so that's going to be interesting to see

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.780 
so that's going to be interesting to see
what<00:03:40.560> new<00:03:40.830> power-ups<00:03:41.070> are<00:03:41.400> going<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.640> be<00:03:41.700> in

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
what new power-ups are going to be in

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.340 
what new power-ups are going to be in
this<00:03:41.940> map<00:03:42.180> if<00:03:42.600> you<00:03:43.020> don't<00:03:43.170> know<00:03:43.230> what

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
this map if you don't know what

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.480 
this map if you don't know what
power-ups<00:03:43.770> are<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:44.010> basically<00:03:44.280> like<00:03:44.460> a

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
power-ups are the basically like a

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.250 
power-ups are the basically like a
Maximo<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.240> you<00:03:45.360> found<00:03:45.570> on<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.780> floor<00:03:45.930> or

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
Maximo that you found on the floor or

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.730 
Maximo that you found on the floor or
like<00:03:47.010> a.m.<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.210> know<00:03:48.330> carpenter<00:03:49.110> or<00:03:49.260> things

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
like a.m. you know carpenter or things

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.620 
like a.m. you know carpenter or things
like<00:03:49.860> that<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.430> brand-new<00:03:50.880> power<00:03:51.210> up<00:03:51.450> we'll

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
like that so a brand-new power up we'll

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.970 
like that so a brand-new power up we'll
just<00:03:51.840> find<00:03:52.020> dropping<00:03:52.380> off<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.530> zombie<00:03:52.830> that's

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
on different types of robots so we've

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.379 
on different types of robots so we've
got<00:04:37.919> one<00:04:38.069> to<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.250> left<00:04:38.400> one<00:04:38.639> in<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:38.789> middle<00:04:39.000> we

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
got one to the left one in the middle we

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:40.640 
got one to the left one in the middle we
start<00:04:39.630> we've<00:04:39.750> got<00:04:39.840> another<00:04:40.110> one<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.440> right

start we've got another one to the right

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.499 
start we've got another one to the right
there<00:04:40.919> so<00:04:41.190> in<00:04:41.430> this<00:04:41.789> image<00:04:42.000> it<00:04:42.210> looks<00:04:42.360> like

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
robot roaming around this map I think

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.040 
robot roaming around this map I think
it's<00:04:47.490> going<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.639> be<00:04:47.729> so<00:04:48.000> so<00:04:48.210> amazing<00:04:48.449> different

it's going to be so so amazing different
types<00:04:49.229> of<00:04:49.380> robots<00:04:49.590> as<00:04:49.919> well<00:04:50.069> that<00:04:50.250> could<00:04:50.400> do

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
types of robots as well that could do

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.610 
types of robots as well that could do
different<00:04:50.940> things<00:04:50.970> to<00:04:51.360> you<00:04:51.539> one<00:04:52.229> could<00:04:52.410> shoot
