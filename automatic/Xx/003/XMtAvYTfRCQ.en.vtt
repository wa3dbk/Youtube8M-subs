look<00:00:16.139> at<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.350> formation<00:00:16.770> plan<00:00:17.520> now<00:00:18.449> we

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
look at the formation plan now we

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.890 
look at the formation plan now we
recently<00:00:19.410> looked<00:00:19.859> at<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.359> annihilation<00:00:21.359> Fine

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
recently looked at the annihilation Fine

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.340 
recently looked at the annihilation Fine
Arts<00:00:22.320> Center<00:00:22.590> right<00:00:22.769> finally<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.990> this<00:00:24.990> is

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
Arts Center right finally and this is

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.620 
Arts Center right finally and this is
the<00:00:25.800> opposite<00:00:26.160> what<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.269> think<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.599> does

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the opposite what do you think it does

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.609 
the opposite what do you think it does
it<00:00:28.050> spits<00:00:28.560> things<00:00:28.920> out<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.820> brilliant<00:00:30.619> so

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
it spits things out it is brilliant so

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.860 
it spits things out it is brilliant so
what<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.399> do<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.300> go<00:00:33.480> into<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
what we can do is you can go into the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.530 
what we can do is you can go into the
system<00:00:34.140> we're<00:00:34.590> gonna<00:00:34.680> grab<00:00:35.300> you're<00:00:36.300> not<00:00:36.390> we're

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
system we're gonna grab you're not we're

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.180 
system we're gonna grab you're not we're
gonna<00:00:36.630> rope<00:00:36.840> half<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.410> these<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.920> we're<00:00:38.070> gonna

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
gonna rope half of these and we're gonna

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.869 
gonna rope half of these and we're gonna
hog<00:00:38.489> grab<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.570> collar<00:00:40.050> still<00:00:40.379> -<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.430> what<00:00:41.820> you

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
hog grab the collar still - so what you

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.459 
hog grab the collar still - so what you
can<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.750> right<00:00:42.960> click<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
can do is you can right click at the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.310 
can do is you can right click at the
wrench<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.520> set<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.360> now<00:00:46.110> these<00:00:46.289> R

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
wrench and you can set it up now these R

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.740 
wrench and you can set it up now these R
upgrade<00:00:47.010> slots<00:00:47.280> that's<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.820> another<00:00:47.910> tutorial

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
upgrade slots that's in another tutorial

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.779 
upgrade slots that's in another tutorial
and<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.530> set<00:00:49.920> what<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.219> want<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.640> do

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and you can set what you want it to do

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.750 
and you can set what you want it to do
in<00:00:51.719> theory<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:53.660> should<00:00:55.039> be<00:00:56.039> spitting<00:00:56.520> things

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
in theory that should be spitting things

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
in theory that should be spitting things
out<00:00:59.390> but<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:00.989> oh<00:01:03.019> it<00:01:04.019> doesn't<00:01:04.799> matter

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
out but it's not oh it doesn't matter

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.830 
out but it's not oh it doesn't matter
because<00:01:05.430> what<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.880> do<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.540> can<00:01:06.630> triple

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
because what we can do is we can triple

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.270 
because what we can do is we can triple
things<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.140> there<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.530> it'll<00:01:07.799> come<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.070> here

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
things in there and it'll come up here

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.700 
things in there and it'll come up here
now<00:01:08.790> what<00:01:09.060> I've<00:01:09.240> done<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.780> I've<00:01:10.200> set<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
now what I've done is I've set a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.219 
now what I've done is I've set a
priority<00:01:11.450> everything's<00:01:12.450> got<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> priority<00:01:12.900> in

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
priority everything's got a priority in

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.340 
priority everything's got a priority in
the<00:01:13.290> network<00:01:13.799> now<00:01:14.700> everything<00:01:15.540> was<00:01:15.900> set<00:01:16.200> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
the network now everything was set to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.280 
the network now everything was set to
zero<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.729> does<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:17.939> mean<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:19.080> means

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
zero so what does that mean that means

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.830 
zero so what does that mean that means
that<00:01:19.770> zero<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.580> goes<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.390> anywhere<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
that zero it just goes to anywhere it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.359 
that zero it just goes to anywhere it
just<00:01:22.020> goes<00:01:22.170> straight<00:01:22.380> into<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.770> system<00:01:23.159> now

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
just goes straight into the system now

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.969 
just goes straight into the system now
I've<00:01:23.850> set<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.270> priority<00:01:24.750> one<00:01:24.960> any<00:01:25.259> block

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
I've set this to priority one any block

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.539 
I've set this to priority one any block
is<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.090> initially<00:01:27.540> come<00:01:28.350> here<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.280> is

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
is going to initially come here this is

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.460 
is going to initially come here this is
the<00:01:29.729> most<00:01:29.850> priority<00:01:30.390> area<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.320> is

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the most priority area this is

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.590 
the most priority area this is
everything<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.909> network<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
everything in the network is going to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.810 
everything in the network is going to
come<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.079> point<00:01:34.380> when<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.159> gets<00:01:35.400> put<00:01:35.640> into

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
come to this point when it gets put into

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.260 
come to this point when it gets put into
it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.539 
it
so<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.380> gonna<00:01:37.470> come<00:01:37.710> along<00:01:37.829> here<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
so here it's gonna come along here and

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.420 
so here it's gonna come along here and
out<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.259> whereas<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.439> set<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> zero<00:01:41.040> it's

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
out here whereas it was set to zero it's

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.469 
out here whereas it was set to zero it's
just<00:01:41.909> going<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.630> ah<00:01:43.340> it's<00:01:44.340> gonna<00:01:44.579> go<00:01:44.850> into<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
just going to ah it's gonna go into the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.359 
just going to ah it's gonna go into the
system<00:01:45.720> as<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.829> see<00:01:47.070> here<00:01:47.340> 33<00:01:48.259> so<00:01:49.369> what

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
system as you can see here 33 so what

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.830 
system as you can see here 33 so what
else<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:51.000> used<00:01:51.210> for

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
else can this be used for

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.460 
else can this be used for
and<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:52.950> be<00:01:53.130> used<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.490> all<00:01:53.640> sorts<00:01:54.470> we

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
and can you be used for all sorts we

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.139 
and can you be used for all sorts we
can't<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.159> need<00:01:56.369> said<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.759> partially

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
can't we just need said so partially

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.399 
can't we just need said so partially
weak<00:01:58.079> state<00:01:58.380> other<00:01:58.530> stick<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.540> so<00:02:00.540> we

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
weak state other stick that that so we

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.740 
weak state other stick that that so we
can<00:02:01.920> put<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.610> here<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.180> I'll<00:02:03.540> place

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
can put that in here and then I'll place

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.020 
can put that in here and then I'll place
it<00:02:03.990> place<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.439> block<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.130> amazing<00:02:05.820> you

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
it place the block it is amazing you

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.710 
it place the block it is amazing you
pull<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.840> again<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:08.250> doesn't<00:02:08.729> work<00:02:09.239> though

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
pull it in again it doesn't work though
