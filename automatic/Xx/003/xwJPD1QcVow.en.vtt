00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
it actually really feels like it's a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.980 
it actually really feels like it's a
wall<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.549> also<00:01:50.790> used<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.360> storage<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
the personalization just it's very

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.520 
the personalization just it's very
subtle<00:01:56.399> though<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.840> color<00:01:58.049> scheme<00:01:58.350> we

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
subtle though so the color scheme we

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.770 
subtle though so the color scheme we
have<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.649> bright<00:01:59.009> blue<00:01:59.369> as<00:01:59.790> well<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:00.390> orange

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
have to cut this out so you can't just

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.600 
have to cut this out so you can't just
buy<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> big<00:02:07.170> B<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.799> was<00:02:08.009> challenging<00:02:08.489> so

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
buy a big B so this was challenging so

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:08.870 
buy a big B so this was challenging so
what<00:02:08.759> I

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
what I

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.090 
what I
as<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.150> created<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.840> square<00:02:10.230> put<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.710> on<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> wall

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
as I created a square put it on the wall

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.610 
as I created a square put it on the wall
and<00:02:11.340> then<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.640> had<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:12.000> cut<00:02:12.240> out<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.960> shape<00:02:13.260> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
and then I had to cut out the shape and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.710 
and then I had to cut out the shape and
I<00:02:13.770> used<00:02:14.010> an<00:02:14.160> exacto<00:02:14.670> knife<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.090> do<00:02:15.210> that<00:02:15.390> okay

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
I used an exacto knife to do that okay

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.720 
I used an exacto knife to do that okay
without<00:02:16.020> going<00:02:16.560> into<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.800> wall<00:02:17.040> too<00:02:17.310> deeply

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
without going into the wall too deeply

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.210 
without going into the wall too deeply
and<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.750> works<00:02:18.930> perfectly<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.710> it's<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.130> a

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
and it works perfectly and it's just a

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.850 
and it works perfectly and it's just a
simple<00:02:20.720> impactful<00:02:21.720> statement<00:02:21.930> yep<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:22.680> this

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
simple impactful statement yep so this

yeah so we did I wanted to keep it

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.210 
yeah so we did I wanted to keep it
consistent<00:03:18.990> and<00:03:19.260> wrap<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.620> where<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:20.070> know<00:03:20.190> I

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
consistent and wrap to where you know I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.440 
consistent and wrap to where you know I
didn't<00:03:20.610> have<00:03:20.700> different<00:03:20.940> color<00:03:21.090> embedding

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
didn't have different color embedding

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.730 
didn't have different color embedding
flowers<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.020> all<00:03:22.110> of<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.350> wanted<00:03:22.620> to

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
flowers and all of that I wanted to

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.260

still<00:03:22.980> keep<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.250> clean<00:03:23.490> and<00:03:23.520> you<00:03:23.970> know<00:03:24.090> white

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
still keep it clean and you know white

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.680

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.810 
and bright and cheery and terrific so I
think<00:03:27.930> it's<00:03:28.290> really<00:03:28.620> important<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.310> take<00:03:29.790> a

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
think it's really important to take a

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.640 
think it's really important to take a
look<00:03:29.940> at<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.090> floor<00:03:30.360> tiles<00:03:30.660> I've<00:03:30.960> always<00:03:31.380> said

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
look at the floor tiles I've always said

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.220 
look at the floor tiles I've always said
you<00:03:32.010> know<00:03:32.760> your<00:03:33.030> area<00:03:33.330> rug<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.930> really<00:03:34.140> going

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
you know your area rug is really going

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.080 
you know your area rug is really going
to<00:03:34.320> anchor<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.800> room<00:03:35.010> well<00:03:35.430> clearly<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.910> did

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
to anchor the room well clearly you did

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.550 
to anchor the room well clearly you did
that<00:03:36.270> it's<00:03:36.480> anchored<00:03:36.810> each<00:03:37.050> of<00:03:37.440> their

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
that it's anchored each of their

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.949 
that it's anchored each of their
individual<00:03:37.980> spaces<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:38.850> what<00:03:39.030> did<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.270> use<00:03:39.480> so

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
individual spaces so what did you use so

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.260 
individual spaces so what did you use so
I<00:03:39.990> used<00:03:40.260> floor<00:03:40.650> tiles<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.370> can<00:03:41.580> make<00:03:42.090> them

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
I used floor tiles you can make them

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.790 
I used floor tiles you can make them
whatever<00:03:42.420> size<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:42.900> want<00:03:43.110> whatever<00:03:43.290> pattern

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
whatever size you want whatever pattern

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.500 
whatever size you want whatever pattern
and<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.130> love<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.370> if<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.520> get<00:03:44.580> bored<00:03:44.910> with<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:45.360> I

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
and I love it if I get bored with this I

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.449 
and I love it if I get bored with this I
can<00:03:45.660> make<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:46.380> know<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.530> different<00:03:46.860> pattern

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
can make it you know a different pattern

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.430 
can make it you know a different pattern
the<00:03:47.700> next<00:03:47.940> day<00:03:48.060> or<00:03:48.330> whatever<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.080> really

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
the next day or whatever and it really

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.470 
the next day or whatever and it really
does<00:03:49.740> give<00:03:50.370> them<00:03:50.520> a<00:03:50.760> sense<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.090> separateness

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
does give them a sense of separateness

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.940 
does give them a sense of separateness
here<00:03:51.870> being<00:03:52.140> able<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.380> do<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.590> blue<00:03:52.740> on<00:03:52.830> one

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
here being able to do the blue on one

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.320 
here being able to do the blue on one
side<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.370> orange<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.730> other<00:03:53.910> it's

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
side and the orange of the other it's

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.210 
side and the orange of the other it's
perfect<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.900> don't<00:03:54.930> have<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.260> look<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:55.709> what<00:03:56.190> I

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
perfect I don't have to look so what I

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.670 
perfect I don't have to look so what I
think<00:03:56.310> is<00:03:56.550> so<00:03:56.850> ingenious<00:03:57.390> about<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.140> room<00:03:58.470> is

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
think is so ingenious about this room is

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.520 
think is so ingenious about this room is
using<00:03:59.310> every<00:03:59.820> ounce<00:03:59.850> of<00:04:00.240> space<00:04:00.600> so<00:04:01.080> let's<00:04:01.290> take

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
using every ounce of space so let's take

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.199 
using every ounce of space so let's take
the<00:04:01.680> air<00:04:01.800> conditioning<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.550> heating<00:04:02.880> unit

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
the air conditioning and heating unit

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.550 
the air conditioning and heating unit
for<00:04:03.330> example<00:04:03.720> now<00:04:03.870> these<00:04:04.020> things<00:04:04.290> aren't

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
for example now these things aren't

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.580 
for example now these things aren't
necessarily<00:04:05.459> attractive<00:04:06.300> but<00:04:06.540> sherry<00:04:06.840> you've

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
necessarily attractive but sherry you've

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.870 
necessarily attractive but sherry you've
done<00:04:07.800> something<00:04:08.010> really<00:04:08.310> cool<00:04:08.459> here<00:04:08.700> you've

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
done something really cool here you've

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.449 
done something really cool here you've
made<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.270> fun<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.230> functional<00:04:10.590> so<00:04:11.100> let's<00:04:11.280> take

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
made it fun and functional so let's take

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.430 
made it fun and functional so let's take
a<00:04:11.490> look<00:04:11.700> tell<00:04:12.030> me<00:04:12.060> what<00:04:12.209> is<00:04:12.630> this<00:04:12.750> okay<00:04:13.380> so

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
a look tell me what is this okay so

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.090 
a look tell me what is this okay so
these<00:04:13.740> are<00:04:14.480> similar<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.810> wall<00:04:15.990> applique

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
these are similar to the wall applique

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.710 
these are similar to the wall applique
that<00:04:17.490> you<00:04:17.610> can<00:04:17.820> put<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:18.240> it's<00:04:18.360> a<00:04:18.420> dry<00:04:18.660> erase

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
that you can put so it's a dry erase

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.750 
that you can put so it's a dry erase
