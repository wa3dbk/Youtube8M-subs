 Since then, our extensive experience has helped us to manufacture 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.989
 The world's best light shaping tool 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.220

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.800
 And there are four sizes, two different shapes and three different materials. 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.400
 The new series of umbrellas are divided into twelve models according to two types. 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.600

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.400

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.400
 Deeper umbrellas have deeper, more parabolic curved shapes than regular umbrellas 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.070
 Deeper shapes allow photographers to better control light diffusion 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.500

 The deep and shallow umbrellas have been extensively improved to be as reliable and sturdy as possible.

 The selected materials provide excellent light quality after years of high-intensity use. 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.150
 The surface of the metal part has been treated to prevent rust and discoloration.
