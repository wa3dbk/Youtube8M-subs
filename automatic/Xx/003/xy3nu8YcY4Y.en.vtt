I'm Linda Thomas I'm a teaching fellow

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.270 
I'm Linda Thomas I'm a teaching fellow
in<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:02.429> computer<00:00:02.970> science<00:00:03.120> department<00:00:07.280> well

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
in the computer science department well

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.480 
in the computer science department well
there<00:00:08.820> are<00:00:08.910> two<00:00:08.940> schemes<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.570> 400<00:00:10.290> mg<00:00:10.650> 401<00:00:11.250> and

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
there are two schemes to 400 mg 401 and

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.330 
there are two schemes to 400 mg 401 and
they're<00:00:11.759> both<00:00:11.880> computer<00:00:12.420> science<00:00:13.160> they<00:00:14.160> are

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
they're both computer science they are

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.849 
they're both computer science they are
our<00:00:14.549> most<00:00:14.759> general<00:00:15.570> scheme<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.170> would<00:00:16.379> say<00:00:16.590> in

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
our most general scheme I would say in

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.950 
our most general scheme I would say in
other<00:00:17.100> words<00:00:17.340> students<00:00:18.300> take<00:00:18.570> computer

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
other words students take computer

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.840 
other words students take computer
science<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.619> they<00:00:19.680> can<00:00:19.980> do<00:00:20.100> electives<00:00:20.609> in

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
science that they can do electives in

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.509 
science that they can do electives in
any<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> areas<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.289> we<00:00:22.619> have<00:00:22.859> specific

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
any of the areas that we have specific

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.870 
any of the areas that we have specific
degrees<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:28.099> well<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.130> hope<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.640> they<00:00:29.789> would

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
degrees in well I hope that they would

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.510 
degrees in well I hope that they would
want<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.210> study<00:00:30.420> because<00:00:30.890> this<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.130> really

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
want to study because this is really

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.420 
want to study because this is really
interesting<00:00:33.320> it's<00:00:34.320> about<00:00:34.710> building<00:00:35.190> things

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
interesting it's about building things

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.590 
interesting it's about building things
and<00:00:36.030> solving<00:00:36.660> problems<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.300> just

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and solving problems and and it's just

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.780 
and solving problems and and it's just
more<00:00:40.500> fun<00:00:40.710> than<00:00:40.829> anything<00:00:41.160> else<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.460> can<00:00:41.520> think

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
more fun than anything else I can think

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:50.410 
more fun than anything else I can think
of<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:46.680> students<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.190> ng<00:00:47.850> 400mg<00:00:48.539> 401<00:00:49.230> take<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
of the students in ng 400mg 401 take a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.630 
of the students in ng 400mg 401 take a
core<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.449> modules<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.500> then<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.100> electives

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
core of modules and then have electives

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.170 
core of modules and then have electives
in<00:00:53.850> other<00:00:54.390> areas<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.370> all<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.850> students

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
in other areas so all of the students

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.740 
in other areas so all of the students
take<00:00:57.449> programming<00:00:58.879> specifically<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
take programming specifically in the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.959 
take programming specifically in the
java<00:01:00.989> programming<00:01:01.109> language<00:01:01.850> they<00:01:02.850> also

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
java programming language they also

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.990 
java programming language they also
study<00:01:03.390> database<00:01:04.070> they<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.250> modules<00:01:05.489> in

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
study database they have modules in

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.780 
study database they have modules in
software<00:01:06.780> engineering<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.790> ubiquitous

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
computing and then they can take

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.880 
computing and then they can take
electives<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.299> things<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.890> artificial

kind of project a lot of students bring
their<00:04:02.120> own<00:04:02.150> equipment<00:04:02.599> so<00:04:02.989> they<00:04:03.019> bring<00:04:03.319> their

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
their own equipment so they bring their

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.369 
their own equipment so they bring their
own<00:04:03.500> laptop<00:04:04.329> but<00:04:05.329> we<00:04:05.599> have<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.870> facilities

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
own laptop but we have the facilities

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.909 
own laptop but we have the facilities
for<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:06.799> while<00:04:07.010> throughout<00:04:07.609> the<00:04:07.790> campus<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:08.919> so

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
for a while throughout the campus and so

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:15.399 
for a while throughout the campus and so
students<00:04:10.310> often<00:04:10.879> use<00:04:11.060> that<00:04:11.269> as<00:04:11.389> well<00:04:14.409> well

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
students often use that as well well

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:16.900 
students often use that as well well
what<00:04:15.650> they<00:04:15.739> find<00:04:15.950> in<00:04:16.099> terrible<00:04:16.430> depends<00:04:16.820> on

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
what they find in terrible depends on

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.170 
what they find in terrible depends on
them<00:04:17.120> of<00:04:17.299> course<00:04:17.509> I<00:04:17.840> hope<00:04:18.769> that<00:04:19.009> that<00:04:19.489> one<00:04:20.060> of

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
them of course I hope that that one of

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.430 
them of course I hope that that one of
the<00:04:20.239> things<00:04:20.449> that<00:04:20.539> students<00:04:20.989> find<00:04:21.229> very

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
the things that students find very

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.260 
the things that students find very
enjoyable<00:04:21.769> is<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.310> final<00:04:22.610> year<00:04:22.729> project

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
enjoyable is the final year project

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.900 
enjoyable is the final year project
which<00:04:23.570> enables<00:04:24.289> a<00:04:24.380> student<00:04:24.740> to<00:04:24.860> work<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.310> third

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
which enables a student to work a third

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.580 
which enables a student to work a third
of<00:04:26.000> their<00:04:26.180> time<00:04:26.479> on<00:04:26.750> a<00:04:26.780> project<00:04:27.199> of<00:04:27.289> their<00:04:27.470> own

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
of their time on a project of their own

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.560 
of their time on a project of their own
choice<00:04:27.860> which<00:04:28.610> could<00:04:28.820> either<00:04:28.940> be<00:04:29.150> something

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
choice which could either be something

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.159 
choice which could either be something
which<00:04:29.780> they<00:04:30.020> have<00:04:30.199> made<00:04:30.949> up<00:04:31.099> themselves<00:04:31.310> or

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
which they have made up themselves or

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.510 
which they have made up themselves or
possibly<00:04:33.169> something<00:04:33.740> which<00:04:34.039> a<00:04:34.159> member<00:04:34.430> of

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
possibly something which a member of

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.450 
possibly something which a member of
staff<00:04:34.729> has<00:04:35.000> suggested<00:04:36.130> obviously<00:04:37.130> that<00:04:37.310> can

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
staff has suggested obviously that can

staff has suggested obviously that can
also<00:04:37.610> be<00:04:37.760> frustrating<00:04:38.570> because<00:04:38.690> programming

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
also be frustrating because programming

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.649 
also be frustrating because programming
sometimes<00:04:39.620> is<00:04:39.800> frustrating<00:04:40.400> but<00:04:40.430> but<00:04:41.240> it's

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:41.659 
sometimes is frustrating but but it's

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:44.770 
sometimes is frustrating but but it's
also<00:04:41.840> fun<00:04:42.229> in<00:04:42.979> the<00:04:43.699> second<00:04:44.060> year<00:04:44.120> students

work on the modules called the software
development<00:04:49.190> lifecycle<00:04:49.419> but<00:04:50.419> we<00:04:51.080> all<00:04:51.199> call<00:04:51.229> it

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
development lifecycle but we all call it

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.670 
development lifecycle but we all call it
informally<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.639> group<00:04:52.849> project<00:04:53.360> so<00:04:53.840> students

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
informally the group project so students

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.080 
informally the group project so students
have<00:04:54.740> divided<00:04:55.190> up<00:04:55.310> into<00:04:55.430> groups<00:04:55.729> and

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
have divided up into groups and

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.779 
have divided up into groups and
different<00:04:57.050> students<00:04:57.979> take<00:04:58.159> different<00:04:58.400> roles

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
different students take different roles

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.120 
different students take different roles
within<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.389> groups<00:04:59.630> so<00:05:00.229> somebody<00:05:00.830> might<00:05:01.010> be

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
within the groups so somebody might be

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.830 
within the groups so somebody might be
the<00:05:01.220> manager<00:05:01.760> somebody<00:05:02.210> else<00:05:02.389> might<00:05:02.599> be<00:05:02.780> in

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
the manager somebody else might be in

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.020 
the manager somebody else might be in
charge<00:05:03.080> of<00:05:03.169> testing<00:05:03.520> someone<00:05:04.520> else<00:05:04.669> might<00:05:04.849> be

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
charge of testing someone else might be

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.300 
charge of testing someone else might be
in<00:05:05.120> charge<00:05:05.330> of<00:05:05.419> design<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:06.080> again<00:05:06.860> that's<00:05:07.039> one

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
in charge of design and again that's one

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.920 
in charge of design and again that's one
of<00:05:07.400> those<00:05:07.490> experiences<00:05:08.300> that<00:05:08.449> can<00:05:08.630> be<00:05:08.750> both

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
of those experiences that can be both

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.140 
of those experiences that can be both
very<00:05:09.280> rewarding<00:05:10.280> and<00:05:10.430> sometimes<00:05:10.909> a<00:05:11.000> little

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
very rewarding and sometimes a little

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.140 
very rewarding and sometimes a little
bit<00:05:11.740> frustrating<00:05:12.740> but<00:05:13.159> that's<00:05:13.639> sort<00:05:13.909> of<00:05:14.000> what

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
bit frustrating but that's sort of what

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.110 
bit frustrating but that's sort of what
computing<00:05:14.599> is<00:05:14.720> like<00:05:14.960> and<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:16.130> reward<00:05:16.520> always

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
computing is like and the reward always

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.660 
computing is like and the reward always
outweighs<00:05:17.449> the<00:05:17.659> frustration<00:05:18.259> I<00:05:18.409> think

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.730 

we<00:05:22.670> try<00:05:22.940> to<00:05:22.970> make<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:23.480> course<00:05:23.720> as<00:05:23.930> vocational

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
we try to make the course as vocational

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.460 
we try to make the course as vocational
as<00:05:25.040> possible<00:05:25.520> so<00:05:25.820> in<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:26.600> first<00:05:26.780> year<00:05:27.140> we<00:05:27.260> take

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
as possible so in the first year we take

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.720 
as possible so in the first year we take
students<00:05:27.830> away<00:05:28.130> for<00:05:28.460> a<00:05:28.490> team-building

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
students away for a team-building

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.760 
students away for a team-building
weekend<00:05:29.570> then<00:05:29.780> we<00:05:29.900> take<00:05:30.050> all<00:05:30.290> the<00:05:30.440> students

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
weekend then we take all the students

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.830 
weekend then we take all the students
away<00:05:31.040> for<00:05:31.250> that<00:05:31.370> in<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.390> second<00:05:32.810> year

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
away for that in the second year

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.410 
away for that in the second year
students<00:05:33.500> who<00:05:33.620> are<00:05:33.740> on<00:05:33.860> the<00:05:33.890> G<00:05:34.160> 401<00:05:34.880> scheme

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
students who are on the G 401 scheme

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.540 
students who are on the G 401 scheme
which<00:05:35.720> is<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:36.080> one<00:05:36.260> version<00:05:37.070> of<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:37.280> scheme

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
which is the one version of the scheme

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.570 
which is the one version of the scheme
with<00:05:37.730> a<00:05:37.760> urine<00:05:38.090> industry<00:05:38.830> go<00:05:39.830> to<00:05:39.890> Coogan<00:05:40.340> arc

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
with a urine industry go to Coogan arc

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.870 
with a urine industry go to Coogan arc
and<00:05:40.760> they<00:05:40.970> get<00:05:41.120> interviewed<00:05:41.660> by<00:05:41.930> employers

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
and they get interviewed by employers

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.580 
and they get interviewed by employers
sort<00:05:43.880> of<00:05:43.940> mock<00:05:44.150> interviews<00:05:44.720> who<00:05:45.110> and<00:05:45.350> the

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
sort of mock interviews who and the

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.820 
sort of mock interviews who and the
employers<00:05:45.950> also<00:05:46.130> look<00:05:46.340> at<00:05:46.460> their<00:05:46.580> CVS<00:05:47.000> so<00:05:47.830> that

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
employers also look at their CVS so that

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.170 
employers also look at their CVS so that
can<00:05:49.010> be<00:05:49.040> that<00:05:49.400> could<00:05:49.520> be<00:05:49.640> quite<00:05:49.880> good

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
can be that could be quite good

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.420 
can be that could be quite good
experience<00:05:50.690> because<00:05:50.780> then<00:05:51.320> when<00:05:51.650> they<00:05:51.800> apply

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
experience because then when they apply

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.280 
experience because then when they apply
for<00:05:52.700> jobs<00:05:52.910> for<00:05:53.180> their<00:05:53.330> industrial<00:05:53.630> your<00:05:54.080> or

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
for jobs for their industrial your or

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.680 
for jobs for their industrial your or
when<00:05:54.830> they<00:05:54.950> finish<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:55.400> degree<00:05:55.520> they<00:05:55.910> have<00:05:56.660> a

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
when they finish the degree they have a

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.360 
when they finish the degree they have a
CP<00:05:57.140> which<00:05:57.320> has<00:05:57.470> already<00:05:57.620> been<00:05:57.800> seen<00:05:58.130> by

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
CP which has already been seen by

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.500 
CP which has already been seen by
somebody<00:05:58.820> in<00:05:58.850> industry<00:05:59.780> so<00:06:00.850> in<00:06:01.850> terms<00:06:02.120> of<00:06:02.300> work

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
somebody in industry so in terms of work

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.560 
somebody in industry so in terms of work
experience<00:06:03.280> the<00:06:04.280> main<00:06:04.490> work<00:06:04.880> experience<00:06:05.390> that

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
experience the main work experience that

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.200 
experience the main work experience that
students<00:06:05.900> have<00:06:06.140> would<00:06:06.590> be<00:06:06.620> on<00:06:07.130> the<00:06:07.490> G<00:06:07.640> 401

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
students have would be on the G 401

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.540 
students have would be on the G 401
scheme<00:06:08.600> if<00:06:08.780> they<00:06:08.930> decide<00:06:09.290> to<00:06:09.320> do<00:06:09.590> that<00:06:09.800> between

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
scheme if they decide to do that between

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.090 
scheme if they decide to do that between
the<00:06:10.790> second<00:06:11.240> and<00:06:11.300> third<00:06:11.420> year<00:06:11.930> and<00:06:12.140> the<00:06:12.770> kinds

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
the second and third year and the kinds

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.350 
the second and third year and the kinds
of<00:06:13.160> things<00:06:13.220> that<00:06:13.430> students<00:06:13.850> do<00:06:14.060> on<00:06:14.090> that

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
of things that students do on that

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.330 
of things that students do on that
scheme<00:06:14.690> are<00:06:14.900> very<00:06:15.050> similar<00:06:15.320> to<00:06:15.440> the<00:06:15.590> ones<00:06:15.860> that

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
scheme are very similar to the ones that

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.090 
scheme are very similar to the ones that
they<00:06:16.490> do<00:06:16.550> when<00:06:16.850> they<00:06:16.940> graduate<00:06:17.680> so<00:06:18.680> we<00:06:18.890> have

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
they do when they graduate so we have

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.000 
they do when they graduate so we have
some<00:06:19.400> students<00:06:19.760> who<00:06:19.820> work<00:06:20.060> on<00:06:20.240> campus<00:06:21.010> for

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
some students who work on campus for

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.550 
some students who work on campus for
example<00:06:22.430> some<00:06:22.670> of<00:06:22.760> them<00:06:22.910> are<00:06:23.840> in<00:06:23.900> the<00:06:24.440> computer

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
have lots of students who go all over
