00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:40.929 
have that all set up you're ready to
start<00:04:39.020> up<00:04:39.139> your<00:04:39.349> server<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:39.979> just<00:04:40.280> if<00:04:40.729> you're

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:40.939 
start up your server so just if you're

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:42.610 
start up your server so just if you're
using<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.360> batch<00:04:41.539> file<00:04:41.840> for<00:04:42.229> running<00:04:42.500> your

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
using a batch file for running your

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.490 
using a batch file for running your
server<00:04:42.889> or<00:04:43.340> if<00:04:44.330> you're<00:04:44.449> on<00:04:44.509> Linux<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:44.990> using

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
server or if you're on Linux and using

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.020 
server or if you're on Linux and using
the<00:04:45.590> startup<00:04:45.919> command<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.580> should<00:04:46.759> be<00:04:46.879> about

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
the startup command it should be about

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.119 
the startup command it should be about
the<00:04:47.180> same

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
the same

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.490 
the same
so<00:04:49.129> our<00:04:49.490> startup<00:04:49.909> command<00:04:50.240> is<00:04:50.599> gonna<00:04:50.930> include

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
so our startup command is gonna include

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.059 
so our startup command is gonna include
a<00:04:52.810> well<00:04:53.810> you<00:04:54.169> should<00:04:54.349> already<00:04:54.560> have<00:04:54.650> all<00:04:54.919> of

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:55.069 
a well you should already have all of

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:57.459 
a well you should already have all of
this<00:04:55.219> if<00:04:55.639> you<00:04:55.819> haven't<00:04:55.939> already<00:04:56.150> and<00:04:56.539> at<00:04:57.319> the

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:57.469 
this if you haven't already and at the

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:59.439 
this if you haven't already and at the
end<00:04:57.620> if<00:04:57.770> you<00:04:57.800> don't<00:04:58.039> have<00:04:58.250> it<00:04:58.430> just<00:04:58.610> add<00:04:59.029> plus

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
end if you don't have it just add plus

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.230 
end if you don't have it just add plus
game-mode<00:05:00.229> and<00:05:00.439> here's<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.639> you're<00:05:02.029> going<00:05:02.180> to

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
game-mode and here's the you're going to

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.029 
game-mode and here's the you're going to
use<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:03.370> schemas<00:05:04.370> name<00:05:04.779> which<00:05:05.779> basically<00:05:06.259> the

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
use the schemas name which basically the

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.480 
use the schemas name which basically the
dot<00:05:08.000> txt<00:05:08.419> file<00:05:08.719> without<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.259> extension<00:05:09.949> so

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
dot txt file without the extension so

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.080 
dot txt file without the extension so
we'll<00:05:10.639> sample<00:05:12.729> we're<00:05:13.729> going<00:05:13.849> to<00:05:13.909> save<00:05:14.060> that

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
we'll sample we're going to save that

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.740 
we'll sample we're going to save that
and<00:05:14.479> now<00:05:15.229> just<00:05:15.919> double<00:05:16.219> click<00:05:16.400> on<00:05:16.550> run<00:05:17.270> dot<00:05:17.509> bat

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
and now just double click on run dot bat

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.149 
and now just double click on run dot bat
or<00:05:18.020> run<00:05:18.289> your<00:05:18.439> command<00:05:18.770> if<00:05:18.889> you're<00:05:19.039> using

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 
or run your command if you're using

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:26.070 
or run your command if you're using
Linux<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:21.110> server<00:05:21.319> should<00:05:21.439> be<00:05:21.680> starting

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.279 

now<00:05:27.080> you<00:05:27.139> can<00:05:27.590> all<00:05:27.680> have<00:05:27.830> a<00:05:27.860> Garry's<00:05:28.129> Mod<00:05:28.189> open

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
now you can all have a Garry's Mod open

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:35.980 
now you can all have a Garry's Mod open
then<00:05:30.289> go<00:05:31.009> open<00:05:31.610> up<00:05:31.699> Garry's<00:05:32.000> Mod<00:05:32.029> and<00:05:34.990> we're

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
then go open up Garry's Mod and we're

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.839 
then go open up Garry's Mod and we're
playing<00:05:36.289> to<00:05:36.469> the<00:05:36.560> server<00:05:36.770> startup<00:05:38.289> alright<00:05:39.849> so

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
playing to the server startup alright so

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:43.689 
playing to the server startup alright so

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
on lamb where I you can see it since

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.390 
on lamb where I you can see it since
it's<00:05:43.879> running<00:05:44.120> on<00:05:44.210> my<00:05:44.330> computer<00:05:45.279> we're<00:05:46.279> going

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
it's running on my computer we're going

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.040 
it's running on my computer we're going
to<00:05:46.460> see<00:05:46.610> my<00:05:46.789> Center<00:05:47.180> is<00:05:47.360> going<00:05:47.659> to<00:05:47.719> be<00:05:47.839> running

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
to see my Center is going to be running

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.379 
to see my Center is going to be running
nut<00:05:48.349> script<00:05:48.650> sample<00:05:49.069> and<00:05:49.400> if<00:05:49.879> you<00:05:50.000> join<00:05:50.180> it

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
nut script sample and if you join it

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.399 
nut script sample and if you join it
then<00:05:52.479> hopefully<00:05:53.479> your<00:05:53.629> service<00:05:53.990> is<00:05:54.050> all<00:05:54.169> set

then hopefully your service is all set

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.429 
then hopefully your service is all set
