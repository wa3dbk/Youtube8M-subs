00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.399 
that he decided to continue on with the
process<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.370> was<00:02:24.670> actually<00:02:24.819> a<00:02:25.540> six-year-old

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
process and was actually a six-year-old

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.890 
process and was actually a six-year-old
self-funded<00:02:27.400> retiree<00:02:27.819> with<00:02:28.209> a<00:02:28.239> investment

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
self-funded retiree with a investment

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.809 
self-funded retiree with a investment
portfolio<00:02:29.530> over<00:02:29.950> three<00:02:30.190> million<00:02:30.400> u.s.

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
portfolio over three million u.s.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.699 
portfolio over three million u.s.
dollars<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.629> he<00:02:31.750> was<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:32.019> living<00:02:32.260> off<00:02:32.379> the

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
dollars and he was just living off the

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.710 
dollars and he was just living off the
passive<00:02:33.040> income<00:02:33.370> which<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:34.209> obviously<00:02:34.599> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
passive income which is obviously the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.350 
passive income which is obviously the
dividends<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.890> what<00:02:36.549> I'm<00:02:36.670> going<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.879> do<00:02:37.060> is

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
dividends so what I'm going to do is

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.259 
dividends so what I'm going to do is
