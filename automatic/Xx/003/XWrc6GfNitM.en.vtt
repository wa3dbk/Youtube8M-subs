00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
size and strength and I'm looking for a

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.810 
size and strength and I'm looking for a
new<00:00:15.480> program<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.109> mix<00:00:16.320> things<00:00:16.560> up<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.039> ran

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
new program to mix things up I ran

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.510 
new program to mix things up I ran
across<00:00:17.970> HST<00:00:18.840> but<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.590> my<00:00:19.800> doubts<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
across HST but of my doubts on the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.480 
across HST but of my doubts on the
program<00:00:20.939> approach<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.960> effectiveness<00:00:22.500> what

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
program approach and effectiveness what

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.640 
program approach and effectiveness what
your<00:00:23.670> thoughts<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.150> this

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.630 

okay<00:00:27.609> Jay<00:00:28.359> Curtis<00:00:28.779> 90<00:00:29.110> x<00:00:29.230> in<00:00:29.800> your<00:00:30.189> video<00:00:30.550> you

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
okay Jay Curtis 90 x in your video you

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.690 
okay Jay Curtis 90 x in your video you
explain<00:00:31.330> how<00:00:31.360> the<00:00:31.599> HST<00:00:32.169> program<00:00:32.860> which<00:00:33.340> I<00:00:33.520> have

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
explain how the HST program which I have

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.180 
explain how the HST program which I have
never<00:00:33.910> heard<00:00:34.150> of<00:00:34.360> calls<00:00:35.050> for<00:00:35.379> high<00:00:35.500> repetition

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
never heard of calls for high repetition

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.100 
never heard of calls for high repetition
training<00:00:36.640> in<00:00:36.820> high<00:00:37.000> volumes<00:00:37.540> of<00:00:37.750> work<00:00:37.930> in

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
training in high volumes of work in

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.340 
training in high volumes of work in
period<00:00:38.650> I<00:00:38.829> socks<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:40.300> is<00:00:40.510> usually<00:00:41.020> very<00:00:41.050> good

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
period I socks this is usually very good

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.119 
period I socks this is usually very good
for<00:00:41.739> what<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.040> program<00:00:42.340> is<00:00:42.610> designed<00:00:42.970> for

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
for what the program is designed for

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.100 
for what the program is designed for
hypertrophy<00:00:45.129> you<00:00:45.850> also<00:00:46.059> state<00:00:46.600> that<00:00:46.629> you<00:00:46.989> are

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
hypertrophy you also state that you are

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.259 
hypertrophy you also state that you are
not<00:00:47.290> an<00:00:47.350> athlete<00:00:47.680> so<00:00:48.430> you<00:00:48.489> have<00:00:48.760> no<00:00:48.970> need<00:00:49.210> for

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
not an athlete so you have no need for

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.270 
not an athlete so you have no need for
strength<00:00:49.809> or<00:00:50.110> functionality<00:00:50.620> in<00:00:50.980> Europe

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
strength or functionality in Europe

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.729 
strength or functionality in Europe
program<00:00:51.760> so<00:00:52.660> if<00:00:52.839> you<00:00:52.960> are<00:00:53.110> strictly<00:00:53.500> looking

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
program so if you are strictly looking

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.460 
program so if you are strictly looking
to<00:00:54.040> add<00:00:54.190> muscle<00:00:54.489> size<00:00:54.820> then<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.720> program<00:00:56.230> you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
to add muscle size then the program you

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.640 
to add muscle size then the program you
are<00:00:56.500> using<00:00:56.620> may<00:00:57.190> be<00:00:57.250> a<00:00:57.339> good<00:00:57.579> choice<00:00:58.080> yes<00:00:59.080> but

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
are using may be a good choice yes but

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.619 
are using may be a good choice yes but
I'm<00:00:59.890> not<00:00:59.920> sure<00:01:00.400> if<00:01:00.580> I<00:01:00.729> am<00:01:00.879> getting<00:01:01.000> results

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
I'm not sure if I am getting results

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.229 
I'm not sure if I am getting results
from<00:01:01.839> this<00:01:02.019> approach<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.769> I<00:01:03.519> am<00:01:03.670> used<00:01:03.970> a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
from this approach and I am used a

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.510 
from this approach and I am used a
training<00:01:04.659> with<00:01:04.839> heavier<00:01:05.170> weights<00:01:05.520> what

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
training with heavier weights what

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.250 
training with heavier weights what
should<00:01:06.760> I<00:01:06.880> do<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:09.400> I<00:01:09.670> were<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:10.000> guess<00:01:10.210> you<00:01:11.049> are

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
should I do if I were to guess you are

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.530 
should I do if I were to guess you are
probably<00:01:11.710> taking<00:01:12.010> the<00:01:12.369> same<00:01:12.610> rest<00:01:12.939> intervals

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
probably taking the same rest intervals

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.840 
probably taking the same rest intervals
between<00:01:13.689> sets<00:01:14.229> with<00:01:14.470> this<00:01:14.710> program<00:01:15.189> as<00:01:15.369> when

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
between sets with this program as when

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.510 
between sets with this program as when
you<00:01:15.880> were<00:01:16.060> lifting<00:01:16.630> with<00:01:16.780> heavier<00:01:17.110> weights

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
you were lifting with heavier weights

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.120 
you were lifting with heavier weights
correct<00:01:18.900> well<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.380> secret<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.920> getting

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
correct well the secret to getting

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.399 
correct well the secret to getting
results<00:01:21.700> with<00:01:21.880> bodybuilding<00:01:22.240> type<00:01:22.840> programs

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
results with bodybuilding type programs

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.760 
results with bodybuilding type programs
is<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.680> keep<00:01:23.950> a<00:01:24.100> very<00:01:24.280> high<00:01:24.659> time<00:01:25.770> under

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
is to keep a very high time under

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
is to keep a very high time under
tension<00:01:27.600> or<00:01:28.600> Tut<00:01:29.049> the<00:01:29.770> way<00:01:29.979> this<00:01:30.159> is<00:01:30.340> done<00:01:30.640> is

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
tension or Tut the way this is done is

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.880 
tension or Tut the way this is done is
by<00:01:30.970> keeping<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.510> work<00:01:31.720> volume<00:01:32.230> high<00:01:32.470> and<00:01:32.650> rest

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
by keeping the work volume high and rest

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.000 
by keeping the work volume high and rest
intervals<00:01:33.430> very<00:01:33.700> low<00:01:34.050> so<00:01:35.050> but<00:01:35.560> for<00:01:35.740> when<00:01:35.890> you

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
intervals very low so but for when you

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.830 
intervals very low so but for when you
were<00:01:36.160> doing<00:01:36.460> fives<00:01:36.790> and<00:01:37.180> triples<00:01:37.540> you<00:01:37.630> might

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
were doing fives and triples you might

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.080 
were doing fives and triples you might
have<00:01:38.050> taken<00:01:38.260> three<00:01:38.770> to<00:01:38.950> five<00:01:39.220> minute<00:01:39.640> rest<00:01:39.820> in

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
have taken three to five minute rest in

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.290 
have taken three to five minute rest in
between<00:01:40.240> sets<00:01:40.740> now<00:01:41.740> you've<00:01:42.370> got<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.909> keep<00:01:43.090> the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
between sets now you've got to keep the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.270 
between sets now you've got to keep the
rest<00:01:43.480> closer<00:01:43.870> to<00:01:44.140> 30<00:01:44.409> to<00:01:44.620> 90<00:01:45.010> seconds

okay<00:01:48.350> when<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.470> are<00:01:49.590> graining<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.250> this

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
okay when you are graining like this

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.609 
okay when you are graining like this
your<00:01:51.210> muscles<00:01:51.510> should<00:01:51.900> feel<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.409> they<00:01:52.560> are

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
your muscles should feel like they are

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.100 
your muscles should feel like they are
going<00:01:52.830> to<00:01:52.950> explode<00:01:53.540> otherwise<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:54.960> doing

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
going to explode otherwise you are doing

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.380 
going to explode otherwise you are doing
it<00:01:55.320> wrong<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:56.460> should<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.850> beating<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
it wrong you should be beating the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.480 
it wrong you should be beating the

training for strength you are primarily

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.040 
training for strength you are primarily
focused<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.820> increasing<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.509> function<00:02:03.960> of
