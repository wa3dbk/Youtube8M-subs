00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
awareness from that which is aware of is

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.699 
awareness from that which is aware of is
an<00:02:46.680> empowering<00:02:47.450> form<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.690> integration<00:02:48.959> but

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
an empowering form of integration but

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.470 
an empowering form of integration but
it's<00:02:49.800> very<00:02:49.920> empowering<00:02:50.459> because<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.239> allows<00:02:51.450> a

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
it's very empowering because it allows a

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.070 
it's very empowering because it allows a
person<00:02:51.959> not<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.739> shut<00:02:53.340> off<00:02:53.610> feelings<00:02:54.180> but<00:02:54.959> to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
person not to shut off feelings but to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.990 
person not to shut off feelings but to
be<00:02:55.200> fully<00:02:55.440> present<00:02:55.709> with<00:02:55.950> them<00:02:56.250> but<00:02:56.670> just<00:02:56.819> not

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
be fully present with them but just not

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.220 
be fully present with them but just not
swallowed<00:02:57.569> up<00:02:57.720> by<00:02:57.900> them

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230

okay<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.470> mindfulness<00:02:59.340> practice<00:03:00.090> has<00:03:00.840> been

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
okay so mindfulness practice has been

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.160 
okay so mindfulness practice has been
shown<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.739> not<00:03:02.459> only<00:03:02.700> stimulate<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.420> insula

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
shown to not only stimulate the insula

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.600 
shown to not only stimulate the insula
which<00:03:04.290> brings<00:03:04.709> up<00:03:04.920> data<00:03:05.160> from<00:03:05.280> these

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
which brings up data from these

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.850 
which brings up data from these
subcortical<00:03:06.090> areas<00:03:06.299> upward<00:03:06.900> but<00:03:07.530> actually

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
subcortical areas upward but actually

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.729 
subcortical areas upward but actually
strengthens<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.790> makes<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.269> thicker<00:03:09.739> and

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
strengthens it it makes it thicker and

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.520 
strengthens it it makes it thicker and
so<00:03:11.040> when<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> person<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:12.209> more<00:03:12.989> in<00:03:13.170> touch<00:03:13.319> with

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
so when a person is more in touch with

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.470 
so when a person is more in touch with
themselves<00:03:13.680> they<00:03:14.280> have<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:14.880> more<00:03:15.120> robust

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
themselves they have a more robust

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.509 
themselves they have a more robust
insula<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.920> beautiful<00:03:17.400> thing<00:03:17.489> about

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
insula and the beautiful thing about

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.210 
insula and the beautiful thing about
that<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.900> more<00:03:19.260> robust<00:03:19.620> your<00:03:19.799> insula

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
that is that the more robust your insula

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.600 
that is that the more robust your insula
response<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:21.569> more<00:03:21.720> empathy<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.230> have<00:03:22.610> for

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
response the more empathy you have for

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.180 
response the more empathy you have for
others<00:03:23.880> that's<00:03:24.209> been<00:03:24.510> demonstrated<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:26.010> we

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
others that's been demonstrated so we

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.370 
others that's been demonstrated so we
have<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.340> win-win<00:03:26.760> situation<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.630> actually

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
have a win-win situation you actually

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.430 
have a win-win situation you actually
get<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.620> know<00:03:28.799> yourself<00:03:28.980> better<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:30.440> you

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
get to know yourself better and you

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.620 
get to know yourself better and you
become<00:03:31.890> more<00:03:32.820> balanced<00:03:33.269> in<00:03:33.420> your<00:03:33.450> own

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
become more balanced in your own

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.810 
become more balanced in your own
emotional<00:03:34.049> response<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:35.489> become<00:03:35.790> more

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
emotional response and you become more

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.109 
emotional response and you become more
compassionate<00:03:36.299> for<00:03:36.660> other<00:03:36.780> people
