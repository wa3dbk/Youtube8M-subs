00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.110
 3 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.310
 the future 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.129
 t 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.910
 two 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.840
 he also tells me 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.629
 hi friends, how are you? 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.989
 of the best and welcome to a new 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.840
 mode called rainbow liquits clear that 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.540
 yes it would be the rainbow fluids more 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.430
 or less the translation really our 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.260
 exactly how to say it but good if 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.420
 signals what they are seeing is the mod 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.579
 like we do not have very many 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.960
 many very many liquids 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.449
 different colors as you are seeing 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.259
 yourselves with your own eyes 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.270
 Then they will tell you what we want 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.340
 both good color liquid in first 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.800
 you can decorate with them that 's the least 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.869
 important in second every liquid has 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.390
 potion effects which with these 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.960
 they can be adventure maps with traps 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.179
 or with a bonus so to speak because then 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.009
 there may be a good liquids well and 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.630
 bad liquids then they can 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.090
 use for the things that you 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.290
 Like, let's start to try them here 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.560
 we have the grave that this would be him 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.990
 the gray liquid can be strong gray 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.380
 because I have one that is light gray 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.990
 then because it is 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.060
 and the great spectral all have for 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.009
 some reason spectrum after its 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.590
 name as you can see white spectral 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.329
 over plus spectrum now in spectrum and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.229
 so on then we started with 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.990
 the gray we get and with so much goes to us 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.210
 give the effect of wilder lechita lechita 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.069
 there they are because then you have to have 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.329
 careful to take good care of there and as 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.610
 you can see all so many milk I'm 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.350
 prepared for the massacre ok we're going to 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.289
 get into purple and purple gives us 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.800
 until which, well, this one is very, very 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.380
 very good 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.650
 brown to the white liquid that is going to 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.930
 give in instant healing this 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.900
 liquid is very but very good can see 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.910
 and static to express more is like 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.550
 you lie do not be to the clouds 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.650
 well it's very good here we go now with 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.330
 the magnet spectra that gives us 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.950
 regeneration these liquids so 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.950
 general are good not those that are 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.800
 claritos less the the naranjito but the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.810
 people will give us strength 2 then 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.390
 It is also very promote not to drink milk 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.100
 because they are buying the effects not 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.110
 we want effects accumulate 20000 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.850
 there are two red that red 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.730
 it will definitely give us resistance 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.890
 to the clear fire that yes gentlemen now the 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.890
 black is going to give us snapshots 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:02.750
 let's hope and so fast people 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.290
 it will be logical but I still thought that I was going to 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:11.030
 Hold on for a little bit more 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.030
 the more it really was 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.570
 with blue blue and gives us vision 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.140
 night 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.630
 then the rose will give us a booster 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.220
 jumps in both tones we highlight well to 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.800
 we are all 9 jumping 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.930
 perfect with what would be light gray the 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.160
 light gray will not give you what it would be 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.770
 resistance 2 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.540
 Many of these colors are very good 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.770
 there are only few that are bad that 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.020
 the good thing then here we have 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.560
 invisibility with yellow or where 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.560
 is the raba 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.780
 there was that good 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.970
 we had here with those who are missing this 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.860
 side that we have what would be the sayan 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.920
 colors come out from beautiful post 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.680
 we have to be able to breathe under 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.780
 the water then this is very good here 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.700
 this is bad this is the color the image 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.629
 your hand will give us if I'm not mistaken 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.629
 do not give 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.880
 then the green that is green is going 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:16.260
 to give vomit nausea so so so so so 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:19.680
 the voice light blue the speed both 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.430
 we are fast while we fall 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.419
 he does not know anything 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.419
 you do not see anything 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:34.080
 ok now the brawn is going to give us this 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.460
 hong is not super wires 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.529
 quickly then you have to have 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.789
 Beware of that definitely with 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:42.969
 these liquids can make maps of 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.949
 adventure with liquids that are good and 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:47.919
 liquids that are bad with traps with 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:50.650
 with riddles with you can not in fact 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.629
 make up lakes and lakes of liquids 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.699
 good and bad liquid lakes as well 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:57.729
 say you're finishing an adventure map 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.789
 if you put I do not know a super mega river of what 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.839
 what would be and is the white liquid 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.779
 so that it is very nice so that 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:06.520
 look like you're winning a good game 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:08.979
 I do not know there are ideas that you can think of 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.699
 with these macabre liquids that we have 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.979
 around here then well before 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.409
 finish we will go through all the 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:24.449
 fluids to see how many effects are achieved 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:24.449
 accumulate the poison however 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:29.560
 nothing else will not go through the liquid 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:31.340
 black because I would die then 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.740
 tourism people 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.699
 today how many effects if I get to diego 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.699
 as 2000 effects 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.350
 there are people 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.160
 I have two I have two I can 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.160
 do it I'm sure I can do it 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.110
 okay those are like 200 effects 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.420
 accumulated and here we have a rabah 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.420
 invisible and drunk and I do not know what 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.100
 this mod of today we die 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.770
 today closed it has been killed by magic 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.300
