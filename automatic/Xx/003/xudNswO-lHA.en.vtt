00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:02.620
 track where as promised done 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.010
 guidelines for making this 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:05.540
 here 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.630
 ceramic tiles 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.969
 device for 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.279
 gave vodka with a knife remove the tile 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.279
 pre tempting money 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.880
 nuland and pre 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.769
 wetted bar but minsk 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.769
 coarse grained 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.230
 all irregularities 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.279
 Well, we will not 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:31.449
 waste time 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.090
 cooking should turn out here 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.670
 so we have 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.350
 peak 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.350
 with rum 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.920
 surface 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.870
 already polished 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.250
 by the same 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.250
 to teens 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.510
 you can do and put some 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.000
 which one 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.970
 all this with water machine 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.840
 keeps well 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.300
 if one hand tires 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.250
 maintain several years 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.250
 what can you do some trick 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.330
 the same cell 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.150
 polished 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.300
 means further action such 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.580
 take the night 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.100
 but now he 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.100
 exactly 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.280
 however 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.290
 Poland 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.680
 look at their surface 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.680
 Ign sat here such design 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.210
 tile surface is constantly wetted 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.510
 spend 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.520
 planning 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.880
 match match cube 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.840
 but with one hand it's not very comfortable 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.030
 to shoot 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.330
 and show in principle clear 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.430
 that's when it comes 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.620
 traces of metal 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.620
 on the tile we also have on they appeared 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:11.339
 these are all reasons for prices 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.339
 water can be wiped with a cloth 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:16.419
 fk news 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:19.019
 in general, I will not show the final 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:19.749
 result 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.589
 because you still need tweaking at 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.139
 belt if you choose and did on this tile 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.679
 can be used 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:30.299
 as small for finishing 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.419
 next edge 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.370
 at no cost, with a capacity of 1 million
