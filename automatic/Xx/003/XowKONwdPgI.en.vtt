00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.040
 More than 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:39.869
 It is blood phase strength It is big that the unity strength is strong after all 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.820

 It is a 20-pound using now as a rut length of the c premium max is 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.750
 that 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.380
 Not easy to assemble, so the characteristic is that knots on that side are easy to assemble 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.550
 is 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.920
