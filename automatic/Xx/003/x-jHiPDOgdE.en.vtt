another lego tutorial and this is how to
make<00:00:23.529> a<00:00:23.800> lego<00:00:24.279> turret<00:00:24.730> and<00:00:25.439> primarily<00:00:26.439> this

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
make a lego turret and primarily this

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.890 
make a lego turret and primarily this
would<00:00:26.860> be<00:00:26.980> for<00:00:27.220> Star<00:00:27.670> Wars<00:00:27.700> figures<00:00:28.180> but<00:00:28.779> you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
would be for Star Wars figures but you

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.019 
would be for Star Wars figures but you
can<00:00:29.050> use<00:00:29.259> it<00:00:29.439> for<00:00:29.560> any<00:00:29.740> lego<00:00:30.160> theme<00:00:30.550> that<00:00:30.939> you

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
can use it for any lego theme that you

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.490 
can use it for any lego theme that you
would<00:00:31.119> like<00:00:31.949> alright<00:00:32.949> so<00:00:33.460> let's<00:00:34.150> get<00:00:34.360> in<00:00:34.500> to

sets but yeah so I can get these pieces

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.950 
sets but yeah so I can get these pieces
off<00:01:01.930> there<00:01:02.170> we<00:01:02.290> go<00:01:06.420> these<00:01:07.420> are<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.750> pieces

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
off there we go these are the pieces

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:16.170 
off there we go these are the pieces
that<00:01:08.350> you'll<00:01:08.500> need<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.740> build<00:01:11.890> this<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:16.030> we

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
that you'll need to build this there we

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.320 
that you'll need to build this there we
go<00:01:16.330> alright<00:01:17.260> so<00:01:17.409> first<00:01:17.950> you<00:01:18.580> start<00:01:18.729> this<00:01:19.090> piece

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
go alright so first you start this piece

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.620 
go alright so first you start this piece
and<00:01:19.540> this<00:01:19.659> is<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:20.130> less<00:01:21.130> common<00:01:21.610> piece<00:01:24.630> see

focus it there we go
I've<00:01:32.230> seen<00:01:32.500> it<00:01:32.650> used<00:01:32.800> in<00:01:32.950> some<00:01:33.190> sets<00:01:33.460> as<00:01:33.610> an

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
I've seen it used in some sets as an

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.410 
I've seen it used in some sets as an
engine<00:01:34.240> it<00:01:34.510> is<00:01:35.020> used<00:01:35.500> in<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.730> battle<00:01:37.120> and

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
engine it is used in the battle and

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.840 
engine it is used in the battle and
older<00:01:37.750> battle<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.140> Hoth<00:01:38.290> set<00:01:38.760> for<00:01:39.760> this

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
older battle of the Hoth set for this

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.490 
older battle of the Hoth set for this
turret<00:01:40.180> it's<00:01:40.600> kind<00:01:40.780> of<00:01:40.840> where<00:01:40.930> I<00:01:40.960> got<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.230> idea

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
turret it's kind of where I got the idea

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.300 
turret it's kind of where I got the idea
of<00:01:41.560> this<00:01:41.710> turret<00:01:41.920> from<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.780> uh<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:45.070> piece

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
of this turret from but uh this piece

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.340 
of this turret from but uh this piece
I'm<00:01:45.520> not<00:01:45.730> really<00:01:45.909> sure<00:01:46.120> to<00:01:46.270> describe<00:01:46.570> it<00:01:46.870> this

because there's four I guess you could
say<00:05:22.310> like<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.520> quad<00:05:22.880> pot<00:05:23.210> or<00:05:23.360> something<00:05:23.750> you<00:05:24.590> can

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
say like a quad pot or something you can

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.279 
say like a quad pot or something you can
take<00:05:24.919> one<00:05:25.130> of<00:05:25.160> these<00:05:25.430> off<00:05:25.699> if<00:05:25.910> you<00:05:26.000> want<00:05:26.289> works

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
take one of these off if you want works

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.770 
take one of these off if you want works
both<00:05:27.530> ways<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.389> you're<00:05:29.389> just<00:05:29.539> going<00:05:29.720> to

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
both ways and you're just going to

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.980 
both ways and you're just going to
attach<00:05:30.080> it<00:05:30.669> so<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:33.699> opening<00:05:34.699> closest<00:05:35.270> to<00:05:35.840> the

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
attach it so the opening closest to the

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.120 
attach it so the opening closest to the
barrel<00:05:36.560> of<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:37.180> turret<00:05:38.180> is<00:05:38.710> where<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:39.830> stud

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
barrel of the turret is where the stud

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:46.990 
barrel of the turret is where the stud
from<00:05:41.090> the<00:05:41.410> stand<00:05:42.410> goes<00:05:43.060> and<00:05:45.669> there<00:05:46.669> you<00:05:46.820> have

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
from the stand goes and there you have

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.370 
from the stand goes and there you have
it

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
it

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.790 
it
and<00:05:48.380> you<00:05:48.500> can<00:05:48.680> raise<00:05:48.919> the<00:05:50.470> lovers<00:05:51.470> a<00:05:51.500> little

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
and you can raise the lovers a little

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.230 
and you can raise the lovers a little
bit<00:05:51.949> so<00:05:52.370> it's<00:05:52.490> a<00:05:52.550> little<00:05:52.699> bit<00:05:52.909> off<00:05:53.030> the<00:05:53.060> ground

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
bit so it's a little bit off the ground

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.460 
bit so it's a little bit off the ground
and<00:05:53.710> there<00:05:54.710> you<00:05:54.830> have<00:05:54.919> your<00:05:54.949> turret<00:05:56.320> and<00:05:57.320> you

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
and there you have your turret and you

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.810 
and there you have your turret and you
can<00:05:57.650> take<00:05:57.830> your<00:05:58.010> clone<00:05:58.370> or<00:06:00.370> whatever<00:06:01.370> your

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820

can take your clone or whatever your
military<00:06:02.360> figure<00:06:02.750> and<00:06:03.460> then<00:06:04.460> you<00:06:04.580> just<00:06:05.080> put

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
military figure and then you just put

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.529
