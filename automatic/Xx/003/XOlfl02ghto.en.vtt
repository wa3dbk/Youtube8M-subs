00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello to you all and time 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.719
 welcome for this new video no 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.099
 not on call of duty not for a 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.830
 commander harrie over a gameplay 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.570
 but for a little analysis in 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.310
 few minutes of the first trailer 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.619
 of assassin's creed iv who has been fleeing since 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.119
 ubisoft ubi soft did not reveal 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.380
 officially so it's really a 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.449
 I do not know at all how 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.220
 happened on their side really needs to 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.820
 not ask me then assassin's creed 4 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.260
 black flag this will be the full name of the game 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.610
 black flag which means black flag in 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.989
 French so black flag that we 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.660
 evokes of course the pirates 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.040
 so we will embody edwards who help us 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.360
 who is the father of the tam quesnoy who 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.129
 himself is the father of connor so 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.860
 our protagonist of assassin's creed 3 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.800
 the game will happen in 1715 so at all 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.309
 early eighteenth so about 70 years old 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.780
 after before forgiveness the 3 the novelties 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.160
 so what we know is that we can 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.570
 already having two swords is a 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.559
 first in assassin's creed 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.719
 since she has until now 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.850
 always had a sword and a tomahawk 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.870
 finally thomas august sorry but we could 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.190
 Never before both at the same time there 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.090
 we can have two sabers at the same time 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.129
 time as we have seen 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.710
 we can also wear four 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.299
 pistols maybe more we do not know of 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.700
 for example at the belt and two on the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.590
 chest as we have seen the game itself 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.930
 will pass exclusively at sea so I 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.939
 admits to you right now displays both 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.770
 maps so the map of google maps 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.799
 today and the amap of the game there is 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.299
 frankly nothing to say the resemblance 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.950
 is more than striking there is more than 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.360
 doubt possible the game will go well 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.700
 so in the Caribbean on the side of the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.290
 havana of haiti jamaica is just 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.119
 south of florida so florida which 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.650
 is of course in the united states maybe 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.180
 that there will be a link with the 3 maybe 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.079
 we do not know anyway between 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.220
 assassin's creed have to be well they have 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.630
 a little link somewhere 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.430
 maybe that will be all 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.960
 beginning of the American Revolution 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.370
 that may be a trigger 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.110
 something I do not know we'll see 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.420
 anyway but in my opinion will have a 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.340
 little link on that side the game is 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.490
 will go exclusively to sea what wants 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.590
 say we will have h24 our boat which 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.080
 may well be that we will be able to 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.450
 So wander throughout all Caribbean 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.320
 here we go around the island 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.130
 tour of the islands etc 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.869
 given the size of the map 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.539
 I think we'll have something to do 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.410
 have fun we can also swim under 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.180
 water that's also a big 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.530
 novelty we could not up 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.940
 now we could just under the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.530
 surface could not really go to 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.269
 bottom of the water so we can 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.709
 maybe to recover kind of 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.930
 treasures you know there have been feathers 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.370
 and it is in brotherhood and everything out there 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.019
 we may be able to recover small 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.180
 stuff that at the bottom of the water so 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.620
 it could be nice 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.780
 it's not impossible at all here 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.000
 could be interesting also the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.510
 juice will be released on October 29 on pc 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.519
 ps3 xbox 360 and ps 4 and yes or also 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.470
 to forget to tell the lobby often 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.849
 this wiiu the xbox 720 not being 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.940
 announced it has not been announced yet 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.750
 on the game and then that's okay listen 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.489
 I think we went around 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.599
 if I have other information I wanted 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.670
 I will share it with you in the next 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.319
 I'm from the gamer by then so I'll get you 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.239
 wish a very good end of the day 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.160
 a good holiday for those who are 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.810
 still do not forget the little like 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.280
 habitual that makes so much pleasure as well as 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.269
 the little comment I say to very 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.470

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.980
