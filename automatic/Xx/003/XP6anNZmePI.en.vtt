00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
these out of each material and then

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.470 
these out of each material and then
place<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.250> beacon<00:00:32.669> right<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.030> middle<00:00:33.239> and

place a beacon right in the middle and

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.240 
place a beacon right in the middle and
once<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.170> do<00:00:34.290> place<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> beacon<00:00:35.010> around<00:00:35.190> the

once you do place a beacon around the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.830 
once you do place a beacon around the
middle<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.640> going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> shoot<00:00:36.420> up<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:36.630> that

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
and we can actually have faster speed

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.329 
and we can actually have faster speed
now<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.019> cool<00:01:04.320> thing<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.920> thing<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.100> does

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
now the cool thing the thing that does

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.859 
now the cool thing the thing that does
like<00:01:05.460> about<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.880> though<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.060> if<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.479> do<00:01:06.630> go<00:01:06.750> out

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
like about it though is if you do go out

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.050 
like about it though is if you do go out
of<00:01:06.960> range<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.560> end<00:01:08.369> up<00:01:08.430> going<00:01:08.520> back<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.880> just

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
of range you end up going back to just

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.670 
of range you end up going back to just
regular<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.630> once<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.930> get<00:01:10.049> closer<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.530> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
regular so once you get closer to it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.710 
regular so once you get closer to it
your<00:01:11.280> speed<00:01:11.549> into<00:01:11.790> precreasing<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.390> little<00:01:12.600> bit

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
your speed into precreasing a little bit

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.070 
your speed into precreasing a little bit
more<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.260> yeah<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.630> cool<00:01:15.869> thing<00:01:16.049> about

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
more and yeah so the cool thing about

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.690 
more and yeah so the cool thing about
this<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.950> lot<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.369> beacons

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
this if you have a lot of like beacons

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.399 
this if you have a lot of like beacons
kind<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.030> close<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.330> each<00:01:18.420> other<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:19.200> run

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
kind of close to each other you can run

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.530 
kind of close to each other you can run
to<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.770> unlimited<00:01:20.040> speed<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.610> well<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.030> then

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
to like unlimited speed as well and then

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.789 
to like unlimited speed as well and then
once<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.930> start<00:01:21.990> building<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.560> little<00:01:22.680> bit

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
once you start building a little bit

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.800 
once you start building a little bit
bigger<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.460> see<00:01:23.640> right<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.750> is

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
bigger as you can see right here this is

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.630 
bigger as you can see right here this is
a<00:01:24.930> 5x5<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.710> then<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> pyramid

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
a 5x5 and then it's like a pyramid

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.700 
a 5x5 and then it's like a pyramid
obviously<00:01:27.119> go<00:01:27.240> back<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> 3x3<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.290> then

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
obviously go back to the 3x3 and then

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.410 
obviously go back to the 3x3 and then
put<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> beacon<00:01:29.159> right<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.490> middle<00:01:29.670> you

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
put a beacon right in the middle you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.990 
put a beacon right in the middle you
have<00:01:30.630> even<00:01:30.990> more<00:01:31.020> powers<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.619> have

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
have even more powers you have

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.100 
have even more powers you have
resistance<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.270> then<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> jump

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
resistance and then you have the jump

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
resistance and then you have the jump
boost<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.650> back<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> same<00:01:35.310> speed<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
boost and back to the same speed and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.700 
boost and back to the same speed and
haste<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.210> once<00:01:36.720> again<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.409> want<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.619> go

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
haste and once again you want to go

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.350 
haste and once again you want to go
ahead<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.189> put<00:01:38.549> either<00:01:38.670> an<00:01:38.850> emerald<00:01:39.240> diamond

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
ahead and put either an emerald diamond

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
ahead and put either an emerald diamond
whatever<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.020> click<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> check<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.130> then

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
whatever it is click the check and then

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.819 
whatever it is click the check and then
you'll<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.570> whatever<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.409> end<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.590> choosing

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
you'll have whatever you end up choosing

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.710 
you'll have whatever you end up choosing
and<00:01:44.100> obviously<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.549> bigger<00:01:44.729> they<00:01:44.909> are<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
and obviously the bigger they are the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.960 
and obviously the bigger they are the
higher<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.530> range<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.130> these<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
higher the range is for these so the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.370 
higher the range is for these so the
cool<00:01:48.149> thing<00:01:48.329> about<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.960> can't<00:01:49.290> really

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
cool thing about this so I can't really

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.770 
cool thing about this so I can't really
get<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.649> horse<00:01:49.860> right<00:01:50.040> now<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.659> have

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
get the horse right now but if you have

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.569 
get the horse right now but if you have
like<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> boost<00:01:52.920> or<00:01:53.070> whatever<00:01:53.340> once

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
like a like the boost or whatever once

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.370 
like a like the boost or whatever once
you<00:01:53.759> or<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> jump<00:01:54.509> booster<00:01:54.810> whatever<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.229> is

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
you or the jump booster whatever it is

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.020 
you or the jump booster whatever it is
your<00:01:55.829> horse<00:01:56.070> ends<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:56.369> also<00:01:56.490> jumping<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:57.000> well

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
your horse ends up also jumping as well

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.600 
your horse ends up also jumping as well
and<00:01:57.420> one<00:01:58.409> thing<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.829> also<00:01:58.979> notice<00:01:59.430> is

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
and one thing you have to also notice is

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.219 
and one thing you have to also notice is
that<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.180> hollow<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.110> to

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that it can be hollow so you have to

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.410 
that it can be hollow so you have to
actually<00:02:01.439> fill<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.250> here<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.549> that's

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
actually fill it in like here so that's

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.340 
actually fill it in like here so that's
something<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.960> kind<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.259> know

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
something you have to kind of you know

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.080 
something you have to kind of you know
be<00:02:04.979> consistent<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.579> doesn't<00:02:05.790> matter<00:02:05.939> what

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
be consistent but it doesn't matter what

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.330 
be consistent but it doesn't matter what
one<00:02:06.899> material<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:07.979> as<00:02:08.129> long<00:02:08.310> as

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
one material it is so but as long as

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.729 
one material it is so but as long as
it's<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.910> know<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.569> same<00:02:09.840> as<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.500> can<00:02:10.619> see

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
it's a you know the same as you can see

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.290 
it's a you know the same as you can see
goes<00:02:10.920> up<00:02:11.069> he<00:02:11.250> has<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.459> be<00:02:11.640> all<00:02:11.760> filled<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.120> as

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
goes up he has to be all filled in as

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.730 
goes up he has to be all filled in as
well

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
well

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.950 
well
and<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:13.160> know<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.340> bigger<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:14.210> go<00:02:14.450> obviously

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
and you know the bigger you go obviously

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.810 
and you know the bigger you go obviously
I<00:02:14.990> end<00:02:15.170> up<00:02:15.260> getting<00:02:15.560> more<00:02:15.710> powers<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.760> all

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
I end up getting more powers and all

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.520 
I end up getting more powers and all
that<00:02:17.030> now<00:02:17.210> you<00:02:17.270> have<00:02:17.510> strength<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.260> then<00:02:18.440> you

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
that now you have strength and then you

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.690 
that now you have strength and then you
can<00:02:18.680> go<00:02:18.770> ahead<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.010> get<00:02:19.100> jumpers<00:02:19.550> as<00:02:19.670> a

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
can go ahead and get jumpers as a

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.520 
can go ahead and get jumpers as a
secondary<00:02:20.210> and<00:02:20.510> then<00:02:20.960> you<00:02:21.020> can<00:02:21.140> go<00:02:21.230> ahead<00:02:21.350> and

secondary and then you can go ahead and

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.590 
secondary and then you can go ahead and
