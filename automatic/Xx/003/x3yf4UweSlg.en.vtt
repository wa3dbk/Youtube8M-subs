00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 thinking 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.770
 it has already proven to be a smart phone that plagues you 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.740
 hunger 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.809
 you're done 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.769
 wakefield to make the call 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.489
 elieser anamara is doing 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:17.869
 This is a problem that allows doctors and is not on the internet and 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.320
 various 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.539
 the blog says that it has already been reported by many users 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.640
 nobody leaves on the right bail 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.689
 He said that she ate justified 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.669
 I went to change the chips 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.070
 It worked for a few days. 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.370
 this device was purchased in ct month ago already passed 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.830
 four months ago in technical assistance in the guaranteed but next 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.010
 every time I go there they speak that I do not dedicate myself defect to updating the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.610
 software back 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.540
 some days have begun to an intermittent defect 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.490
 this happens any number that colleague 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.500
 the only way to get back to working once is to turn off the side pear 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.940
 I'll put on airplane mode turn on and off 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.940
 only it's not possible that you have to do this all the time 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.730
 and even then he just makes a mysterious call back to give a problem 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.200
 when I proposed ipec works for a few days after it can give 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.120
 problem 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.800
 that's why they have technical assistance, they say they did not 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.670
 problem 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.100
 click here consumer ic 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.800
 qf her fight with the bike in the 20 years is then is the key of the type of order 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.720
 because I'm sending a device 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.720
 those who have no defect but what is done here 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.860
 black on white here is another thing by the way the smart phones from 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.380
 motorola 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.740
 because he does everything except to speak 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.140
 It's a shame because it's an all-in-one device 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.100
 very good workmanship 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.570
 but maintaining the shape 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.590
 Too late 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.510
 is that the df is from birth 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.210
 Is it proof that I already count on this? I hope so, that I would like 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.450
 keep on using and if the motorola itself does not have its reputation 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.640
 was a hidden defect 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.979
 and this is good but it prevents the main function of the device to call
