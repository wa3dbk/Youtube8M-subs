very useful installation guide now
you're<00:00:29.839> going<00:00:29.960> to<00:00:30.019> need<00:00:30.140> to<00:00:30.289> get<00:00:30.439> this<00:00:30.560> out<00:00:31.220> and

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
you're going to need to get this out and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.100 
you're going to need to get this out and
lay<00:00:31.789> it<00:00:31.849> on<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.090> table<00:00:32.300> so<00:00:32.570> that<00:00:32.900> you<00:00:32.960> know

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
lay it on the table so that you know

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.240 
lay it on the table so that you know
what<00:00:33.290> you're<00:00:33.440> doing<00:00:33.940> now<00:00:35.530> this<00:00:36.530> machine<00:00:36.770> has

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
what you're doing now this machine has

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.900 
what you're doing now this machine has
two<00:00:37.609> paper<00:00:37.940> outputs<00:00:38.570> this<00:00:38.960> is<00:00:39.289> a<00:00:39.350> separator<00:00:40.129> so

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
two paper outputs this is a separator so

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.090 
two paper outputs this is a separator so
that<00:00:41.480> you've<00:00:41.780> got<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.079> bottom<00:00:42.500> output<00:00:42.859> tray

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
that you've got the bottom output tray

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.310 
that you've got the bottom output tray
and<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.789> top<00:00:43.969> output<00:00:44.390> tray<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:44.660> we'll<00:00:44.930> put

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
and the top output tray so we'll put

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.299 
and the top output tray so we'll put
that<00:00:45.350> on<00:00:45.469> in<00:00:45.710> a<00:00:45.769> second

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
that on in a second

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.930 
that on in a second
let's<00:00:46.820> pop<00:00:47.030> up<00:00:47.180> there<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:49.190> four<00:00:49.429> toner

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
let's pop up there and the four toner

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.819 
let's pop up there and the four toner
cartridges<00:00:50.629> which<00:00:51.109> we're<00:00:51.350> just<00:00:51.500> going<00:00:51.649> to<00:00:51.679> lay

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
cartridges which we're just going to lay

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:59.709 
cartridges which we're just going to lay
down<00:00:52.129> in<00:00:52.670> from<00:00:52.879> some<00:00:53.090> machine<00:00:58.329> let's<00:00:59.329> get<00:00:59.539> rid

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
down in from some machine let's get rid

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.790 
down in from some machine let's get rid
of<00:00:59.750> our<00:00:59.960> Sun<00:01:00.530> in<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.710> polystyrene<00:01:02.679> okay<00:01:03.679> the

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
of our Sun in the polystyrene okay the

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.290 
of our Sun in the polystyrene okay the
first<00:01:03.920> thing<00:01:04.160> we're<00:01:04.280> going<00:01:04.370> to<00:01:04.430> do<00:01:04.610> is<00:01:04.850> take

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
first thing we're going to do is take

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.620 
first thing we're going to do is take
off<00:01:05.480> all<00:01:05.660> this<00:01:06.140> sticky<00:01:06.410> tape<00:01:06.970> this<00:01:07.970> just<00:01:08.270> stops

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
off all this sticky tape this just stops

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.950 
off all this sticky tape this just stops
things<00:01:09.439> getting<00:01:09.770> loose<00:01:09.979> as<00:01:10.310> it's<00:01:10.759> coming<00:01:11.750> to

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
things getting loose as it's coming to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:26.210 
things getting loose as it's coming to
you<00:01:12.170> on<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:13.210> koreas<00:01:14.210> vehicle<00:01:14.720> so

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.440 

as<00:01:27.220> you<00:01:27.340> probably<00:01:27.550> can<00:01:27.790> see<00:01:27.850> it's<00:01:28.180> quite<00:01:28.330> a

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
as you probably can see it's quite a

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.290 
as you probably can see it's quite a
large<00:01:28.840> machine<00:01:29.320> so<00:01:29.800> you<00:01:30.070> need<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.120> make<00:01:31.270> sure

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
large machine so you need to make sure

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.030 
large machine so you need to make sure
you've<00:01:31.600> got<00:01:31.630> access<00:01:32.140> all<00:01:32.320> around<00:01:32.650> it<00:01:32.890> while

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
you've got access all around it while

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:41.880 
you've got access all around it while
you're<00:01:33.220> doing<00:01:33.460> this<00:01:40.380> there<00:01:41.380> we<00:01:41.470> go<00:01:41.620> we'll<00:01:41.740> just

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
you're doing this there we go we'll just

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.270 
you're doing this there we go we'll just
throw<00:01:42.100> them<00:01:42.310> in<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.730> bin<00:01:43.980> okay

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
throw them in the bin okay

00:01:45.280 --> 00:02:06.420 
throw them in the bin okay
so<00:01:45.670> let's<00:01:46.060> connect<00:01:46.600> this<00:01:46.780> up<00:01:47.020> first<00:02:05.220> okay<00:02:06.220> this

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
so let's connect this up first okay this

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.250 
so let's connect this up first okay this
point<00:02:06.880> I<00:02:07.060> think<00:02:07.120> what<00:02:07.450> I'll<00:02:07.570> do<00:02:07.720> is<00:02:07.750> refer<00:02:08.230> to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
point I think what I'll do is refer to

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:20.220 
point I think what I'll do is refer to
the<00:02:08.590> instruction<00:02:09.130> manual<00:02:17.550> okay<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:19.420> as<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
the instruction manual okay so as the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.440 
the instruction manual okay so as the
thought<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.980> just<00:02:21.670> have<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.030> figure<00:02:22.210> out

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
thought you just have to figure out

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.570 
thought you just have to figure out
where<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.900> slots<00:02:23.530> are<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:25.950> there<00:02:26.950> we<00:02:27.040> go<00:02:27.220> that

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
where the slots are and there we go that

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.400 
where the slots are and there we go that
was<00:02:27.670> was<00:02:28.540> actually<00:02:28.840> been<00:02:28.959> easier<00:02:29.260> than

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
was was actually been easier than

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.820 
was was actually been easier than
expected<00:02:29.740> there<00:02:30.220> we<00:02:30.340> go<00:02:31.440> make<00:02:32.440> sure<00:02:32.620> yeah

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
expected there we go make sure yeah

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.290 
expected there we go make sure yeah
that's<00:02:33.040> definitely<00:02:33.250> in<00:02:38.640> let's<00:02:39.640> remove<00:02:39.940> that

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
that's definitely in let's remove that

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.890 
that's definitely in let's remove that
bit<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:40.900> sticky<00:02:41.380> tape<00:02:44.550> okay<00:02:45.550> so<00:02:45.910> wasn't<00:02:46.660> quite

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
bit of sticky tape okay so wasn't quite

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.740 
bit of sticky tape okay so wasn't quite
in<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.230> order<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.620> tells<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.070> do<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.459> but

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
in the order it tells you to do it but

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.300 
in the order it tells you to do it but
it<00:02:49.750> doesn't<00:02:50.050> make<00:02:50.260> much<00:02:50.470> difference<00:02:50.500> at<00:02:51.220> this

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
it doesn't make much difference at this

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.380 
it doesn't make much difference at this
stage<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:51.880> let's<00:02:52.000> just<00:02:52.360> take<00:02:52.570> this<00:02:52.720> that's<00:02:53.709> the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
stage so let's just take this that's the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.650 
stage so let's just take this that's the
side<00:02:55.390> input<00:02:55.870> tray<00:02:56.650> let's<00:02:57.040> just<00:02:57.280> take<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.760> rest

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
side input tray let's just take the rest

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.610 
side input tray let's just take the rest
of<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.870> sticky<00:02:59.110> bits<00:02:59.350> off<00:03:02.370> right<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.840> when<00:03:05.470> we

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
of the sticky bits off right so when we

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.270 
of the sticky bits off right so when we
open<00:03:05.920> this<00:03:06.100> this<00:03:06.880> is<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.360> fuser<00:03:07.980> here<00:03:08.980> now

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
open this this is the fuser here now

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.500 
open this this is the fuser here now
there<00:03:09.430> will<00:03:09.520> be<00:03:09.580> another<00:03:09.880> video<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.480> goes

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
there will be another video that goes

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.510 
there will be another video that goes
through<00:03:10.930> all<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.230> ins<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.530> outs<00:03:11.709> so<00:03:12.010> there's

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
through all the ins and outs so there's

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.430 
through all the ins and outs so there's
a<00:03:12.550> little<00:03:12.790> label<00:03:13.300> here<00:03:13.630> that<00:03:13.780> tells<00:03:14.020> you<00:03:14.260> that

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
a little label here that tells you that

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.350 
a little label here that tells you that
I<00:03:14.500> need<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.950> pull<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:17.040> hopefully<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:19.120> will

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
I need to pull and hopefully this will

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.470 
I need to pull and hopefully this will
come<00:03:19.570> off<00:03:19.750> quite<00:03:20.320> easily<00:03:20.910> there<00:03:21.910> we<00:03:22.090> go

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
come off quite easily there we go

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.050 
come off quite easily there we go
so<00:03:22.690> just<00:03:22.930> throw<00:03:23.080> that<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.410> bin

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.360 

okay<00:03:29.060> we'll<00:03:29.210> close<00:03:29.450> up<00:03:29.750> there<00:03:31.990> and<00:03:33.310> now<00:03:34.310> we

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
okay we'll close up there and now we

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.730 
okay we'll close up there and now we
come<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.240> where<00:03:35.569> we<00:03:35.780> load<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.140> toners<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.680> do

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
come to where we load the toners I do

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.740 
come to where we load the toners I do
know<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.340> little<00:03:37.700> bit<00:03:37.970> about<00:03:38.180> this<00:03:38.390> machine

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
know a little bit about this machine

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.980 
know a little bit about this machine
obviously<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.620> that's<00:03:40.090> how<00:03:41.090> this<00:03:41.480> says<00:03:41.750> though

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
obviously so that's how this says though

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.840 
obviously so that's how this says though
right<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:42.650> this<00:03:42.800> is<00:03:42.980> just<00:03:43.130> telling<00:03:43.490> me<00:03:43.610> that<00:03:43.640> I

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
right so this is just telling me that I

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.380 
right so this is just telling me that I
need<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.180> pull<00:03:44.650> this<00:03:45.650> locking<00:03:46.220> pin<00:03:46.940> out<00:03:47.150> so

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
need to pull this locking pin out so

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.350 
need to pull this locking pin out so
there<00:03:47.570> we<00:03:47.690> go<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:48.730> that's<00:03:49.730> it<00:03:49.910> just<00:03:49.940> throw

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
there we go and that's it just throw

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.040 
there we go and that's it just throw
that<00:03:50.510> in<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.690> bin<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:52.390> we<00:03:53.390> just<00:03:53.570> need<00:03:53.690> to<00:03:53.810> put

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
that in the bin and we just need to put

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.190 
that in the bin and we just need to put
the<00:03:54.170> toners<00:03:54.590> in<00:03:54.739> so<00:03:55.360> quite<00:03:56.360> obviously<00:03:56.870> this<00:03:56.989> is

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
the toners in so quite obviously this is

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.990 
the toners in so quite obviously this is
the<00:03:57.319> yellow<00:03:57.650> cone<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.100> cartridge<00:03:58.580> but<00:03:58.730> if<00:03:58.880> you

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
the yellow cone the cartridge but if you

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.479 
the yellow cone the cartridge but if you
not<00:03:59.750> sure<00:04:00.020> it's<00:04:00.290> got<00:04:00.440> a<00:04:00.620> color<00:04:00.890> code<00:04:01.190> on<00:04:01.400> the

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
not sure it's got a color code on the

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:08.280 
not sure it's got a color code on the
end<00:04:01.640> of<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.880> cartridge<00:04:04.300> there<00:04:05.300> for<00:04:05.570> now<00:04:05.690> so

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:37.390 

very<00:04:09.290> easy<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.250> do<00:04:16.090> magenta<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.970> cyan<00:04:36.400> finally

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
very easy to do magenta and cyan finally

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.360 
very easy to do magenta and cyan finally
the<00:04:37.850> black<00:04:38.120> now<00:04:38.360> you<00:04:38.419> will<00:04:38.630> notice<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:40.190> black

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
the black now you will notice the black

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.440 
the black now you will notice the black
cartridge<00:04:41.030> is<00:04:41.270> quite<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.660> lot<00:04:41.900> larger<00:04:46.270> there<00:04:47.270> we

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
cartridge is quite a lot larger there we

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.950 
cartridge is quite a lot larger there we
go<00:04:47.630> I<00:04:47.840> believe<00:04:48.320> that's<00:04:48.710> everything<00:04:49.370> but<00:04:49.960> let's

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
go I believe that's everything but let's

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.990 
go I believe that's everything but let's
just<00:04:51.260> double<00:04:51.620> check<00:04:55.570> with<00:04:56.570> me<00:04:56.780> while<00:04:56.990> I<00:04:57.020> just

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
just double check with me while I just

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.820 
just double check with me while I just
write<00:04:59.000> yes<00:04:59.570> so<00:04:59.810> that<00:04:59.990> just<00:05:00.260> needs<00:05:00.440> locking

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
write yes so that just needs locking

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.969 
write yes so that just needs locking
down<00:05:01.040> there<00:05:01.840> and<00:05:02.840> there<00:05:03.350> we<00:05:03.440> go<00:05:03.560> let<00:05:03.740> me<00:05:03.800> just

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
down there and there we go let me just

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.680 
down there and there we go let me just
see<00:05:04.190> if<00:05:04.340> we've<00:05:04.550> got<00:05:04.820> everything<00:05:05.090> done<00:05:05.510> and

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
see if we've got everything done and

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.960 
see if we've got everything done and
dusted

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.939 

okay<00:05:13.970> I<00:05:14.150> think<00:05:14.479> we're<00:05:14.599> now<00:05:14.720> ready<00:05:14.900> to<00:05:15.440> plug<00:05:15.919> the

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949 
okay I think we're now ready to plug the

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.249 
okay I think we're now ready to plug the
machine<00:05:16.129> in<00:05:16.810> okay<00:05:17.810> we're<00:05:17.990> now<00:05:18.050> going<00:05:18.199> to

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
machine in okay we're now going to

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.680 
machine in okay we're now going to
switch<00:05:18.379> the<00:05:18.650> machine<00:05:18.949> on<00:05:19.190> so<00:05:19.580> before<00:05:20.180> we<00:05:20.270> do<00:05:20.389> so

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
switch the machine on so before we do so

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.300 
switch the machine on so before we do so
just<00:05:20.900> go<00:05:21.050> check<00:05:21.259> that<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.530> tray<00:05:21.830> haven't<00:05:22.220> got

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
just go check that the tray haven't got

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.770 
just go check that the tray haven't got
anything<00:05:22.490> in<00:05:22.729> it<00:05:22.819> which<00:05:22.970> it<00:05:23.120> does<00:05:23.330> have<00:05:23.569> so

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
anything in it which it does have so

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:36.520 
anything in it which it does have so
let's<00:05:23.960> take<00:05:24.169> those<00:05:24.349> out<00:05:24.560> now<00:05:34.629> okay<00:05:35.629> the<00:05:36.020> main

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
let's take those out now okay the main

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.629 
let's take those out now okay the main
power<00:05:37.009> switch<00:05:37.220> is<00:05:37.520> located<00:05:37.690> under<00:05:38.690> this<00:05:38.930> lid

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
power switch is located under this lid

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.339 
power switch is located under this lid
turn<00:05:40.639> that<00:05:40.789> on<00:05:40.940> and<00:05:41.090> this<00:05:41.360> is<00:05:41.419> the<00:05:41.720> soft<00:05:42.020> power

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
turn that on and this is the soft power

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:49.480 
turn that on and this is the soft power
switch<00:05:47.379> the<00:05:48.379> reason<00:05:48.680> for<00:05:48.800> the<00:05:48.919> soft<00:05:49.190> power

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
switch the reason for the soft power

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.800 
switch the reason for the soft power
switch<00:05:49.759> is<00:05:49.969> when<00:05:50.120> you<00:05:50.240> want<00:05:50.389> to<00:05:50.449> turn<00:05:50.659> the

switch is when you want to turn the
Machine<00:05:51.110> off<00:05:51.259> if<00:05:51.889> you<00:05:52.069> just<00:05:52.310> turn<00:05:52.490> it<00:05:52.520> off

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
Machine off if you just turn it off

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.909 
Machine off if you just turn it off

using the soft power switch it actually

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.279 
using the soft power switch it actually
turns<00:05:55.190> it<00:05:55.400> off<00:05:55.550> more<00:05:56.210> gently<00:05:56.810> than<00:05:56.840> actually

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
turns it off more gently than actually

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.200 
turns it off more gently than actually

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
turning the main power off which just

00:05:59.210 --> 00:07:07.770 
turning the main power off which just
cuts<00:05:59.569> the<00:05:59.690> parallel<00:06:00.139> together

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:07.780 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.900 

okay<00:07:08.530> because<00:07:08.680> this<00:07:08.920> is<00:07:08.980> a<00:07:09.100> page<00:07:09.340> PAP<00:07:09.580> machine

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:09.910 
okay because this is a page PAP machine

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.060
