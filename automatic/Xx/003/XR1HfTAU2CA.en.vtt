00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.629
 this is the big whole debate 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.919
 we hear buys real estate then belong 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.660
 on the one hand much too expensive 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.160
 everything makes no sense so what are we doing in 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.139
 the moment we go somewhere else 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.910
 to do so with the real estate 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.650
 is the german darling kind but 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.510
 you have to really disenchanted times 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.580
 the theme is not the money 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.470
 river age where i buy myself now 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.119
 a house I live in there and that is 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.920
 That's why I do not have that great 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.570
 rented free in the old age is a great 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.640
 investment forget about the nonsense 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.439
 Break that is a huge money the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.700
 it incredible amount of money it cost them 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.590
 can not guess what 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.960
 there's something going on about repairs 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.820
 Homes can lose value if they 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.160
 have a new house today that's great 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.840
 Modern in 15 20 years it is an old one 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.460
 box that is no longer state and says 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.079
 because hardly anyone bought it for 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.250
 reasonable price and the ticos 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.050
 ceiling as perhaps not in it 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.730
 so now they have made it 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.469
 the thing is the number you have heaps 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.690
 this is me half a million 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.219
 value class you are now in pension what 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.750
 do they sell the house are 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.520
 Shawn position on vacation 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.379
 Build two windows out as a car 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.760
 they have nothing to repair 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.619
 the money you can not use 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.840
 on the contrary now come the big ones 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.340
 cost you to because nothing with rent-free 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.659
 as has now made it roof 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.520
 are now leaking into the windows 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.530
 now comes the heating and all the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.600
 go with high the call landlords 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.220
 By the way, the heating does not work 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.450
 drive more with your family beautiful 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.610
 holidays when they come back all in 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.560
 order so rent is not that 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 most common and all 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.040
 Statistics say that people are in 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.689
 Rent is even easier 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.329
 can come as people who are on property 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.890
 tree and woe things go awry like it 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.720
 a divorce wil come otherwise 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.430
 which does not work so well and I have great 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.930
 I have a great phase I can 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.490
 rent a great house now with mine 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.409
 family beautiful lose my job 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.240
 wonderful i cancel my apartment 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.430
 or a house a small apartment 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.049
 and can sort me out I have that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.399
 do not live in the solid one 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.829
 pay where I am in east giant 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.360
 I then owe a debt to children 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.979
 maybe the family is going to the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.290
 Breaks of louder worry during the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.009
 family next to the rental lives 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.009
 completely relaxed 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.170
 love the motto 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.729
 the clever people probably all be with 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.410
 Peter Zwegat what would I rent now 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.130
 not thought how lived katja ebstein 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.640
 for rent but so I have a house 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.110
 on the island in the morning and somehow 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.190
 I still find the specific people 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.990
 like me the money if I have a house 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.670
 did not run through my fingers 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.610
 So therefore I am I could I look 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.709
 do not want to be against any already 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.270
 understood the great thing when you look 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.170
 you can and do your own house 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.730
 do not do that 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.470
 that's a lot of freedom you can do yourself 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.480
 but have to be clear that 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.070
 is no return for the future 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.810
 is a luxury I like to like 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.550
 new car or other thing must be there 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.750
 reason it is to have and then completely 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.790
 exactly one must be able to afford it 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.989
 to do with the money that all away 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.910
 is but then again the question is yes 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.950
 can no longer afford the house and how 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.380
 I pay because because if I now one 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.510
 a house worth 200,000 has to 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.670
 finance on the period iks then 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.380
 would be out of debt that I have 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.350
 not the 200,000 if you do not 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.390
 equity but it years 300 years 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.380
 350,000 of these 350,000 are already working 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.330
 never again 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.310
 whether my wife stays with me or 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.739
 if she is gone that means even if that is 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.030
 someday sell please hear 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.769
 me after five years belongs to me 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.080
 first window after ten years on one 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.060
 Doorknob so at that time I had the money 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.890
 yes, if they have it and invest it here 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.690
 where there are also here then hot 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.049
 is still to be believed today 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.000
 that all my children are here in this 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.980
 around when they are little and to 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.690
 play and safe and road traffic 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.010
 everything is fine but they want 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.230
 Once again in the shrine 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.110
 The seven will be missed now 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.240
 Do not freeze play 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.620
 now we would have the big ones 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.000
 a teaching post you have a teaching post 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.880
 get hold of it then they need it 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.080
 I suddenly have three cars 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.610
 finance because i need a car around 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.360
 to go to work my wife need 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.360
 car work 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.310
 The son also needs a car around 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.470
 to do his apprenticeship means that 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.810
 everything must be first funded 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.460
 experienced as this book but written 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.670
 I have a divider before the holidays 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.680
 written in diversity and have me 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.750
 then entertained at the bar in the evening 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.210
 an entrepreneur from the Ruhr area and 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.770
 I told him which topic was there 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.930
 this is just the real estate 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.580
 I also find such ski vacation 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:36.790
 to talk about it like the flakes 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:38.950
 come in there I have to smile like 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.150
 has several houses and myself 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.150
 does not live to rent why
