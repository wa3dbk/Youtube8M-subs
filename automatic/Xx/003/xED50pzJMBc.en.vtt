00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
for the opposing manager I think they

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.729 
for the opposing manager I think they
had<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.250> that<00:03:36.820> are<00:03:36.970> very<00:03:37.060> tight<00:03:37.360> bond<00:03:38.019> mark<00:03:38.470> and

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
had a that are very tight bond mark and

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.520 
had a that are very tight bond mark and
am<00:03:39.220> right<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.640> that<00:03:40.600> helped<00:03:40.930> them<00:03:41.080> develop

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
am right and that helped them develop

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.590 
am right and that helped them develop
each<00:03:41.860> other's<00:03:42.160> games<00:03:42.370> they<00:03:42.670> they<00:03:43.120> were<00:03:43.180> good

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
bright it will probably argue that um

diminution<00:04:02.980> because<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:04.180> power<00:04:04.660> of<00:04:04.959> the

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
diminution because of the power of the

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.610 
diminution because of the power of the
midfield<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.610> top<00:04:06.820> teams<00:04:07.090> and<00:04:07.450> if<00:04:08.140> you<00:04:08.260> and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
midfield of the top teams and if you and

midfield of the top teams and if you and
if<00:04:09.130> you<00:04:09.250> don't<00:04:09.489> match<00:04:09.730> that<00:04:09.970> up<00:04:10.120> it's<00:04:11.019> very

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
if you don't match that up it's very

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.380 
if you don't match that up it's very
difficult<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.650> win<00:04:11.860> games<00:04:12.070> so<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:13.090> kind<00:04:13.269> of

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
difficult to win games so that kind of

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.319 
difficult to win games so that kind of
combination<00:04:13.680> isn't<00:04:14.680> as<00:04:15.100> popular<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:16.030> the

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
combination isn't as popular in the

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.539 
combination isn't as popular in the
Premier<00:04:16.600> League<00:04:16.630> as<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.930> used<00:04:17.079> to<00:04:17.140> be<00:04:17.260> and

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
Premier League as it used to be and

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.789 
Premier League as it used to be and
those<00:04:18.549> not<00:04:19.000> great<00:04:19.269> too<00:04:19.959> many<00:04:20.140> I<00:04:20.229> can<00:04:20.470> think<00:04:20.620> of

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
those not great too many I can think of

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.170 
those not great too many I can think of
that<00:04:21.099> will<00:04:21.280> operate<00:04:21.520> and<00:04:21.729> well<00:04:21.849> at<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.030> moment

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
that will operate and well at the moment

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.210 
that will operate and well at the moment
but<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.200> to<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.770> style<00:04:24.370> that<00:04:24.550> we<00:04:24.880> have

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
but the to the style that we have

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.460 
but the to the style that we have
with<00:04:25.430> them<00:04:25.640> to<00:04:25.880> out<00:04:26.060> wide<00:04:26.300> it<00:04:26.900> can<00:04:27.140> become<00:04:27.290> a

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
with them to out wide it can become a

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.470 
with them to out wide it can become a
nice<00:04:27.680> force<00:04:27.980> for<00:04:28.220> us<00:04:28.280> we've<00:04:29.120> got<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.270> very

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
nice force for us we've got a very

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.470 
nice force for us we've got a very
experienced<00:04:29.990> striker<00:04:30.790> look<00:04:31.790> into<00:04:32.090> profit

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
experienced striker look into profit

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.630 
experienced striker look into profit
from<00:04:33.020> their<00:04:33.230> crosses<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:33.860> that's<00:04:34.010> their<00:04:34.460> job

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
from their crosses and that's their job

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.000 
from their crosses and that's their job
really<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.240> put<00:04:35.390> balls<00:04:35.570> in<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.780> box<00:04:36.010> to

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
really to put balls in the box to

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.500 
really to put balls in the box to
results<00:04:37.490> for<00:04:37.670> one<00:04:37.790> of<00:04:37.880> those<00:04:37.970> bottom<00:04:38.270> teams

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
results for one of those bottom teams

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.090 
results for one of those bottom teams
and<00:04:38.870> you<00:04:38.990> know<00:04:39.230> it's<00:04:39.410> going<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.620> be<00:04:39.710> very<00:04:39.950> very

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
and you know it's going to be very very

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.270 
and you know it's going to be very very
tight<00:04:40.520> again<00:04:40.820> so<00:04:41.510> we<00:04:42.380> know<00:04:42.560> that<00:04:42.590> we're<00:04:43.100> not

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
tight again so we know that we're not

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.250 
tight again so we know that we're not
we're<00:04:44.180> experienced<00:04:44.780> enough<00:04:44.960> got<00:04:45.170> the

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
we're experienced enough got the

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.290 
we're experienced enough got the
experience<00:04:45.500> enough<00:04:45.830> players<00:04:46.100> to<00:04:46.370> know<00:04:47.030> that

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
experience enough players to know that

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.010 
experience enough players to know that
we<00:04:47.450> still<00:04:48.020> got<00:04:48.200> work<00:04:48.350> to<00:04:48.560> do<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:49.600> three<00:04:50.600> points

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
we still got work to do and three points

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.780

in<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.320> Premier<00:04:51.620> League<00:04:51.650> is<00:04:51.980> very<00:04:52.580> difficult

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
in the Premier League is very difficult

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.100 
in the Premier League is very difficult
to<00:04:53.090> get<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:54.580> every<00:04:55.580> game<00:04:56.120> you<00:04:56.150> look<00:04:56.720> at<00:04:56.840> almost

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
to get and every game you look at almost

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.200 
to get and every game you look at almost
every<00:04:57.470> game<00:04:57.500> across<00:04:57.950> the<00:04:58.100> board<00:04:58.340> you<00:04:59.090> know

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
every game across the board you know

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.360 
every game across the board you know
there's<00:04:59.390> not<00:04:59.570> often<00:04:59.960> that<00:05:00.170> there's<00:05:00.740> a<00:05:01.070> team

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
there's not often that there's a team

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.370 
there's not often that there's a team
that<00:05:01.610> run<00:05:01.760> away<00:05:01.880> with<00:05:02.180> a<00:05:02.210> win<00:05:02.390> they<00:05:03.140> were<00:05:03.200> all

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
that run away with a win they were all

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.860 
that run away with a win they were all
really<00:05:03.710> tight<00:05:04.070> it's<00:05:04.370> all<00:05:04.580> hinges<00:05:05.390> on<00:05:05.390> the<00:05:05.660> last

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
really tight it's all hinges on the last

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.890 
really tight it's all hinges on the last
ten<00:05:06.200> minutes<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:07.000> I<00:05:08.000> don't<00:05:08.300> think<00:05:08.540> Stoke<00:05:08.750> will

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
ten minutes and I don't think Stoke will

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.730 
ten minutes and I don't think Stoke will
be<00:05:08.990> any<00:05:09.110> different<00:05:09.200> Palace<00:05:09.980> Saturday
