00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
right all right now this piece here

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.809 
right all right now this piece here
let's<00:03:18.440> look<00:03:18.709> up<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:20.060> want<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:20.360> keep<00:03:20.600> up<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.819> kind

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
let's look up you want to keep up I kind

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.290 
let's look up you want to keep up I kind
of<00:03:22.910> like<00:03:23.120> it<00:03:23.150> was<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.690> pivot<00:03:24.110> up<00:03:24.230> like<00:03:24.470> this

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
of like it was it pivot up like this

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:32.650 
of like it was it pivot up like this
just<00:03:26.300> like<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:28.010> take<00:03:28.489> my<00:03:29.380> hair<00:03:31.660> pins

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
just like that so I take my hair pins

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:40.509 
just like that so I take my hair pins
and<00:03:34.269> I<00:03:35.530> secure<00:03:36.530> it<00:03:36.560> in<00:03:36.830> place<00:03:38.890> at<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.100> bottom

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
and I secure it in place at the bottom

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:47.590 
and I secure it in place at the bottom
so<00:03:40.730> it<00:03:40.940> still<00:03:43.480> flips<00:03:44.480> up<00:03:44.690> just<00:03:44.959> like<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:46.600> and

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
so it still flips up just like that and

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.569 
so it still flips up just like that and
make<00:03:47.870> sure<00:03:47.900> why<00:03:48.170> attach<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:48.769> from<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.160> bottom

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
make sure why attach it from the bottom

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:55.150 
make sure why attach it from the bottom
and<00:03:50.860> secure<00:03:51.860> it<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:53.410> like<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.560> flipped<00:03:54.799> up<00:03:54.950> like

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
and secure it I like it flipped up like

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:03.200 
and secure it I like it flipped up like
