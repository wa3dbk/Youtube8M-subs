00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:12.570
 Good people, I hope everything is fine 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.560
 with you today I'm going to talk about a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:21.119
 problem that plagues many users of 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:25.859
 windows phone that is the fact sometimes 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.670
 some applications close by themselves 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.640
 well some time ago I thought that 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.670
 this problem happened because of the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.280
 amount of ram memory in the device 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.690
 it's got 512 mb of ram is then 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.950
 I thought this happened because of 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.629
 of ram 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.610
 however I followed some users 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.160
 whose devices have ram 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.870
 that they also complain about this 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.719
 problem then I went give a researched 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.270
 here in the settings and everything else and see 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.450
 what could I come to the conclusion 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.860
 what this is not is relative to memory 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:15.030
 but the physical memory of the phone is 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.390
 the application all applications when 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.750
 they are being used they store 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.659
 Your cash information is not it 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.439
 uses the phone memory to 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.460
 store kers 4 to your information 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.259
 especially the applications that 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.329
 use the internet for example the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.110
 facebook which is usually the most 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.329
 shut me up in my case alone 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.180
 So I realized that when I 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.259
 released the memory this problem was 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.380
 solved a while ago I made a 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.090
 video is to give some tips on how to 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.329
 improve the performance of your windows 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.700
 phone link here is below here at 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.100
 video you can access this video 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.500
 It's also giving good tips. 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.649
 how to improve the performance of the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.190
 windows phone and no more because I 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.060
 I recommend school applications 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.349
 that you do not use 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.380
 is from time to time a scan in the 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:24.120
 memory using another one or here 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:28.569
 even in the settings is the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:34.599
 have the option to give you 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:37.840
 one in the memory is memory of the 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.540
 phone or sd card in case 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.030
 storing all applications not in the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.760
 memory of the phone because I think 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.980
 The phone lives better 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.540
 applications than the memory than the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.319
 memory card 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.620
 so here is a temporary files if 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:01.510
 you can exclude that temporary files 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:04.810
 if you have any and also exclude here is the 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.910
 history on an internet cast 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.540
 history and other browsers 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.870
 that you use is a tip I gave 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.230
 in the other video was also to use what 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.709
 the clinics that today is no longer called 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.760
 that the clinics now cleaning is as it is 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:28.510
 the cash cleaning you will use 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:33.090
 this app is having a video too 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:41.019
 that teaching to use this application and 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:45.819
 Let me see but that's it I recommend it 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:49.109
 also leave at least 100 megs of 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:54.609
 free memory to power applications 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:57.060
 use store because windows 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:04:00.549
 phone it has a security system 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.739
 that he gives preference to the 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.350
 stability of the system and not for 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.230
 application stability is one thing 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:11.530
 It is halfway logical to avoid 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.829
 locking system 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.639
 so when the app arrives in a 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:21.039
 amount of memory such that the system 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.680
 is not supporting that the system does not 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.990
 will support if it plays the app 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.120
 use more then 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.030
 the system closes the application itself 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.319
 to avoid any treatment by the 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.449
 system 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:37.360
 so I recommend leaving at least 100 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.979
 Memory megs free thought 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.560
 you use many applications that 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:47.289
 They use the internet, so it's the lady. 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.490
 memory would exclude applications 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:55.240
 you do not use is to choose the cash of 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.160
 browsers and that's it I hope the 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.699
 jica has been useful 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:05.039
 It's favorite the video sign up for the channel 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:08.349
 short our fan page on facebook and 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.599
 share and everything you want to know 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:14.500
 on the windows leaf only to be welcomed 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:18.030
 by the club or with 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.030
 God is even more
