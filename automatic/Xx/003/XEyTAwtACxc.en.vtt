from fourth round so because of an
uneven<00:05:13.890> area<00:05:14.669> you'd<00:05:15.540> always<00:05:15.660> add<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:15.930> shim<00:05:16.320> I'll

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
uneven area you'd always add a shim I'll

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.840 
uneven area you'd always add a shim I'll
show<00:05:16.979> you<00:05:17.070> with<00:05:17.190> the<00:05:17.310> nail<00:05:17.460> here<00:05:17.640> you<00:05:17.729> can

always add it to shim underneath of any
section<00:05:20.070> of<00:05:20.220> it<00:05:20.370> you<00:05:20.820> can<00:05:20.940> buy<00:05:21.060> split<00:05:21.479> wedge

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
section of it you can buy split wedge

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.540 
section of it you can buy split wedge
shims<00:05:22.620> but<00:05:22.830> I<00:05:22.860> recommend<00:05:23.310> you<00:05:23.400> use<00:05:23.460> a

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
shims but I recommend you use a

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.150 
shims but I recommend you use a
composite<00:05:24.240> chin<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:25.620> then<00:05:25.740> you<00:05:25.860> can<00:05:25.979> just

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
composite chin and then you can just

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.310 
composite chin and then you can just
tilt<00:05:26.370> it<00:05:26.550> put<00:05:26.880> it<00:05:26.970> under<00:05:27.300> remount<00:05:27.900> it<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:28.260> the

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
tilt it put it under remount it and the

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.659 
tilt it put it under remount it and the
idea<00:05:28.620> in<00:05:28.680> that<00:05:28.830> is<00:05:28.950> this<00:05:29.100> way<00:05:29.250> you<00:05:29.310> can<00:05:29.490> get<00:05:29.640> a

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
idea in that is this way you can get a

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.870 
idea in that is this way you can get a
level<00:05:29.880> with<00:05:30.150> it<00:05:30.300> and<00:05:30.510> now<00:05:31.470> get<00:05:31.680> awesome

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880
