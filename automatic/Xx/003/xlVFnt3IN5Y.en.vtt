dash hol which is the hardware screws
you<00:00:08.320> can<00:00:08.469> see<00:00:08.710> here<00:00:09.070> at<00:00:09.129> the<00:00:09.219> front<00:00:09.539> that's

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:10.539 
you can see here at the front that's

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:14.220 
you can see here at the front that's
used<00:00:10.990> with<00:00:11.650> the<00:00:11.770> cradles<00:00:12.309> to<00:00:12.549> connect<00:00:13.180> them<00:00:13.449> to

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
used with the cradles to connect them to

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.790 
used with the cradles to connect them to
the<00:00:14.529> RAM<00:00:14.860> diamond<00:00:15.369> plate<00:00:15.580> so<00:00:16.570> when<00:00:17.080> you<00:00:17.199> buy<00:00:17.440> a

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
the RAM diamond plate so when you buy a

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.420 
the RAM diamond plate so when you buy a
ram<00:00:18.460> cradle<00:00:19.030> like<00:00:19.960> this<00:00:20.110> one<00:00:20.290> here<00:00:20.430> they

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
ram cradle like this one here they

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.000 
ram cradle like this one here they
include<00:00:22.060> hardware<00:00:22.330> packs<00:00:22.870> now<00:00:23.170> this<00:00:23.470> is<00:00:23.650> the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
include hardware packs now this is the

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.820 
include hardware packs now this is the
the<00:00:24.340> three<00:00:24.700> pack<00:00:24.910> which<00:00:25.180> has<00:00:25.420> two<00:00:26.260> half-inch

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
the three pack which has two half-inch

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.480 
the three pack which has two half-inch
screws<00:00:27.039> to<00:00:28.260> five<00:00:29.260> eighths<00:00:29.530> inch<00:00:29.800> screws<00:00:30.250> and

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
screws to five eighths inch screws and

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.660 
screws to five eighths inch screws and
then<00:00:30.760> two<00:00:31.119> three<00:00:31.900> quarter<00:00:32.230> inch<00:00:32.379> screws<00:00:32.670> and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
then two three quarter inch screws and

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.130 
then two three quarter inch screws and
you<00:00:33.760> can<00:00:33.879> see<00:00:34.060> them<00:00:34.270> there<00:00:34.480> and<00:00:34.690> then<00:00:34.989> they

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
you can see them there and then they

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.050 
you can see them there and then they
also<00:00:35.290> have<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.710> matching<00:00:35.890> nuts<00:00:36.370> one<00:00:36.700> set<00:00:36.970> of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
also have the matching nuts one set of

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.420 
also have the matching nuts one set of
matching<00:00:37.390> nuts<00:00:37.630> now<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.320> reason<00:00:38.680> you'll<00:00:39.160> have

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
matching nuts now the reason you'll have

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.600 
matching nuts now the reason you'll have
three<00:00:40.030> sets<00:00:40.329> in<00:00:40.660> a<00:00:40.810> pack<00:00:41.079> is<00:00:41.350> because<00:00:42.250> this

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
three sets in a pack is because this

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.210 
three sets in a pack is because this
diamond<00:00:43.090> plate<00:00:43.329> can<00:00:43.720> connect<00:00:44.079> to<00:00:44.320> one<00:00:45.040> of

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
diamond plate can connect to one of

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.600 
diamond plate can connect to one of
three<00:00:45.790> types<00:00:46.329> of<00:00:46.570> diamonds<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.230> RAM<00:00:47.470> make<00:00:47.770> in

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
three types of diamonds the RAM make in

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.490 
three types of diamonds the RAM make in
this<00:00:48.880> case<00:00:49.120> there's<00:00:49.450> the<00:00:49.660> marine<00:00:50.290> grade

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
this case there's the marine grade

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.410 
this case there's the marine grade
aluminum<00:00:51.040> in<00:00:51.220> the<00:00:51.280> center<00:00:51.730> here<00:00:51.760> which<00:00:52.270> you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
aluminum in the center here which you

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.979 
aluminum in the center here which you
can<00:00:52.540> see<00:00:52.780> is<00:00:53.050> very<00:00:53.920> flat<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:55.329> also<00:00:55.510> have<00:00:55.750> the

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
can see is very flat they also have the

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.920 
can see is very flat they also have the
older<00:00:56.530> style<00:00:56.969> plastic<00:00:57.969> one<00:00:58.210> which<00:00:59.050> has<00:01:00.040> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
older style plastic one which has a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.229 
older style plastic one which has a
quite<00:01:01.930> deep<00:01:02.290> look<00:01:02.739> but<00:01:03.280> actually<00:01:03.670> a<00:01:03.700> very

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
quite deep look but actually a very

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.529 
quite deep look but actually a very
shallow<00:01:04.989> hole<00:01:05.469> inside<00:01:06.009> and<00:01:06.369> then<00:01:07.179> you<00:01:07.329> have

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
shallow hole inside and then you have

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:10.770 
shallow hole inside and then you have
the<00:01:07.810> new<00:01:08.219> plastic<00:01:09.219> diamond<00:01:09.459> plate<00:01:09.880> which<00:01:10.749> has

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
the new plastic diamond plate which has

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.429 
the new plastic diamond plate which has
a<00:01:11.609> thinner<00:01:12.609> look<00:01:12.909> but<00:01:13.539> actually<00:01:13.899> has<00:01:14.049> a<00:01:14.079> more

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
a thinner look but actually has a more

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.590 
a thinner look but actually has a more
raised<00:01:14.770> point<00:01:15.639> for<00:01:15.850> mounting<00:01:16.270> so<00:01:16.479> it's

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
raised point for mounting so it's

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.779 
raised point for mounting so it's
actually<00:01:16.719> thicker<00:01:17.229> when<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.799> screw<00:01:18.609> goes

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
actually thicker when the screw goes

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.779 
actually thicker when the screw goes
through<00:01:19.090> so<00:01:19.869> that's<00:01:20.079> the<00:01:20.259> three<00:01:20.590> types<00:01:20.950> of<00:01:21.279> a

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
through so that's the three types of a

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.300 
through so that's the three types of a
one-inch<00:01:22.659> bull<00:01:22.990> diamond<00:01:23.590> plate<00:01:23.799> you<00:01:23.979> can<00:01:24.130> get

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
one-inch bull diamond plate you can get

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.059 
one-inch bull diamond plate you can get
you<00:01:24.939> can<00:01:25.090> also<00:01:25.209> find<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:26.109> same<00:01:26.380> style<00:01:26.859> of

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:27.069 
you can also find the same style of

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.910 
you can also find the same style of
thickness<00:01:27.600> varying<00:01:28.600> between<00:01:28.869> different<00:01:29.529> ramp

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
thickness varying between different ramp

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.559 
thickness varying between different ramp
diamond<00:01:30.399> plates<00:01:30.639> in<00:01:30.849> this<00:01:30.969> case<00:01:31.179> this<00:01:31.359> is<00:01:31.539> a

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
diamond plates in this case this is a

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:33.690 
diamond plates in this case this is a
snap<00:01:31.929> link<00:01:32.229> diamond<00:01:32.679> ball<00:01:32.859> sorry<00:01:33.459> it's<00:01:33.549> not

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
snap link diamond ball sorry it's not

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.449 
snap link diamond ball sorry it's not
linked<00:01:33.999> ball<00:01:34.209> but<00:01:34.810> it<00:01:34.929> has<00:01:35.109> the<00:01:35.319> same<00:01:35.590> diamond

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459 
linked ball but it has the same diamond

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.809 
linked ball but it has the same diamond
plate<00:01:36.670> shape<00:01:36.999> as<00:01:37.179> the<00:01:37.529> older<00:01:38.529> style<00:01:38.799> wrap<00:01:39.459> be

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
plate shape as the older style wrap be

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.620 
plate shape as the older style wrap be
238<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:42.189> basically<00:01:42.670> they're<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.029> three<00:01:43.359> main

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
238 so basically they're the three main

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.059 
238 so basically they're the three main
diamond<00:01:44.079> plates<00:01:44.319> you'll<00:01:44.499> be<00:01:44.619> using<00:01:44.829> when

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
diamond plates you'll be using when

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.730 
diamond plates you'll be using when
connecting<00:01:45.579> to<00:01:45.759> a<00:01:45.789> ram<00:01:46.090> cradle<00:01:46.599> so<00:01:47.319> the<00:01:47.469> reason

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
connecting to a ram cradle so the reason

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.019 
connecting to a ram cradle so the reason
you<00:01:47.799> have<00:01:47.950> these<00:01:48.099> three<00:01:48.490> different<00:01:48.609> sets<00:01:48.909> of

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:49.029 
you have these three different sets of

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:51.179 
you have these three different sets of
screws<00:01:49.389> is<00:01:49.599> to<00:01:50.169> allow<00:01:50.469> for<00:01:50.679> the<00:01:50.770> different

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
screws is to allow for the different

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.609 
screws is to allow for the different
depths<00:01:51.549> of<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.849> holes<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:52.840> when<00:01:53.169> you<00:01:53.289> use<00:01:53.469> the

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
depths of the holes so when you use the

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.550 
depths of the holes so when you use the
aluminum<00:01:54.130> one<00:01:54.159> you<00:01:54.880> can<00:01:55.090> use<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.599> medium<00:01:56.319> size

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
aluminum one you can use the medium size

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.769 
aluminum one you can use the medium size
length<00:01:56.979> when<00:01:57.909> you're<00:01:58.060> using<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.419> actual

00:01:58.769 --> 00:01:58.779 
length when you're using the actual

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:00.269 
length when you're using the actual
thickest<00:01:59.259> one<00:01:59.499> which<00:01:59.709> is<00:01:59.859> the<00:01:59.950> old-style

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:00.279 
thickest one which is the old-style

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:02.010 
thickest one which is the old-style
plastic<00:02:00.939> one<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.299> can<00:02:01.419> use<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.719> thinner

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
plastic one you can use the thinner

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.019 
plastic one you can use the thinner
screws<00:02:02.499> and<00:02:03.159> when<00:02:03.310> you've<00:02:03.459> got<00:02:03.639> the<00:02:03.700> thinner

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:04.029 
screws and when you've got the thinner

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:06.419 
screws and when you've got the thinner
style<00:02:04.389> plastic<00:02:04.929> the<00:02:05.109> newer<00:02:05.349> version<00:02:05.799> you<00:02:06.340> can

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
style plastic the newer version you can

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.150 
style plastic the newer version you can
actually<00:02:06.639> use<00:02:06.969> the<00:02:07.509> longest<00:02:07.869> screws<00:02:08.080> so<00:02:08.770> very

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
actually use the longest screws so very

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.130 
actually use the longest screws so very
simply<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:10.060> diamond<00:02:10.420> just<00:02:10.600> connect<00:02:10.930> straight

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
simply the diamond just connect straight

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.880 
simply the diamond just connect straight
to<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.560> back<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.660> cradle<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:14.530> drop<00:02:14.740> your

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
to the back of the cradle you drop your

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:15.400 
to the back of the cradle you drop your
screws

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
screws

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.260 
screws
in<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:16.190> best<00:02:16.400> way<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.670> do<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.090> actually

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
in the best way to do it is actually

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.970 
in the best way to do it is actually
dropping<00:02:17.630> in<00:02:18.220> from<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.820> back<00:02:20.000> like<00:02:20.300> so

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
dropping in from the back like so

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.350 
dropping in from the back like so
probably<00:02:21.980> easier<00:02:22.460> to<00:02:22.490> do<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.760> one<00:02:22.910> at<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.090> time

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
probably easier to do it one at a time

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.330 
probably easier to do it one at a time
but<00:02:23.600> I've<00:02:23.720> done<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:24.140> flip<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:24.920> over<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.250> you

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
but I've done to flip it over and you

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.930 
but I've done to flip it over and you
can<00:02:25.490> see<00:02:25.700> inside<00:02:26.060> here<00:02:26.120> now<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.110> can<00:02:27.350> see<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
can see inside here now you can see the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.880 
can see inside here now you can see the
screw<00:02:28.940> sticking<00:02:29.180> through<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:30.350> can<00:02:30.500> also<00:02:30.620> see

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
screw sticking through you can also see

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.990 
screw sticking through you can also see
the<00:02:31.010> hex<00:02:31.220> head<00:02:31.460> that<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.670> can<00:02:31.790> drop<00:02:31.940> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
the hex head that you can drop the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.090 
the hex head that you can drop the
screws<00:02:32.390> into<00:02:32.600> or<00:02:32.990> them<00:02:33.230> sorry<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.650> nuts<00:02:33.860> into

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
screws into or them sorry the nuts into

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.220 
screws into or them sorry the nuts into
that<00:02:34.970> hold<00:02:35.240> it<00:02:35.390> when<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:35.690> do<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.930> up<00:02:36.050> with<00:02:36.200> a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
that hold it when you do it up with a

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.530 
that hold it when you do it up with a
screwdriver<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:37.490> now<00:02:37.700> on<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.030> back<00:02:38.210> here<00:02:38.240> you

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
screwdriver so now on the back here you

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.420 
screwdriver so now on the back here you
can<00:02:38.660> come<00:02:38.780> back<00:02:38.990> tighten<00:02:39.890> them<00:02:39.980> up<00:02:40.040> here<00:02:40.250> on<00:02:40.340> a

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
can come back tighten them up here on a

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.430 
can come back tighten them up here on a
screw<00:02:40.700> drive<00:02:40.940> with<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.150> screwdriver<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.960> the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
screw drive with a screwdriver and the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.340 
screw drive with a screwdriver and the
hole<00:02:42.650> in<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.250> cradle<00:02:43.790> will<00:02:44.180> hold<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.110> nut

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
hole in the cradle will hold that nut

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.260 
hole in the cradle will hold that nut
still<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.580> reason<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.910> want<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.120> select

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
still and the reason you want to select

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.330 
still and the reason you want to select
the<00:02:47.510> right<00:02:47.630> length<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.170> so<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.800> your<00:02:48.980> screw

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
the right length is so that your screw

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.160 
the right length is so that your screw
does<00:02:49.580> not<00:02:49.790> come<00:02:50.060> through<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.570> scratch<00:02:50.930> the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
does not come through and scratch the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.110 
does not come through and scratch the
back<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.560> unit<00:02:51.770> so<00:02:52.520> you<00:02:52.580> want<00:02:52.850> to<00:02:52.910> have<00:02:53.030> it
