 hello I'm basti of maxfield support 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.850
 Today I'll tell you what you are doing at the 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.880
 using the maxfield wireless charging 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.550
 power bank you have to pay attention to 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.130
 to power bank a usb power supply with the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.859
 associated usb cable and one 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.960
 German short instructions included one 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.740
 detailed instruction manual finds 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.930
 you on our website under 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.970
 www.maxdome.de power bank has 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.670
 via a micro usb input to the battery 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.470
 charge a usb output around too 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.250
 other mobile devices with energy too 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.890
 supply 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.140
 Two LEDs showing the current status of the 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.839
 signal device and a battery 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.129
 status indicator 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.619
 In addition, it is with two anti slip 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.449
 Feet at the bottom equipped around 

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:56.089
 on all smooth surfaces like wood 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.229
 glass or plastic a safe 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.750
 stood to grant 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.790
 a rubber ring on the loading area provides 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.530
 for that the smartphone during the 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.489
 charging is safe and not 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.430
 falls 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.930
 to start with the loading process 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.710
 Her button on the silver button 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.760
 actuate 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.620
 the power bank is now active the 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.560
 orange power led signals here 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.540
 the standby status of the device at 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.730
 hang up your smartphones now starts 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.180
 in addition the blue charging led to 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.250
 blinking and indicating the charging process 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.680
 or the communication of the transmitter coil 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.330
 with the receiver coil for one 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.010
 optimal loading must be 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.250
 smartphone in the middle of the wireless 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.240
 charging power bank 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.270
 This is through our logo 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.400
 marked important here is that 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.040
 the receiver in the smartphone in parallel 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.020
 the transmitter in the power bank is the 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.630
 start of energy transmission is through 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.700
 a beeping displayed an inaccurate 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.700
 Positioning is repeated 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.740
 beeping characterizes please note 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.720
 that the nokia lumia devices the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.060
 Induction coil in the lower part of the 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.770
 smartphones is attached and the device 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.470
 accordingly positioned higher 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.380
 must become 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.930
 when reaching 100 smartphone battery 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.940
 remains while the blue flashing led on 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.280
 However, there is no current flow 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.140
 More than just the battery's power 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.200
 loses starts the energy transfer 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.080
 again and the battery will be recharged 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.330
 highlight the four led battery indicators 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.270
 the current state of the integrated 10 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.710
 1000 milliamps of power bank ever 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.290
 after use it reduces 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.960
 Display of 4 white LED's lit up 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.600
 on an led what charging the power 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.340
 Bank needs help 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.380
 power bank first with the enclosed 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.720
 USB cable and the included 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.600
 power plug connected and then one 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.140
 common 240 volt socket connected 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.930
 become 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.180
 when again all four leds light up 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.790
 the charging process is completed and the 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.610
 power bank has again 100% battery 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.380
 strength as a highlight of power bank can 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.170
 They also over in addition to the inductive load 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.880
 usb other non-induction capable 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.010
 provide power to devices 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.590
 For this, the mobile device only needs 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.910
 via a usb cable to the power bank 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.580
 be connected 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.230
 after finishing the loading process and 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.330
 remove all charged devices 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.269
 the maxfield power bank turns off 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.860
 after five minutes on its own completely 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.739
 normal is a heat development during 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.060
 inductive charging battery as well as device 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.470
 can be during the 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.600
 Charging process heat 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.550
 however, this development is complete 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.360
 harmless and harmless for battery 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.360
 and smartphone
