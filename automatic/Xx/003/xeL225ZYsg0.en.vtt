and yeah it's my favorite blue product

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.440 
and yeah it's my favorite blue product
of<00:04:34.890> like<00:04:35.040> all<00:04:35.250> times<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.730> next<00:04:36.000> color<00:04:36.210> is

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
of like all times the next color is

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.480 
of like all times the next color is
indigo<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.710> think<00:04:37.980> that's<00:04:38.130> a<00:04:38.220> mix<00:04:38.370> between

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
indigo and I think that's a mix between

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.850 
indigo and I think that's a mix between
purple<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.240> blue<00:04:39.660> but<00:04:40.020> I<00:04:40.170> kind<00:04:40.500> of<00:04:40.560> went<00:04:40.710> with
