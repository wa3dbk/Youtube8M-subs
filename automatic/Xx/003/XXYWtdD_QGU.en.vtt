00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.530
 hello everyone today I'm going to do today what 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.340
 happened the ingredients are breasts 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.340
 clean chicken 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:26.230
 cream liquid oil whole tomatoes juice 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.900
 of half a lemon a little salt a little 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.050
 of sugar a couple of garlics and as not 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.960
 important the curry 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.100
 The first thing we do is put a little 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.100
 of oil in our pan 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.090
 like to hear raids to be 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.090
 go heating up 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.540
 and meanwhile we take the garlic 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.790
 and we crush 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.070
 we have 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.070
 machado and the oil is hot 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.110
 we miss it 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.869
 and we offered ourselves a little 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.280
 Be careful not to be prevented 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.280
 young 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.920
 when it goes taking beige valuation 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.920
 of the golden color 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.660
 at this point we incorporate 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.130
 the whole tomatoes broken into pieces 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.090
 and this now we have to beg him 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.090
 we put a little salt 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.720
 and whenever you use tomato to 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.030
 cook throw him 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.840
 a little sugar tip to remove the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.840
 tomato acid 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.070
 it's a little 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.030
 and how is this going to be the basis of our 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.780
 important sauce 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.780
 and it happens 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.670
 Well let's let it reduce a 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.670
 little sauce 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.750
 in this point 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.560
 we will add the lemon juice 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.560
 a little bit 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.990
 It's like a soup spoon 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.710
 enough 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.710
 we move 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.020
 and rectify the point of ripeness 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.290
 it's a little 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.310
 If there is not a 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.310
 little acid from the snow 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.170
 and now while it's finished striking 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.660
 what we have to do is split the 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.490
 chicken breasts to strips or 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.849
 small squares like you want 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.250
 this recipe I'm making is for 4 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:32.759
 I'm going to put a whole breast of 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.069
 Chicken and a tiny little achievement of that 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:37.430
 it's more than enough and we're going to 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.430
 split 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.900
 A) Yes 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.010
 we already have all the chicken 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.010
 we miss 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.580
 and this sauce is already 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:46.220
 all the aura is consumed 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.220
 about this the chicken and let's not do it 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.500
 Well, we have the chicken 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.480
 drug addicts and now we add 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.480
 a glass of liquid cream 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.180
 as we see 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:28.639
 and nothing else has been cooking 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.639
 for about 810 minutes at medium heat 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.160
 good after eight minutes firing at 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.260
 medium fire here we have our plate 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.690
 chicken curry the best 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.180
 accompaniment to my liking is a bit of 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.370
 Cooked rice simply cooked with water 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.410
 and come out and if you want to get this out 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.110
 color so yellow you throw him a 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.990
 little curry good you know dale me 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:00.669
