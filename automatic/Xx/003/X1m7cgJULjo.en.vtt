00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
ATO and what's interesting is that we

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.070 
ATO and what's interesting is that we
now<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.350> three<00:01:43.940> DisplayPort<00:01:44.940> outputs<00:01:45.090> for

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
which enables three digital displays

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.570 
which enables three digital displays
such<00:01:51.210> as<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.570> new<00:01:51.750> HP<00:01:52.020> Z<00:01:52.530> displays<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.550> be

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
such as the new HP Z displays to be

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.280 
such as the new HP Z displays to be
connected<00:01:54.120> with<00:01:54.150> no<00:01:54.480> compromise<00:01:55.050> on

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.620 

so<00:02:00.680> under<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.100> hood<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.880> SFF<00:02:02.390> has<00:02:02.600> a

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
so under the hood the SFF has a

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.440 
so under the hood the SFF has a
completely<00:02:03.140> new<00:02:03.500> design<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:05.060> first<00:02:05.240> thing
