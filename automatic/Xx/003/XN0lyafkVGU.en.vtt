really excited about ninja rata we did a

truck<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.320> we<00:03:04.380> got<00:03:04.560> horsepower<00:03:05.340> numbers<00:03:05.750> an

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
truck and we got horsepower numbers an

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.350 
truck and we got horsepower numbers an
increase<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.290> 25<00:03:07.770> horsepower<00:03:08.070> at<00:03:08.940> peak

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360

horsepower and 40 foot pounds of torque

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.610 
horsepower and 40 foot pounds of torque
but<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.420> neat<00:03:12.720> thing<00:03:12.750> about<00:03:12.960> it<00:03:13.140> was<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.410> it

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
but the neat thing about it was that it

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.700 
but the neat thing about it was that it
all<00:03:13.770> came<00:03:13.980> in<00:03:14.220> at<00:03:14.370> about<00:03:14.460> a<00:03:14.910> thousand<00:03:15.710> rpm

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
all came in at about a thousand rpm

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.540 
all came in at about a thousand rpm
sooner

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
sooner

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.030 
sooner
so<00:03:18.060> with<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:18.780> equates<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.320> is<00:03:19.560> if<00:03:19.710> you<00:03:19.860> say

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
so with that equates to is if you say

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.880 
so with that equates to is if you say
you<00:03:20.100> had<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.540> diesel<00:03:21.540> truck<00:03:21.780> with<00:03:22.050> a<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.440> fifth

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
you had a diesel truck with a a fifth

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.680 
you had a diesel truck with a a fifth
wheel<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.120> were<00:03:24.240> getting<00:03:24.480> on<00:03:24.600> the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
wheel and you were getting on the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.720 
wheel and you were getting on the
freeway<00:03:24.900> you're<00:03:25.530> going<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.740> hit<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.130> peak

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
freeway you're going to hit that peak

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.540 
freeway you're going to hit that peak
horsepower<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.720> torque<00:03:28.350> curve<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:29.250> almost

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
horsepower and torque curve that almost

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.610 
horsepower and torque curve that almost
1000<00:03:30.120> rpm<00:03:30.480> sooner<00:03:30.810> than<00:03:31.050> you<00:03:31.140> would<00:03:31.380> with

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
1000 rpm sooner than you would with

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.000 
1000 rpm sooner than you would with
regular<00:03:31.890> pump<00:03:32.700> diesel<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:34.080> added<00:03:34.530> toe<00:03:34.680> to

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
regular pump diesel so this added toe to

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.800 
regular pump diesel so this added toe to
pump<00:03:35.280> T<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:35.640> one<00:03:35.910> can<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:37.280> about<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.310> 30<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.810> 34

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.230 
other out of the factors we have it it
will<00:03:49.650> will<00:03:50.160> give<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.640> extra<00:03:50.790> horsepower

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
will will give you that extra horsepower

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.050 
will will give you that extra horsepower
and<00:03:51.540> torque<00:03:51.780> but<00:03:52.650> out<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.070> sooner<00:03:53.370> rpm<00:03:53.790> so

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
and torque but out of sooner rpm so

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.880 
and torque but out of sooner rpm so
we're<00:03:54.180> real<00:03:54.330> excited<00:03:54.360> about<00:03:54.780> this<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.470> we've

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
we're real excited about this and we've

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.070 
we're real excited about this and we've
yet<00:03:56.100> to<00:03:56.160> test<00:03:56.519> it<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:56.910> our<00:03:57.209> performance

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
yet to test it on our performance

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.100 
yet to test it on our performance
application<00:03:58.680> but<00:03:59.280> we

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
application but we

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.170
