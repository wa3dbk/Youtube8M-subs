00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.429 
I believe that every year the past is
that<00:01:44.970> randy<00:01:45.210> savage<00:01:45.360> isn't<00:01:45.659> inducted<00:01:46.229> and

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
that randy savage isn't inducted and

whatever issue hasn't been smooth over

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.270 
whatever issue hasn't been smooth over
it<00:01:48.720> makes<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.079> double<00:01:49.259> degree<00:01:49.380> look<00:01:49.680> bad<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
it makes it double degree look bad and

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.160 
it makes it double degree look bad and
it<00:01:50.640> froze<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.180> legitimacy<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.049> whole

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
