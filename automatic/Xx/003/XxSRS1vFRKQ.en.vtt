cola I'm going to teach you today is the

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.060 
cola I'm going to teach you today is the
double<00:00:36.970> strand<00:00:37.300> butterfly<00:00:37.750> coil<00:00:38.110> it's<00:00:38.710> really

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
double strand butterfly coil it's really

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.610 
double strand butterfly coil it's really
easy<00:00:39.310> to<00:00:39.610> do<00:00:39.790> and<00:00:39.820> when<00:00:40.690> you<00:00:40.840> lay<00:00:41.020> it<00:00:41.200> down<00:00:41.230> at

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
easy to do and when you lay it down at

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.100 
easy to do and when you lay it down at
the<00:00:41.710> base<00:00:41.860> of<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:42.370> climb<00:00:42.940> it's<00:00:43.450> really<00:00:43.780> easy<00:00:43.989> to

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
the base of a climb it's really easy to

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.229 
the base of a climb it's really easy to
flake<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:44.559> rope<00:00:44.710> from<00:00:44.890> it<00:00:45.100> possibly<00:00:45.910> the<00:00:46.059> best

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
flake the rope from it possibly the best

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.790 
flake the rope from it possibly the best
benefit<00:00:46.750> though<00:00:46.930> is<00:00:47.110> to<00:00:47.230> be<00:00:47.320> able<00:00:47.379> to<00:00:47.530> turn<00:00:47.650> it

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
benefit though is to be able to turn it

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.590 
benefit though is to be able to turn it
into<00:00:47.920> a<00:00:48.040> rope<00:00:48.280> backpack<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:49.270> so<00:00:49.449> to<00:00:49.540> start

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
into a rope backpack and so to start

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.450 
into a rope backpack and so to start
what<00:00:50.050> we<00:00:50.199> want<00:00:50.410> is<00:00:50.559> we<00:00:50.739> want<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.040> rope<00:00:51.190> fully

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
what we want is we want the rope fully

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.979 
what we want is we want the rope fully
flighted<00:00:51.699> our<00:00:51.970> feet<00:00:52.239> which<00:00:52.449> is<00:00:52.480> what<00:00:52.660> I<00:00:52.690> have<00:00:52.960> I

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
flighted our feet which is what I have I

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.900 
flighted our feet which is what I have I
just<00:00:53.320> pulled<00:00:53.559> it<00:00:53.650> off<00:00:53.800> this<00:00:54.040> route<00:00:54.340> and<00:00:54.580> so

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
just pulled it off this route and so

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.670 
just pulled it off this route and so
it's<00:00:55.330> nice<00:00:55.570> and<00:00:55.809> flight<00:00:55.989> there<00:00:56.199> are<00:00:56.290> no<00:00:56.410> knots

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
it's nice and flight there are no knots

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.630 
it's nice and flight there are no knots
we<00:00:57.489> want<00:00:57.700> to<00:00:57.790> find<00:00:58.000> both<00:00:58.510> ends<00:00:59.079> so<00:00:59.950> one<00:01:00.399> comes

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
we want to find both ends so one comes

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.920 
we want to find both ends so one comes
from<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:00.970> top<00:01:01.120> one's<00:01:01.480> going<00:01:01.630> to<00:01:01.660> come<00:01:01.780> from

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
from the top one's going to come from

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.499 
from the top one's going to come from
the<00:01:02.110> bottom<00:01:02.700> go<00:01:03.700> ahead<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.030> match<00:01:04.149> them<00:01:04.390> up

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
the bottom go ahead and match them up

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.630 
the bottom go ahead and match them up
and<00:01:04.750> then<00:01:05.560> if<00:01:05.680> you're<00:01:05.800> going<00:01:05.979> to<00:01:06.070> tied<00:01:06.250> just<00:01:06.490> a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
and then if you're going to tied just a

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.609 
and then if you're going to tied just a
coil<00:01:06.910> and<00:01:07.119> put<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.479> in<00:01:07.600> your<00:01:07.750> pack<00:01:08.020> you'd

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
coil and put it in your pack you'd

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.570 
coil and put it in your pack you'd
probably<00:01:08.860> want<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.399> take<00:01:09.610> maybe<00:01:10.830> two<00:01:11.830> arm

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
probably want to take maybe two arm

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.810 
probably want to take maybe two arm
lengths<00:01:13.320> would<00:01:14.320> be<00:01:14.440> enough<00:01:14.740> but<00:01:15.430> since<00:01:15.640> we're

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
lengths would be enough but since we're

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.249 
lengths would be enough but since we're
going<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:16.000> make<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.149> rope<00:01:16.450> backpack<00:01:16.899> we<00:01:17.080> need<00:01:17.229> a

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
going to make a rope backpack we need a

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.430 
going to make a rope backpack we need a
little<00:01:17.470> extra<00:01:17.950> so<00:01:18.100> I'm<00:01:18.190> going<00:01:18.369> to<00:01:18.430> do<00:01:18.520> three

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
little extra so I'm going to do three

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.499 
little extra so I'm going to do three
and<00:01:20.440> a<00:01:21.130> little<00:01:21.369> bit<00:01:21.490> more<00:01:21.670> just<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:21.910> be<00:01:22.030> safe

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
and a little bit more just to be safe

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.710 
and a little bit more just to be safe
longer<00:01:23.229> is<00:01:23.289> always<00:01:23.560> better<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:25.090> then<00:01:25.300> to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
longer is always better so then to

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.680 
longer is always better so then to
actually<00:01:26.110> start<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.619> coil<00:01:26.920> we<00:01:27.759> want<00:01:27.940> to<00:01:28.030> put

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
actually start the coil we want to put

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.620 
actually start the coil we want to put
our<00:01:28.810> hand<00:01:29.050> here<00:01:29.320> and<00:01:29.440> hold<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.740> rope<00:01:30.330> and<00:01:31.330> put

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
our hand here and hold the rope and put

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.289 
our hand here and hold the rope and put
it<00:01:31.720> over<00:01:31.869> our<00:01:32.110> shoulders<00:01:32.650> and<00:01:33.150> extend<00:01:34.150> this

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
it over our shoulders and extend this

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.030 
it over our shoulders and extend this
hand<00:01:34.540> all<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.780> way<00:01:34.810> out<00:01:35.020> do<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.680> same<00:01:35.890> with

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
hand all the way out do the same with

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.800 
hand all the way out do the same with
this<00:01:36.159> one<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:36.610> then<00:01:37.180> while<00:01:37.360> I<00:01:37.390> leave<00:01:37.630> this

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
this one and then while I leave this

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.100 
this one and then while I leave this
hand<00:01:38.110> here<00:01:38.530> I'm<00:01:39.490> going<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.670> pull<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:40.030> rope<00:01:40.270> go

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
hand here I'm going to pull the rope go

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.530 
hand here I'm going to pull the rope go
over<00:01:41.380> my<00:01:41.530> shoulders<00:01:41.950> again<00:01:43.140> pitching<00:01:44.140> sides

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
over my shoulders again pitching sides

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.170 
over my shoulders again pitching sides
and<00:01:46.540> notice<00:01:47.080> how<00:01:47.260> when<00:01:48.010> I<00:01:48.040> extend<00:01:48.580> my<00:01:48.640> arm<00:01:48.970> out

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
and notice how when I extend my arm out

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.330 
and notice how when I extend my arm out
it's<00:01:49.510> making<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.020> coils<00:01:50.350> almost<00:01:50.710> exactly<00:01:51.189> the

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
it's making the coils almost exactly the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.510 
it's making the coils almost exactly the
same<00:01:51.369> size<00:01:51.580> each<00:01:52.119> time<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:54.189> want<00:01:54.369> the

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
same size each time and you want the

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.300 
same size each time and you want the
coils<00:01:54.939> to<00:01:55.119> be<00:01:55.390> a<00:01:55.420> good<00:01:55.900> length<00:01:56.200> not<00:01:56.560> too<00:01:56.950> long

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
coils to be a good length not too long

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.940 
coils to be a good length not too long
especially<00:01:57.850> if<00:01:58.330> you're<00:01:58.450> short<00:01:58.869> it's<00:01:59.409> easy<00:01:59.710> to

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
especially if you're short it's easy to

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.620 
especially if you're short it's easy to
trip<00:02:00.250> over<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.610> coils<00:02:01.060> when<00:02:01.240> you're<00:02:01.360> going

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
trip over the coils when you're going

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.929 
trip over the coils when you're going
downhill

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
downhill

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.630 
downhill
you<00:02:03.719> know<00:02:03.840> crossing<00:02:04.079> rocky<00:02:04.499> terrain<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.460> is

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
you know crossing rocky terrain this is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.660 
you know crossing rocky terrain this is
the<00:02:05.759> over-the-shoulder<00:02:06.270> method<00:02:07.670> there's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the over-the-shoulder method there's

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.400 
the over-the-shoulder method there's
another<00:02:08.940> way<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.179> do<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.450> where<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.720> just<00:02:09.840> coil

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
another way to do it where you just coil

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.979 
another way to do it where you just coil
in<00:02:10.649> one<00:02:10.860> hand<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.580> find<00:02:12.269> that<00:02:12.450> method<00:02:12.780> pretty

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
in one hand I find that method pretty

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.780 
in one hand I find that method pretty
difficult<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.650> small<00:02:14.040> hands<00:02:14.310> it's<00:02:14.580> hard

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
difficult I have small hands it's hard

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.400 
difficult I have small hands it's hard
for<00:02:14.940> me<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.090> hold<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.420> whole<00:02:15.629> rope<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.140> it's

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
for me to hold the whole rope and it's

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.020 
for me to hold the whole rope and it's
really<00:02:16.620> tiring<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.310> hold<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.610> whole<00:02:17.790> weight

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
really tiring to hold the whole weight

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.750 
really tiring to hold the whole weight
of<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:18.540> rope<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.379> one<00:02:19.650> hand<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.400> now<00:02:20.549> we've

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
of a rope in one hand so now we've

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.020 
of a rope in one hand so now we've
gotten<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.239> end<00:02:21.269> and<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:23.310> have<00:02:23.489> this<00:02:23.700> kind

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
gotten to the end and I have this kind

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.059 
gotten to the end and I have this kind
of<00:02:24.120> awkward<00:02:24.390> leave<00:02:24.810> sized<00:02:25.200> coil<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:25.920> what<00:02:26.040> I

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
of awkward leave sized coil so what I

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.100 
of awkward leave sized coil so what I
want<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.400> do<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:27.180> I'm<00:02:27.269> going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.450> pull<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.019> make

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
want to do is I'm going to pull and make

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.240 
want to do is I'm going to pull and make
that<00:02:28.590> last<00:02:28.890> one<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.129> little<00:02:29.310> bit<00:02:29.489> shorter<00:02:30.200> and

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
that last one a little bit shorter and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.710 
that last one a little bit shorter and
then<00:02:32.250> just<00:02:32.489> kind<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.760> match<00:02:32.910> them<00:02:33.150> all<00:02:33.239> up<00:02:33.510> as

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
then just kind of match them all up as

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.589 
then just kind of match them all up as
best<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.620> can<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:35.910> then<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> hard<00:02:36.390> part

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
best you can so then the hard part

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.910 
best you can so then the hard part
sometimes<00:02:36.989> is<00:02:37.110> actually<00:02:37.379> getting<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.769> all

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
sometimes is actually getting it all

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.800 
sometimes is actually getting it all
from<00:02:38.069> your<00:02:38.220> shoulders<00:02:38.640> what<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.269> like<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.510> do<00:02:39.629> is

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
from your shoulders what I like to do is

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.009 
from your shoulders what I like to do is
bend<00:02:40.049> forward<00:02:40.319> slightly<00:02:41.060> take<00:02:42.060> two<00:02:42.360> hands<00:02:42.870> and

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
bend forward slightly take two hands and

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.670 
bend forward slightly take two hands and
kind<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.040> just<00:02:44.190> lift<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.180> off<00:02:45.299> my<00:02:45.540> neck<00:02:45.680> and

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
kind of just lift it off my neck and

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.770 
kind of just lift it off my neck and
find<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.160> middle<00:02:47.340> again<00:02:47.670> with<00:02:47.849> one<00:02:48.030> hand<00:02:48.360> make

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
find the middle again with one hand make

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.380 
find the middle again with one hand make
sure<00:02:48.959> they're<00:02:49.110> about<00:02:49.260> even<00:02:50.090> with<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.239> other

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
sure they're about even with the other

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.680 
sure they're about even with the other
hand<00:02:51.720> get<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.769> two<00:02:52.950> tails<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.700> then<00:02:54.390> start

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
hand get the two tails and then start

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.150 
hand get the two tails and then start
wrapping<00:02:54.959> around<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.859> coils<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:58.010> like<00:02:59.010> to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
wrapping around the coils I like to

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.930 
wrapping around the coils I like to
start<00:02:59.370> at<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.640> bottom<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.739> wrap<00:03:01.739> up<00:03:01.980> that

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
start at the bottom and wrap up that

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.640 
start at the bottom and wrap up that
creates<00:03:03.269> an<00:03:03.420> X<00:03:03.660> where<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:03.959> rope<00:03:04.140> goes<00:03:04.349> over

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
creates an X where the rope goes over

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.259 
creates an X where the rope goes over
itself<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.250> really<00:03:05.370> locks<00:03:05.670> everything<00:03:06.120> into

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
itself and really locks everything into

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.319 
itself and really locks everything into
place<00:03:06.980> three<00:03:07.980> or<00:03:08.099> four<00:03:08.340> coils<00:03:08.639> should<00:03:08.849> be<00:03:09.090> good

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
place three or four coils should be good

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.110 
place three or four coils should be good
and<00:03:10.250> then<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.430> finish

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
and then to finish

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.840 
and then to finish
I'm<00:03:14.120> going<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.450> take<00:03:14.630> this<00:03:14.900> tail<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.950> go<00:03:16.550> back

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
I'm going to take this tail and go back

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.780 
I'm going to take this tail and go back
through<00:03:17.180> this<00:03:17.360> main<00:03:17.660> loop<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.200> just<00:03:18.610> pull<00:03:19.610> a

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
through this main loop and just pull a

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.340 
through this main loop and just pull a
bite<00:03:20.150> through<00:03:20.390> don't<00:03:20.660> pull<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:20.990> whole<00:03:21.140> rope

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
bite through don't pull the whole rope

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.790 
bite through don't pull the whole rope
through<00:03:21.730> so<00:03:22.730> then<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.410> want<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.470> take<00:03:24.590> these

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
through so then I want to take these

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.030 
through so then I want to take these
tails<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:26.630> I<00:03:27.200> just<00:03:27.500> pulled<00:03:27.680> this<00:03:27.800> bite

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
tails and I just pulled this bite

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.520 
tails and I just pulled this bite
through<00:03:28.400> go<00:03:29.120> through<00:03:29.480> that<00:03:29.780> bite<00:03:30.080> all<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.530> way

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
through go through that bite all the way

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
through go through that bite all the way
it<00:03:33.530> will<00:03:33.650> cumbersome<00:03:34.160> because<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:34.400> have<00:03:34.520> a

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
it will cumbersome because you have a

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.330 
it will cumbersome because you have a
lot<00:03:34.670> of<00:03:34.700> extra<00:03:35.030> tail<00:03:35.770> so<00:03:36.770> then<00:03:36.920> here's<00:03:37.190> the

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
lot of extra tail so then here's the

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.610 
lot of extra tail so then here's the
coil<00:03:37.580> and<00:03:37.910> if<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:39.020> are<00:03:39.140> like<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.380> said<00:03:39.560> if

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
coil and if you are like I said if

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.990 
coil and if you are like I said if
you're<00:03:39.710> just<00:03:39.920> calling<00:03:40.370> you'd<00:03:40.550> have<00:03:40.700> probably

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
you're just calling you'd have probably

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.250 
you're just calling you'd have probably
up<00:03:41.060> this<00:03:41.180> much<00:03:41.390> tail<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.900> you'd<00:03:41.990> be<00:03:42.080> done

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
up this much tail and you'd be done

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.390 
up this much tail and you'd be done
throw<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.650> in<00:03:42.710> your<00:03:42.770> pack<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.160> you're<00:03:43.250> good

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
throw it in your pack and you're good

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.910 
throw it in your pack and you're good
with<00:03:44.240> the<00:03:44.360> rope<00:03:44.540> backpack<00:03:44.990> we<00:03:45.590> want<00:03:45.770> to<00:03:45.830> make

with the rope backpack we want to make
sure<00:03:45.950> this<00:03:46.310> is<00:03:46.460> up<00:03:46.580> against<00:03:46.940> our<00:03:47.090> back<00:03:47.590> so<00:03:48.590> the

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
sure this is up against our back so the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.980 
sure this is up against our back so the
key<00:03:48.920> here<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:50.500> just<00:03:51.500> put<00:03:51.980> it<00:03:52.100> on<00:03:52.220> your<00:03:52.370> back

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
strand to each side and then I go under

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.780 
strand to each side and then I go under
my<00:04:01.160> armpits<00:04:02.710> back<00:04:03.710> around<00:04:04.640> and<00:04:06.280> switch<00:04:07.280> hands
