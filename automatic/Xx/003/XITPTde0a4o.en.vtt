face<00:02:36.410> turning<00:02:36.830> it<00:02:37.069> I<00:02:37.310> usually<00:02:38.180> hold<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.660> like

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
face turning it I usually hold it like

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.180 
face turning it I usually hold it like
this<00:02:40.810> look<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.989> looks<00:02:42.170> like<00:02:42.350> fun<00:02:42.560> just<00:02:43.010> like

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
this look it looks like fun just like

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:51.160 
this look it looks like fun just like
that<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:45.560> then<00:02:46.130> for<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.850> back<00:02:47.060> face<00:02:47.300> I<00:02:50.170> mean

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
that and then for the back face I mean

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.130 
that and then for the back face I mean
from<00:02:51.530> space<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:51.980> actually<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:53.780> can<00:02:54.019> only

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
from space is actually you can only

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.410 
from space is actually you can only
group<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:54.590> but<00:02:55.519> I<00:02:55.550> think<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.090> lot<00:02:56.269> easier

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
group it but I think it's a lot easier

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.460 
group it but I think it's a lot easier
to<00:02:56.900> hold<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.890> like<00:02:58.010> this<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:59.080> just<00:03:00.080> flick<00:03:00.440> it

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
to hold it like this and just flick it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.979 
to hold it like this and just flick it
down<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.760> for<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.510> back<00:03:02.720> base<00:03:03.010> Jesus<00:03:04.010> fingers

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
down and for the back base Jesus fingers

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:12.009 
down and for the back base Jesus fingers
forget<00:03:05.989> down<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:10.120> one<00:03:11.120> main<00:03:11.450> thing<00:03:11.780> that<00:03:11.810> I

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
entire way of solving the cube plus one

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.130 
entire way of solving the cube plus one
end<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.610> just<00:03:19.730> recognize<00:03:20.420> what<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.870> have<00:03:20.989> to

end and just recognize what you have to

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.870 
end and just recognize what you have to
do<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.970> then<00:03:23.510> from<00:03:23.630> now<00:03:24.250> you'll<00:03:25.250> be<00:03:25.280> fine<00:03:25.640> then

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
you'll get it you get a real step and

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.069 
you'll get it you get a real step and
then<00:03:29.239> one<00:03:30.079> more<00:03:30.290> thing<00:03:30.530> if<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.250> know<00:03:31.370> I'm<00:03:31.579> my

then one more thing if you I know I'm my

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.990 
then one more thing if you I know I'm my

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:57.029 

for<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.560> flow<00:04:51.800> face<00:04:52.930> figure<00:04:53.930> it<00:04:54.020> from<00:04:55.060> there

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
for the flow face figure it from there

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:03.250 
for the flow face figure it from there
to<00:04:58.039> there<00:04:58.449> to<00:04:59.979> swing<00:05:00.979> it<00:05:01.130> down<00:05:01.810> till<00:05:02.810> next

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
to there to swing it down till next

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:11.810 
to there to swing it down till next
finger<00:05:05.590> and<00:05:06.590> then<00:05:06.770> for<00:05:07.099> the<00:05:07.190> back<00:05:07.400> face<00:05:07.639> to<00:05:08.330> say

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.560 

looks<00:05:12.690> like<00:05:12.960> that<00:05:13.520> once<00:05:14.520> again<00:05:14.880> is<00:05:15.030> practice

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
looks like that once again is practice

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.790 
looks like that once again is practice
still<00:05:15.600> get<00:05:15.990> it<00:05:16.140> up<00:05:16.170> on<00:05:16.500> and<00:05:18.230> make<00:05:19.230> sure<00:05:19.260> you<00:05:19.620> run

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
still get it up on and make sure you run

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.400 
still get it up on and make sure you run
