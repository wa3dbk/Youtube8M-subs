left is it the image we have on the left
I<00:01:46.470> think<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.119> as<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
I think it is as you can see that the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.539 
I think it is as you can see that the
structures<00:01:49.500> will<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.950> look<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.369> very

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
structures will just look so very

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.929 
structures will just look so very
similar<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.680> by<00:01:52.890> water<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.579> could<00:01:53.729> see

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
similar and it is by water you could see

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.550 
similar and it is by water you could see
all<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.060> water<00:01:54.360> here<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> left<00:01:55.049> image<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
all the water here on the left image and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.649 
all the water here on the left image and
then<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.710> can<00:01:55.860> see<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> actual

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
then you can see if you go to the actual

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.550 
then you can see if you go to the actual
image<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.409> Chi<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.729> all<00:02:00.270> water<00:02:00.719> i<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:01.350> i

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
image of Chi it is all water i think i

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.370 
image of Chi it is all water i think i
think<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.950> water<00:02:02.189> behind<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.960> then

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
think it's water behind it so and then

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.999 
think it's water behind it so and then
it's<00:02:04.649> all<00:02:04.860> built<00:02:05.100> up<00:02:05.399> by<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.149> water<00:02:06.590> so<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.890> do

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
it's all built up by the water so I do

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.229 
it's all built up by the water so I do
think<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.879> mean<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.720> mean<00:02:10.520> usually<00:02:11.520> even<00:02:12.000> like

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
think I mean I I mean usually even like

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.670 
think I mean I I mean usually even like
the<00:02:12.390> Overlord<00:02:12.750> thing<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.050> brought<00:02:13.110> up<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.530> mean

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the Overlord thing I brought up I mean

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.910 
the Overlord thing I brought up I mean
that

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.440 
that
is<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.280> thought<00:02:14.520> really<00:02:14.880> but<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.060> mean<00:02:15.300> this

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
is just a thought really but I mean this

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.510 
is just a thought really but I mean this
does<00:02:15.750> actually<00:02:16.110> look<00:02:16.349> like<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.280> place

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
does actually look like it is the place

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.559 
does actually look like it is the place
that<00:02:17.790> was<00:02:18.480> on<00:02:18.840> in<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:20.069> picture<00:02:20.370> here<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:21.239> it

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
that was on in this picture here so it

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.350 
that was on in this picture here so it
just<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.410> had<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.069> feeling<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.640> since<00:02:24.150> this

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
just I I had a feeling that since this

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.910 
just I I had a feeling that since this
wasn't<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> background<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.290> all<00:02:25.410> these<00:02:25.500> images

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
wasn't a background of all these images

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.199 
wasn't a background of all these images
and<00:02:26.069> stuff<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.340> had<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.520> feeling<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:27.000> would<00:02:27.090> be

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
and stuff I had a feeling it would be

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.660 
and stuff I had a feeling it would be
something<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:28.160> that's<00:02:29.160> why<00:02:29.280> i<00:02:29.310> made<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.520> video

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
something and that's why i made a video

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.050 
something and that's why i made a video
on<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.940> little<00:02:30.209> while<00:02:30.360> ago<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:30.810> now<00:02:31.470> i<00:02:31.950> was<00:02:32.760> sort

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
on a little while ago but now i was sort

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.090 
on a little while ago but now i was sort
of<00:02:33.120> right<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.690> now<00:02:33.989> they<00:02:34.170> are<00:02:34.200> actually<00:02:34.500> going

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
of right and now they are actually going

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.020 
of right and now they are actually going
to<00:02:35.610> be<00:02:36.000> there<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.989> looks<00:02:37.260> like<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:38.310> what<00:02:38.970> do

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
to be there it looks like it so what do

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.920 
to be there it looks like it so what do
you<00:02:39.090> think<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:39.330> place<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.540> going<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.780> be

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
you think this place is going to be

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.660 
you think this place is going to be
where<00:02:40.380> do<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.590> think<00:02:40.830> they're<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.370> do

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
where do you think they're going to do

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.960 
where do you think they're going to do
there<00:02:42.000> because<00:02:42.870> um<00:02:43.489> they're<00:02:44.489> obviously<00:02:44.849> in

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
there because um they're obviously in

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.880 
there because um they're obviously in
the<00:02:45.030> new<00:02:45.150> suits<00:02:45.390> by<00:02:45.569> then<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:45.989> it's<00:02:46.140> gonna<00:02:46.470> they

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
the new suits by then so it's gonna they

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.280 
the new suits by then so it's gonna they
obviously<00:02:47.130> go<00:02:47.580> there<00:02:47.730> right<00:02:47.819> away<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:49.170> an

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
obviously go there right away it's an

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.479 
obviously go there right away it's an
episode<00:02:49.650> 45<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:52.620> means<00:02:52.830> they<00:02:53.160> go<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.400> the

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
episode 45 so that means they go on the

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.100 
episode 45 so that means they go on the
first<00:02:53.640> episode<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.390> it's<00:02:54.540> something<00:02:54.870> they<00:02:54.959> go

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110
