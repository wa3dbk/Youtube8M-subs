you're<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.120> split<00:01:03.480> your<00:01:03.570> hair<00:01:03.750> into<00:01:03.930> two

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470

you're going to split your hair into two
separate<00:01:04.860> sections<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.820> there's<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.119> two

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
separate sections so there's like two

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.960 
separate sections so there's like two
separate<00:01:07.009> ponytails<00:01:08.009> or<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.369> pigtails<00:01:08.850> or

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
separate ponytails or just pigtails or

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.450 
separate ponytails or just pigtails or
whatever<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.630> then<00:01:10.259> what<00:01:10.800> I<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:11.009> to<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.369> I

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
whatever and then what I like to do is I

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.999 
whatever and then what I like to do is I
like<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.610> twist<00:01:12.149> each<00:01:12.479> section<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.770> way

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
like to twist each section so that way

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.889 
like to twist each section so that way
it's<00:01:14.160> just<00:01:14.340> easier<00:01:14.759> to<00:01:14.789> wrap<00:01:15.420> around<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
it's just easier to wrap around the

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.660 
it's just easier to wrap around the
headband<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.830> adds<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> little<00:01:17.250> bit<00:01:17.369> more

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
headband and it adds a little bit more

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.060 
headband and it adds a little bit more
curl<00:01:17.910> to<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.539> what<00:01:19.170> you're<00:01:19.289> gonna<00:01:19.410> do<00:01:19.740> is

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
curl to it and what you're gonna do is

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.010 
curl to it and what you're gonna do is
you're<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.340> going<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.880> kind<00:01:21.569> of<00:01:21.690> tuck<00:01:21.959> it

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
you're just going to kind of tuck it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.490 
you're just going to kind of tuck it
behind<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.369> headband<00:01:23.819> and<00:01:24.420> you'll<00:01:24.929> see<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.470> I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
behind the headband and you'll see as I

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.010 
behind the headband and you'll see as I
do<00:01:26.220> how<00:01:26.640> easy<00:01:26.940> it<00:01:27.149> really<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.390> you're<00:01:27.869> just

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
do how easy it really is you're just

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.930 
do how easy it really is you're just
wrapping<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.530> around<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.830> headband<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.399> you

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
wrapping it around the headband and you

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.550 
wrapping it around the headband and you
want<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.179> wrap<00:01:30.300> it<00:01:30.330> as<00:01:30.539> tight<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.780> possible<00:01:31.440> so

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
want to wrap it as tight as possible so

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.859 
want to wrap it as tight as possible so
that<00:01:31.740> way<00:01:31.860> they<00:01:32.399> don't<00:01:32.670> come<00:01:32.910> loose<00:01:33.209> overnight

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
that way they don't come loose overnight

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.469 
that way they don't come loose overnight
and<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> curls<00:01:35.280> are<00:01:35.580> as<00:01:35.849> curly<00:01:36.450> as

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
and if the curls are as curly as

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.889 
and if the curls are as curly as
possible<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.140> they're<00:01:37.229> not<00:01:37.349> too<00:01:37.590> flat<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.899> I

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
possible and they're not too flat so I

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.600 
possible and they're not too flat so I
just<00:01:40.289> continue<00:01:41.539> wrapping<00:01:42.539> and<00:01:43.220> twisting<00:01:44.220> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
just continue wrapping and twisting and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.300 
just continue wrapping and twisting and
then<00:01:44.910> pulling<00:01:45.149> through<00:01:45.619> until<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.920> reaches

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
then pulling through until it reaches

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.300 
then pulling through until it reaches
the<00:01:47.340> ends<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.090> my<00:01:48.300> hair

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310

it<00:02:18.860> was<00:02:19.010> hard<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.310> see<00:02:19.610> from<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.630> camera<00:02:20.780> angle

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
it was hard to see from the camera angle

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.840 
it was hard to see from the camera angle
so<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.530> decided<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.160> show<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.580> other<00:02:22.730> part

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
so I decided to show you the other part

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.770 
so I decided to show you the other part
first<00:02:24.550> but<00:02:25.550> it's<00:02:25.760> just<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.180> same<00:02:26.390> process

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
first but it's just the same process

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.750 
first but it's just the same process
over<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.230> over<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.470> just<00:02:27.890> twist<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.520> pull<00:02:28.670> it

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
over and over I just twist and pull it

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.930 
over and over I just twist and pull it
through<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.240> then<00:02:30.140> wrap<00:02:31.100> it<00:02:31.250> around<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.880> then

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
through and then wrap it around and then

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.390 
through and then wrap it around and then
twist<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:32.990> again<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.680> pull<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.070> through<00:02:34.100> it

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
twist it again and pull it through it

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.460 
twist it again and pull it through it
and<00:02:34.550> make<00:02:34.730> sure<00:02:34.910> I'm<00:02:35.180> tucking<00:02:35.480> in<00:02:35.780> my<00:02:35.960> hair<00:02:36.200> so

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.910 
and make sure I'm tucking in my hair so
that<00:02:36.500> way<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.980> don't<00:02:37.430> miss<00:02:37.610> any<00:02:37.790> sections

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
like this and then I do the same thing

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.920 
like this and then I do the same thing
with<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.430> other<00:03:20.549> side<00:03:20.730> gently<00:03:21.329> pulling<00:03:21.720> it

so then you're left with these two
sections<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.470> curled<00:03:34.920> hair<00:03:35.190> then<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.790> take

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.939 
and that's basically all you have to do
it's<00:04:44.729> really<00:04:44.970> easy<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:45.600> it's<00:04:46.410> great<00:04:46.710> for<00:04:46.889> your

this<00:04:50.940> on<00:04:51.120> school<00:04:51.389> day<00:04:51.600> so<00:04:51.660> that<00:04:51.930> way<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.050> don't

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
this on school day so that way I don't

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:53.689 
this on school day so that way I don't
have<00:04:52.229> to<00:04:52.350> wake<00:04:52.530> up<00:04:52.650> extra<00:04:52.979> earlier<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.370> my<00:04:53.520> hair

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
have to wake up extra earlier to my hair

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.400 
have to wake up extra earlier to my hair
I'd<00:04:53.880> have<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.150> take<00:04:54.270> it<00:04:54.419> all<00:04:54.539> out<00:04:54.750> and<00:04:55.020> put<00:04:55.229> some

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
I'd have to take it all out and put some

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.200 
I'd have to take it all out and put some
product<00:04:55.740> in<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.100> I'm<00:04:56.460> good

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.860 

so<00:05:02.210> basically<00:05:02.720> this<00:05:02.990> is<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.340> completed<00:05:04.870> hair

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
so basically this is the completed hair

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.070 
so basically this is the completed hair
look<00:05:06.139> and<00:05:06.500> I<00:05:07.129> also<00:05:07.340> have<00:05:07.729> another<00:05:08.080> heatless

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
look and I also have another heatless

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.529 
look and I also have another heatless
way<00:05:09.680> I<00:05:09.710> do<00:05:09.949> my<00:05:10.220> curls<00:05:10.580> that<00:05:10.789> I<00:05:10.819> have<00:05:11.060> been<00:05:11.240> doing

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
way I do my curls that I have been doing

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.230 
way I do my curls that I have been doing
since<00:05:11.750> about<00:05:12.080> beep<00:05:12.860> grade<00:05:13.280> that<00:05:13.849> I<00:05:13.879> think

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
since about beep grade that I think

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.659 
since about beep grade that I think
works<00:05:14.479> the<00:05:14.960> best<00:05:15.319> and<00:05:15.620> it<00:05:15.770> is<00:05:15.830> actually<00:05:16.340> in<00:05:16.520> my

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
works the best and it is actually in my

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.790 
works the best and it is actually in my
first<00:05:16.970> video<00:05:17.120> I<00:05:17.599> showed<00:05:18.110> you<00:05:18.229> guys<00:05:18.289> how<00:05:18.409> to<00:05:18.590> do

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
first video I showed you guys how to do

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.740 
first video I showed you guys how to do
that<00:05:18.919> but<00:05:19.460> I<00:05:19.639> thought<00:05:19.909> maybe<00:05:20.180> I<00:05:20.330> should<00:05:20.419> do

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
that but I thought maybe I should do

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.649 
that but I thought maybe I should do
kind<00:05:20.990> of<00:05:21.080> in<00:05:21.379> updated<00:05:22.250> version<00:05:22.669> I<00:05:22.879> still<00:05:23.479> do<00:05:23.629> it

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
kind of in updated version I still do it

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:25.029 
kind of in updated version I still do it
the<00:05:23.840> same<00:05:24.050> way<00:05:24.080> but<00:05:24.319> it<00:05:24.590> might<00:05:24.710> be<00:05:24.830> a<00:05:24.860> little

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
the same way but it might be a little

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.129 
the same way but it might be a little
bit<00:05:25.280> clearer<00:05:25.639> now<00:05:26.000> that<00:05:26.240> you<00:05:26.750> know<00:05:26.840> I've<00:05:26.990> been

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139

just think it's a lot faster than having

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.820 
just think it's a lot faster than having
to<00:05:49.370> have<00:05:49.460> to<00:05:49.610> curl<00:05:49.789> my<00:05:49.969> hair<00:05:50.000> and<00:05:50.629> I<00:05:51.379> hope<00:05:51.650> that
