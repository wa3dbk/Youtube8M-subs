00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.410 
example of one and this would be a
vertical<00:01:31.829> credit<00:01:32.490> spread<00:01:32.700> actually<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> couple

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
vertical credit spread actually a couple

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.330 
vertical credit spread actually a couple
of<00:01:33.509> vertical<00:01:33.810> credit<00:01:34.079> spreads<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:35.220> can

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
of vertical credit spreads as you can

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.590 
of vertical credit spreads as you can
see<00:01:35.460> here<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.790> last<00:01:35.909> video<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> showed<00:01:36.390> you

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
see here in the last video I showed you

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600 
see here in the last video I showed you
this<00:01:36.840> goldman<00:01:37.470> sachs<00:01:37.740> put<00:01:38.100> option<00:01:38.400> trade

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
this goldman sachs put option trade

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.760 
this goldman sachs put option trade
where<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:38.939> made<00:01:39.180> money<00:01:39.479> when<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> stock<00:01:40.439> fell

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
where we made money when the stock fell

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.560 
where we made money when the stock fell
so<00:01:41.280> here's<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.610> couple<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.939> vertical<00:01:42.299> credit

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
so here's a couple of vertical credit

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.469 
so here's a couple of vertical credit
spread<00:01:42.780> trades<00:01:43.049> here<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:43.979> 1212<00:01:44.490> we<00:01:44.700> sold<00:01:44.970> 20

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
spread trades here on 1212 we sold 20

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.719 
spread trades here on 1212 we sold 20
vertical<00:01:46.409> credit<00:01:46.710> spreads<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.189> SP<00:01:47.549> why

now<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.840> way<00:02:13.110> these<00:02:13.349> trades

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
now the way these trades

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.990 
now the way these trades
work<00:02:14.069> or<00:02:14.480> you're<00:02:15.480> essentially<00:02:15.990> selling<00:02:16.290> time

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000

and that's a whole training and of
itself<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.420> just<00:02:21.660> know<00:02:21.810> there<00:02:22.050> are

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
itself but just know there are

money that doesn't really require

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.880 
money that doesn't really require
directional<00:02:27.690> movement<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.290> stock<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.739> mean

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
directional movement of the stock I mean

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.410 
directional movement of the stock I mean
the<00:02:28.980> stock<00:02:29.250> could<00:02:29.400> literally<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.940> sit<00:02:30.180> there

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
the stock could literally just sit there

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.630 
the stock could literally just sit there
you'll<00:02:30.930> still<00:02:31.200> make<00:02:31.230> money<00:02:31.650> now<00:02:32.190> again<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
you'll still make money now again on the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.640 
you'll still make money now again on the
surface<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.209> might<00:02:33.510> not<00:02:33.660> make<00:02:33.840> sense<00:02:34.110> but

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
surface that might not make sense but

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.559 
surface that might not make sense but
just<00:02:34.860> know<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.220> possible<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:36.090> here's

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
just know it's possible and here's

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.229 
just know it's possible and here's
another<00:02:36.750> one<00:02:37.200> where<00:02:37.800> we<00:02:37.830> sold<00:02:38.100> about<00:02:38.160> 50<00:02:38.670> our

the way credit spreads work are again

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.210 
the way credit spreads work are again
your<00:03:06.209> selling<00:03:06.569> time<00:03:06.810> it's<00:03:07.110> like<00:03:07.319> a<00:03:07.590> wasting

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
your selling time it's like a wasting

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.059 
your selling time it's like a wasting
asset<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.850> actually<00:03:09.269> want<00:03:09.569> time<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.530> dwindle

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
asset you actually want time to dwindle

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.970 
asset you actually want time to dwindle
down<00:03:11.250> because<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.299> more<00:03:12.540> time<00:03:13.470> join<00:03:13.799> those

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
down because the more time join those

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.640 
down because the more time join those
down<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.790> cheaper<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.690> contracts<00:03:16.200> will<00:03:16.410> get

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
down the cheaper the contracts will get

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.650 
down the cheaper the contracts will get
so<00:03:17.250> here's<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.730> summary<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.209> sell<00:03:18.420> them<00:03:18.540> at<00:03:18.630> a

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
so here's a summary you sell them at a

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.180 
so here's a summary you sell them at a
higher<00:03:18.870> price<00:03:19.200> here<00:03:19.820> so<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.030> vertical<00:03:22.190> credit

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
higher price here so the vertical credit

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.069 
higher price here so the vertical credit
spreads<00:03:23.400> at<00:03:23.609> 52<00:03:24.150> sold<00:03:24.540> them<00:03:24.660> at<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.780> higher

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
spreads at 52 sold them at a higher

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.770 
spreads at 52 sold them at a higher
price<00:03:25.470> bought<00:03:26.459> them<00:03:26.670> back<00:03:26.910> at<00:03:27.269> a<00:03:27.299> cheaper

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
price bought them back at a cheaper

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.199 
price bought them back at a cheaper
price<00:03:27.890> for<00:03:29.209> was<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.390> twenty<00:03:31.290> three<00:03:31.829> cents<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:32.880> I

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
price for was it twenty three cents so I

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.970 
price for was it twenty three cents so I
bought<00:03:33.540> them<00:03:33.660> back<00:03:33.780> cheaper<00:03:34.260> than<00:03:34.410> how<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:34.590> sold

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
bought them back cheaper than how I sold

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.440 
bought them back cheaper than how I sold
them<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.310> that's<00:03:35.700> how<00:03:35.880> it<00:03:36.030> works

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
them and that's how it works

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.490 
them and that's how it works
so<00:03:36.959> that's<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.739> roundabout<00:03:38.630> way<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.660> kind<00:03:40.350> of

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
so that's a roundabout way to kind of

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.979 
so that's a roundabout way to kind of
explain<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.549> theory<00:03:42.000> behind<00:03:42.209> how<00:03:42.630> credit

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
explain the theory behind how credit

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.930 
explain the theory behind how credit
spreads<00:03:43.290> work<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.829> so<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.250> wanted<00:03:44.579> to<00:03:44.670> in<00:03:44.790> this

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
spreads work and so I wanted to in this

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.060 
spreads work and so I wanted to in this
