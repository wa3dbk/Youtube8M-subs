00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.309
 well we are always going to prepare a few taxpayers what you eat in 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.069
 Central America before and those that I have not done in my life 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:19.019
 I hope that I get it right for it does not need to reform and poverty 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.650
 the goiÃ¡s and yahoo 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.650
 in a bowl we put half a beer 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.349
 and olive oil 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.140
 and we are adding the flour little by little so they gave us a group 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.000
 the objective of the PSOE that does not stick to the hands or the countertop 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.290
 so let's go adding flour 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.290
 until get it 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.500
 p 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 when it has consistency we add more olive oil 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.450
 and it is already 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.170
 we go down to rest covered with a damp cloth 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.520
 He said that this dough does not have to grow 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 we peel three capos 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.600
 and a million users 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.600
 count four big I think matches 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.120
 Fry the fire through the eyes and add the onion 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.730
 if it occurs to me that we can put salt and pepper how not 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.910
 thyme laurel 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.330
 we remove travel 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
 at very slow heat 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:12.029
 we are going to extend 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.719
 I've always liked celtics or empanadas 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.609
 we bend to transport the best 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.810
 and on a tray with aluminum foil or baking paper Nacho 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.939
 let's put some brandy 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.939
 to the onion 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.519
 and when it has caramelized 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.289
 you have to wait for it to cool 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:53.599
 I'm pretty impatient 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.519
 the goal in the freezer 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.689
 just so that they expand or freeze 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.689
 we chop the dough so that it does not swell 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:11.179
 and we add the onion 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:15.149
 we extend it well 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.609
 we cover it with another half 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.419
 we mark 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.479
 how far the onion comes 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:37.509
 mass 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:40.509
 surplus 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:49.289
 and with a fork we close the edges 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.159
 we go back to paint so the mass tells us 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.299
 and we are going to visit Cuba 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.839
 with egg white 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:06.839
 because it leaves much more sophisticated color 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.370
 when we put the oven without being at the top 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.459
 then we leave it half an hour 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.459
 at 5 degrees 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.529
 it's incredible true meadow 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:40.009
 very good 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.009
 I hope you like a hug until robbery 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.630
