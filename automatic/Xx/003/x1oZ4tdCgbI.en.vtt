with one two and three we're going to

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.240 
with one two and three we're going to
play<00:00:27.650> it<00:00:27.770> with<00:00:27.890> two<00:00:28.640> three<00:00:29.030> and<00:00:29.120> four<00:00:30.250> then

we're<00:00:31.400> going<00:00:31.520> to<00:00:31.550> slide<00:00:32.000> up<00:00:32.390> a<00:00:32.750> step<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:33.350> a

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
we're going to slide up a step and a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.110 
we're going to slide up a step and a
half<00:00:33.850> so<00:00:34.850> three<00:00:35.270> frets<00:00:35.540> one<00:00:36.020> two<00:00:36.379> three<00:00:36.860> and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
half so three frets one two three and

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.170 
half so three frets one two three and
then<00:00:38.120> we're<00:00:38.360> going<00:00:38.480> to<00:00:38.540> bar<00:00:39.129> with<00:00:40.129> our<00:00:40.489> first

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
then we're going to bar with our first

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:52.959 
then we're going to bar with our first
finger<00:00:41.809> on<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:43.790> third<00:00:44.210> fret<00:00:47.409> so<00:00:48.409> be<00:00:48.620> like<00:00:48.769> that

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.720 

so<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:53.870> have<00:00:54.109> an<00:00:54.230> a<00:00:54.469> shape<00:00:54.769> here<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.370> then

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
so you have an a shape here and then

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.819 
so you have an a shape here and then
your<00:00:55.910> first<00:00:56.570> finger<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:57.019> barring<00:00:57.469> through<00:00:57.710> all

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
your first finger is barring through all

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.680 
your first finger is barring through all
the<00:00:59.440> 1<00:01:00.440> through<00:01:00.649> 5<00:01:00.890> strings<00:01:01.539> except<00:01:02.539> it's

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
the 1 through 5 strings except it's

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.380 
the 1 through 5 strings except it's
really<00:01:03.019> only<00:01:03.140> playing<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:04.100> first<00:01:04.820> string<00:01:05.239> and

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
really only playing the first string and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.120 
really only playing the first string and
the<00:01:05.449> fifth<00:01:05.720> string<00:01:05.990> just<00:01:06.409> like<00:01:06.530> with<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:06.950> B

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
the fifth string just like with the B

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.680 
the fifth string just like with the B
minor<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:09.280> holding<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:10.430> like<00:01:10.580> this<00:01:10.820> is<00:01:11.090> not

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
minor and holding it like this is not

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.630 
minor and holding it like this is not
very<00:01:12.200> practical<00:01:12.440> for<00:01:12.979> most<00:01:13.070> people<00:01:13.490> because

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
very practical for most people because

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.060 
very practical for most people because
it's<00:01:14.509> really<00:01:14.840> tight<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.440> get<00:01:15.530> all<00:01:15.799> three

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
it's really tight to get all three

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.950 
it's really tight to get all three
fingers<00:01:16.310> in<00:01:16.729> especially<00:01:17.390> as<00:01:17.509> you<00:01:17.630> move<00:01:17.659> up<00:01:17.930> the

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
fingers in especially as you move up the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.039 
fingers in especially as you move up the
fretboard<00:01:18.409> and<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.100> frets<00:01:19.340> get<00:01:19.520> smaller<00:01:20.049> it's

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
fretboard and the frets get smaller it's

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.320 
fretboard and the frets get smaller it's
almost<00:01:21.259> impossible<00:01:21.590> for<00:01:22.039> most<00:01:22.159> people<00:01:22.549> so

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
almost impossible for most people so

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.940 
almost impossible for most people so
what<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:23.690> do<00:01:23.869> instead<00:01:24.320> of<00:01:24.380> doing<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:24.890> with

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
what you do instead of doing it with

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.969 
what you do instead of doing it with
your<00:01:27.850> second<00:01:28.850> third<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.240> fourth<00:01:29.690> finger<00:01:30.229> you

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
your second third and fourth finger you

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.020 
your second third and fourth finger you
bar<00:01:31.630> where<00:01:32.630> these<00:01:32.810> fingers<00:01:33.289> are<00:01:33.440> with<00:01:34.220> your

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
bar where these fingers are with your

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.840 
bar where these fingers are with your
third<00:01:35.390> finger<00:01:35.659> so<00:01:36.619> it'd<00:01:36.710> be<00:01:36.830> like<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.280> and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
third finger so it'd be like that and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.669 
third finger so it'd be like that and
I'll<00:01:38.000> move<00:01:38.119> my<00:01:38.179> fingers<00:01:38.630> out<00:01:38.750> of<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.899> way<00:01:38.990> so

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
I'll move my fingers out of the way so

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.770 
I'll move my fingers out of the way so
this<00:01:39.920> finger<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.369> barring<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:42.970> fourth<00:01:43.970> third

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
this finger is barring the fourth third

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.190 
this finger is barring the fourth third
and<00:01:45.170> second<00:01:45.649> string<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:46.850> this<00:01:47.360> is<00:01:47.569> a<00:01:47.600> pretty

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
and second string so this is a pretty

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.100 
and second string so this is a pretty
difficult<00:01:48.500> one<00:01:49.009> to<00:01:49.039> get<00:01:49.670> at<00:01:49.850> first<00:01:50.119> since

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
difficult one to get at first since

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.730 
difficult one to get at first since
you're<00:01:51.560> having<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:51.979> do<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:52.520> much<00:01:52.580> with<00:01:52.970> your

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
you're having to do so much with your

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.200 
you're having to do so much with your
third<00:01:54.740> finger<00:01:54.770> it's<00:01:55.460> a<00:01:55.490> lot<00:01:55.640> harder<00:01:55.819> to<00:01:55.940> borrow

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
third finger it's a lot harder to borrow

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.729 
third finger it's a lot harder to borrow
with<00:01:56.479> your<00:01:56.630> third<00:01:56.840> finger<00:01:56.869> than<00:01:57.289> it<00:01:57.410> is<00:01:57.560> with

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:57.739 
with your third finger than it is with

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:59.770 
with your third finger than it is with
your<00:01:57.800> first<00:01:58.129> finger<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.360> thing<00:01:59.569> about

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
your first finger and the thing about

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.949 
your first finger and the thing about
this<00:02:00.110> one<00:02:00.470> is<00:02:02.020> most<00:02:03.020> people<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.860> me<00:02:04.310> included

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
this one is most people and me included

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:10.199 
this one is most people and me included
camp<00:02:05.959> Barre<00:02:06.670> those<00:02:07.670> three<00:02:08.090> strings<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:09.020> not

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
camp Barre those three strings and not

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.000

those three strings your first finger is

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.369 
those three strings your first finger is
actually<00:02:20.060> not<00:02:20.180> barring<00:02:20.480> anymore<00:02:20.959> it's<00:02:21.080> just

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
actually not barring anymore it's just

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.339 
actually not barring anymore it's just
playing<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.920> C<00:02:22.250> note<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.569> third

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.589 
fret so if I really really try and arch
my<00:02:33.170> finger<00:02:33.530> as<00:02:33.620> much<00:02:33.769> as<00:02:33.920> possible<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.670> can<00:02:35.390> get

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
my finger as much as possible I can get

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.470 
my finger as much as possible I can get
that<00:02:35.750> first<00:02:36.050> string<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:36.760> but<00:02:37.760> it's<00:02:38.030> really

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
that first string in but it's really

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.869 
that first string in but it's really
uncomfortable<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:40.160> honestly<00:02:40.310> don't<00:02:40.730> even

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
uncomfortable and I honestly don't even

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.610 
uncomfortable and I honestly don't even
like<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.360> sound<00:02:41.599> of<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:41.810> first<00:02:42.080> string<00:02:42.410> in

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
like the sound of that first string in

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.430 
like the sound of that first string in
with<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:43.190> chord<00:02:43.550> so<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.790> never<00:02:43.989> even<00:02:44.989> try<00:02:45.379> to

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
with this chord so I never even try to

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.240 
with this chord so I never even try to
play<00:02:45.709> it<00:02:45.800> that<00:02:45.950> way

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.460 

so<00:02:52.090> you'll<00:02:52.300> see<00:02:52.480> on<00:02:52.600> your<00:02:52.630> charts<00:02:53.200> where<00:02:53.440> I

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
so you'll see on your charts where I

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.350 
so you'll see on your charts where I
gave<00:02:53.830> three<00:02:54.100> examples<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.760> how<00:02:54.820> to<00:02:54.970> play<00:02:55.210> the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
gave three examples of how to play the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.480 
gave three examples of how to play the
first<00:02:55.600> was<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:56.380> play<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.650> with<00:02:56.860> these<00:02:57.160> three

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
first was to play it with these three

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.570 
first was to play it with these three
fingers<00:02:57.760> making<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.360> a<00:02:58.390> shape<00:02:59.280> then<00:03:00.280> another

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
fingers making that a shape then another

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.540 
fingers making that a shape then another
one<00:03:00.850> was<00:03:01.350> barring<00:03:02.350> with<00:03:02.860> this<00:03:03.100> finger<00:03:03.520> and

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
one was barring with this finger and

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.640 
one was barring with this finger and
barring<00:03:04.270> with<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.630> finger<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.230> barring<00:03:05.440> with

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
barring with that finger so barring with

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.699 
barring with that finger so barring with
your<00:03:05.800> third<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:06.400> your<00:03:06.640> first<00:03:06.820> finger<00:03:06.970> and

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
your third and your first finger and

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.690 
your third and your first finger and
those<00:03:08.709> are<00:03:08.860> for<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.040> people<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.340> can

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
those are for the people that can

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.310 
those are for the people that can
actually<00:03:09.880> avoid<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:10.660> first<00:03:10.959> string<00:03:11.290> with

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
actually avoid this first string with

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.730 
actually avoid this first string with
their<00:03:11.800> third<00:03:12.430> finger<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.350> then<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.530> other

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
their third finger and then the other

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.830 
their third finger and then the other
option<00:03:14.950> is<00:03:15.310> how<00:03:15.520> I<00:03:15.550> play<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:16.000> which<00:03:16.270> is<00:03:16.420> barring

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
option is how I play it which is barring

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.170 
option is how I play it which is barring
with<00:03:16.990> your<00:03:17.140> third<00:03:17.350> finger<00:03:17.850> muting<00:03:18.850> out<00:03:18.970> the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
with your third finger muting out the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.530 
with your third finger muting out the
first<00:03:19.450> string<00:03:19.720> with<00:03:19.870> your<00:03:19.900> third<00:03:20.680> finger<00:03:20.709> and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
first string with your third finger and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.940 
first string with your third finger and
only<00:03:22.540> playing<00:03:22.810> one<00:03:23.110> note<00:03:23.320> with<00:03:23.560> your<00:03:23.680> first

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
only playing one note with your first

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.880 
only playing one note with your first
finger<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.270> would<00:03:25.390> be

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.300 

and<00:03:30.430> then<00:03:30.640> this<00:03:31.590> string<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.770> first<00:03:33.010> thing<00:03:33.190> is

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
and then this string the first thing is

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.200 
and then this string the first thing is
just<00:03:33.340> muted<00:03:33.820> out<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:35.350> this<00:03:35.710> one's<00:03:35.950> going<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.250> be

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
just muted out so this one's going to be

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.850 
just muted out so this one's going to be
pretty<00:03:37.600> difficult<00:03:37.870> like<00:03:38.230> I<00:03:38.380> said<00:03:38.620> on<00:03:38.830> your

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
pretty difficult like I said on your

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.730 
pretty difficult like I said on your
hand<00:03:39.280> it's<00:03:39.940> pretty<00:03:40.300> difficult<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:41.020> get<00:03:41.500> used

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
hand it's pretty difficult to get used

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.940 
hand it's pretty difficult to get used
to<00:03:42.040> this<00:03:42.220> finger<00:03:42.820> doing<00:03:43.120> a<00:03:43.210> bar<00:03:43.450> and<00:03:43.950> you're

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
to this finger doing a bar and you're

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.710 
to this finger doing a bar and you're
just<00:03:45.100> going<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.340> have<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.670> work<00:03:46.090> at<00:03:46.300> it<00:03:46.420> slowly

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
just going to have to work at it slowly

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.920 
just going to have to work at it slowly
and<00:03:47.380> what<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:47.770> can<00:03:47.950> do<00:03:48.100> is<00:03:48.280> just<00:03:48.550> practice

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
and what you can do is just practice

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.050 
and what you can do is just practice
barring<00:03:49.930> with<00:03:50.830> your<00:03:51.040> third<00:03:51.280> finger<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:51.880> try

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
barring with your third finger and try

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.820 
barring with your third finger and try
to<00:03:52.120> get<00:03:52.330> those<00:03:52.570> three<00:03:52.870> strings<00:03:53.320> to<00:03:53.530> ring<00:03:53.710> out

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
to get those three strings to ring out

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.870 
to get those three strings to ring out
and<00:03:54.370> not<00:03:55.270> worry<00:03:55.300> about<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:55.810> other<00:03:56.080> strings<00:03:56.880> so

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
and not worry about the other strings so

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.340 
and not worry about the other strings so
just<00:03:58.090> trying<00:03:58.300> to<00:03:58.390> get<00:03:58.480> your<00:03:58.660> third<00:03:58.990> finger<00:03:59.170> to

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
just trying to get your third finger to

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.410 
just trying to get your third finger to
be<00:03:59.470> able<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.650> bar<00:03:59.890> all<00:04:00.190> three<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.270> those

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
be able to bar all three of those

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.420 
be able to bar all three of those
strings<00:04:01.810> is<00:04:02.050> probably<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.650> first<00:04:02.860> step<00:04:03.190> for

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
strings is probably the first step for

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.060 
strings is probably the first step for
you<00:04:03.550> and<00:04:03.990> your<00:04:04.990> thumb<00:04:05.230> still<00:04:05.590> needs<00:04:05.800> to<00:04:05.890> be

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
you and your thumb still needs to be

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.800 
you and your thumb still needs to be
where<00:04:06.640> it<00:04:06.760> normally<00:04:06.940> is<00:04:07.300> you're<00:04:07.480> not<00:04:07.600> going<00:04:07.750> to

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
where it normally is you're not going to

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.360 
where it normally is you're not going to
put<00:04:07.959> your<00:04:08.080> thumb<00:04:08.350> behind<00:04:08.500> your<00:04:08.860> first<00:04:09.100> finger

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
put your thumb behind your first finger

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.890 
put your thumb behind your first finger
it's<00:04:09.489> going<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.670> be<00:04:09.790> behind<00:04:10.480> your<00:04:10.660> third

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
it's going to be behind your third

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.690 
it's going to be behind your third
finger<00:04:11.050> is<00:04:11.200> going<00:04:11.260> to<00:04:11.440> be<00:04:11.500> behind<00:04:11.920> your<00:04:12.220> first

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
finger is going to be behind your first

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.340 
finger is going to be behind your first
finger<00:04:13.060> still<00:04:15.299> so<00:04:16.299> just<00:04:16.480> work<00:04:16.660> at<00:04:16.840> that<00:04:17.019> trying

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
finger still so just work at that trying

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.680 
finger still so just work at that trying
to<00:04:17.440> get<00:04:17.590> your<00:04:17.890> third<00:04:18.280> finger<00:04:18.730> to<00:04:19.000> be<00:04:19.450> able<00:04:19.600> to

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
to get your third finger to be able to

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.420 
to get your third finger to be able to
bar<00:04:19.900> all<00:04:20.079> three<00:04:20.410> of<00:04:20.500> these<00:04:20.620> strings<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:21.340> make

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
bar all three of these strings and make

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.490 
bar all three of these strings and make
each<00:04:21.609> one<00:04:21.850> ring<00:04:22.030> out<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.480> then<00:04:23.110> when<00:04:23.260> you<00:04:23.350> get

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
each one ring out and then when you get

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.260 
each one ring out and then when you get
that<00:04:23.680> you<00:04:23.740> can<00:04:24.070> add<00:04:24.280> in<00:04:24.490> your<00:04:24.640> first<00:04:24.910> finger

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
that you can add in your first finger

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.170 
that you can add in your first finger
but<00:04:25.930> this<00:04:26.260> one<00:04:26.470> will<00:04:26.620> tire<00:04:27.520> out<00:04:27.760> your<00:04:27.790> hand

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
but this one will tire out your hand

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.360 
but this one will tire out your hand
pretty<00:04:28.450> quickly<00:04:28.540> because<00:04:29.320> of<00:04:29.530> how<00:04:30.130> you're

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
pretty quickly because of how you're

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.180 
pretty quickly because of how you're
holding<00:04:30.790> it<00:04:30.970> so<00:04:31.630> just<00:04:32.440> do<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:32.770> a<00:04:32.800> little<00:04:33.010> bit

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
holding it so just do it a little bit

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.440 
holding it so just do it a little bit
each<00:04:33.340> day<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:33.940> don't<00:04:34.150> get<00:04:34.270> frustrated

each day and don't get frustrated
frustrated<00:04:35.229> with<00:04:35.650> this<00:04:35.770> one<00:04:36.010> because<00:04:36.130> it's<00:04:36.430> a

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
frustrated with this one because it's a

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.850 
frustrated with this one because it's a
difficult<00:04:36.850> one

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.439 

for<00:04:40.860> practice<00:04:41.219> just<00:04:41.400> get<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.699> C<00:04:41.939> major<00:04:42.150> bar

day and give it a break at that bar
going<00:05:03.240> first<00:05:03.780> over<00:05:04.409> that<00:05:04.590> a<00:05:04.770> shape<00:05:05.189> with<00:05:05.400> your

going first over that a shape with your
third<00:05:05.789> finger<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:07.039> really<00:05:08.039> work<00:05:08.219> at<00:05:08.370> that

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
third finger and really work at that

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.420 
third finger and really work at that
first<00:05:08.909> but<00:05:09.210> really<00:05:09.629> it<00:05:10.229> it's<00:05:10.710> an<00:05:10.889> easy<00:05:11.069> one<00:05:11.340> to

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
first but really it it's an easy one to

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.580 
first but really it it's an easy one to
hurt<00:05:11.610> your<00:05:11.759> hand

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
hurt your hand

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.159 
hurt your hand
doing<00:05:13.590> if<00:05:13.740> you<00:05:13.889> do<00:05:14.430> it<00:05:14.580> too<00:05:14.789> much<00:05:14.819> so<00:05:15.419> like<00:05:16.020> I

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
doing if you do it too much so like I

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.779 
doing if you do it too much so like I
said<00:05:16.229> just<00:05:16.409> a<00:05:16.650> little<00:05:16.919> bit<00:05:17.039> each<00:05:17.159> day<00:05:17.219> and

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
said just a little bit each day and

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.659 
said just a little bit each day and
eventually<00:05:18.539> it'll<00:05:18.750> come<00:05:19.020> fairly<00:05:19.919> easy<00:05:20.159> to<00:05:20.490> use

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
eventually it'll come fairly easy to use

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:21.980 
eventually it'll come fairly easy to use
so<00:05:20.879> just<00:05:21.090> work<00:05:21.240> at<00:05:21.419> it<00:05:21.449> until<00:05:21.779> you<00:05:21.840> have<00:05:21.960> it

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
so just work at it until you have it

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.749 
so just work at it until you have it
down<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.889> once<00:05:23.069> you<00:05:23.159> have<00:05:23.250> it<00:05:23.279> down<00:05:23.490> you<00:05:23.610> can

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
down and once you have it down you can

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.189 
down and once you have it down you can
move<00:05:23.849> on<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.180> next<00:05:24.360> lesson<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:24.930> we'll

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
move on to the next lesson and we'll

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:34.110 
move on to the next lesson and we'll
keep<00:05:25.379> moving<00:05:25.740> forward

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.180
