00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.000 
have to measure where the leather will
start<00:02:54.769> without<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.910> seam<00:02:56.150> allowance<00:02:57.010> now

something like that

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.370 
something like that
you<00:03:12.799> can<00:03:12.980> use<00:03:13.130> little<00:03:13.579> clips<00:03:13.970> on<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.329> side<00:03:14.599> but

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
you can use little clips on the side but

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.470 
you can use little clips on the side but
you<00:03:15.530> should<00:03:15.829> avoid<00:03:16.099> using<00:03:16.160> pins<00:03:16.819> so<00:03:17.060> again<00:03:17.329> you

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
you should avoid using pins so again you

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.420 
you should avoid using pins so again you

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.850 
don't puncture your leather the next
thing<00:03:19.640> is<00:03:19.849> to<00:03:19.880> use<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.780> walking<00:03:21.349> foot<00:03:21.590> or<00:03:21.829> a

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
thing is to use a walking foot or a

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.009 
thing is to use a walking foot or a
Teflon<00:03:22.610> foot<00:03:22.940> with<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.239> leather<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.989> leather

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
Teflon foot with the leather the leather

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.860 
Teflon foot with the leather the leather
can<00:03:24.470> have<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.650> tendency<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.310> stick<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.299> regular

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
can have a tendency to stick to regular

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.530 
can have a tendency to stick to regular
presser<00:03:27.290> feet<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:28.010> if<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.310> have<00:03:28.760> one<00:03:29.299> of<00:03:29.420> those

presser feet so if you have one of those

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.300 
presser feet so if you have one of those
specialty<00:03:30.019> feet<00:03:30.410> I<00:03:30.590> think<00:03:30.860> you'll<00:03:31.010> have<00:03:31.130> an

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
specialty feet I think you'll have an

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.670 
specialty feet I think you'll have an
easier<00:03:31.670> time<00:03:31.730> sewing<00:03:32.480> if<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:33.079> don't<00:03:33.410> have<00:03:33.650> a

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
easier time sewing if you don't have a

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.860 
easier time sewing if you don't have a
specialty<00:03:34.190> foot<00:03:34.579> you<00:03:34.790> can<00:03:34.940> try<00:03:35.209> taking<00:03:35.750> a

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
specialty foot you can try taking a

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.539 
specialty foot you can try taking a
piece<00:03:36.049> of<00:03:36.200> tissue<00:03:36.410> paper<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.920> putting<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.400> on

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549

top of the leather and sewing those
together<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:40.130> then<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:40.400> can<00:03:40.549> rip<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.880> tissue

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
together and then you can rip the tissue

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.509 
together and then you can rip the tissue
paper<00:03:41.209> off<00:03:41.630> when<00:03:41.840> you're<00:03:41.959> done<00:03:41.989> after<00:03:42.769> you've
