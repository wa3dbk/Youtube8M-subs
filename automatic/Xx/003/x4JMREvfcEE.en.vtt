part<00:01:08.369> one<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.850> recipe<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.810> ranch

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
part one of this recipe is the ranch

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.830 
part one of this recipe is the ranch
dressing<00:01:10.409> part<00:01:10.979> two<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.270> crudité

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
dressing part two is the crudité

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.750 
dressing part two is the crudité
and<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.110> crudité<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.710> French<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.369> raw

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and so crudité is French for raw

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.480 
and so crudité is French for raw
vegetables<00:01:15.330> essentially<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.990> crude<00:01:16.710> means<00:01:16.979> raw

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
vegetables essentially a crude means raw

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.340 
vegetables essentially a crude means raw
and<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.000> what<00:01:18.210> we're<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.600> doing<00:01:18.780> is

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and so what we're going to be doing is

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.929 
and so what we're going to be doing is
actually<00:01:19.650> blanching<00:01:20.159> them<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.490> technically

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
actually blanching them so technically

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.390 
actually blanching them so technically
they're<00:01:21.150> not<00:01:21.180> rough<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.229> they're<00:01:22.439> blanching

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
they're not rough but they're blanching

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.649 
they're not rough but they're blanching
them<00:01:23.549> actually<00:01:23.909> makes<00:01:24.090> them<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> little<00:01:24.540> bit

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
them actually makes them a little bit

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.380 
them actually makes them a little bit
better<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.229> raw<00:01:25.500> plus<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.090> want<00:01:27.299> to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
better it's like raw plus so you want to

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.569 
better it's like raw plus so you want to
use<00:01:27.540> sort<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.960> thick<00:01:28.380> vegetables<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
use sort of thick vegetables like you

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.190 
use sort of thick vegetables like you
wouldn't<00:01:29.790> want<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.329> with<00:01:30.600> cucumbers

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
wouldn't want to do this with cucumbers

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.810 
wouldn't want to do this with cucumbers
for<00:01:31.320> instance<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.430> goal<00:01:32.640> when<00:01:32.790> you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
for instance and the goal when you

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.969 
for instance and the goal when you
blanch<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:34.049> want<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.350> get<00:01:34.439> them<00:01:34.650> tender

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
blanch is you want to get them tender

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.890 
blanch is you want to get them tender
and<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:35.850> get<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> really<00:01:36.360> beautiful<00:01:36.479> bright

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and then get a really beautiful bright

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.140 
and then get a really beautiful bright
color<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.250> simple<00:01:38.490> once<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.970> do

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
color and it's so simple once you do

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.700 
color and it's so simple once you do
this<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.450> will<00:01:39.600> continue<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.590> this

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
this you will continue to do this

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.109 
this you will continue to do this
because<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.100> makes<00:01:41.430> everything<00:01:41.759> look<00:01:41.939> so

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
because it just makes everything look so

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.690 
because it just makes everything look so
much<00:01:42.689> prettier<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.380> party<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:44.610> you

ready<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.790> go<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:18.310> I'm<00:02:18.430> just<00:02:18.580> going<00:02:18.790> to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
ready to go and I'm just going to

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.940 
ready to go and I'm just going to
basically<00:02:19.030> put<00:02:19.570> my<00:02:19.840> vegetable<00:02:20.440> straight<00:02:20.680> into

basically put my vegetable straight into

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.950 
basically put my vegetable straight into
it<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:24.640> important<00:02:25.030> thing<00:02:25.180> when<00:02:25.270> blanching<00:02:25.810> is

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
it the important thing when blanching is

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.690 
it the important thing when blanching is
to<00:02:26.110> make<00:02:26.260> sure<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:26.590> everything<00:02:27.070> is<00:02:27.190> about

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
to make sure that everything is about

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.310 
to make sure that everything is about
the<00:02:27.940> same<00:02:28.120> size<00:02:28.360> just<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:28.990> everything

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
the same size just so that everything

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.680 
the same size just so that everything
cooks<00:02:29.650> at<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:29.950> same<00:02:30.280> rate<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:30.820> my<00:02:31.480> broccoli

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
cooks at the same rate so my broccoli

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.940 
cooks at the same rate so my broccoli
and<00:02:31.900> cauliflower<00:02:32.080> were<00:02:32.560> chopped<00:02:32.800> into

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
and cauliflower were chopped into

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.100 
and cauliflower were chopped into
florets<00:02:33.460> and<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:34.150> character<00:02:34.510> chopped<00:02:34.960> into

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
florets and the character chopped into

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.690 
florets and the character chopped into
sticks<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:35.920> that's<00:02:36.100> all<00:02:36.220> gonna<00:02:36.370> cook<00:02:36.520> at<00:02:36.640> about

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
sticks so that's all gonna cook at about

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.120 
sticks so that's all gonna cook at about
the<00:02:36.910> same<00:02:37.060> time<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:38.650> kind<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.070> the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
the same time so this is kind of the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.600 
the same time so this is kind of the
point<00:02:39.250> where<00:02:39.490> it's

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
point where it's

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.380 
point where it's
