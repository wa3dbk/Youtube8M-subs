00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.019 

okay<00:00:01.500> now<00:00:01.800> we<00:00:01.860> have<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.810> Panasonic

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029 
okay now we have the Panasonic

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.770 
okay now we have the Panasonic
performanceplus<00:00:06.290> Platinum<00:00:07.700> vacuum<00:00:08.780> with

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
performanceplus Platinum vacuum with

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.180 
performanceplus Platinum vacuum with
HEPA<00:00:10.590> filter<00:00:11.190> system<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.410> Triforce<00:00:13.410> system

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.880 

basically<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.359> have<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.869> old<00:00:18.990> jet<00:00:19.350> flow<00:00:19.650> up

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
basically and I have the old jet flow up

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.220 
basically and I have the old jet flow up
here<00:00:20.160> again<00:00:20.510> which<00:00:21.510> we're<00:00:21.720> not<00:00:21.840> going<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.050> try

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
here again which we're not going to try

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.689 
here again which we're not going to try
that<00:00:22.260> out<00:00:22.529> because<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.859> saw<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:23.369> happened

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
that out because we saw what happened

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.200 
that out because we saw what happened
last<00:00:23.910> time<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.300> tried<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.689> out<00:00:24.750> but<00:00:26.210> looking

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
last time we tried that out but looking

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.970 
last time we tried that out but looking
at<00:00:27.390> them<00:00:28.310> the<00:00:29.310> performance<00:00:29.880> plus<00:00:30.150> is

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
at them the performance plus is

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.920 
at them the performance plus is
basically<00:00:31.980> an<00:00:33.469> updated<00:00:34.469> jet<00:00:34.739> flow<00:00:35.930> slightly

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
basically an updated jet flow slightly

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:51.350 
basically an updated jet flow slightly
different<00:00:46.250> but<00:00:47.250> for<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.700> most<00:00:47.940> part<00:00:50.360> they're

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
different but for the most part they're

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:09.950 
different but for the most part they're
fairly<00:00:52.170> similar<00:01:08.000> now<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.360> thing<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.630> they

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
fairly similar now one thing that they

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:21.080 
fairly similar now one thing that they
did<00:01:10.200> away<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:15.290> is<00:01:18.170> this<00:01:19.170> gizmo<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:20.369> which

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
did away with is this gizmo here which

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.880 
did away with is this gizmo here which
is<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.450> idler<00:01:21.930> wheel<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.530> shut<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
is that idler wheel to shut the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.690 
is that idler wheel to shut the
brushroll<00:01:23.340> off<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.500> that<00:01:25.500> was<00:01:25.710> where<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.310> were

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
brushroll off and that was where we were

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.170 
brushroll off and that was where we were
having<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.390> sticking<00:01:27.869> problems<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.939> belt

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
having the sticking problems or the belt

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.420 
having the sticking problems or the belt
slipping<00:01:31.110> problems<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.950> one<00:01:32.159> because

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
slipping problems on this one because

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.969 
slipping problems on this one because
this<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.380> felt<00:01:34.740> is

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
this is we can see here that felt is

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.310 
this is we can see here that felt is
shot<00:01:36.380> this<00:01:37.380> one's<00:01:37.650> still<00:01:37.890> okay<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:39.229> it's<00:01:40.229> not

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
shot this one's still okay but it's not

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.190 
shot this one's still okay but it's not
the<00:01:40.590> best<00:01:42.049> this<00:01:43.049> one<00:01:44.450> just<00:01:45.450> has<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.930> single

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
the best this one just has the single

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.819 
the best this one just has the single
belt<00:01:46.530> straight<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.159> motor<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.790> most

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
belt straight to the motor like most

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.280 
belt straight to the motor like most
uprights<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.210> also<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.540> see<00:01:51.780> here<00:01:52.110> we've

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
uprights and also we can see here we've

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.389 
uprights and also we can see here we've
just<00:01:52.530> got<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.799> two<00:01:53.240> two<00:01:54.240> brush<00:01:55.040> brush<00:01:56.040> roll

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
just got the two two brush brush roll

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.679 
just got the two two brush brush roll
and<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:56.850> are<00:01:57.000> very<00:01:58.250> small<00:02:01.159> bristles<00:02:02.689> this

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
and there are very small bristles this

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.790 
and there are very small bristles this
one<00:02:03.960> has<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:05.119> three<00:02:06.119> brush<00:02:06.680> roll

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.000 

and<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.700> much<00:02:12.540> stiffer<00:02:15.470> bristles<00:02:16.470> on<00:02:16.710> this

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and it's a much stiffer bristles on this

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.000 
and it's a much stiffer bristles on this
one<00:02:19.280> compared<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.580> one<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.660> light

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
one compared to that one and the light

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.520 
one compared to that one and the light
the<00:02:26.010> same<00:02:26.250> place<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:26.730> one<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.410> except<00:02:28.410> this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
the same place this one is except this

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.260 
the same place this one is except this
one<00:02:28.740> doesn't<00:02:28.920> have<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.190> separate<00:02:29.610> cover<00:02:29.820> over

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
one doesn't have a separate cover over

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.590 
one doesn't have a separate cover over
it<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.620> let's<00:02:31.980> get<00:02:32.100> this<00:02:32.250> back<00:02:32.459> together<00:02:32.610> we'll

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
it so let's get this back together we'll

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.100 
it so let's get this back together we'll
try<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:33.870> out<00:02:34.760> okay<00:02:35.760> now<00:02:35.790> before<00:02:36.150> we<00:02:36.480> fire<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.840> up

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
try it out okay now before we fire it up

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.860 
try it out okay now before we fire it up
this<00:02:37.770> one<00:02:38.010> uses<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.490> same<00:02:38.700> bag<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.630> jet

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
this one uses the same bag as the jet

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.400 
this one uses the same bag as the jet
flow<00:02:41.000> type<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.840> three<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:46.050> one<00:02:46.170> nice

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
flow type you and you three the one nice

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:55.040 
flow type you and you three the one nice
thing<00:02:46.440> about<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.980> jet<00:02:47.220> flow<00:02:47.520> though<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:54.050> it

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
thing about the jet flow though is it

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.270 
thing about the jet flow though is it
has<00:02:55.320> this<00:02:55.590> neat<00:02:55.860> little<00:02:58.070> attachment<00:02:59.070> thing

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
has this neat little attachment thing

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.530 
has this neat little attachment thing
here<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.670> pop<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.450> bag<00:03:00.660> on<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:03.090> then<00:03:03.450> you

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
here you pop the bag on and then you

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.690 
here you pop the bag on and then you
just<00:03:05.720> snap<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.900> back<00:03:06.930> in<00:03:07.350> there<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.430> and

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
just snap it back in there like that and

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.650 
just snap it back in there like that and
that's<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:12.120> lot<00:03:12.420> simpler<00:03:13.350> than<00:03:13.530> trying<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.660> jam

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
that's a lot simpler than trying to jam

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.310 
that's a lot simpler than trying to jam
the<00:03:15.959> bag<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.890> there<00:03:17.070> with<00:03:17.220> your<00:03:17.340> hands<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.660> now

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
the bag in there with your hands so now

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.470 
the bag in there with your hands so now
we<00:03:19.380> can<00:03:19.769> if<00:03:20.489> we<00:03:20.580> look<00:03:20.820> at<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.000> cover<00:03:21.239> here<00:03:21.570> -

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
we can if we look at the cover here -

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.340 
we can if we look at the cover here -
they<00:03:24.480> both<00:03:24.690> have<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.200> little<00:03:27.049> vacuum<00:03:28.049> gauge

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
they both have a little vacuum gauge

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.910 
they both have a little vacuum gauge
here<00:03:28.950> but<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:30.380> performanceplus<00:03:31.380> does<00:03:31.739> not

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
here but the performanceplus does not

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.460 
here but the performanceplus does not
have<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.510> adjustable<00:03:33.510> suction<00:03:33.780> control

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
have the adjustable suction control

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.949 
have the adjustable suction control
which<00:03:35.220> all<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.549> does<00:03:35.820> anyways<00:03:36.269> opens<00:03:36.690> up<00:03:36.840> a

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
which all that does anyways opens up a

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.030 
which all that does anyways opens up a
couple<00:03:37.200> little<00:03:37.560> vents<00:03:37.890> on<00:03:38.070> there<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:40.680> here<00:03:40.890> we

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
couple little vents on there and here we

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.630 
couple little vents on there and here we
can<00:03:41.190> see<00:03:41.430> this<00:03:41.670> is<00:03:41.970> our<00:03:42.209> supposed<00:03:43.010> HEPA<00:03:44.010> filter

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
can see this is our supposed HEPA filter

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.300 
can see this is our supposed HEPA filter
how<00:03:44.850> much<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:45.720> actually<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.590> HEPA<00:03:46.829> filter

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
how much that is actually a HEPA filter

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.890 
how much that is actually a HEPA filter
I'm<00:03:47.400> not<00:03:47.579> sure

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.050 

and<00:03:51.900> this<00:03:52.290> is<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.530> it's<00:03:53.310> probably<00:03:53.879> a<00:03:53.909> little

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
and this is a it's probably a little

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.630 
and this is a it's probably a little
hard<00:03:54.329> to<00:03:54.420> tell<00:03:54.629> on<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.989> camera<00:03:55.019> here<00:03:55.560> but<00:03:55.739> this

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
hard to tell on the camera here but this

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.390 
hard to tell on the camera here but this
is<00:03:56.939> a<00:03:56.970> very<00:03:57.620> like<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.650> navy<00:03:59.069> blue<00:03:59.640> and<00:04:00.120> spot

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
is a very like a navy blue and spot

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.080 
is a very like a navy blue and spot
glitter<00:04:02.400> in<00:04:02.970> it<00:04:04.040> so<00:04:05.989> let's<00:04:06.989> give<00:04:07.170> it<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.349> try

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
glitter in it so let's give it a try

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.699 
glitter in it so let's give it a try
okay<00:04:09.090> now<00:04:09.930> this<00:04:10.079> one<00:04:10.140> I<00:04:11.959> don't<00:04:12.959> know<00:04:13.110> why<00:04:13.349> but

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
okay now this one I don't know why but

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.860 
okay now this one I don't know why but
it<00:04:13.829> has<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.250> power<00:04:14.459> switches<00:04:15.000> down<00:04:15.180> here<00:04:15.690> on

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
it has the power switches down here on

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.750 
it has the power switches down here on
the<00:04:16.109> actual<00:04:16.410> housing<00:04:16.620> instead<00:04:17.160> of<00:04:17.340> up<00:04:17.489> on<00:04:17.609> the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
the actual housing instead of up on the

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.569 
the actual housing instead of up on the
handle<00:04:18.180> like<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.419> other<00:04:18.570> one<00:04:19.010> now<00:04:20.010> one<00:04:20.370> thing

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
handle like the other one now one thing

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.850 
handle like the other one now one thing
to<00:04:20.639> notice<00:04:21.030> about<00:04:21.299> this<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.930> watch<00:04:22.560> how<00:04:22.590> the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
to notice about this is watch how the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.659 
to notice about this is watch how the
head<00:04:25.639> swivels<00:04:26.639> when<00:04:27.120> I<00:04:27.150> put<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.539> handle<00:04:27.930> down

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
head swivels when I put the handle down

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.279 
head swivels when I put the handle down
it<00:04:29.669> cuz<00:04:30.000> right<00:04:30.150> now<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.419> brush<00:04:30.780> rolls<00:04:31.050> off<00:04:31.260> the

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
it cuz right now the brush rolls off the

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.050 
it cuz right now the brush rolls off the
carpet<00:04:32.090> put<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.210> handle<00:04:33.570> down<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:35.340> wheels<00:04:35.610> on

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
carpet put the handle down the wheels on

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
carpet put the handle down the wheels on
the<00:04:36.330> back<00:04:36.510> kick<00:04:36.930> underneath<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.590> unit<00:04:37.979> and

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
the back kick underneath the unit and

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.950 
the back kick underneath the unit and
push<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:41.460> brush<00:04:41.699> roll<00:04:41.940> down<00:04:42.120> onto<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:42.539> carpet

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
push the brush roll down onto the carpet

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.400 
push the brush roll down onto the carpet
there<00:04:43.530> is<00:04:43.560> no<00:04:43.949> height<00:04:44.220> adjustment<00:04:44.970> on<00:04:45.410> these

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
there is no height adjustment on these

00:04:46.410 --> 00:05:10.440 
there is no height adjustment on these
vacuums<00:04:47.750> so<00:04:49.220> let's<00:04:50.220> turn<00:04:50.550> on<00:04:50.789> give<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.090> a<00:04:51.240> shot

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:06:54.470 

vibrate<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.680> little<00:05:11.980> baby

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.480 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.290 

and<00:06:55.480> there<00:06:55.690> we<00:06:55.870> have<00:06:56.080> it

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
and there we have it

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.370 
and there we have it
Panasonic<00:06:58.620> performance<00:06:59.620> plus<00:06:59.920> platinum

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
Panasonic performance plus platinum

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.570 
Panasonic performance plus platinum
definitely<00:07:02.380> works<00:07:02.590> a<00:07:02.740> lot<00:07:02.890> better<00:07:02.950> than<00:07:03.430> the

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
definitely works a lot better than the

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:09.900 
definitely works a lot better than the
debt<00:07:03.760> flow<00:07:07.470> as<00:07:08.470> we<00:07:08.680> can<00:07:08.860> see<00:07:09.130> there's<00:07:09.610> still<00:07:09.760> a

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:09.910 
debt flow as we can see there's still a

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.980 
debt flow as we can see there's still a
little<00:07:10.090> bit<00:07:10.330> of<00:07:11.820> stuff<00:07:12.820> in<00:07:13.060> the<00:07:13.210> carpet<00:07:13.630> but

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
little bit of stuff in the carpet but

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.130 
little bit of stuff in the carpet but
not<00:07:14.260> nearly<00:07:14.800> as<00:07:15.070> much<00:07:15.250> so<00:07:15.690> I<00:07:16.690> think<00:07:16.810> this

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.140 
not nearly as much so I think this

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.490 
not nearly as much so I think this
actually<00:07:17.410> picked<00:07:17.860> up<00:07:18.010> better<00:07:18.310> than<00:07:18.430> the

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 
actually picked up better than the

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.040 
actually picked up better than the
Hoover<00:07:20.500> elite
