severe weather here in the cold season

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.690 
severe weather here in the cold season
in<00:04:40.350> quite<00:04:40.590> frankly<00:04:40.890> these<00:04:41.100> numbers<00:04:41.430> are<00:04:41.580> very

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
in quite frankly these numbers are very

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.450 
in quite frankly these numbers are very
impressive<00:04:42.000> this<00:04:42.390> is<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.690> bulk<00:04:43.320> sheer<00:04:43.620> in<00:04:43.860> the

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
impressive this is the bulk sheer in the

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.520 
impressive this is the bulk sheer in the
lowest<00:04:44.820> levels<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.330> surface<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.810> 925

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
lowest levels the surface to 925

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.760 
lowest levels the surface to 925
millibars<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.370> it's<00:04:47.460> ramped<00:04:47.760> up<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.970> 40<00:04:48.330> knots

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
millibars and it's ramped up to 40 knots

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.380 
millibars and it's ramped up to 40 knots
so<00:04:49.770> we're<00:04:50.040> gonna<00:04:50.130> have<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.340> watch<00:04:50.550> this<00:04:50.850> period

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
so we're gonna have to watch this period

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.060 
so we're gonna have to watch this period
for<00:04:51.420> severe<00:04:51.900> weather<00:04:51.930> I'm<00:04:52.320> not<00:04:52.440> saying<00:04:52.770> we<00:04:52.890> are

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
for severe weather I'm not saying we are

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.710 
for severe weather I'm not saying we are
going<00:04:53.280> to<00:04:53.340> have<00:04:53.460> some<00:04:53.700> but<00:04:53.880> left<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.180> watch<00:04:54.420> it

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
going to have some but left to watch it

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.390 
going to have some but left to watch it
over<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.440> weekend<00:04:55.800> for<00:04:55.950> these<00:04:56.070> parameters
