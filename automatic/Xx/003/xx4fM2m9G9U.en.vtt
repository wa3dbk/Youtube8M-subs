00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.590
 the second part of my breast 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.810
 Training people summarily described 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.960
 Bench press this is the second exercise in 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.990
 my breast workout we do here 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.730
 four sets like the second bench press 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.210
 Exercise also four sets at an angle 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.369
 move 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.099
 I have the bank at 30 degrees 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.750
 Incidentally, if you set less 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.480
 I find it a bit too 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.190
 not so it is not so on the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.440
 upper chest in my opinion 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.059
 and if you take more than 30 degrees 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.360
 I think the whole thing already a bit too much 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.160
 So then years will go the whole 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.270
 very much on the shoulders and not anymore 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.590
 really on the chest 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.070
 this is my first set with 32 5 kilos 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.050
 I'll do that nine times here 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.239
 also here in every sentence so almost 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.550
 every set of weight and go again 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.899
 for that with the repetitions down the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.420
 is the first sentence of mine 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.950
 training partner also with 32 5 kilo 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.940
 I know how that worked 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.289
 but I think so eight to ten times 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.860
 the execution with him is also again 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:23.789
 right if he goes upstairs I find one 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.099
 a bit too far together, so to speak 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.259
 You do not have the elbows like the 

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:30.000
 Bank press again not quite 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.819
 if you go through the next sentence 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.179
 I will do the execution more often 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.179
 demonstrate 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.640
 so that's my second sentence now 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.200
 35 kilos as 35 kilos dumb the whole 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.750
 I'm doing this' six times 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.840
 As I said, you will fail again 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.790
 at the last sentence I have like you here 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.290
 also see a light hole cards yes that 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.580
 is synonymous with this exercise also 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.640
 at an angle bench press 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.800
 I do not quite go down quite far 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.170
 the shoulder is too much under us 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.750
 stretched people and as I said 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.850
 also did not stretch out the arms completely 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.180
 In the end, that's really important 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.190
 So I think you do not have to 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.360
 case, go through that up there 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.340
 We do not even have the breast 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.230
 really burdened but my opinion 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.959
 after rather the triceps and the front 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.430
 Shoulder is expressed 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.860
 that is, do not go all the way up 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.510
 is healthier for the elbow and 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.430
 below would not be complete either 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.030
 really touch the shoulder with the 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.550
 dabampf year but can be edited shortly 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.380
 just stop because otherwise the shoulder 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.450
 just partially stretched too much 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.120
 and you just so much more 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.120
 could hurt that the second sentence 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.560
 again from my training partner too 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.299
 with 35 kilos 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.320
 That's easy going as he said 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.570
 a bit stronger is my third set 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.700
 this is the penultimate one I have 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.280
 taken again the 35 action and 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.430
 Do it again six times 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.500
 So as I said equal to the hollow cross 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.480
 nice full range of motion year though 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.519
 maybe not go down very far 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.250
 and not all the elbows 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.540
 that's really about it 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.890
 just do not hurt yourself 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.060
 and yes, the whole thing is really important 46 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.880
 repeats 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.080
 not quite failing to go here 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.090
 I'll do a few more 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.260
 repetitions around the last one already 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.270
 squeeze out 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.050
 but as I said still not as 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.099
 go fail 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.300
 that's the third sentence of mine 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.599
 training partner 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.720
 I think he already has the 37 5 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.739
 taken and makes the whole again 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.739
 nice six times 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.069
 we saw here so if you are 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.019
 Help in the last sentence, for example 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.120
 or in the penultimate at most as already 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.549
 explained at the last video then makes 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.500
 this is really just a repetition and 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.610
 Helper training partner on the elbow 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.280
 I think that's a bit 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.139
 better the last repetition yes the 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.299
 last negative repetition where he is the 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.459
 We could do that too 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.810
 have often seen here now quite long to 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.889
 do that again gives you one 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.449
 nice charm and yes then you have 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.160
 another nice negative repetition 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.949
 doing it and doing it better than easy 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.310
 To cut off the dumbbells, that is 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.180
 my last sentence with 37 5 here I have 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.550
 even only three four 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.139
 repetitions made and am ans 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.270
 Muscle failed at the year 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.660
 fail last sentence only to the muscle 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.850
 go 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.250
 this was short trading bankroll 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.320
 has people across the upper breast, I hope
