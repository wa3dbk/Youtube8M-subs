desert we're using it over for spring

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.810 
desert we're using it over for spring
because<00:00:34.710> there's<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.160> not<00:00:35.309> as<00:00:35.520> much

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
because there's just not as much

because there's just not as much
superfine<00:00:36.780> bullet<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.260> there<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.800> then<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
superfine bullet out there and then the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.670 
superfine bullet out there and then the
machine<00:00:38.730> will<00:00:38.760> catch<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:39.629> there<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:41.510> have

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
machine will catch what there is I have

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.440 
machine will catch what there is I have
lately<00:00:43.680> we've<00:00:44.129> been<00:00:44.160> seeing<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.940> being<00:00:45.149> used

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
lately we've been seeing it being used

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.900 
lately we've been seeing it being used
as<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> redundant<00:00:46.289> recovery<00:00:46.739> device<00:00:47.039> for

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
as a redundant recovery device for

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.240 
as a redundant recovery device for
people<00:00:48.300> who<00:00:48.450> are<00:00:48.600> running<00:00:48.780> hardrock<00:00:49.410> so

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
people who are running hardrock so

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.069 
people who are running hardrock so
they'll<00:00:50.460> use<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> last<00:00:51.300> thing<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.840> test

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
they'll use it as the last thing to test

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.650 
they'll use it as the last thing to test
their<00:00:52.289> tailings<00:00:52.680> make<00:00:53.160> sure<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.730> everything

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
their tailings make sure that everything

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.470 
their tailings make sure that everything
is<00:00:54.780> being<00:00:54.809> caught<00:00:55.260> by<00:00:55.440> their<00:00:55.620> tables<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:57.120> now

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
is being caught by their tables and now

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.060 
is being caught by their tables and now
I<00:00:57.539> think<00:00:57.690> I'm<00:00:57.989> ready<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.289> go<00:00:58.469> ahead<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.800> get<00:00:58.920> it

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
I think I'm ready to go ahead and get it

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.450 
I think I'm ready to go ahead and get it
set<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.879> first<00:01:00.149> thing<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:01.399> run<00:01:02.399> a

up on it the toothbrush is used just to

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.830 
up on it the toothbrush is used just to
rub<00:01:16.140> over<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> mat<00:01:16.770> before<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.880> fire<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.180> up

that keeps the air bubbles from sticking
in<00:01:22.920> any<00:01:23.310> place<00:01:23.610> there's<00:01:23.850> an<00:01:23.939> air<00:01:24.090> bubble<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
in any place there's an air bubble and

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.660 
in any place there's an air bubble and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
you want the water running quickly it is

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.190 
you want the water running quickly it is
what<00:02:12.519> helps<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:13.000> develop<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.540> low-pressure

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
what helps to develop a low-pressure

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.860 
what helps to develop a low-pressure
zone<00:02:14.670> underneath<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.940> Hungarian<00:02:16.480> riffle

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
zone underneath the Hungarian riffle

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.500 
zone underneath the Hungarian riffle
that<00:02:17.379> catches<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:18.010> super<00:02:18.400> clean<00:02:18.610> goal<00:02:18.879> and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
that catches that super clean goal and

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.910 
that catches that super clean goal and
we'll<00:02:19.690> take<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.900> look<00:02:20.080> at<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.260> close-up<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.799> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
we'll take a look at a close-up of the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.460 
we'll take a look at a close-up of the
map<00:02:21.099> a<00:02:21.129> little<00:02:21.489> bit<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.120> show<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.900> how<00:02:23.230> it

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
map a little bit and show you how it

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.880 
map a little bit and show you how it
actually<00:02:23.500> recovers<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.430> goal<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:26.709> is

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
actually recovers the goal and this is

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.589 
actually recovers the goal and this is
the<00:02:27.010> way<00:02:27.129> it<00:02:27.280> should<00:02:27.310> be<00:02:27.580> running<00:02:27.879> and<00:02:28.120> then

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
the way it should be running and then

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.059 
the way it should be running and then
the<00:02:28.780> next<00:02:29.019> step<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.410> just<00:02:29.440> adding<00:02:29.920> material

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
the next step is just adding material

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.710 
the next step is just adding material
okay<00:02:33.069> we're<00:02:33.640> back<00:02:33.849> with<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.120> couple<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.510> more

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
okay we're back with a couple of more

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.600 
okay we're back with a couple of more
things<00:02:34.959> on<00:02:35.200> adjustments<00:02:35.860> before<00:02:36.010> we<00:02:36.280> actually

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
things on adjustments before we actually

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.259 
things on adjustments before we actually
run<00:02:36.760> material<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:38.519> play<00:02:39.519> up<00:02:39.670> up<00:02:39.819> at<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.060> top

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
run material the play up up at the top

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.559 
run material the play up up at the top
is<00:02:40.750> real<00:02:41.230> simple<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:42.610> mat<00:02:42.819> just<00:02:43.090> sticks<00:02:43.360> right

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
is real simple the mat just sticks right

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.720 
is real simple the mat just sticks right
underneath<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.230> sort<00:02:45.129> of<00:02:45.220> take<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.549> in<00:02:45.640> an

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
underneath it sort of take it in an

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.360 
underneath it sort of take it in an
angle<00:02:45.879> and<00:02:46.480> just<00:02:46.900> press<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.290> underneath<00:02:48.129> that

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
angle and just press it underneath that

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.569 
angle and just press it underneath that
riff<00:02:48.720> when<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.959> get<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.530> underneath<00:02:50.799> you<00:02:51.340> want

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
riff when you get it underneath you want

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.400 
riff when you get it underneath you want
it<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.879> be<00:02:52.060> sticking<00:02:52.599> over<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.959> end<00:02:53.140> about<00:02:53.379> a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
it to be sticking over the end about a

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.229 
it to be sticking over the end about a
quarter<00:02:53.799> of<00:02:53.829> an<00:02:53.950> inch<00:02:54.069> that<00:02:54.910> way<00:02:55.060> you'll<00:02:55.209> have

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
quarter of an inch that way you'll have

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.270 
quarter of an inch that way you'll have
no<00:02:55.510> accumulation<00:02:56.200> underneath<00:02:56.859> here<00:02:57.099> what

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
no accumulation underneath here what

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.460 
no accumulation underneath here what
becomes<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.849> can<00:02:58.030> become<00:02:58.329> problem<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.290> that's

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
becomes a can become problem so that's

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.400 
becomes a can become problem so that's
how<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.680> mat<00:02:59.950> sets<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:01.390> header<00:03:01.599> box<00:03:01.900> the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
how the mat sets in the header box the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.009 
how the mat sets in the header box the
header<00:03:02.560> box<00:03:02.799> is<00:03:03.010> adjustable<00:03:03.609> when<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:04.569> gets<00:03:04.810> to

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
header box is adjustable when it gets to

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.220 
header box is adjustable when it gets to
you<00:03:05.139> it'll<00:03:05.440> be<00:03:05.769> a<00:03:06.069> little<00:03:06.639> bit<00:03:06.880> high<00:03:07.230> if

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
you it'll be a little bit high if

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.690 
you it'll be a little bit high if
there's<00:03:08.470> leaks<00:03:08.769> around<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.220> edge<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.670> just

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
there's leaks around the edge you just

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.940 
there's leaks around the edge you just
take<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.120> with<00:03:10.329> your<00:03:10.540> thumbs<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.440> just<00:03:11.650> press

it<00:03:11.980> down<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.280> little<00:03:12.489> bit<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.849> those<00:03:13.000> leaks<00:03:13.299> go

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
it down a little bit to those leaks go

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.470 
it down a little bit to those leaks go
away<00:03:13.780> if<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.620> somehow<00:03:14.859> gets<00:03:15.280> smashed<00:03:15.639> down<00:03:16.000> at

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
away if it somehow gets smashed down at

away if it somehow gets smashed down at
some<00:03:16.750> point<00:03:16.780> in<00:03:17.200> its<00:03:17.349> life<00:03:17.440> it<00:03:18.310> will<00:03:18.549> in<00:03:18.700> my
