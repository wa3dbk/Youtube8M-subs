how<00:02:54.810> much<00:02:55.050> they<00:02:55.230> really<00:02:55.350> want<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.650> commit<00:02:55.890> to

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
how much they really want to commit to

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.440 
how much they really want to commit to
these<00:02:56.100> strategies<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.820> when<00:02:56.910> we<00:02:57.060> are<00:02:57.180> going

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
these strategies and when we are going

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.270 
these strategies and when we are going
to<00:02:57.540> see<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> baneling<00:02:58.140> nests<00:02:58.290> because<00:02:59.040> that

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
to see the baneling nests because that

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.040 
to see the baneling nests because that
we<00:02:59.430> have<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.910> baleen<00:03:00.239> s<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:00.600> is<00:03:00.720> something

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
we have the baleen s this is something

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.760 
we have the baleen s this is something
that<00:03:01.080> is<00:03:01.260> carrying<00:03:01.590> em<00:03:01.709> away<00:03:01.860> yeah<00:03:03.770> there's

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
that is carrying em away yeah there's

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.410 
that is carrying em away yeah there's
two<00:03:04.980> hatches<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.580> don't<00:03:05.730> make<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.850> babbling<00:03:06.239> us

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
two hatches you don't make a babbling us

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.970 
two hatches you don't make a babbling us
then<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:07.080> could<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:07.290> get<00:03:07.470> over<00:03:07.680> one<00:03:07.800> bike

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
then you could just get over one bike

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.490 
then you could just get over one bike
rulings<00:03:08.430> alone<00:03:08.820> you<00:03:09.660> need<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.170> at<00:03:10.290> least

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
rulings alone you need it at least

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.470

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
fast attack though yeah I think he knows

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.730 
fast attack though yeah I think he knows
that<00:04:44.730> that<00:04:45.450> was<00:04:45.630> not<00:04:45.870> a<00:04:45.900> good<00:04:46.080> exchange<00:04:46.290> for

him and he's already started the layer

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.210 
him and he's already started the layer

soon as the Overlord was there he

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.920

no<00:04:53.970> mining<00:04:54.360> at<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.870> gas<00:04:55.080> that<00:04:55.350> he<00:04:55.440> built<00:04:55.620> at

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
no mining at the gas that he built at

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.980 
no mining at the gas that he built at
the<00:04:55.830> natural<00:04:56.370> and<00:04:56.670> he<00:04:56.850> I<00:04:56.880> think<00:04:57.300> just<00:04:57.540> started

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
the natural and he I think just started

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.930 
the natural and he I think just started
to<00:04:58.140> send<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.770> few<00:04:58.920> drones<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.370> there<00:04:59.520> yes<00:04:59.730> there

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
to send a few drones and there yes there

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.360 
to send a few drones and there yes there
it<00:05:00.060> is<00:05:00.180> so<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.930> gas<00:05:01.080> is<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.350> lot<00:05:01.590> faster<00:05:02.160> for

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
it is so the gas is a lot faster for

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.300 
it is so the gas is a lot faster for
effort<00:05:02.700> here<00:05:02.850> DRG<00:05:03.450> not<00:05:03.750> taking<00:05:04.170> the<00:05:04.350> spot<00:05:04.620> he's

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
effort here DRG not taking the spot he's

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.290 
effort here DRG not taking the spot he's
getting<00:05:05.460> his<00:05:05.670> third<00:05:05.880> base<00:05:06.150> before<00:05:06.500> a<00:05:08.300> nice

is falling behind in tech yes the third
up<00:05:19.980> a<00:05:20.100> lot<00:05:20.250> earlier<00:05:20.400> but<00:05:20.850> he<00:05:20.940> has<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.420> be<00:05:21.510> able

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
up a lot earlier but he has to be able

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.450 
up a lot earlier but he has to be able
to<00:05:21.840> defend<00:05:21.960> exactly<00:05:22.740> and<00:05:22.980> you<00:05:23.220> know<00:05:23.340> he's

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
to defend exactly and you know he's

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.890 
to defend exactly and you know he's
going<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.670> have<00:05:23.850> a<00:05:23.880> slightly<00:05:24.300> faster<00:05:24.540> Roach

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
going to have a slightly faster Roach

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.540 
going to have a slightly faster Roach
Warren<00:05:25.200> but<00:05:25.470> with<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.800> bel<00:05:26.010> air<00:05:26.160> coming<00:05:26.400> out

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
Warren but with the bel air coming out

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.340 
Warren but with the bel air coming out
here<00:05:26.790> the<00:05:27.270> roach<00:05:27.419> Warren<00:05:27.690> may<00:05:27.960> allow<00:05:28.290> the

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
here the roach Warren may allow the

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.800 
here the roach Warren may allow the
dependence<00:05:28.860> base<00:05:29.040> Holden<00:05:29.400> easier<00:05:29.700> I<00:05:29.940> like<00:05:30.630> the

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
dependence base Holden easier I like the

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.659 
dependence base Holden easier I like the
baneling<00:05:31.140> defense<00:05:31.440> set<00:05:31.770> up<00:05:31.890> here<00:05:32.070> means<00:05:32.520> that

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
baneling defense set up here means that

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.100 
baneling defense set up here means that
any<00:05:32.790> more<00:05:32.970> links<00:05:33.300> ever<00:05:33.480> it<00:05:33.600> sends<00:05:33.840> it<00:05:33.870> or<00:05:33.990> not

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
any more links ever it sends it or not

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.870 
any more links ever it sends it or not
going<00:05:34.230> to<00:05:34.290> be<00:05:34.350> very<00:05:34.380> effective<00:05:34.860> two<00:05:35.700> more

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
going to be very effective two more

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.070 
going to be very effective two more
banelings<00:05:36.270> making<00:05:36.600> for<00:05:36.780> him<00:05:36.900> right<00:05:37.020> now

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
banelings making for him right now

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.120 
banelings making for him right now
though<00:05:37.350> and<00:05:37.530> oh<00:05:37.620> I<00:05:37.650> think<00:05:37.830> they're<00:05:38.040> gonna

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
though and oh I think they're gonna

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.990 
though and oh I think they're gonna
finish<00:05:38.400> oh<00:05:38.760> just<00:05:39.750> barely<00:05:40.050> not<00:05:40.320> wow<00:05:41.310> that<00:05:41.880> was

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
finish oh just barely not wow that was

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.990 
finish oh just barely not wow that was
an<00:05:42.150> ID<00:05:42.450> stock<00:05:42.780> but<00:05:43.620> only<00:05:44.130> were<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:44.550> first<00:05:44.760> ones

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
an ID stock but only were the first ones

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.770 
an ID stock but only were the first ones
yeah<00:05:46.310> good<00:05:47.310> no<00:05:47.669> manual<00:05:48.210> detonation<00:05:48.330> supply

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
yeah good no manual detonation supply

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.300 
yeah good no manual detonation supply
both<00:05:48.930> players<00:05:49.200> actually<00:05:49.410> I<00:05:49.650> really<00:05:50.040> like<00:05:50.190> to

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
both players actually I really like to

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.409 
both players actually I really like to
see<00:05:50.430> that<00:05:50.550> because<00:05:50.700> of<00:05:50.880> something<00:05:51.090> right<00:05:51.360> now

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
see that because of something right now

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.570 
see that because of something right now
I<00:05:51.810> think<00:05:52.110> too<00:05:52.710> few<00:05:52.950> people<00:05:52.980> are<00:05:53.370> doing

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
I think too few people are doing

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.970 
I think too few people are doing
especially<00:05:53.880> in<00:05:54.120> this<00:05:54.210> matchup<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:55.650> hottest

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
especially in this matchup the hottest

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.680 
especially in this matchup the hottest
account<00:05:56.250> is<00:05:56.370> roughly<00:05:56.760> the<00:05:56.790> same<00:05:57.030> effort<00:05:57.450> is

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
account is roughly the same effort is

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.330 
account is roughly the same effort is
now<00:05:57.810> done<00:05:58.050> with<00:05:58.290> this<00:05:58.410> tech<00:05:58.770> and<00:05:58.980> it's<00:05:59.100> going

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
now done with this tech and it's going

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.400 
now done with this tech and it's going
straight<00:05:59.550> for<00:05:59.760> the<00:05:59.820> expansion<00:06:00.180> and<00:06:00.570> he<00:06:01.110> saw<00:06:01.290> of

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
straight for the expansion and he saw of

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.890 
straight for the expansion and he saw of
course<00:06:01.590> has<00:06:01.800> the<00:06:01.910> faster<00:06:02.910> road<00:06:03.210> speed<00:06:03.570> because

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
course has the faster road speed because

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.510 
course has the faster road speed because
of<00:06:04.080> it<00:06:04.200> and<00:06:04.320> also<00:06:04.919> his<00:06:05.160> plus-one<00:06:05.370> attack

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
of it and also his plus-one attack

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.310 
of it and also his plus-one attack
upgrade<00:06:06.210> will<00:06:06.390> hit<00:06:06.570> a<00:06:06.600> little<00:06:06.810> bit<00:06:06.930> earlier

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
upgrade will hit a little bit earlier

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.230 
upgrade will hit a little bit earlier
than<00:06:07.440> the<00:06:07.590> AG's<00:06:07.919> a<00:06:08.190> slight<00:06:08.610> timing<00:06:09.030> we<00:06:09.120> know

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
than the AG's a slight timing we know

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.970 
than the AG's a slight timing we know
that<00:06:09.390> he<00:06:09.450> has<00:06:09.630> a<00:06:09.660> very<00:06:09.960> small<00:06:10.380> one<00:06:10.650> though<00:06:10.800> that

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
that he has a very small one though that

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.740 
that he has a very small one though that
he's<00:06:11.100> probably<00:06:11.250> not<00:06:11.490> going<00:06:11.669> to<00:06:11.730> use<00:06:11.880> yeah<00:06:12.480> and

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
he's probably not going to use yeah and

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.690 
he's probably not going to use yeah and
the<00:06:13.169> window<00:06:13.710> that<00:06:13.740> donor<00:06:14.070> who<00:06:14.280> has<00:06:14.460> this

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
the window that donor who has this

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.850 
the window that donor who has this
hatchery<00:06:15.060> is<00:06:15.480> gonna<00:06:15.690> be<00:06:15.870> slightly<00:06:16.620> ahead

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
hatchery is gonna be slightly ahead

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.950 
hatchery is gonna be slightly ahead
Susan<00:06:17.250> a<00:06:17.340> slightly<00:06:17.730> better<00:06:18.120> income<00:06:18.630> but<00:06:18.780> with

Susan a slightly better income but with

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.570 
Susan a slightly better income but with
all<00:06:19.380> the<00:06:19.590> pressure<00:06:19.740> the<00:06:19.980> efforts<00:06:20.280> putting<00:06:20.490> on

all the pressure the efforts putting on

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
all the pressure the efforts putting on
is<00:06:20.669> probably<00:06:20.910> gonna<00:06:21.030> be<00:06:21.090> a<00:06:21.240> while<00:06:21.330> before

fall at the same time the third base is
being<00:06:36.830> attacked<00:06:37.130> but<00:06:37.639> the<00:06:37.759> AG<00:06:38.090> has<00:06:38.240> to<00:06:38.479> pull

back<00:06:38.840> and<00:06:39.080> he<00:06:39.320> still<00:06:39.620> didn't<00:06:39.889> start<00:06:40.190> his<00:06:40.340> road

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580

speed<00:06:40.970> now<00:06:41.000> finally<00:06:41.900> started<00:06:42.289> but<00:06:42.470> lost<00:06:42.680> a<00:06:42.800> lot

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
speed now finally started but lost a lot

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:45.129 
speed now finally started but lost a lot
of<00:06:43.039> time<00:06:43.340> here<00:06:43.580> and<00:06:44.210> he<00:06:44.360> also<00:06:44.539> lost<00:06:44.840> the<00:06:45.020> key

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.379 
of time here and he also lost the key
Hamas's<00:06:45.620> yeah<00:06:45.919> not<00:06:46.190> too<00:06:46.310> many<00:06:46.430> though<00:06:46.580> exactly

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:47.389 
Hamas's yeah not too many though exactly

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.480 
Hamas's yeah not too many though exactly
efforts<00:06:47.810> still<00:06:48.110> down<00:06:48.320> for<00:06:48.590> harvesters<00:06:49.220> right

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490 
efforts still down for harvesters right

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.939 
efforts still down for harvesters right
now<00:06:49.639> but<00:06:50.300> the<00:06:50.389> roach<00:06:50.570> count<00:06:50.900> is<00:06:51.110> slightly<00:06:51.770> in

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:51.949 
now but the roach count is slightly in

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:55.150 
now but the roach count is slightly in
his<00:06:52.070> favor<00:06:52.310> at<00:06:52.789> 14<00:06:53.240> to<00:06:53.389> 0<00:06:53.419> and<00:06:53.930> this<00:06:54.410> is<00:06:54.710> going

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 
his favor at 14 to 0 and this is going

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.650 
his favor at 14 to 0 and this is going
to<00:06:55.250> become<00:06:55.430> a<00:06:55.460> problem<00:06:55.759> with<00:06:56.060> plus<00:06:56.300> one<00:06:56.509> being

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
to become a problem with plus one being

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.909 
to become a problem with plus one being
out<00:06:56.780> for<00:06:56.960> him<00:06:57.050> you<00:06:57.410> know<00:06:57.530> we<00:06:57.650> talked<00:06:57.860> about

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 
out for him you know we talked about

00:06:57.919 --> 00:06:59.740 
out for him you know we talked about
this<00:06:58.130> may<00:06:58.370> be<00:06:58.430> a<00:06:58.490> time<00:06:58.729> he<00:06:58.850> hits<00:06:59.150> but<00:06:59.449> very

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750 
this may be a time he hits but very

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.200 
this may be a time he hits but very
likely<00:06:59.960> he<00:07:00.289> will<00:07:00.410> not<00:07:00.620> if<00:07:00.860> he<00:07:01.190> decided<00:07:01.520> to<00:07:01.669> to

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
likely he will not if he decided to to

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.640 
likely he will not if he decided to to
push<00:07:02.449> and<00:07:02.690> not<00:07:02.810> turn<00:07:02.990> around<00:07:03.080> here<00:07:03.380> would<00:07:03.560> have

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
push and not turn around here would have

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.140 
push and not turn around here would have
been<00:07:03.740> able<00:07:03.830> to<00:07:03.979> hit<00:07:04.099> it<00:07:04.190> but<00:07:04.280> now<00:07:04.460> he's<00:07:05.000> not

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.150 
been able to hit it but now he's not

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.400 
been able to hit it but now he's not
only<00:07:05.210> gonna<00:07:05.479> have<00:07:05.690> to<00:07:05.750> turn<00:07:05.900> around<00:07:06.020> but<00:07:06.320> he

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410 
only gonna have to turn around but he

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.930 
only gonna have to turn around but he
may<00:07:06.650> lose<00:07:06.949> his<00:07:07.009> Hatcher<00:07:07.340> I<00:07:07.520> think<00:07:07.759> there's

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:07.940 
may lose his Hatcher I think there's

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.189 
may lose his Hatcher I think there's
enough<00:07:08.120> to<00:07:08.240> defend<00:07:08.479> here<00:07:08.690> he's<00:07:08.840> trying<00:07:09.110> to

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 
enough to defend here he's trying to

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:11.050 
enough to defend here he's trying to
target<00:07:09.410> it<00:07:09.590> down<00:07:09.770> he's<00:07:10.130> gotta<00:07:10.340> die<00:07:10.490> yeah<00:07:10.820> yeah

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.060 
target it down he's gotta die yeah yeah

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.790 
target it down he's gotta die yeah yeah
yeah<00:07:11.270> turn<00:07:11.870> around<00:07:11.960> he<00:07:12.169> sent<00:07:12.380> his<00:07:12.470> roaches

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
yeah turn around he sent his roaches

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.100 
yeah turn around he sent his roaches
forward<00:07:13.130> the<00:07:13.910> hatch<00:07:14.180> is<00:07:14.210> gonna<00:07:14.630> die<00:07:14.810> and<00:07:14.840> this

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.689 
forward the hatch is gonna die and this
is<00:07:15.229> so<00:07:15.440> important<00:07:15.949> for<00:07:16.039> the<00:07:16.160> edgy<00:07:16.430> right<00:07:16.550> now
