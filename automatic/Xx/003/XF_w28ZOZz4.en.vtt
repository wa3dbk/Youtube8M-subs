keep it white while we paint without

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.639 
keep it white while we paint without
having<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.730> meticulously<00:00:57.480> paint<00:00:57.960> around<00:00:58.350> it

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
having to meticulously paint around it

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.779

and<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.699> great<00:00:59.910> way<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.789> you

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and it's a great way to do that and you

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.929 
and it's a great way to do that and you
just<00:01:03.030> put<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.359> down<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:04.170> that

just put it down there like that

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.190

probably<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:06.180> too<00:01:06.479> accurate<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:07.080> I've

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200

see them and we put a little have a
couple<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.200> drops<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.770> there<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:54.000> could

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
couple of drops in there and we could

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
couple of drops in there and we could
imagine<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.810> want<00:01:55.110> something<00:01:55.439> over<00:01:55.829> here

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
imagine that we want something over here

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.969 
imagine that we want something over here
and<00:01:56.909> we<00:01:57.060> want<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.360> keep<00:01:57.509> quite<00:01:57.869> whatever<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.860> is

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
and we want to keep quite whatever it is

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.800 
and we want to keep quite whatever it is
you<00:01:59.100> want<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.340> keep<00:01:59.460> white<00:01:59.729> with<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> masking

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you want to keep white with the masking

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.590 
you want to keep white with the masking
fluid<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.619> area<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:03.000> must<00:02:03.299> dry

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
fluid on that area it must dry

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.660 
fluid on that area it must dry
completely<00:02:04.110> before<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.770> start<00:02:05.100> painting<00:02:05.579> it

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
completely before you start painting it

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.700 
completely before you start painting it
so<00:02:05.820> we're<00:02:06.060> going<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.240> let<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.570> dry<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.170> then

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
so we're going to let this dry and then

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.790 
so we're going to let this dry and then
come<00:02:07.890> back<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.250> finish<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:09.319> now<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.590> have

come back and finish it now I have

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.930 
come back and finish it now I have
already<00:02:11.009> prepared<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.940> one<00:02:12.209> and

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
already prepared this one and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.300 
already prepared this one and
in<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.390> essence<00:02:13.750> of<00:02:13.870> time<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.530> it's<00:02:14.620> dry<00:02:14.980> so

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
in the essence of time and it's dry so

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.070 
in the essence of time and it's dry so
you<00:02:15.430> want<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.850> be<00:02:15.970> sure<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.330> masking<00:02:16.750> fluid<00:02:16.780> is

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
you want to be sure the masking fluid is

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.860 
you want to be sure the masking fluid is
perfectly<00:02:17.530> dry<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.130> now<00:02:18.700> quickly<00:02:19.090> I'm<00:02:19.450> just

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870

thing<00:02:21.910> so<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.080> get<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.560> idea<00:02:23.590> not

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
thing so that you get the idea not

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.160 
thing so that you get the idea not
trying<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.820> keep<00:02:25.030> anything<00:02:25.360> particularly<00:02:26.080> in

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
trying to keep anything particularly in

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.840

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
mind but I want you to see how it's done

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.970 
mind but I want you to see how it's done
so<00:02:28.150> I've<00:02:28.270> activated<00:02:28.600> some<00:02:28.960> color<00:02:29.230> already<00:02:29.710> and

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
so I've activated some color already and

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.580 
so I've activated some color already and
we'll<00:02:30.670> just<00:02:30.850> come<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.240> here<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.510> without<00:02:31.960> much

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
we'll just come in here and without much

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.160 
we'll just come in here and without much
ado<00:02:32.980> add<00:02:33.310> some<00:02:34.120> color<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.690> see<00:02:34.900> I'm<00:02:34.990> going

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
ado add some color you see I'm going

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.810 
ado add some color you see I'm going
right<00:02:35.320> over<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.710> masking<00:02:36.160> fluid<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.670> that's

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
right over the masking fluid and that's

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.480 
right over the masking fluid and that's
the<00:02:36.970> reason<00:02:37.480> for<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.960> is<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.920> don't<00:02:38.980> have<00:02:39.310> to

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
the reason for it is I don't have to

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.210 
the reason for it is I don't have to
worry<00:02:39.760> here<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:41.050> this<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:41.560> going<00:02:41.740> to<00:02:41.800> be<00:02:41.950> so

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
worry here and this is going to be so

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.470 
worry here and this is going to be so
quick<00:02:44.100> just<00:02:45.100> like<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.150> we're<00:02:46.300> going<00:02:46.390> to

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
quick just like that and we're going to

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.420 
quick just like that and we're going to
add<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.600> little<00:02:46.780> darker<00:02:47.320> color<00:02:47.620> right<00:02:47.980> down<00:02:48.220> in

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
add a little darker color right down in

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.350 
add a little darker color right down in
here<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.890> masking<00:02:51.580> fluid<00:02:51.760> right<00:02:52.120> there

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
here and that masking fluid right there

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.620 
here and that masking fluid right there
so<00:02:52.630> now<00:02:52.840> we'll<00:02:53.110> come<00:02:53.380> back<00:02:53.590> in<00:02:53.800> here<00:02:54.040> with<00:02:54.100> some

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
so now we'll come back in here with some

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.770 
so now we'll come back in here with some
heavier<00:02:55.630> stuff<00:02:56.700> just<00:02:57.700> simply<00:02:58.150> so<00:02:58.360> you'll<00:02:58.570> be

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
heavier stuff just simply so you'll be

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.950 
heavier stuff just simply so you'll be
able<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.140> see<00:02:59.410> what<00:02:59.650> we've<00:02:59.860> done<00:03:00.690> with<00:03:01.690> the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
able to see what we've done with the

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.960 
able to see what we've done with the
masking<00:03:02.560> fluid<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:03.250> all<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:03.580> is<00:03:03.760> going<00:03:03.880> to

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
masking fluid and all this is going to

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.000 
masking fluid and all this is going to
be<00:03:04.090> wet<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.390> wet<00:03:04.810> which<00:03:05.080> might<00:03:05.320> end<00:03:05.530> up<00:03:05.680> being

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
be wet and wet which might end up being

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.640 
be wet and wet which might end up being
kind<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.400> interesting<00:03:07.000> like<00:03:07.210> I<00:03:07.750> love<00:03:08.320> painting

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
nice little accent and now we'll take

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.720 
nice little accent and now we'll take
the<00:04:12.040> brush<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:12.340> add<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.760> little<00:04:13.030> bit<00:04:13.150> of<00:04:14.730> light

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
the brush and add a little bit of light

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.000 
the brush and add a little bit of light
give<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.000> light<00:04:16.269> Direction<00:04:16.870> coming<00:04:17.290> in<00:04:17.440> here<00:04:17.739> to

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
give a light Direction coming in here to

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.360 
give a light Direction coming in here to
this<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:19.750> would<00:04:20.049> be<00:04:20.200> all<00:04:20.380> we<00:04:20.680> need<00:04:20.950> to<00:04:21.130> do

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
this and that would be all we need to do

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.470 
this and that would be all we need to do
to<00:04:21.729> say

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
to say

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.360 
to say
little<00:04:23.870> buildings<00:04:24.440> like<00:04:24.620> that<00:04:24.680> maybe<00:04:25.100> we<00:04:25.250> have

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
little buildings like that maybe we have

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.060 
little buildings like that maybe we have
a<00:04:25.400> little<00:04:25.460> wonder<00:04:26.030> in<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.360> one<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:27.070> perhaps

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
a little wonder in that one and perhaps

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.580 
a little wonder in that one and perhaps
we<00:04:28.520> put<00:04:28.850> a<00:04:28.880> little<00:04:29.150> bitty<00:04:29.450> chimney<00:04:30.110> on<00:04:30.260> it<00:04:30.440> up

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
we put a little bitty chimney on it up

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.020 
we put a little bitty chimney on it up
here<00:04:30.980> and<00:04:32.290> I'm<00:04:33.290> kind<00:04:33.770> of<00:04:33.980> right-handed<00:04:34.790> and

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
here and I'm kind of right-handed and

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.670 
here and I'm kind of right-handed and
it's<00:04:35.150> hard<00:04:35.420> to<00:04:35.480> get<00:04:35.660> in<00:04:35.810> here<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.080> do<00:04:36.230> this<00:04:36.440> so

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
it's hard to get in here to do this so

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.160 
it's hard to get in here to do this so
that<00:04:36.710> you<00:04:36.890> see<00:04:37.460> it<00:04:37.520> but<00:04:37.790> hopefully<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:39.020> get

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
that you see it but hopefully you get

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.690 
that you see it but hopefully you get
the<00:04:39.230> idea<00:04:39.380> of<00:04:40.340> what<00:04:40.610> we've<00:04:40.820> done<00:04:41.090> in<00:04:42.700> here<00:04:43.700> and

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
the idea of what we've done in here and

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.860 
the idea of what we've done in here and
that's<00:04:46.700> got<00:04:46.910> to<00:04:46.940> have<00:04:47.180> some<00:04:47.420> more<00:04:47.570> little

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
that's got to have some more little

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.840 
that's got to have some more little
things<00:04:48.170> put<00:04:48.530> in<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:48.830> put<00:04:49.370> a<00:04:49.430> little<00:04:49.640> for<00:04:49.790> the

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
things put in it put a little for the

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.660 
things put in it put a little for the
flue<00:04:50.120> in<00:04:50.390> that<00:04:50.600> right<00:04:50.840> there<00:04:51.140> and<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.530> little<00:04:52.430> in

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
flue in that right there and a little in

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.130 
flue in that right there and a little in
that<00:04:52.700> the<00:04:53.090> first<00:04:53.330> thing<00:04:53.480> you<00:04:53.600> note<00:04:53.780> we<00:04:53.930> have<00:04:54.110> a
