great help so back to the settings you
can<00:01:09.240> adjust<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.689> frame<00:01:10.020> rate<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:11.720> I've

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
can adjust the frame rate and I've

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.810 
can adjust the frame rate and I've
noticed<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.409> if<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.650> don't<00:01:13.890> lock<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.490> frame

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
noticed that if you don't lock the frame

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.679 
noticed that if you don't lock the frame
right<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> audio<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:15.960> off<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.540> good

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
right that the audio is off so it's good

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.060 
right that the audio is off so it's good
to<00:01:18.720> lock<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.170> frame<00:01:19.619> rate<00:01:21.920> you're<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:22.950> to

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
to lock the frame rate you're going to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.550 
to lock the frame rate you're going to
just<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> rotation<00:01:24.020> all<00:01:25.020> different

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
just the rotation all different

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.969 
just the rotation all different
locations<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.159> lock<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.700> way<00:01:27.829> you<00:01:28.829> can

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
locations and lock it that way you can

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:41.350 
locations and lock it that way you can

in 3 megabits for a second so I'm not
sure<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.830> difference<00:02:13.220> of<00:02:13.550> what<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:13.820> would

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.060 
sure the difference of what it would
look<00:02:14.090> like<00:02:14.150> but<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.750> looks<00:02:15.500> pretty<00:02:15.590> clear<00:02:16.040> to
