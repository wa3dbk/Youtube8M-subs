00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.479 
I find that black binders work really
well<00:02:33.420> with<00:02:33.660> nature<00:02:34.260> photos<00:02:34.620> if<00:02:34.829> they<00:02:34.950> just<00:02:35.130> pop

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
well with nature photos if they just pop

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.879 
well with nature photos if they just pop
right<00:02:35.760> off<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.060> page<00:02:36.590> especially<00:02:37.590> with<00:02:37.739> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
white borders on the photo then you can

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.039 
white borders on the photo then you can
stop<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.459> leave<00:02:41.639> it<00:02:41.760> as<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.209> but<00:02:42.810> I'm
