it's<00:02:09.979> actually<00:02:10.069> a<00:02:10.250> pita<00:02:10.519> that<00:02:10.849> I<00:02:10.879> just<00:02:11.180> kind<00:02:11.330> of

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
it's actually a pita that I just kind of

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.600 
it's actually a pita that I just kind of
sliced<00:02:11.720> along<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.319> edge<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:12.799> then<00:02:13.280> I<00:02:13.370> pre

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
sliced along the edge and then I pre

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.949 
sliced along the edge and then I pre
bake<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.060> oven<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.510> would<00:02:14.629> be<00:02:14.750> hard

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
bake it in the oven so it would be hard

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.089 
bake it in the oven so it would be hard
otherwise<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:15.530> just<00:02:15.560> going<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:15.799> get<00:02:15.890> really

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.039 
otherwise it's just going to get really
soggy<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:17.090> pretty<00:02:17.330> baked<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.599> until<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:17.930> gets

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
soggy so pretty baked that until it gets

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.839 
soggy so pretty baked that until it gets
this<00:02:18.110> kind<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:18.379> golden<00:02:18.739> color<00:02:18.950> on<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.190> nice<00:02:19.640> and

okay<00:02:22.940> which<00:02:23.120> really<00:02:23.510> adds<00:02:23.629> a<00:02:24.019> wonderful

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
okay which really adds a wonderful

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.920 
okay which really adds a wonderful
flavor<00:02:24.530> along<00:02:25.459> with<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.060> apples<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.810> we're

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
flavor along with the apples and we're

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.869 
flavor along with the apples and we're
just<00:02:27.019> going<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.230> brush<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.920> on<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.549> crust

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
just going to brush that on the crust

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.750 
just going to brush that on the crust
and<00:02:29.299> then<00:02:29.989> we<00:02:30.140> have<00:02:30.560> some<00:02:30.829> applicators<00:02:31.430> very

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
and then we have some applicators very

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.640 
and then we have some applicators very
thinly<00:02:32.150> sliced<00:02:32.780> which<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.110> perfect<00:02:33.500> for<00:02:33.530> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
thinly sliced which is perfect for the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.289 
thinly sliced which is perfect for the
pizza<00:02:33.860> because<00:02:34.129> this<00:02:34.700> doesn't<00:02:34.879> take<00:02:35.150> very

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
pizza because this doesn't take very

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.330 
pizza because this doesn't take very
much<00:02:35.420> time<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:36.049> heat<00:02:36.260> really<00:02:36.920> just<00:02:37.160> going<00:02:37.280> to

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
much time to heat really just going to

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.190 
much time to heat really just going to
heat<00:02:37.519> this<00:02:37.549> through<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.840> you're<00:02:38.930> going<00:02:39.019> to<00:02:39.110> go

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
heat this through so you're going to go

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.869 
heat this through so you're going to go
ahead<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:39.530> place<00:02:39.709> these<00:02:39.950> all<00:02:40.250> along<00:02:40.670> the

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
ahead and place these all along the

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.180 
ahead and place these all along the
crust<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.569> we're<00:02:42.079> going<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.379> complement<00:02:43.129> that

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
crust and we're going to complement that

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.849
