it is what can cause it and hopefully
shed<00:00:13.740> some<00:00:13.920> light<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:14.219> actually<00:00:14.639> if<00:00:14.790> you're

and let's dive in so first let's talk
about<00:00:19.949> exactly<00:00:20.520> what<00:00:20.730> water<00:00:21.060> retention<00:00:21.420> is

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
about exactly what water retention is

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.259 
about exactly what water retention is
water<00:00:22.439> retention<00:00:22.800> where<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.699> technical<00:00:24.119> term

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
water retention where the technical term

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.839 
water retention where the technical term
is<00:00:24.300> oedema<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.140> when<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> body<00:00:26.039> holds<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
is oedema is when the body holds on to

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.029 
is oedema is when the body holds on to
water<00:00:27.119> either<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> muscle<00:00:28.500> tissue<00:00:28.740> or

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
water either in the muscle tissue or

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.130 
water either in the muscle tissue or
actually<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.730> skin<00:00:30.029> itself<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:30.990> have

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
actually in the skin itself you can have

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.930 
actually in the skin itself you can have
generalized<00:00:31.800> water<00:00:32.160> retention<00:00:32.489> where<00:00:32.820> your

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
generalized water retention where your

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.389 
generalized water retention where your
body<00:00:33.660> your<00:00:34.020> whole<00:00:34.200> entire<00:00:34.260> body<00:00:34.440> whole<00:00:35.130> body

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
body your whole entire body whole body

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.130 
body your whole entire body whole body
is<00:00:35.579> holding<00:00:36.059> water<00:00:36.210> all<00:00:36.450> over<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.750> place<00:00:36.930> or

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
is holding water all over the place or

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.600 
is holding water all over the place or
you<00:00:37.260> can<00:00:37.380> have<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> localized<00:00:38.129> water<00:00:38.370> retention

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
you can have a localized water retention

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.490 
you can have a localized water retention
like<00:00:38.940> maybe<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.719> your<00:00:39.840> ankles<00:00:40.230> are<00:00:40.350> swelling

like maybe just your ankles are swelling
up<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:40.980> now<00:00:41.100> let's<00:00:41.340> talk<00:00:41.460> about<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:41.910> causes

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
up so now let's talk about what causes

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.940 
up so now let's talk about what causes
water<00:00:42.510> retention<00:00:42.870> there<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> lot<00:00:43.920> of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
water retention there are a lot of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.740 
water retention there are a lot of
different<00:00:44.550> things<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.210> actually<00:00:45.390> cause

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
different things that can actually cause

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.560 
different things that can actually cause
water<00:00:46.170> retention<00:00:46.460> but<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> cover<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.910> few<00:00:48.270> brief

water retention but to cover a few brief

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.650 
water retention but to cover a few brief
ones<00:00:48.870> first<00:00:49.649> one<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.610> body's<00:00:51.059> reaction

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
ones first one be this body's reaction

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.950 
ones first one be this body's reaction
the<00:00:51.780> hot<00:00:51.960> weather<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.829> you're<00:00:53.690> dehydrated<00:00:54.690> if

the hot weather if you're dehydrated if
you're<00:00:55.739> actually<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.489> female<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.390> you're<00:00:57.539> kind

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.229 
you're actually a female and you're kind
of<00:00:57.899> around<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> menstrual<00:00:58.710> cycle<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.489> your

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
of around the menstrual cycle if your

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.990 
of around the menstrual cycle if your
body's<00:01:01.170> hormones<00:01:01.739> are<00:01:01.949> changing<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.579> couple<00:01:02.940> of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
body's hormones are changing a couple of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.570 
body's hormones are changing a couple of
common<00:01:03.329> causes<00:01:03.510> are<00:01:03.920> dehydration<00:01:04.920> gravity

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
common causes are dehydration gravity

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.490 
common causes are dehydration gravity
and<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:05.970> mean<00:01:06.150> by<00:01:06.210> gravity<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.869> standing

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and what I mean by gravity is standing

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.840 
and what I mean by gravity is standing
or<00:01:07.619> sitting<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.189> long<00:01:08.310> periods<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.790> time

then a very common one which is a very

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.770 
then a very common one which is a very
telltale<00:01:44.909> sign<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:45.240> holding<00:01:45.479> water<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
telltale sign up holding water is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.420 
telltale sign up holding water is
actually<00:01:45.899> when<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.290> press<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.920> skin<00:01:47.250> and

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
the rest of it's just water weight no

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.059 
the rest of it's just water weight no
it's<00:03:56.000> not<00:03:56.180> it's<00:03:56.750> still<00:03:56.870> body<00:03:57.260> fat<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.799> haven't

another<00:04:00.530> cause<00:04:00.799> of<00:04:00.829> holding<00:04:01.310> on<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.489> water<00:04:01.670> is

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
another cause of holding on the water is

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.449 
another cause of holding on the water is
eating<00:04:02.060> a<00:04:02.150> very<00:04:02.510> high<00:04:02.870> sodium<00:04:03.290> diet<00:04:03.739> try

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
eating a very high sodium diet try

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.430 
eating a very high sodium diet try
cutting<00:04:04.700> out<00:04:04.940> that<00:04:05.120> sodium<00:04:05.540> or<00:04:05.750> reducing<00:04:06.319> it

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
cutting out that sodium or reducing it

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.780 
cutting out that sodium or reducing it
so<00:04:06.620> again<00:04:07.010> I'm<00:04:07.250> going<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.400> touch<00:04:07.549> on<00:04:07.670> this

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
so again I'm going to touch on this

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.430 
so again I'm going to touch on this
briefly<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.299> best<00:04:08.540> way<00:04:08.690> to<00:04:08.750> combat<00:04:08.959> water

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
briefly the best way to combat water

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.129 
briefly the best way to combat water
retention<00:04:09.769> is<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.609> drink<00:04:10.850> more<00:04:11.090> water<00:04:11.329> a<00:04:11.660> very

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
retention is to drink more water a very

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.550 
retention is to drink more water a very
common<00:04:12.560> cause<00:04:12.850> upholding<00:04:13.850> on<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.090> water

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
common cause upholding on the water

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.289 
common cause upholding on the water
retention<00:04:14.920> is<00:04:15.130> that<00:04:15.280> dehydration<00:04:15.610> your<00:04:16.120> body

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
retention is that dehydration your body

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.629 
retention is that dehydration your body
doesn't<00:04:16.870> know<00:04:17.079> what's<00:04:17.260> going<00:04:17.320> on<00:04:17.739> it<00:04:18.070> doesn't

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
doesn't know what's going on it doesn't

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.460 
doesn't know what's going on it doesn't
know<00:04:18.730> where<00:04:18.970> all<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.299> where<00:04:19.750> it's<00:04:19.930> typical

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
know where all that where it's typical

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.960 
know where all that where it's typical
water<00:04:20.709> consumption<00:04:21.130> is<00:04:21.370> so<00:04:21.489> it's<00:04:21.669> like<00:04:21.790> well

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
water consumption is so it's like well

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.520 
water consumption is so it's like well
since<00:04:22.570> it's<00:04:22.720> a<00:04:22.750> little<00:04:22.960> bit<00:04:23.080> of<00:04:23.110> water<00:04:23.290> i'm

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
since it's a little bit of water i'm

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.810 
since it's a little bit of water i'm
going<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.710> get<00:04:23.830> i'm<00:04:24.010> going<00:04:24.100> to<00:04:24.160> hold<00:04:24.370> on<00:04:24.490> to<00:04:24.700> it

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
going to get i'm going to hold on to it

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.340 
going to get i'm going to hold on to it
so<00:04:24.940> it's<00:04:25.120> going<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.330> store<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:25.870> in<00:04:25.990> your<00:04:26.020> body

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
so it's going to store it in your body

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.080 
so it's going to store it in your body
so<00:04:27.010> in<00:04:27.130> order<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.400> prevent<00:04:27.820> that<00:04:28.030> from

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
so in order to prevent that from

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.810 
so in order to prevent that from
happening<00:04:28.410> always<00:04:29.410> be<00:04:29.770> drinking<00:04:30.250> always<00:04:30.669> be

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
happening always be drinking always be

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.850 
happening always be drinking always be
hydrating<00:04:31.540> don't<00:04:32.110> feed<00:04:32.350> hydrate<00:04:32.770> yourself

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
hydrating don't feed hydrate yourself

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.890 
hydrating don't feed hydrate yourself
and<00:04:33.340> my<00:04:33.520> last<00:04:33.730> point<00:04:33.970> I'll<00:04:34.150> make<00:04:34.180> for<00:04:34.480> y'all<00:04:34.630> is

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.590 
and my last point I'll make for y'all is
again<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.530> best<00:04:35.919> way<00:04:36.190> besides<00:04:37.120> drink<00:04:37.389> a<00:04:37.419> lot

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
again the best way besides drink a lot

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.600 
again the best way besides drink a lot
of<00:04:37.720> water<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:38.320> combat<00:04:38.770> any<00:04:38.980> kind<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.400> water
