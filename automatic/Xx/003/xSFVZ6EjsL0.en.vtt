00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.200

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.139
 years and lives born of the angels is 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.869
 available remember old farc the one that I 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.719
 I told him I was walking like a tower in 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:17.029
 illuminate and I see that if walking like 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.240
 with the heels I was already in the 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.880
 ninth season you passed but I do not know 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.090
 presented to the quarterfinals if I 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.730
 problems with who with my dad 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.780
 day he beat me like he was a 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.149
 man and I preferred to leave the competition what 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.320
 that made me open my eyes I did not 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.539
 account that my daughter saw when I was 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.060
 hitting and now I'm back in 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:48.170
 I have talent logically 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.170
 the typical 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.640
 because you 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 known 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.050
 to me 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:10.740
 the colleagues that you started me 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.740
 and not live without you damn 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.740
 with my life 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.460
 in loves 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.330
 I do not abandon 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.040
 because at the end of everything 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.850
 now 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.850
 sleep 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.340
 arianna well more opinionable nice though 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.060
 your voice still seems to me but if you go 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.719
 to give the pass because I had to 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:54.590
 as how to manipulate or manipulate what 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.590
 it's very good damn talent 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.880
 at the time of getting the voice out to me 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.310
 you surprised that you came out 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.030
 then of bastad the pass and the truth 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.600
 I did not expect that voice to come out 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.370
 that he is as Benedict the clarity 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.240
 and also the truth that did surprise me 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.240
 I will give you the pair 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:28.020
 do not 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.020
 for me it 's one thing that I really want 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.820
 you do not influence them 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:43.220
 I'm not going to take the step and this time 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:43.220
 with that freedom that has already reached the end 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.800
 and if it was not a heel or andy because it 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:58.880
 walk like 7 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:58.880
 please make it look thank you 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.490
