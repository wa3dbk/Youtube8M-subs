00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.400
 armed with triples 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.080
 the triple is a structural piece 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.570
 formed by three fish that will allow us 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.270
 the union between panels whenever this 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.520
 not in corner that is to say 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.029
 configure a t- type union between 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.029
 panels 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.510
 the triple 13 pg cs forming a kind 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.420
 of letter 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.269
 so one of said pg / cs will have 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.930
 screwed to each of its wings another 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.930
 pgc 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.130
 to perform the triple it begins 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.710
 verifying measurements a practice 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.080
 It is advisable to place a pgc on your 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.750
 soul 40 millimeters from the edge of the 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.050
 table and take the ends with two 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.050
 sergeants 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:18.100
 in front of this pgc and leaning on his 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:23.040
 wing we put another screwed every 150 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.040
 millimeters so as not to lose the plane 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.369
 to screw the last pgc that 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.250
 make up the triple we support it on the 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.759
 free and facing the one that we ended up 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.759
 screw 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.260
 we put all the screws that the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.630
 allow the comfort of the table and if 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.040
 will miss one and we install it 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.040
 after removing the sergeants 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.849
 It is important to check in the plans of 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.579
 project assembly the places where 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.590
 anchors will be placed to the foundation and 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:26.500
 that it is feasible that some of said 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.500
 Anchors must be linked with triples
