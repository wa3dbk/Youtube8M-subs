00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
some people but that doesn't mean that I

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.399 
some people but that doesn't mean that I
would<00:01:19.920> settle<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.850> shitty<00:01:21.390> terrible<00:01:22.049> story

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
would settle for a shitty terrible story

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.960 
would settle for a shitty terrible story
that<00:01:22.680> just<00:01:22.860> means<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.430> want<00:01:23.729> something

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
that just means that I want something

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.450 
that just means that I want something
original<00:01:24.390> that's<00:01:25.110> good<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> if<00:01:25.890> somebody<00:01:26.250> did

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
original that's good and if somebody did

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.270 
original that's good and if somebody did
something<00:01:26.490> both<00:01:27.150> original<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.900> good<00:01:28.259> then<00:01:28.950> I

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
something both original and good then I

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.160

it's been done already and it can't be

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.100

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
he doesn't do that so it's going to be

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.490 
he doesn't do that so it's going to be
somewhat<00:04:18.270> similar<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.870> original<00:04:18.989> story

somewhat similar to the original story

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
somewhat similar to the original story
but<00:04:19.650> it's<00:04:19.770> going<00:04:19.890> to<00:04:19.950> it's<00:04:20.160> got<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.430> be

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
but it's going to it's got to be

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.520 
but it's going to it's got to be
different<00:04:20.700> because<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.419> new<00:04:21.840> main<00:04:22.049> character

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
different because a new main character

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.830 
different because a new main character
also<00:04:22.860> new<00:04:23.460> events<00:04:23.880> that<00:04:24.000> happen<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.450> could<00:04:24.660> do

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
also new events that happen you could do

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.840 
also new events that happen you could do
that<00:04:24.870> but<00:04:25.260> still<00:04:25.500> keep<00:04:25.770> with<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.340> change<00:04:26.640> the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
that but still keep with the change the

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.260 
that but still keep with the change the
world

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
world

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.059 
world
panik<00:04:27.539> with<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:27.990> self<00:04:28.349> righteous<00:04:28.740> character
