 when she got up early in the morning the guests were no longer 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:23.410

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:26.870
 water enters the house of the widow on all sides 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.960
 everything was already flooded and only 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:34.069
 her house was like an island in the middle 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.069
 large space of water from her house 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:38.349
 as the bank was narrow not flooded 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:41.949
 trail 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:44.120
 the widow woke the children and tells them 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:47.720
 big trouble came 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.030
 the water flooded the whole village only our house 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.300
 survived and there is a path from it 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:57.070

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.930

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.400
 she picked up the hands of the smallest guys 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:08.509
 and told others to hold on to her hem and 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:12.020
 they went on this path as they go 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:14.509
 the water after them comes and only 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.240
 the widow came to the high bank with the children 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:22.190
 how the whole valley space is completely 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:24.610
 stroked the water so the lake was formed 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.310
 ritsa 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:32.090
 old people say that who would be of the kind 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:36.520
 Absh hut did not appear in the lake pulls him 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:40.490
 some unknown power to drown in it 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:44.270
 that's why from the kind of shoes on now 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.779
 survived only the descendants of the poor sons 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.779
 widows
