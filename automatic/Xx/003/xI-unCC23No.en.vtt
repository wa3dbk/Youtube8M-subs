to have the best shot at presenting the
best<00:01:04.379> version<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.920> themselves<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.519> that's

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
best version of themselves and that's

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.600 
best version of themselves and that's
really<00:01:05.880> part<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.330> what<00:01:06.390> my<00:01:06.750> philosophy<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:08.040> you
