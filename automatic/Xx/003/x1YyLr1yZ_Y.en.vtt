00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
to point the funnels to this last hopper

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.330 
to point the funnels to this last hopper
here<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.019> you<00:02:19.110> want<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.319> go<00:02:19.440> out<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.950> get<00:02:20.190> to

the edge of the wall here and that was a
little<00:02:23.400> too<00:02:24.390> far<00:02:24.629> we'll<00:02:25.230> just<00:02:25.409> break<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.819> so

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
little too far we'll just break that so

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.640 
little too far we'll just break that so
it's<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.090> line<00:02:27.120> with<00:02:27.299> that<00:02:27.480> then<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.470> want<00:02:28.530> to

hoppers<00:02:40.470> holding<00:02:40.920> shift<00:02:41.160> like<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.879> then

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
hoppers holding shift like that and then

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.899 
hoppers holding shift like that and then
the<00:02:42.599> funnels<00:02:43.019> will<00:02:43.409> go<00:02:43.650> into<00:02:44.069> these<00:02:44.640> hoppers

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
the funnels will go into these hoppers

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.210 
the funnels will go into these hoppers
here<00:02:45.269> which<00:02:45.450> then<00:02:45.659> that<00:02:46.349> will<00:02:46.530> travel<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:47.099> this

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
here which then that will travel to this

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.089 
here which then that will travel to this
output<00:02:47.849> chest<00:02:48.480> here<00:02:48.690> now<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.739> want<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.890> do<00:02:50.040> it

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
output chest here now you want to do it

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.550 
output chest here now you want to do it
to<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.310> other<00:02:50.430> side<00:02:50.549> as<00:02:50.849> well<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.290> shift<00:02:52.290> right

click so the funnels are going to the

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.960 
click so the funnels are going to the
hoppers<00:02:54.989> out<00:02:55.200> there<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.680> then<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.579> connects

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
hoppers out there and then that connects

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.199 
hoppers out there and then that connects
up<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.470> chest<00:02:59.220> here<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.640> accidentally

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
and the trap chest now you'll not

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.080 
and the trap chest now you'll not
alternate<00:03:23.639> this<00:03:23.849> so<00:03:24.150> they<00:03:24.810> don't<00:03:25.019> connect<00:03:26.090> so

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
alternate this so they don't connect so

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.330 
alternate this so they don't connect so
like<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.510> two<00:03:27.900> there<00:03:28.109> and<00:03:28.319> then<00:03:28.410> two<00:03:29.069> on<00:03:29.099> this

side<00:03:29.480> then<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.690> between<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.169> gaps<00:03:31.380> just<00:03:31.709> place

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
side then in between the gaps just place

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.030 
side then in between the gaps just place
the<00:03:32.400> trap<00:03:32.639> chest<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.239> they<00:03:33.450> won't<00:03:33.980> make<00:03:34.980> a

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
the trap chest and they won't make a

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.190
