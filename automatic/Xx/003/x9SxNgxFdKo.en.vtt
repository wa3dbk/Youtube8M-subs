00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.540
 for her and work 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.300
 one 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.200
 do not 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.060
 for me it's an honor friends can 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.460
 share the new release of 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.140
 our device that 4 in which 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.629
 We are incorporating new 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.180
 functionalities and new fashions that we 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.649
 they make a robust device and the best 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.140
 what's in the market and let me 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.329
 tell them why I want to talk about their 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.730
 design I want to talk about the camera I want 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.769
 talk about your deployment starting with your 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.339
 design we have incorporated a device 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:54.309
 which has a slight curvature has 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:57.339
 3000 mm radius and you will say 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.600
 so we made this curvature everything 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.270
 that we have in our body 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.080
 it is curved 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.750
 from the ear the mouth in our chest in 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.340
 the bags everything is curved the shape of the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.380
 distance from our thumb to the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.330
 center of the screen or below the 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.220
 screen to be able to use a hand 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.350
 we have used the design that is 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.990
 Slim flame marc 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.120
 In addition to this we have incorporated 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.980
 materials like skin for part of 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.710
 make it an easy and functional phone 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.300
 make a smart phone I'm going to 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.570
 talk a little about the process of 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.060
 skin the process on the skin are pieces 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.040
 unique as well as the top designers 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.520
 who use leather for bags or shoes 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.500
 they use are unique pieces or use skins that 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.540
 last a long time we took three 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.810
 months in making each of our 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.880
 devices are handmade and 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.310
 We use double stitching to reinforce and 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.610
 that does not open we use colors 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.620
 vegetables for its durability and for 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.420
 when one has a rough use it is not 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.479
 stain those plant colors 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.820
 toxic which allow us is from 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.000
 be able to contribute to the environment 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.280
 how many colors will there be in hip hop 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.750
 mainly we are going to have two and 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.640
 as we evolve, we will 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.310
 incorporate different skin colors 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.819
 that we are going to do much more 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.760
 of crazy attractions and jovial districts 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.829
 I want to talk about the camera this camera 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.829
 It is unique in the market, it will explain 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:32.629
 why is it a 16 megapixel camera 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:34.639
 back and 8 megapixels front because 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.569
 is unique in the market because we have 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:41.060
 Built-in a manual module that makes it 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.940
 be a professional camera 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.550
 where we can play with him and with him 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.940
 white balance with the opening of the 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.030
 diaphragm with the with the time of 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.130
 shot which already adds a camera 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.480
 semi-professional all users go to 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.760
 have a professional camera in your hand 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.950
 with which they can play but one of the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.030
 advantages of this new manual is that 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.110
 example 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:10.370
 Yes, well, if I open it 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.300
 and I'm leaving mode badly, that's the celtic 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.620
 but if I go 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.150
 to manual mode 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.340
 I can play with the white balance 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.909
 looking for the best shot with the opening 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.909
 of the diaphragm 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.860
 with the ready to see we know that between 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.650
 minor and that's better photography and 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.819
 take the picture that we 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.220
 We want to be able to have a preview 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.830
 of the photograph of what it would look like before 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.819
 to be able to capture what we have also 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.430
 Built-in screen is the screen 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.720
 what you have is a screen 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.599
 quantum display is not how much command is not 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.310
 equal amoled is 4000 p that allows us 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:05.489
 have a resolution of 1440 x 2560 is 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.350
 an HD screen that is what we did to 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.080
 through proprietary technology the 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.330
 chip how much we have incorporated a few 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.480
 crystals that allow us to have 25 by 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.470
 Greater than 20% brightness level 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.780
 Greater color and 50% higher contrast 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.419
 what we are taking for this we are 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.169
 taking photographs of essential goods 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.419
 We want to bring the experience of 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.190
 screen where we can see the resolution 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.380
 of what we are forming 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.660
 coupled with this given the way in which 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:38.340
 We compress the crystals we have reduced 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:42.390
 the use of the battery in 4% through the 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.000
 new of the new ram 3gb processor that 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.510
 when we take a picture the cpu 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.740
 of the device stops with the way that 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.990
 we compress the light we save another 7% of 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.210
 battery and with flashlight interface 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.630
 user we save more than 11 percent 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.850
 of the battery that a monthly salary 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.370
 we plan to sell more than 100 thousand 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.020
 devices that 4 in Mexico are a 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.910
 high-end contender we are 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.890
 innovators in our products as 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.220
 you know in Barcelona we have won as 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.170
 best phone of the year in 2014 with 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.490
 excited glasses as best manufacturer 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:23.400
 in the year in 2012 and we are innovating 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:26.280
 and we believe that in Mexico the user 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.930
 Mexican is changing the way that 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.400
 interacts with devices through 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.580
 of all the social ones that we have 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.580
 Incorporated 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.940
 we plan to have a pre-paid price of 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:43.900
 13 thousand pesos and in different operators 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.340
 in postpaid and be able to be free 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.680
 mainly in third that has the 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.190
 the biggest coverage in the you will be 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.700
 to months without interest depending on 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.680
 plan that one chooses I thank you 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.070
 much this space and thanks for being 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.070
 with only
