00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
configuration that looks like this with

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.109 
configuration that looks like this with

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
three on a side in a square then you

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.939 
three on a side in a square then you
take<00:00:30.359> your<00:00:30.570> eyes<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.990> ender<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.349> place<00:00:31.710> them

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
simply on top of the portal pieces and

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.150 
simply on top of the portal pieces and
if<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.370> correctly<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:36.300> should<00:00:36.770> open<00:00:37.770> it

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
if we do it correctly we should open it

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.680 
if we do it correctly we should open it
end<00:00:38.370> portal<00:00:38.790> now<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.059> can<00:00:39.270> see<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.660> that

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
end portal now you can see that that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.090 
end portal now you can see that that
actually<00:00:40.140> didn't<00:00:40.440> work<00:00:40.590> which<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.890> very

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
actually didn't work which is very

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.069 
actually didn't work which is very
common<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.640> if<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.239> happens<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.780> simply

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
common and if that happens you simply

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.600 
common and if that happens you simply
need<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> break<00:00:43.590> one<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.040> corner<00:00:44.399> pieces

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
need to break one of the corner pieces

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.819 
need to break one of the corner pieces
and<00:00:45.030> place<00:00:45.239> an<00:00:45.510> eye<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:46.079> now<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.649> can

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
and place an eye on there now you can

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.170 
and place an eye on there now you can
see<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.070> still<00:00:47.309> didn't<00:00:47.550> work<00:00:47.579> simply<00:00:48.000> try

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
see it still didn't work simply try

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.600 
see it still didn't work simply try
breaking<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.629> different<00:00:48.960> corner<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:50.190> believe

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
breaking a different corner I believe

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.639 
breaking a different corner I believe
sometimes<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.690> one<00:00:51.870> yep<00:00:52.260> there<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.559> are

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
sometimes it's this one yep there we are

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.310 
sometimes it's this one yep there we are
and<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.850> now<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.660> can<00:00:55.020> go<00:00:55.260> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and you can see that now we can go to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.049 
and you can see that now we can go to
the<00:00:55.500> end<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.949> by<00:00:56.070> entering<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.550> portal<00:00:56.910> we

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the end and by entering the portal we

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.029 
the end and by entering the portal we
can<00:00:57.239> indeed<00:00:57.539> enter<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> end<00:00:58.109> now<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.920> other

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
can indeed enter the end now the other

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.010 
can indeed enter the end now the other
way<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> get<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> end<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.120> by<00:01:00.570> actually

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
way to get to the end is by actually

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.660 
way to get to the end is by actually
finding<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.620> stronghold<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.250> let's<00:01:02.399> go<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.640> that

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
finding a stronghold so let's go do that

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.549 
finding a stronghold so let's go do that
now<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.600> if<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.780> don't<00:01:03.899> want<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.229> cheat<00:01:04.409> and

now so if you don't want to cheat and
simply<00:01:04.949> build<00:01:05.220> yourself<00:01:05.640> an<00:01:05.820> end<00:01:05.970> portal<00:01:06.360> you

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
simply build yourself an end portal you

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.390 
simply build yourself an end portal you
can<00:01:06.540> actually<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> legit<00:01:07.320> way<00:01:07.740> by

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
can actually do it the legit way by

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.190 
can actually do it the legit way by
getting<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> couple<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.420> items<00:01:09.570> you're<00:01:09.930> going

into a completely different direction in
the<00:02:26.790> stronghold<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.659> you<00:02:27.719> once<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.109> find<00:02:28.349> the

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
the stronghold so you once you find the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
stronghold you actually need to search

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.149 
stronghold you actually need to search
around<00:02:30.049> until<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:31.230> find<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.650> portal<00:02:31.980> room

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
around until you find the portal room
