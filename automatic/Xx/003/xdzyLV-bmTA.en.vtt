00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 well hello everyone dear friends with 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.750
 your style of torus and this is a new release 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.500
 our project St. Petersburg metro in 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.090
 minecraft 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.400
 Well today the release of a 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.630
 built two stations this is gorky and 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.540
 Nevsky Avenue 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.650
 So start with Gorky in here such 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.480
 here at the station turned out on 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.180
 pretty narrow turned out and besides 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.949
 I don't know how cozy you are but 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.260
 very cozy is the lighting straight 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.630
 homemade thats really looks cozy 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.880
 pretty and what can they tell about 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.260
 such an ordinary station from us in principle 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.180
 it resembles an avenue of enlightenment 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.399
 because all the dreams of the station were me 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.480
 either completely open or with doors 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.280
 Well, one station was 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.320
 and so I have long been such stations are not 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.230
 built in principle here from such from on 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.670
 the station is here either unknown things 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.140
 who do not understand here that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.899
 what kind of ventilation is it when 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.850
 the trains arrive la2 what's up ventilation a 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.070
 We planted have turned out pretty 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.379
 more than necessary, well, it happened 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.510
 okay guys so this is from us 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.989
 it turns out the station yes so she 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.570
 Looks like it’s covered 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.400
 so to speak and here it is, let's all 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.080
 go to the next station is with us 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.970
 Nevsky Prospect although we are somehow quick 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.409
 looked over and okay so 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.000
 settled down oh forgot here 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.909
 limit line to put 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.659
 zheltenkie Come here to me, I will correct the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.610
 people ask when it will be all the same 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.900
 map I will lay out catastrophes second line but 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.750
 guys our construction speed 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.390
 ok so in the fall it will definitely be 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.759
 everything is ready even in August on in August 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.799
 Okay, there will soon be Nevsky Prospect 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.960
 and by the way ask us how much to go 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.329
 the whole line is taken about 15 minutes not exactly 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.619
 the whole line but up to that area which 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.689
 completed Nevsky Prospect 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.970
 one is defined as the next station Nevsky 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.400
 Avenue to the station Gostinn yard 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.800
 passage of trains 3 lines 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.220
 here we have the same arrow 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.740
 the usual well 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.210
 usually it is to deserted 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.960
 that's not what is different from the steel as on 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.500
 Petrograd 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.500
 Well, well , and by the guys tank back found 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.960
 tutorial everything is ready okay here such 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.960
 we got the station Nevsky Prospect 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.680
 Here is the transition to the station Gostiny Dvor 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.030
 the transition is recognized 3 lines good he is 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.800
 we got from the station she is at the very 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.680
 business updated just about 5 years ago 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.600
 Well, must wear 7 back here she 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.310
 looks much worse then we had 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.510
 red wall ordinary white tiles 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.270
 which fell off 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.280
 Well, part of the repair done and generally so 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.690
 much nicer to wear she is not this 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.880
 station, a lot of things you can tell it 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.950
 wider than gorky eats appear 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.350
 signposts that is the train Parnassus 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.900
 on porn left caused kupchino right 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.750
 here it is also such a table with columns 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.750
 happened on the broad pretty here 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.910
 I like these red walls 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.040
 still blue so good fusion here 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.019
 advertising as always and you see this 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.640
 us bridge it turns out we have a transition 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.870
 if I already said such a way adore 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.290
 plot they are cozy 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.600
 especially under the transitions so audible 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.920
 fish station everything shakes all too 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.780
 seat where you can sit 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.310
 density is such a transition actually 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.730
 here you can see how the trains will be 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.860
 ride 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.380
 fidelity is such a video straight even for a photo 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.150
 so it looks like that is such a 3d 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.709
 Usually we have time or so right 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.200
 close that is, they know right at all 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.269
 you ca n’t see two hours for you 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.640
 I will show you an example full then they are very years in 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.019
 Moscow did not do it this way 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.060
 seen not even know I was wrong, he said, 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.790
 somehow guys so here it is all now 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.110
 Looks like in the current St. Petersburg 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.880
 almost nothing is visible 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.770
 it is of course unfortunately very sad 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.900
 There, too, this is crazy possible 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.220
 jumped off something okay just to 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.380
 the station is still the way a bad view from here 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.890
 it can be seen but that is not here at least 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.660
 tunnel checks manat 5 pcs akad huge 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.040
 open area 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.360
 Well, what else can you tell this 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.040
 stations yes basically nothing to this 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.830
 Nevsky Prospekt himself well, polar station 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.330
 I think everyone knows Nevsky Prospect 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.490
 popular prospectus for collection 1 in St. Petersburg 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.810
 Well, this is how we got the station 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.310
 In general, the whole issue is well with you 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.050
