00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 thank everyone for the support and 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.220
 other 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.500
 here we just see each other and from very 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.009
 happy I think that I do not 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.710
 He expected and this cream for 18 in those 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.119
 circumstances and seriously andrés that is 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.730
 yourself what it takes for 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.890
 surprise yes I think yes a little I knew 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.199
 that was fine already to romandía I gave myself 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.400
 mind that it was fine but good 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.080
 also he was eager he had 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.199
 come in the talks was very good 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.610
 when I had an injury and good to 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.559
 Sometimes it is what happens that one does not give 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.559
 count and you make those required breaks 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.420
 and they all come to him well even today 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.390
 He is talking to a journalist brand and 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.230
 then another of this confirmed me and he 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.450
 he told me perhaps in one way or another what 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.050
 what was wrong at the time the fracture 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.020
 of the elbow served him android to give him a 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.250
 little rest and take already with this with 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.539
 that rest a bit what was the turn 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.539
 from italy you analyze it and ccoo 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.250
 I analyze it well and I think also not 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.990
 I know the circumstances of the race 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.619
 we came with a clear leader we came 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.040
 to take care of ourselves without getting tired and that 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.950
 I think that reflects a lot and good 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.320
 accompanied by good performance of the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.240
 very good weight of the state also here yes 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.310
 for mine really like that I'm not 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.990
 let's say but for what it was before and 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.030
 I already have almost no power 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.799
 five kilos less I have the important thing is 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.340
 that does not lose power and keep it and 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.560
 that's the dilemma really do not 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.360
 lose I have power of weight and not by 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.490
 power that there is to eat and 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.740
 loses weight in the end loses strength and is 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.810
 the same goes for the physical hand what 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.729
 important is to lose fat and maintain 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.649
 musculature I wish and good musculature 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.759
 you always lose a little but without 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.670
 keep that so that the relationship 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.009
 weight / power is to have more power 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.350
 less weight faster at a click as you 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.450
 has felt because all this I think that 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.100
 as you say it, you take it from us 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.110
 do to us the fans already 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.090
 we know what you explain to me if 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.050
 one does not lower the floor to give very 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.490
 clearly 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:10.130
 but it leaves us with that flavor 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.690
 greater since seeing it there said you're in the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.270
 people say but I think I have 28 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.850
 years and sometimes they say that good age 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.710
 of a runner who knows how to take care 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.710
 It is between the two after 28 years 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.930
 until thirty-something and I think that 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.670
 also a little more has happened to me 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.610
 of the head factor say the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.090
 mental and I think that now the 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.130
 essence ready if I believe that now day to 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.800
 day with the pressure and everything I think what 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.230
 we have been able to face well and motivated 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.960
 enjoying and that it's best to enjoy the 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.720
 moment without now that that sometimes is that 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.720
 if you have a lot of pressure or something for nothing 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.570
 I think that more pressure is to enjoy the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.060
 moment from day to day and I 'm already 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.650
 I'm glad I'm not conformist but I'm 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.500
 happy was there I know that for a 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.510
 future I can be there very cruel already has 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.280
 indifferently left indifferent 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.260
 I ended up doing style if 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.750
 mentally much more motivated now I 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.990
 I think more than physically from the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.880
 mentally and I'm totally motivated 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.440
 and wanting to keep growing and 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.760
 to be able to continue doing what I most 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.409
 like the correct vision android 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.450
 you today at the conference of 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.640
 press they took him to the truth rai the 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.939
 Italian Spanish television radio and 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.560
 they and they said you I'm ready 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.319
 to even go fight until the 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.849
 last moment the third rung 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.209
 place explained to me the podium where the shot 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.209
 Italy 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.650
 and I think we already said a little bit of 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.620
 tests and we saw that it did not go up we put a 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.880
 rhythm and argued and good but it was a 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.010
 pretty short stage and 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.080
 and tomorrow I think we 're going to try 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.950
 in them to us some some have 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.890
 what to see but if you can we'll 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.320
 do and then I'm going to do it 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.790
 and at the end of the book we'll talk about everything 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.240
 this of all that is the recapitulation 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.790
 pull morning salt vineyard 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.790
 so many things that I am going to do 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.420
 I came to the bank inside the pressed if 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.540
 day 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.820
 mythical in all tourist sense and idea 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.120
 for me it has a special meaning 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.010
 that was when the first 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.240
 so the first race they won 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.750
 professionals and in the turn of italy 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.370
 it was also online and for me it does have 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.860
 a meaning that will never forget or 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.060
 the name or the place and cerviño what 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.639
 put back in history this 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.139
 tomorrow as we read today the race a 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.300
 little what you said that wear the 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.919
 try where you can break the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.229
 rope that third place of the avalanche that 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.500
 so much can you remove it ends it becomes 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.880
 to cross in his way yes and I think 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.060
 which is an arrival that I also like 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.780
 is very spread out and as I say if I can 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.120
 I'll try 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.310
 sometimes we are not the leader team either 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.990
 much less because in the end they are 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.880
 those that sometimes layers and goes to 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.400
 far away or are not we going to make a 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.400
 responsibility but I believe that 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.430
 What if tomorrow is going to be a beautiful day? 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.560
 long and then I think it's going to 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.389
 respect the time also then it goes to 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.810
 is going to be a beautiful day and obviously 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:18.479
 in seville the time I came up with the 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.860
 very bad weather it was raining and so on and 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.460
 I think tomorrow will be a bit different 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.460
 good weather 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.690
 and thank you I know and always 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.110
 said he was always from not for now 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.410
 equal for the position something but from the 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.930
 of 2012 when the tour of france and 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:40.210
 they have always been there supporting us and I 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.780
 I think I'm very grateful to always receive 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.550
 that support 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.780
 thanks and last detail you 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.790
 is aware of the revolution that has 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.740
 caused in Costa Rica came because 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.320
 I'm here but it did solve in the 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:54.970
 social networks yes I think there are more 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:59.080
 grateful movement with all the people 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:01.860
 since it supports us and everything and hopefully 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.189
 we can return it there 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.080
 of pride to the country so they know that 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:10.259
 there is talent there we are a small country 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.360
 but with a big heart and that we are 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.939
 trying to leave the flag at the top 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.719
 of what is this clear career I think 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:20.550
 that having already won those of the 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:22.139
 places for the Olympics both in 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.479
 mountain bike as as en route with 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.669
 Josue and you can give us 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.189
 eventually I also think 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.509
 that I do not know how it is and by countries if the 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:32.639
 country is among the first I do not know 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:35.099
 how many in these moments in fact you 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:37.919
 we would be approaching the classification 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:39.870
 of Olympic games although you have to 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:42.389
 wait for the closure by the ranking 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:47.849
 of the uci in this case of the worldtour is 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:49.590
 a little more than the others besides the 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:51.360
 theme is that it brings us closer but yes I believe 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.770
 that the important thing is that good for all 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.150
 the sides have been fine 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.610
 representing the country and 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.449
 Pan American there with Josue wanted and won 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.719
 medal 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:03.419
 André and fonseca a nelly fonseca also 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:06.059
 I think that the important thing 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.699
 I would like it but I can not be in 

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:09.900
 that that kind of career for good by 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:12.270
 theme that matches us with the 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.830
 calendars here but I think the 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.659
 you are doing your job here I 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.969
 I'm doing the job medicine that 

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:20.599
 Tomorrow we pay for the TV we are going to make 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:20.599
 there something nice
