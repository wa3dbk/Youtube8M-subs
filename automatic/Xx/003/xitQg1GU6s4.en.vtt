00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.260
 we have reached one sixth of the 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.420
 special origin of the killer einstein 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.280
 this time we will talk to you only 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.650
 of a character who is not capable 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.840
 to take elements of other games the 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.610
 name of a famous singer of the 80s 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.830
 and even the appearance of a mythical 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.830
 monster of a Hollywood band of 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.660
 the obscura these are the origins of 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.850
 idol 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.530
 as you should know idol is the one who is the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.840
 end of the first delivery of killer 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.120
 instinct which could even be 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.040
 selectable by a trick which 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.830
 we already talk to you and therefore you must 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.530
 know in itself was a great boss nothing 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.930
 easy to defeat 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.059
 let us start with its true origin the 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.710
 creative network from the beginning 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.440
 pose to have a boss who was 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.420
 dominant and very notorious as it was 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.129
 the choir in wall fight for what 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.039
 they decided to create their own version of 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.320
 this if they are fixed to both heads are a 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.050
 large size differ greatly from the 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.560
 more characters and both are complicated 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.560
 to beat 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.400
 but the appearance of idol does not come 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.560
 precisely wanting to tie with a hat 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.780
 itself is practically a clone of 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.910
 characters there are clubs from the tape of 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.770
 steven voyage oxy map of 1958 has almost 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.470
 everything in common is to say the legs 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.270
 similar to the gumina tauro the physical 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.000
 from the waist up of a human 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.650
 muscular and humanoid face with a 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.410
 single eye and a horn in the head 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.630
 Obvious idol was added another head 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.430
 so that another mini was not identical 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.740
 horn as well as they were put 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.290
 clay in the ears very much in style 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.820
 master clean only so that he had a 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.100
 look something different 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.260
 Also the concept of firewalls 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.720
 green color comes from an effect of the 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.000
 same tape probably to the objective 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.920
 it seemed like a good idea to leave 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.259
 a power of the character 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.450
 we really want to assume that this great 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.940
 clone was made as a tribute to 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.390
 creator of these works in stop motion is 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.830
 say to the now deceased ray harryhausen 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.930
 which created many characters 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.730
 mythological and great works with 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.040
 special effects like in this case 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.739
 similarly if it was not intentional the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.720
 tribute can now be taken thus 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.720
 you already know where it really came from 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.510
 but the plagiarism of the 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.250
 character there is another one that can be 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.830
 taken only as a reference 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.960
 for the name of idol comes from 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.660
 famous rock singer of the 80s is 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.550
 called billy idol which we assume 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.550
 some of the creatives was a fan 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.140
 in the end of the character in the game 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.150
 we learn that he really is called 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.880
 bill and which completes the name of the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.980
 singer is to say billy idol obvious 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.740
 written in another way although it gives the 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.530
 same sound this is a curious fact that 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.840
 few knew or assimilated 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.090
 to finish with this character his 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.430
 final turn is a satire of the end 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.140
 of white in street fighter 2 where 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.390
 he came to his mother and recognized him 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.130
 Calling him by his real name is 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.470
 say in gaming 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.990
 well in the case of idol the end is very 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.360
 similar except that he does not agree to be the 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.180
 lost son and ends up ending up with the 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.610
 supposed mother this with a little humor 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.950
 black 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.960
 this time it 's all in the next 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.960
 Delivery will be the turn of maya 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.090
 about this
