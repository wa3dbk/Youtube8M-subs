 currently the huawei snb 620 it in mine 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.690
 hands that is also in the context of the ifa 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.910

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.440
 comes to germany and the big one 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.480
 To cover the mass market is to make one 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.619
 very short tour around the device and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.029
 logically, we start on the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.430
 front we have so in the upper 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.590
 area the earpiece the huawei logo 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.930
 and a front camera for service or 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.269
 for video calling then we have one 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.390
 five inch big hd display that means 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.280
 with a resolution of 12 x 80 x 720 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.770
 pixel and in the lower area we have 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.120
 under the display capacitive buttons that 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.920
 is called a back button the home 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.989
 button and the button for the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.390
 attitude or for some design 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.370
 changing transitions and features how to 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.559
 that from the huawei smartphones 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.420
 knows the surface is running with android 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.489
 4.4 kitkat so the last generation 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.690
 I'll go over that for a moment 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.940
 phone and there we get already 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.399
 some technical data with the addition 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.449
 Of course we are kitkat here 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.900
 have run 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.420
 in the emotional 2.3 whether an update on 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.799
 this new motion you 3.0 is coming 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.100
 this is not known yet 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.330
 however, this surface is also 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.530
 well known by huawei and runs extremely 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.930
 liquid on this device 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.700
 as a processor is a quad core for 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.210
 use namely the polycom snapdragon 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.280
 410 is one of the 32 and 64 bit 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.439
 Mode can work is a quad core 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.000
 as I said with 1 2 ghz 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.939
 we have a gigabyte of memory 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.009
 and an internal memory of 8 gb 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.520
 again by means of a micro SD card 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.170
 Up to 32 gigabytes can be increased 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.670
 sometimes even bigger ones run 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.409
 did in these devices that one must 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.360
 Just give me a try 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.500
 very short tour around the device 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.299

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.850

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.740

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.090
 we have the micro-usb connection and 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.729

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.189
 have a call on the left side 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.170

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.270
 we still have the audio connection for the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.399
 headphone 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.459
 on the back of the device we have 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.230

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.730
 in the lower right area we have 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.379
 nor built the speakers the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.000
 backside is made of polycarbonate that 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.849
 means is a classic basic material and 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.379
 I can lose weight and I have to 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.440
 looking for the small slot 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:28.370
 I installed it there 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.349
 found and with a few handles 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.480
 the whole thing already taken off and you 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.940
 can have a look just on the micro sim 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.880

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.670
