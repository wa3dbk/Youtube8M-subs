00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.290 
I've got a double stripe paint job my
own<00:01:05.899> design<00:01:06.899> on<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> front<00:01:07.410> and<00:01:08.060> it's<00:01:09.060> kind<00:01:09.270> of

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
own design on the front and it's kind of

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.940 
own design on the front and it's kind of
a<00:01:09.390> cool<00:01:09.630> pattern<00:01:09.840> because<00:01:10.200> if<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.410> get<00:01:10.590> kind

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
a cool pattern because if you get kind

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.639 
a cool pattern because if you get kind
of<00:01:11.070> sideways<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.780> stripes<00:01:13.170> kind<00:01:13.560> of

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
of sideways the stripes kind of

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.530 
of sideways the stripes kind of
disappear<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.820> same<00:01:15.090> queue<00:01:16.130> has<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.520> room<00:01:18.270> so

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
disappear the same queue has the room so

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.270 
disappear the same queue has the room so
that<00:01:18.690> they<00:01:18.960> match<00:01:19.140> will<00:01:19.380> kind<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.710> hue<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.160> you

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
that they match will kind of hue if you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.560 
that they match will kind of hue if you
look<00:01:20.399> at<00:01:20.550> it<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.820> black-and-white<00:01:21.060> film

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
look at it and the black-and-white film

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
look at it and the black-and-white film
they<00:01:21.720> wouldn't<00:01:21.990> show<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.250> stripes

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
they wouldn't show up so the stripes

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.249 
they wouldn't show up so the stripes
don't<00:01:23.790> actually<00:01:24.030> stand<00:01:24.479> out<00:01:24.690> at<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.050> unless

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
don't actually stand out at you unless

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.020 
don't actually stand out at you unless
you're<00:01:25.440> actually<00:01:25.560> seeing<00:01:26.010> them<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> book

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030

you're actually seeing them in the book
and<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.870> course<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.260> stripes<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.830> match<00:01:29.220> them

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and of course the stripes I match them

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.429 
and of course the stripes I match them
to<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.440> to<00:01:31.440> the
