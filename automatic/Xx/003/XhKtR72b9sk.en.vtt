00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.049

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:09.840

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.640
 It was there, I know, it's not time to drink. 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.100
 water Brazil leaves things responsible 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.010
 then plucked that things take 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.030
 number 1 goes to the lungs because it is 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.990
 feather 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.990
 so it's a lung 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:04:02.970
 oh the crazy, handsome brother 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:09.420
 now let's get this here and I heard 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:11.100
 say that you have to export until here 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.200
 down 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.200
 I think I've cut or not 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:27.080
 to this hand not to fall the team now 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.950
 It's up here that opa opa my 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.450
 control 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:36.250
 so it's for the boy he could not 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.250
 Cut this part out here. I do not know why. 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.080
 but I think we're going to have to cut it is that 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:49.850
 the little heart the first time I got 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:53.990
 cut the pope after the singer was there 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:57.560
 Calm down , let's go. 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.300
 Come on, they've won the heart of 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.370
 damaged 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.410
 if I can get the first time 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.270
 will dress that the daughter of her life was 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.140
 practical purpose is to send the daughter 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.280
 her out 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:22.790
 Look, you did not even have to take it alone. 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:25.760
 where the heart is good here here here 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:29.290
 not so that the curves so that the 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.290
 curves will goes 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:43.880
 the foundation will take place the collection 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:47.590
 will-will please you is to talk 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:51.380
 that is finally we get laborer the 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:54.410
 androgen 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:58.010
 then the ambulance and so far Brazil 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.080
 listen to music and ucs goes music but 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.780
 at least now we can operate 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.700
 the Ambrose we continue and for the 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.170
 hospital just because you have to do the 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.000
 shea fields and see if everything is in order 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.880
 you know how it is right 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.890
 but in principle Brazil will get away 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.400
 From this surgery I hope so. 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:18.800
 at least she seems to have run into 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.270
 2052 Brazil is to provoke doubt stirs 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.590
 happens to the best 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.750
 The fight to leave the door was 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.350
 making noise from the road 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:30.500
 the driver was obliged and prompt room was 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.630
 successfully operated in brazil soon 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.180
 we have again another operation 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.510
 here in Brazil probably the risks 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.850
 that the next one is not here in the ambulance 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.220
 teleton is to see if we can heal 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:47.440
 Brazil opened the door went away 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.440
