00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.139
 First, you have the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.470
 terrace area exactly do you write 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:20.330
 the mass in a sketch the planned one 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.330
 Then stretch the surface with a string 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.489
 To do this you need safety tape holder 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:34.980
 you save the cord with that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.430
 mason angle you control the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.430
 right angle 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.650
 measure the exact length and with 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.650
 highlight the masking tape 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.680
 now let a cord stretch in front 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.270
 the corners run crosswise over the corners 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.260
 you need the locked area now 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.000
 to prepare 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.300
 look at the construction of a terrace 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.220
 as a substrate at least 20 cm 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.360
 gravel or another antifreeze 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.140
 material edge stones 4 cm split flat 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.820
 withdrawn 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.900
 a weed fleece and patio tiles 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.520
 on the one hand come the one 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.140
 terraces camp and then the 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.600
 porcelain stoneware plates 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.100
 on the other surface terrace camps 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.290
 the substructure and the wpc deal 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.210
 to the heights then come again 6 cm 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.430
 fall to it later more 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.650
 if you add everything together on 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.540
 for wpc terrace you have the 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.780
 total height 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.480
 in our example are 47 cm 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.950
 the distance from the house to the floor is 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.680
 31 cm 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.900
 so you have the floor now 16 cm 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.520
 make a decoys you best one 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.360
 sketch then you always have later 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.360
 all data ready
