00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.379
 new video from max because it de me 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.330
 I want you today the huawei e5 186 lte 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.130
 This is how it is 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.370
 for the first lte router for lte 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.680
 advanced or old category 6 in the downlink 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.119
 the device is possible up to 300 megabits 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.460
 it's twice as fast as that 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.810
 predecessor clock at b 503 could only 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.380
 Category 4 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.240
 Yes, the Huawei E5 186 was released in February 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.189
 2014 at the mobile world congress in 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.710
 barcelona and also at 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.219
 the german telekom as telekom speed 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.320
 box was 3 and vodafone b 4000 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.550
 Available the packaging can 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.200
 possibly from Germany 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.850
 available copy differ 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.860
 but the content should be the same 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.809
 So the router is included 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.329
 short network cable is one 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.710
 power supply and what is missing, unfortunately 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.079
 a detailed guide that would be 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.460
 Unfortunately , there has not been anything nice 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.770
 there you have to go to the web interface 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.960
 access through the browser then respectively 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.190
 in the terminal or according to the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.559
 app one can also take over from 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.110
 android or ios right on that 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.360
 connector face to grab 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.200
 Here we look at the Huawei E5 186 times 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.860
 a little closer 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.960
 on the front hood leds for power for 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.600
 the mode so the nets mode 2g 3g 4g 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.420
 is displayed here for wlan for 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.880
 telephony and for the signal so that 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.290
 network signal 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.450
 where you have to say the voice here 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.770
 function missing in the version of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.439
 German telecom so at the speed box 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.140
 3, you will be the led here 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.210
 also do not find 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.369
 yes, there is a shaft on the side 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.540
 for micro sim cards is protected here 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.430
 from a nice flap and otherwise 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.990
 we have a wlan button here 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.729
 can the wlan on and off without 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.200
 easy to go to the webinterface 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.240
 over a hardware button one 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.640
 reset button and wps button we have too 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.549
 gps for quick encryption with 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.140
 the wlan above is nothing 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.520
 there is nothing else on the other side 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.259
 and below there is nothing on 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.369
 connections for this are on the back 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.979
 very many connections 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.390
 yes we have wifi here in gigabit 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.210
 gigabit lan connections 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.440
 gigabit lan means up to 1000 megabits 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.750
 So you can do the full lte 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.890
 speed of 300 megabits on the pc 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.630
 the game console or wherever 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.420
 then use it if we two 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.080
 telephone connections aj 11 for analog 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.690
 phones 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.690
 you can use voice over ip or just 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.070
 telephony over the sim card 2g 3g can 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.330
 you will not use it then 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.410
 does not support voice over lte 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.140
 at least not in the current one 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.070
 software version these connections are 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.220
 as I said at the German telecom 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.069
 version not on it are covered 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.090
 and here to the usb connection still for 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.989
 printer for example or storage media 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.000
 then the power connection for the 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.459
 power supply of course and what a lot 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.890
 nice one vip key to the device switched on 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.530
 and turn off 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.290
 that was the predecessor huawei e5 93 too 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.150
 not yet here on top of 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.890
 the back there is a cover for 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.340
 we have external antenna connections 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.019
 two pieces sma we can either here 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.820
 two antennas or a mimo antenna 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.209
 connect for lte one knows that 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.470
 already by other routers and 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.480
 Incidentally, I think reception quality is included 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.950
 the device without external antenna not at all 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.070
 times as good as this have to proceed 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.989
 bit better I mean it most 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.670
 average and with the external 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.079
 antenna I like reception but very much 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.560
 well i have those funkwerk 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.489
 or used a novella 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.459
 test report you can find on max because it 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.450
 de also from the antennas and that was 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.820
 the reception was really good 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.900
 yes and the speeds are mine 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.000
 opinion also pretty good 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.700
 depending on it's just on the tariff 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.989
 which one uses is clearly something 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.760
 you can not see from the outside that is 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.950
 integrated wlan module makes that you 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.230
 just back to the wireless module 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.540
 sparks on both 2.4 gigahertz as well 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.989
 5 gigahertz and was compared with it 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.030
 to the predecessor huber b 50 at 593 again 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.790
 significantly improves the speed 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.200
 is a maximum of 867 megabit as I am 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.579
 pc could notice with a 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.650
 matching artistry and within 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.690
 five meters and a wall in between 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.640
 I also reached this 867 megabit 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.500
 gross at least net it is natural 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.940
 a little less but you can handle it 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.560
 already work very well and the full 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.599
 lte speed of 300 megabits 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.320
 would arrive at the pc that's the 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.950
 important 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.020
 yes the huawei e5 186 costs about 250 to 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.200
 300 euros in trade without mobile communications 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.430
 contract and without sim-lock of course and 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.050
 Yes, who is worth the purchase? 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.850
 finally for all the modern lte 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.680
 router also search the home network 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.170
 through gigabit lan and wlan very fast 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.010
 Is on the way 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.260
 You really only have to cut corners at 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.670
 the reception quality of wlan and lte 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.070
 make that is just average my 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.440
 opinion, however , you will be here 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.520
 not much better reception 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.270
 the predecessor as I said a whole 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.860
 a little bit better 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.350
 many will but one lte excel one 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.860
 external lte users use because it is in 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.530
 It does not matter if you like the video for 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.670
 huawei e5 186 liked then pleased 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.590
 I'm a thumbs up 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.490
 and if you have questions then ask 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.490
 Of course, these in the comments
