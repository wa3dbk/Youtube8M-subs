pretty solid I'm gonna put another

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.480 
pretty solid I'm gonna put another
bracket<00:03:08.900> over<00:03:09.230> on<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.380> other<00:03:09.440> side<00:03:09.590> off<00:03:10.130> the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
bracket over on the other side off the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.310 
bracket over on the other side off the
firewall<00:03:11.210> and<00:03:11.450> then<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:11.870> ain't<00:03:12.050> gonna<00:03:12.140> go

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
firewall and then it ain't gonna go

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.560 
firewall and then it ain't gonna go
anywhere<00:03:12.590> because<00:03:12.710> I<00:03:12.890> can't<00:03:13.160> handle<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:14.480> know

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
anywhere because I can't handle you know

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.030 
anywhere because I can't handle you know
rattling<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:15.320> things<00:03:15.500> like<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.920> especially

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
rattling and things like that especially

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.500 
rattling and things like that especially
if<00:03:16.340> you're<00:03:16.490> doing<00:03:16.670> some<00:03:16.790> off-road<00:03:17.240> and<00:03:17.420> your

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
if you're doing some off-road and your

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.450 
if you're doing some off-road and your
Dash<00:03:17.690> is<00:03:17.930> rattling<00:03:18.290> on<00:03:18.410> you<00:03:18.560> that's<00:03:18.740> just<00:03:18.920> not

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
Dash is rattling on you that's just not

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.250 
Dash is rattling on you that's just not
good<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.850> go<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:20.360> I'm<00:03:20.930> gonna<00:03:21.050> put<00:03:21.200> another

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
good to go so I'm gonna put another

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.470 
good to go so I'm gonna put another
bracket<00:03:21.770> in<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.160> it'll<00:03:22.790> be<00:03:22.910> solid<00:03:23.270> I<00:03:23.330> mean

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
bracket in and it'll be solid I mean

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.840 
bracket in and it'll be solid I mean
it's<00:03:23.630> pretty<00:03:23.870> pretty<00:03:24.770> solid<00:03:25.160> now<00:03:25.310> but<00:03:25.820> I

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
it's pretty pretty solid now but I

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.040 
it's pretty pretty solid now but I
wanted<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.240> little<00:03:26.360> bit<00:03:26.510> better

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
wanted a little bit better

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.720 
wanted a little bit better
so<00:03:27.920> that's<00:03:28.100> my<00:03:28.250> dash<00:03:28.400> build<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.050> just<00:03:30.050> got<00:03:30.730> my

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
so that's my dash build and just got my

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.400 
so that's my dash build and just got my
two<00:03:31.790> inch<00:03:33.760> bender<00:03:34.760> for<00:03:35.420> my<00:03:35.540> tube<00:03:35.780> my<00:03:36.020> mandrel

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
two inch bender for my tube my mandrel

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.970 
two inch bender for my tube my mandrel
bender<00:03:36.740> which<00:03:37.400> was<00:03:37.640> not<00:03:37.820> cheap<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.360> it's<00:03:38.480> been

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
bender which was not cheap and it's been

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.890 
bender which was not cheap and it's been
quite<00:03:39.980> a<00:03:40.070> while<00:03:40.280> saving<00:03:41.180> up<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.420> get<00:03:41.660> that

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
quite a while saving up to get that

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.350 
quite a while saving up to get that
piece<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:42.500> that<00:03:43.490> goes<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.120> model<00:03:44.920> 32

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
piece and that goes to the model 32

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.260 
piece and that goes to the model 32
that's<00:03:47.360> a<00:03:47.480> GD<00:03:47.810> squared<00:03:48.430> mandrel<00:03:49.430> bender<00:03:49.730> so

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
that's a GD squared mandrel bender so

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.090 
that's a GD squared mandrel bender so
we're<00:03:50.660> gonna<00:03:50.810> get<00:03:50.990> ready<00:03:51.170> to<00:03:51.590> put<00:03:51.770> the<00:03:51.860> cage<00:03:52.070> in

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
on to the electronics like Center I've

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.250 
on to the electronics like Center I've
really<00:04:14.300> figured<00:04:14.570> out<00:04:14.600> how<00:04:14.810> I'm<00:04:14.870> gonna<00:04:14.960> build

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
really figured out how I'm gonna build

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.920 
really figured out how I'm gonna build
up<00:04:15.410> but<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.590> do<00:04:15.680> want<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:15.920> make<00:04:16.040> it<00:04:16.100> lockable<00:04:16.640> and

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
up but I do want to make it lockable and

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.810 
up but I do want to make it lockable and
that'll<00:04:17.930> go<00:04:18.049> in<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.200> center<00:04:18.530> got<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.460> center

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
that'll go in the center got a center

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.030 
that'll go in the center got a center
console<00:04:20.330> with<00:04:20.570> switches<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.739> whole<00:04:21.890> nine

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
console with switches and the whole nine

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.950 
console with switches and the whole nine
yards<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:22.550> then<00:04:22.670> on<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:23.420> right<00:04:23.600> hand<00:04:23.780> side

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
yards and then on the right hand side

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.780 
yards and then on the right hand side
probably<00:04:24.620> end<00:04:24.770> up<00:04:24.860> putting<00:04:25.100> in<00:04:25.250> a<00:04:25.340> grab<00:04:25.550> bar

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
probably end up putting in a grab bar

probably end up putting in a grab bar
