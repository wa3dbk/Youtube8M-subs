game I can play the game that I've been

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.569 
game I can play the game that I've been
playing<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.689> often<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.320> that's<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.310> really

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
playing so often and that's a really

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.649 
playing so often and that's a really
cool<00:01:56.729> feature<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.180> if<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.329> look<00:01:57.360> at<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
cool feature so if we look at the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.880 
cool feature so if we look at the
thumbnail<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.500> bottom<00:01:58.740> right<00:01:58.829> hand

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
thumbnail on the bottom right hand

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.200 
thumbnail on the bottom right hand
corner<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.430> thumbnail<00:01:59.820> you'll<00:01:59.969> notice

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
corner of the thumbnail you'll notice

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.120 
corner of the thumbnail you'll notice
that<00:02:00.270> there's<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.600> controller<00:02:01.049> there<00:02:01.320> now<00:02:01.890> it's

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that there's a controller there now it's

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.410 
that there's a controller there now it's
split<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.610> half<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.000> means<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.299> has

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
split and a half that means it has

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.920 
split and a half that means it has
partial<00:02:03.960> support<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:05.040> game<00:02:05.369> controllers<00:02:05.930> so

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
partial support for game controllers so

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.469 
partial support for game controllers so
we<00:02:07.079> move<00:02:07.229> over<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.680> something<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:09.179> meat

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
we move over to something so like meat

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.570 
we move over to something so like meat
boy<00:02:09.660> you'll<00:02:10.259> see<00:02:10.470> now<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.709> console<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.340> full

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
boy you'll see now the console is full

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.760 
boy you'll see now the console is full
which<00:02:11.790> means<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.120> has<00:02:12.150> full<00:02:12.510> controller

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
which means it has full controller

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.140 
which means it has full controller
work<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.280> that's<00:02:14.580> something<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.880> keep<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.090> mind

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
work so that's something to keep in mind

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.310 
work so that's something to keep in mind
i<00:02:15.450> don't<00:02:15.630> really<00:02:15.720> know<00:02:15.870> what<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.050> means<00:02:16.200> by

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
i don't really know what it means by

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.900 
i don't really know what it means by
partial<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:16.860> full<00:02:16.920> controller<00:02:17.400> support<00:02:17.610> they

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
partial and full controller support they

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.670 
partial and full controller support they
both<00:02:18.060> work<00:02:18.300> controllers<00:02:18.780> work<00:02:19.500> with

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
both work controllers work with

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.590 
both work controllers work with
controller<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.220> that's<00:02:20.370> cool<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.390> we're<00:02:21.480> going

a web browser that's built into steam
which<00:06:16.919> i<00:06:17.040> think<00:06:17.100> is<00:06:17.370> amazing<00:06:17.640> this<00:06:18.919> this

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
which i think is amazing this this

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.190 
which i think is amazing this this
browser<00:06:20.160> is<00:06:20.400> amazing<00:06:20.880> it's<00:06:21.030> so<00:06:21.090> fast<00:06:21.570> it's

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
browser is amazing it's so fast it's

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.469 
browser is amazing it's so fast it's
pretty<00:06:22.560> much<00:06:22.830> on<00:06:23.100> par<00:06:23.160> with<00:06:23.550> chrome<00:06:24.060> if<00:06:24.270> not

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
pretty much on par with chrome if not

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.780 
pretty much on par with chrome if not
faster<00:06:24.780> than<00:06:25.050> chrome<00:06:25.350> it's<00:06:26.040> a<00:06:26.160> little<00:06:26.280> clunky

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
faster than chrome it's a little clunky

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.310 
faster than chrome it's a little clunky
to<00:06:26.880> use<00:06:27.090> with<00:06:27.300> the<00:06:27.510> joystick<00:06:28.020> but<00:06:28.200> it's

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
to use with the joystick but it's

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.200 
to use with the joystick but it's
probably<00:06:28.590> a<00:06:28.680> lot<00:06:28.830> better<00:06:29.070> with<00:06:29.430> the<00:06:29.729> mouse<00:06:30.000> and

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
probably a lot better with the mouse and

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.350 
probably a lot better with the mouse and
keyboard<00:06:30.300> so<00:06:31.669> once<00:06:32.669> we've<00:06:32.880> opened<00:06:33.240> up<00:06:33.300> the

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
keyboard so once we've opened up the

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.089 
keyboard so once we've opened up the
beta<00:06:33.960> section<00:06:34.320> you'll<00:06:34.560> notice<00:06:34.830> that<00:06:34.860> it's

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:35.099
