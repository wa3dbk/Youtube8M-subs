mix<00:00:25.410> yeah<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.830> mean<00:00:26.010> there's<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.250> couple<00:00:26.519> of

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
mix yeah I mean there's a couple of

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.820 
mix yeah I mean there's a couple of
different<00:00:26.880> things<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.330> if<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.500> know<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
different things so if the you know the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.279 
different things so if the you know the
very<00:00:29.010> high<00:00:29.189> level<00:00:29.609> with<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.269> base<00:00:30.510> core<00:00:30.990> game

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
very high level with the base core game

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.200 
very high level with the base core game
modes<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.769> people<00:00:32.160> are<00:00:32.250> familiar<00:00:32.430> with<00:00:32.730> like

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
modes that people are familiar with like

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.229 
modes that people are familiar with like
domination<00:00:33.930> we've<00:00:34.649> added<00:00:34.890> what<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:35.940> call<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
domination we've added what we call the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.180 
domination we've added what we call the
bare-bones<00:00:36.649> variation<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.070> is

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
bare-bones variation so this is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.000 
bare-bones variation so this is
something<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.550> fans<00:00:38.820> had<00:00:39.059> asked<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
something that fans had asked for and

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.160 
something that fans had asked for and
that<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.160> did<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.210> know<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.540> may<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.050> know

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
that we did so you know you may you know

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.930 
that we did so you know you may you know
the<00:00:43.320> groom<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.680> probably<00:00:44.160> core<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.789> then<00:00:44.910> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
the groom is probably core and then a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.369 
the groom is probably core and then a
lot<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.149> people<00:00:45.360> also<00:00:45.539> know<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.899> hardcore

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
lot of people also know the hardcore

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.869 
lot of people also know the hardcore
version<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> game<00:00:47.070> which<00:00:47.309> removes<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
version of the game which removes the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.060 
version of the game which removes the
HUD<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.090> makes<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> game<00:00:48.719> deadlier<00:00:49.260> but

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
HUD and makes the game deadlier but

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.040 
HUD and makes the game deadlier but
there's<00:00:50.309> also<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.640> bare-bones<00:00:51.180> variation<00:00:51.930> of

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
there's also a bare-bones variation of

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.290 
there's also a bare-bones variation of
every<00:00:52.289> game<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.500> ordered<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.949> could<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
every game you ordered it could be and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.110 
every game you ordered it could be and
what<00:00:54.570> bare-bones<00:00:55.020> allows<00:00:55.440> us<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.800> do<00:00:55.949> is

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
what bare-bones allows us to do is

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.240 
what bare-bones allows us to do is
selectively<00:00:57.120> figure<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.140> which<00:00:58.590> killstreaks

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
selectively figure out which killstreaks

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.340 
selectively figure out which killstreaks
to<00:00:59.430> either<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> goon<00:01:00.300> or<00:01:00.629> take<00:01:01.140> all

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
to either have in the goon or take all

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.319 
to either have in the goon or take all
the<00:01:01.500> killstreaks<00:01:01.980> out<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:02.879> top<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.149> that

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the killstreaks out but on top of that

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.240 
the killstreaks out but on top of that
we<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.780> also<00:01:03.930> force<00:01:04.470> people<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.769> use<00:01:04.949> default

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
we can also force people to use default

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.149 
we can also force people to use default
classes<00:01:05.970> or<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.780> say<00:01:06.990> hey<00:01:07.530> there's<00:01:07.979> only

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
classes or we can say hey there's only

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.070 
classes or we can say hey there's only
going<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.909> level<00:01:09.390> three<00:01:09.600> kill<00:01:09.780> streak

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
going to be a level three kill streak

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.630 
going to be a level three kill streak
and<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.470> where<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.710> going<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.010> it

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and this is where it's going to do it

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.700 
and this is where it's going to do it
lets<00:01:11.820> us<00:01:11.970> modify<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.689> change<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.229> from<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
lets us modify and change that from the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.219 
lets us modify and change that from the
games<00:01:13.890> actually<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> retail<00:01:15.000> world<00:01:15.229> as

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
the fans change and they do change

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:22.999 
the fans change and they do change
absolutely<00:01:22.259> now<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.500> should<00:01:22.650> probably

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
absolutely now we should probably

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.109 
absolutely now we should probably
mention<00:01:23.100> off<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> bat<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.000> we're

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
mention off the bat here that we're

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.289 
mention off the bat here that we're
starting<00:01:25.110> off<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.799> fairly<00:01:26.700> low<00:01:26.880> level<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
starting off on a fairly low level I

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.270 
starting off on a fairly low level I
think<00:01:27.330> we're<00:01:27.630> at<00:01:27.689> level<00:01:27.990> 3<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:28.829> should<00:01:29.189> get

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
think we're at level 3 so we should get

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.039 
think we're at level 3 so we should get
a<00:01:29.340> good<00:01:29.520> essential<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.329> what<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
a good essential for you what the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.899 
a good essential for you what the
initial<00:01:31.409> progression<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.070> unlockables<00:01:32.759> that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
initial progression and unlockables that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.370 
initial progression and unlockables that
you<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.240> when<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.600> when<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:33.990> start<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> game

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
you get when you when you start the game

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.039 
you get when you when you start the game

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.810 
only got a couple of base classes and
weapons<00:01:43.110> available<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.770> him<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.159> then<00:01:44.790> like

weapons available to him and then like
in<00:01:45.270> previous<00:01:45.479> games<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:46.049> course<00:01:46.200> as<00:01:46.439> he<00:01:46.560> ranks

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
in previous games of course as he ranks

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.620 
in previous games of course as he ranks
up<00:01:47.100> he'll<00:01:47.280> start<00:01:47.520> unlocking<00:01:47.790> more<00:01:48.210> features

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
up he'll start unlocking more features

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.240 
up he'll start unlocking more features
and<00:01:48.899> will<00:01:49.470> start<00:01:49.649> unlocking<00:01:49.740> more<00:01:50.250> weapons

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
and will start unlocking more weapons

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.819 
and will start unlocking more weapons
well<00:01:53.250> now<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:54.479> know<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> designer<00:01:55.710> of

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
well now as you know as a designer of

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.120 
well now as you know as a designer of
multiplayer<00:01:56.759> games<00:01:57.060> there's<00:01:57.740> I'd<00:01:58.740> imagine

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
multiplayer games there's I'd imagine

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.219 
multiplayer games there's I'd imagine
one<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> biggest<00:01:59.670> challenges<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.630> making

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
one of the biggest challenges is making

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.410 
one of the biggest challenges is making
sure<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:02.579> know<00:02:02.670> there's<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.000> sense<00:02:03.240> of

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
sure that you know there's that sense of

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.179 
sure that you know there's that sense of
reward<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.590> really<00:02:04.829> high<00:02:05.009> level

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
reward for the really really high level

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.740 
reward for the really really high level
players<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.820> also<00:02:05.909> making<00:02:06.240> sure<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
players but also making sure that the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.210 
players but also making sure that the
low-level<00:02:07.110> guys<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.680> what<00:02:07.860> we're<00:02:08.009> seeing

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
low-level guys like what we're seeing

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.620 
low-level guys like what we're seeing
here<00:02:08.340> are<00:02:09.090> still<00:02:09.330> able<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.750> be<00:02:09.840> competitive<00:02:10.140> in

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
here are still able to be competitive in

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.060 
here are still able to be competitive in
right<00:02:11.080> yeah<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:11.740> know<00:02:11.830> it's<00:02:11.950> really

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
right yeah you know it's really

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.140 
right yeah you know it's really
important<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.640> no<00:02:13.170> absolutely<00:02:14.170> new<00:02:14.440> player

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
important that no absolutely new player

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.180 
important that no absolutely new player
you<00:02:16.150> know<00:02:16.240> can't<00:02:16.870> have<00:02:17.050> fun<00:02:17.380> playing<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.010> game

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
you know can't have fun playing the game

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.520 
you know can't have fun playing the game
so<00:02:18.610> there's<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.330> lot<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.690> stuff<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.200> happens

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
so there's a lot of stuff that happens

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.040 
so there's a lot of stuff that happens
at<00:02:20.680> very<00:02:20.860> early<00:02:20.980> lovers<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:22.600> know<00:02:22.630> in<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.900> way

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
at very early lovers you know in a way

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.350 
at very early lovers you know in a way
it's<00:02:23.410> it's<00:02:23.920> not<00:02:24.190> necessarily<00:02:24.820> intrinsically

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
it's it's not necessarily intrinsically

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.000 
it's it's not necessarily intrinsically
part<00:02:25.660> of<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.840> design<00:02:26.350> but<00:02:26.740> it's<00:02:26.860> certainly

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
part of the design but it's certainly

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.430 
part of the design but it's certainly
discussed<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.700> lot<00:02:27.880> which<00:02:28.210> is<00:02:28.240> in<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:29.080> very<00:02:29.110> low

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
discussed a lot which is in a very low

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.600 
discussed a lot which is in a very low
level<00:02:29.470> what<00:02:29.950> are<00:02:30.040> going<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.220> be<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.430> default

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
level what are going to be the default

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.280 
level what are going to be the default
weapons<00:02:31.270> because<00:02:31.630> if<00:02:31.900> you<00:02:31.990> don't<00:02:32.080> have<00:02:32.230> a

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
weapons because if you don't have a

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.740 
weapons because if you don't have a
positive<00:02:32.560> experience<00:02:33.190> using<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.850> weapon<00:02:34.030> very

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
positive experience using a weapon very

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.210 
positive experience using a weapon very
early<00:02:34.930> on<00:02:35.080> you<00:02:35.350> can<00:02:35.470> get<00:02:35.560> turned<00:02:35.770> off<00:02:35.920> right

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
early on you can get turned off right

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.270 
early on you can get turned off right
away<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.330> mp5k<00:02:37.840> for<00:02:38.230> example<00:02:38.710> it's<00:02:39.160> a

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
away so this mp5k for example it's a

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.100 
away so this mp5k for example it's a
pretty<00:02:39.550> easy<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:40.030> use<00:02:40.180> gone<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.750> it's<00:02:40.870> fairly

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
pretty easy to use gone and it's fairly

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.200 
pretty easy to use gone and it's fairly
representative<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:42.010> all<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.460> SMGs<00:02:42.940> in<00:02:43.120> the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
representative of all the SMGs in the

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.060 
representative of all the SMGs in the
game<00:02:43.390> like<00:02:43.630> it's<00:02:43.660> what<00:02:44.200> we<00:02:44.290> call<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.470> baseline

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
game like it's what we call a baseline

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.170 
game like it's what we call a baseline
gun<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.900> SMGs<00:02:46.900> are<00:02:47.260> either<00:02:47.500> sort<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:48.180> more

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
gun so SMGs are either sort of more

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.090 
gun so SMGs are either sort of more
deadly<00:02:49.540> but<00:02:49.720> less<00:02:49.900> accurate<00:02:50.500> or<00:02:50.680> less

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
deadly but less accurate or less

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.970 
deadly but less accurate or less
accurate<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:52.750> know<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:53.320> more<00:02:53.530> deadly

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
accurate you know it but more deadly

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.580 
accurate you know it but more deadly
from<00:02:54.430> this<00:02:54.610> point<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.300> that's<00:02:55.750> pretty<00:02:55.990> common

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
from this point so that's pretty common

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.010 
from this point so that's pretty common
thing<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.340> do<00:02:57.580> in<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.850> early<00:02:58.090> levels<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.660> guy

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
thing to do in the early levels so a guy

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.200 
thing to do in the early levels so a guy
like<00:02:59.050> John<00:02:59.500> who<00:02:59.680> are<00:02:59.740> literally<00:03:00.160> gone<00:03:00.400> can<00:03:01.120> you

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
like John who are literally gone can you

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.550 
like John who are literally gone can you
know<00:03:01.300> still<00:03:01.540> have<00:03:01.660> his<00:03:01.810> fair<00:03:02.020> share<00:03:02.050> of<00:03:02.320> fun

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
know still have his fair share of fun

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.630 
know still have his fair share of fun
all<00:03:03.490> right<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:05.740> other<00:03:06.010> players<00:03:06.370> in<00:03:06.550> the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
all right and the other players in the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.100 
all right and the other players in the
match<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:06.940> looks<00:03:07.120> like<00:03:07.240> they're<00:03:07.390> roughly<00:03:07.840> the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
match it looks like they're roughly the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.660 
match it looks like they're roughly the
same<00:03:08.560> level<00:03:08.800> it<00:03:09.010> doesn't<00:03:09.250> look<00:03:09.340> like<00:03:09.400> we're

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
same level it doesn't look like we're

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.210 
same level it doesn't look like we're
seeing<00:03:09.940> anything<00:03:10.150> too<00:03:10.630> outlandish<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:12.010> a

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
seeing anything too outlandish and a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.710 
seeing anything too outlandish and a
high<00:03:12.580> level<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.030> terms<00:03:13.180> of<00:03:13.390> what<00:03:13.600> they're

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
high level in terms of what they're

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.310 
high level in terms of what they're
carrying<00:03:13.930> around<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:15.370> case<00:03:15.550> yeah<00:03:16.320> John

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
carrying around that the case yeah John
