digital era and Playstations evolution
is<00:00:38.110> tracked<00:00:38.410> precisely<00:00:38.800> with<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.430> obviously

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
is tracked precisely with and obviously

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.570 
is tracked precisely with and obviously
in<00:00:40.239> many<00:00:40.420> cases<00:00:40.900> helped<00:00:41.350> lead<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:42.010> increase

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
in many cases helped lead the increase

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.970 
in many cases helped lead the increase
in<00:00:42.730> comfort<00:00:43.150> consumers<00:00:43.720> have<00:00:43.989> with<00:00:44.589> digital

in comfort consumers have with digital

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.090 
in comfort consumers have with digital
technology<00:00:45.100> and<00:00:45.900> two<00:00:46.900> years<00:00:47.140> ago<00:00:47.379> we<00:00:47.860> sought

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
technology and two years ago we sought

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.979 
technology and two years ago we sought
to<00:00:48.280> understand<00:00:48.699> more<00:00:48.940> about<00:00:49.000> how<00:00:49.420> consumers

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
to understand more about how consumers

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.710 
to understand more about how consumers
were<00:00:50.140> using<00:00:50.559> that<00:00:50.949> digital<00:00:51.430> technology<00:00:52.000> so

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
were using that digital technology so

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.930 
were using that digital technology so
naturally<00:00:52.960> we<00:00:53.559> went<00:00:53.769> on<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:53.949> road<00:00:54.100> visiting

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
naturally we went on the road visiting

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.780 
naturally we went on the road visiting
with<00:00:55.059> publishers<00:00:55.680> developers<00:00:56.680> and<00:00:56.920> gamers<00:00:57.309> to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
with publishers developers and gamers to

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.630 
with publishers developers and gamers to
ask<00:00:57.909> how<00:00:58.269> we<00:00:58.300> could<00:00:58.750> make<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.350> PSP<00:00:59.860> better<00:01:00.309> and
