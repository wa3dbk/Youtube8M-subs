00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.710 

and<00:01:54.280> then<00:01:54.490> just<00:01:54.670> flip<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:55.030> skirt<00:01:55.330> underneath

and then just flip the skirt underneath
the<00:01:55.960> throat<00:01:56.170> kicks<00:01:57.100> it<00:01:57.250> in<00:01:57.370> places<00:01:57.870> when<00:01:58.870> that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
the throat kicks it in places when that

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.650 
the throat kicks it in places when that
provides<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.400> a<00:02:00.430> really<00:02:00.790> good<00:02:01.000> seal<00:02:01.300> around

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
provides you a really good seal around

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.340 
provides you a really good seal around
like<00:02:01.840> your<00:02:01.990> key<00:02:02.640> stops<00:02:03.640> any<00:02:03.880> wind<00:02:04.350> assisted

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
like your key stops any wind assisted

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.570 
like your key stops any wind assisted
rain<00:02:05.560> getting<00:02:05.830> in<00:02:06.040> etc<00:02:06.610> so<00:02:07.420> that<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:09.009> possible

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
rain getting in etc so that is possible

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.160 
rain getting in etc so that is possible
to<00:02:09.729> put<00:02:09.910> on<00:02:10.060> when<00:02:10.270> you're<00:02:10.420> inside<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.020> cocoon

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
to put on when you're inside the cocoon

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.980 
to put on when you're inside the cocoon
but<00:02:11.950> it's<00:02:12.130> quite<00:02:12.400> tricky<00:02:12.730> reaching<00:02:13.360> out<00:02:13.540> and

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
but it's quite tricky reaching out and

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.920 
but it's quite tricky reaching out and
doing<00:02:14.260> these<00:02:14.470> totals<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:16.240> that<00:02:16.420> one's<00:02:16.630> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
doing these totals so that one's the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:25.190 
doing these totals so that one's the
door<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:21.520> same<00:02:21.790> process<00:02:22.420> for<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:23.170> fucknut

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
door the same process for the fucknut

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.690 
door the same process for the fucknut
