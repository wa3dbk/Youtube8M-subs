00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:08.900
 yes, how is it going on that was now 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:13.650
 the mesh arrangement for the body part 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:18.870
 and now she is going to size 34 or 5 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.630
 cm or even easy for xxl 9 cm long 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.619
 knit smooth right always in the round 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.820
 the sleeves are shut down and 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:32.909
 then after this with me now 4 cm 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.149
 be incorporated laterally increase 

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:42.179
 as always under the sleeves we do 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:46.139
 again in the 1 and in the single name 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:51.120
 which we already know from that of the 

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:53.819
 Cyclists on their sleeves and see that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.909
 completely from which form you want for 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:59.879
 a tunic if you arguably the team her 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.739
 Body is then rather not so 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.430
 to take a lot or maybe to 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.369
 promote weight loss and depending on how long 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.770
 and you want the tunic too 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:18.020
 you have to keep remembering in the long run 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.020
 eventually comes this sheet 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.109
 there is this leaf shirt that 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.799
 needs another 12 centimeters so that 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:33.750
 to include in the length 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.859
 but the dear thread of the spot has on 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.049
 her side 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:43.530
 a really great lavender rosina and the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.249
 he looks slim fit and I have to 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.659
 always ask what he name for it 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:50.969
 has done or maybe even 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.390
 lose weight because that really looks too 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:58.469
 really great so these are different 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.890
 possibilities long and rather far or 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.030
 distinctive also shorter and divide 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.340
 emphasize 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.649
 this remains your personal taste 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.390
 let's leave so hardest we have 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.790
 actually already behind us 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.970
 here it goes on smooth right on 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.950
 and below again the sheet 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.440
 which is almost again as well as on 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.600
 at the beginning and it does me too 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.600
 together with then
