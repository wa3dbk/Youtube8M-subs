00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
and I work in the greenhouses here we

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.010 
and I work in the greenhouses here we
have<00:00:05.220> three<00:00:05.490> greenhouses<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.330> provide<00:00:06.690> enough

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
have three greenhouses to provide enough

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.589 
have three greenhouses to provide enough
food<00:00:07.049> for<00:00:07.470> our<00:00:07.710> community<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.510> our

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
food for our community and this is our

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.950 
food for our community and this is our
aquaponic<00:00:10.320> solar<00:00:10.559> greenhouse

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.679 

so<00:00:17.500> this<00:00:17.679> is<00:00:17.830> where<00:00:18.009> it<00:00:18.099> all<00:00:18.160> begins<00:00:18.519> at<00:00:19.329> seven

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
so this is where it all begins at seven

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.749 
so this is where it all begins at seven
hundred<00:00:19.900> gallon<00:00:20.199> fish<00:00:20.349> tank<00:00:20.410> with<00:00:20.919> 90<00:00:21.519> fish

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
hundred gallon fish tank with 90 fish

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.630 
hundred gallon fish tank with 90 fish
and<00:00:22.179> there<00:00:23.169> are<00:00:23.259> ecosystem<00:00:23.980> provides<00:00:24.099> enough

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
and there are ecosystem provides enough

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.490 
and there are ecosystem provides enough
nutrients<00:00:25.180> for<00:00:25.359> all<00:00:25.509> of<00:00:25.689> these<00:00:28.230> water<00:00:29.230> from

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
nutrients for all of these water from

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.159 
nutrients for all of these water from
the<00:00:29.590> tank<00:00:29.859> flows<00:00:30.429> through<00:00:30.820> these<00:00:31.000> pipes<00:00:31.300> into

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
the tank flows through these pipes into

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.280 
the tank flows through these pipes into
the<00:00:32.410> grow<00:00:32.590> beds<00:00:32.860> that<00:00:33.159> are<00:00:33.220> full<00:00:33.579> of<00:00:33.730> hydrogen

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
the grow beds that are full of hydrogen

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.770 
the grow beds that are full of hydrogen
this<00:00:35.290> hydrogen<00:00:35.350> provides<00:00:36.250> enough<00:00:36.699> space<00:00:37.030> for

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
this hydrogen provides enough space for

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.290 
this hydrogen provides enough space for
the<00:00:37.930> roots<00:00:38.110> to<00:00:38.260> grow<00:00:38.350> through<00:00:38.970> these<00:00:39.970> beds

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
the roots to grow through these beds

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.180 
the roots to grow through these beds
gradually<00:00:41.019> fill<00:00:41.229> with<00:00:41.379> water<00:00:41.530> from<00:00:41.769> the<00:00:41.949> tank

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
gradually fill with water from the tank

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.790 
gradually fill with water from the tank
the<00:00:43.030> roots<00:00:43.300> soak<00:00:43.629> up<00:00:43.809> all<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.140> nutrients<00:00:44.649> from

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
the roots soak up all the nutrients from

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.369 
the roots soak up all the nutrients from
the<00:00:44.890> water<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:45.390> filter<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.629> water<00:00:46.659> so

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
the water and filter the water so

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.490 
the water and filter the water so
whenever<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.370> bed<00:00:48.519> rains<00:00:48.909> it<00:00:49.480> sends<00:00:49.870> only

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
whenever the bed rains it sends only

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.439 
whenever the bed rains it sends only
clean<00:00:50.800> water<00:00:51.070> back<00:00:51.399> to<00:00:51.609> the<00:00:51.699> fish<00:00:51.879> tank<00:00:52.179> and

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
clean water back to the fish tank and

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.720 
clean water back to the fish tank and
then<00:00:52.780> we<00:00:52.929> start<00:00:53.199> all<00:00:53.320> over<00:00:53.350> again<00:00:56.070> hi<00:00:57.070> my<00:00:57.550> name
