over<00:02:18.870> without<00:02:19.080> starting<00:02:19.650> until<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.280> get<00:02:20.520> oil

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
over without starting until I get oil

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.110 
over without starting until I get oil
pressure<00:02:21.890> gauges<00:02:22.890> are<00:02:23.070> cheap<00:02:23.340> enough<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.910> buy

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120

before you try and start the engine okay

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.660 
before you try and start the engine okay
we're<00:02:50.519> going<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.760> set<00:02:50.970> up<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.330> end<00:02:51.480> play<00:02:52.670> these

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
we're going to set up the end play these

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.780 
we're going to set up the end play these
are<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.060> shims<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.690> use<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:56.280> always<00:02:56.400> use

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
are the shims you use you always use

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.040 
are the shims you use you always use
three<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.330> them<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:58.910> Mike<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.180> shims<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.959> you

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
three of them and Mike the shims so you

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.910 
three of them and Mike the shims so you
know<00:03:01.320> where<00:03:02.190> you're<00:03:02.370> starting<00:03:02.970> at<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:04.620> case

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
know where you're starting at in case

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.580 
know where you're starting at in case
you<00:03:05.100> have<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:06.680> add<00:03:07.680> or<00:03:08.100> subtract<00:03:09.350> you<00:03:10.350> want

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
you have to add or subtract you want

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.460 
you have to add or subtract you want
four<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.010> six<00:03:11.280> thousandths<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.300> play<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:15.440> put<00:03:16.440> a

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
four to six thousandths and play I put a

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.810 
four to six thousandths and play I put a
magnetic<00:03:17.570> dial<00:03:18.570> indicator<00:03:19.230> on<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.070> flywheel

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
magnetic dial indicator on the flywheel

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.900 
magnetic dial indicator on the flywheel
and<00:03:21.230> have<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.410> touching<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.160> back<00:03:23.610> of<00:03:23.820> the

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
and have it touching the back of the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.570 
and have it touching the back of the
case<00:03:24.769> and<00:03:25.769> we<00:03:26.130> set<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.790> zero<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:29.160> now<00:03:29.340> I'll

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
case and we set it to zero so now I'll

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.410 
case and we set it to zero so now I'll
pull<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.970> crank<00:03:30.269> forward<00:03:31.970> using<00:03:32.970> two

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
pull the crank forward using two

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.080 
pull the crank forward using two
screwdrivers<00:03:34.350> on

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
screwdrivers on

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.229 
screwdrivers on
back<00:03:37.090> pulley<00:03:37.950> then<00:03:38.950> I'll<00:03:39.129> come<00:03:39.370> back<00:03:39.400> here<00:03:40.030> and

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
back pulley then I'll come back here and

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.869 
back pulley then I'll come back here and
pull<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:43.469> flywheel<00:03:44.469> the<00:03:44.500> opposite<00:03:45.250> way<00:03:45.459> and

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
pull the flywheel the opposite way and

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:57.930 
pull the flywheel the opposite way and
see<00:03:46.299> what<00:03:46.510> our<00:03:46.540> employers

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.880 

okay<00:03:58.940> I'm<00:03:59.060> going<00:03:59.270> to<00:03:59.360> take<00:03:59.540> my<00:03:59.720> two

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
okay I'm going to take my two

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:07.290 
okay I'm going to take my two
screwdrivers<00:04:03.040> put<00:04:04.040> them<00:04:04.160> behind<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.670> poi<00:04:04.880> and

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
screwdrivers put them behind the poi and

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:22.660 
screwdrivers put them behind the poi and
pull<00:04:08.300> the<00:04:08.450> crank<00:04:09.940> towards<00:04:10.940> me<00:04:21.220> now<00:04:22.220> we'll<00:04:22.460> take

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
pull the crank towards me now we'll take

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.830 
pull the crank towards me now we'll take
a<00:04:22.730> reading<00:04:23.120> let's<00:04:23.870> say<00:04:24.140> I<00:04:24.170> have<00:04:25.960> one<00:04:28.419> two<00:04:29.419> three

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
a reading let's say I have one two three

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.050 
a reading let's say I have one two three
four<00:04:30.169> five<00:04:31.010> thousands<00:04:33.160> so<00:04:34.160> now<00:04:34.370> check<00:04:34.400> the

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
four five thousands so now check the

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.650 
four five thousands so now check the
back<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:40.400> I'll<00:04:40.610> pull<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.090> crank<00:04:41.390> the

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
back and I'll pull the crank the

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:52.629 
back and I'll pull the crank the
opposite<00:04:42.320> way<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:45.370> see<00:04:46.370> what<00:04:46.580> we<00:04:46.790> end<00:04:47.120> up<00:04:47.600> with

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.279 

back<00:04:53.639> to<00:04:53.909> zero<00:04:54.889> so<00:04:55.889> we<00:04:56.069> end<00:04:56.250> up<00:04:56.460> with<00:04:56.729> a<00:04:57.289> five

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
back to zero so we end up with a five

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:10.399 
back to zero so we end up with a five
thousand<00:04:58.949> son<00:04:59.220> play<00:05:01.789> which<00:05:02.789> is<00:05:02.819> good<00:05:09.199> if<00:05:10.199> you

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
thousand son play which is good if you

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.170 
thousand son play which is good if you
don't<00:05:10.530> have<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:10.979> four<00:05:11.220> to<00:05:11.340> five<00:05:11.370> thousands

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
don't have the four to five thousands

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.800 
don't have the four to five thousands
you<00:05:12.330> have<00:05:12.509> to<00:05:13.940> make<00:05:14.940> your<00:05:15.150> shins<00:05:15.419> again<00:05:15.690> and

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
you have to make your shins again and

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.850 
you have to make your shins again and
replace<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:19.050> shims<00:05:19.319> until<00:05:19.889> you<00:05:21.680> get<00:05:22.680> the

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
replace the shims until you get the

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.600 
replace the shims until you get the
correct<00:05:23.250> amount<00:05:23.639> of<00:05:23.819> em<00:05:24.000> play<00:05:25.370> that's<00:05:26.370> all

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610
