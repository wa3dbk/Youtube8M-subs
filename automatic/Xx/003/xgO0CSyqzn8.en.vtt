00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
read it the first time at all because

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.439 
read it the first time at all because
it's<00:00:53.190> completely<00:00:53.460> different<00:00:53.820> than<00:00:54.270> how<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
it's completely different than how I

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.450 
it's completely different than how I
remembered<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.910> lot<00:00:57.629> more

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
remembered it and it's a lot more

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.189 
remembered it and it's a lot more
there's<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> lot<00:00:59.579> more<00:00:59.910> symbolism<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.050> it's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
there's a lot more symbolism in it it's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.770 
there's a lot more symbolism in it it's
a<00:01:01.260> lot<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.399> lot<00:01:02.550> more<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.120> deep<00:01:03.390> book

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
a lot it's a lot more of a deep book

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.350 
a lot it's a lot more of a deep book
than<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.049> realized<00:01:04.379> at<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> time<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.460> guess

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
than I realized at the time but I guess

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.460 
than I realized at the time but I guess
that's<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> whole<00:01:07.380> thing<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.950> being

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
that's the whole thing of being

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.690 
that's the whole thing of being
seventeen<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.680> reading<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> book<00:01:11.189> versus

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
seventeen and reading a book versus

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.289 
seventeen and reading a book versus
being<00:01:11.939> 35<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.320> 34<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> time<00:01:14.700> reading<00:01:15.150> a
