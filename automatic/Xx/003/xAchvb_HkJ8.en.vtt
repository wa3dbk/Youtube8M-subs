 hello everyone I hope you go 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.770
 well I find you today for 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.509
 a new manga discovery and you 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.970
 welcome to the nikki club 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.980
 assad published at akata sachets of a 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.210
 shojo from his comedy romance that counts 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.840
 for now eight men still in 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.759
 course in japan 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.279
 Volume 3 is planned in France for the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.900
 August 21, volume 4 for October 9 and 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.970
 the top 5 for December 4 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.410
 this title was published in France at the same time 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.350
 time that a woman's diary that at 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.460
 akata and as much as I had cracked 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.859
 to recover from a feint dude 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.510
 but absolutely not for this title 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.309
 is only very recently that I have 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.110
 bent over the title for the simple and 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.480
 good reason extremely reason 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.800
 superficial besides that I cracked 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.800
 for the cover of volume 3 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.149
 opening that do not arrive 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.710
 extraordinary it just represents 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.910
 one of the characters in the series where I 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.070
 found that he was emerging from this 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.420
 blanket something tender and 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.940
 melancholy what I would not know 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.500
 explain but that convinced me to me 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.760
 to get the first two volumes of the 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.159
 series thing that I do not regret 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.280
 absolutely not for recall this volume 1 is 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.659
 released last April 24 and the volume 2 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.920
 June 26 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.330
 I'm talking to you now very quickly 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.159
 history so we follow the jeanne images 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.299
 to the words sato who is a high school student 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.399
 more banal that has nothing 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.080
 extraordinary in itself but who has the 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.420
 annoying mania to fall quite often 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.280
 in love and she seems struck by a 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.020
 strange curse that makes that 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.060
 when she says she chooses to 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.950
 boy he also fell in love but 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.050
 of a completely different girl she takes herself 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.179
 so rake on rake and one day she 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.950
 will get the attention of yole echoes that 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.960
 leads the psychology study club 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.970
 young people and who will propose to him 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.340
 join this club of the most atypical 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.530
 will upset the life of satory meaux 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.509
 like that it saves the banal by 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.330
 excellence that is not extraordinary 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.679
 that seems to be even warmed up and 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
 alright I can assure you gentlemen 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.640
 ladies that this is absolutely not the case 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.350
 the strength of this manga is to treat 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.789
 the relationships between the characters with 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.630
 a lot of accuracy and a lot 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.820
 authenticity 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.560
 the characters are absolutely not 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.210
 to caricature even if we could 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.399
 believe when one lille synopsis this is 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.590
 really not the case and it's really 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.329
 something very human and we 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.130
 attaches to these characters they have 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.509
 something touching and that's 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.829
 really something that marked me 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.109
 so not a little bit the characters of 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.000
 this club the club at the base does not involve 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:12.650
 that three members whose co pioli 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.390
 spoke to you who runs the club 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.480
 kate a binoclarde extremely 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.160
 studious who is content to take 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.049
 notes observing relationships 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.400
 loving each other at a distance and who 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.959
 the she says herself not really history 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.400
 of love 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.380
 then we have to rio which I spoke to you 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.470
 question the cover of volume 3 but 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.390
 who is the service otaku extremely 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.739
 animated fans who just happy 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.390
 virtual love story with 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.880
 animal characters that does not have 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.450
 really big worries lovers like 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.519
 that in life 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.519
 and then we have to pineau shima it's 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.270
 he who is the beautiful kid transvestite and 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.980
 that they saw 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.870
 awesome it's really my character 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.460
 favorite so far it is extremely 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.750
 touching then we could believe that 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.970
 it's the fun of service to 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.980
 to disguise as a girl but not because 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.870
 his intentions are noble it's not 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.640
 to amuse the gallery must 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.990
 to force between ten meters goes through kir 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.120
 at the base and it's really a 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.710
 character that I like a lot and we 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.870
 sees a moment his turn is added to everything 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.790
 that with the lot of gags that it's going 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.100
 train and it's a stuffed shojo 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.020
 of love humor too because william 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.730
 a little bit of love but a lot of 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.320
 disastrous love relationships must 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.240
 well to say it but the subject is treated 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.770
 with so much accuracy that it makes 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.570
 the most enjoyable reading to follow 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.860
 I show you very quickly the drawings 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.150
 personally I totally flashed 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.300
 about the author's trait 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.960
 even if it's very subjective 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.930
 personally I find it brings 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.850
 a lot to emotion so that's small 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.620
 additional things that I noticed 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.270
 edition side which frankly friendly 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.070
 it's the subtitles on each of 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.220
 tomes your places you have loosers 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.350
 here you have freaks and if you 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.450
 put side by side we can see the strange 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.220
 and I find this edition side frankly 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.020
 friendly on the part of acs attack but 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.550
 so far all types dakota 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.110
 which is presented side editing it was 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.430
 impeccable so here's a penny that I 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.360
 highly recommend for this summer 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.320
 even if I take it a little bit 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.150
 course of travel as you can 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.740
