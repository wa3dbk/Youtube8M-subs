I<00:01:03.510> use<00:01:03.720> a<00:01:03.930> warlock<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.770> it's<00:01:04.890> but

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
I use a warlock is here and it's but

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.140 
I use a warlock is here and it's but
typically<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.460> stick<00:01:05.729> with<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
typically a stick with one of the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.340 
typically a stick with one of the
tyranid<00:01:06.509> heroes<00:01:06.780> because<00:01:06.930> there's<00:01:07.140> better

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
tyranid heroes because there's better

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.280 
tyranid heroes because there's better
synergy<00:01:07.649> and<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.100> important<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.790> them

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
synergy and it's important to have them

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.240 
synergy and it's important to have them
synapse<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.410> stuff<00:01:10.680> because<00:01:10.800> if<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.070> get<00:01:11.190> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
synapse and stuff because if you get the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.670 
synapse and stuff because if you get the
Warlock<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.850> he's<00:01:12.119> all<00:01:12.240> right<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.660> if<00:01:13.530> you're

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
Warlock and he's all right but if you're

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.440 
Warlock and he's all right but if you're
going<00:01:13.800> for<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.100> male<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.759> sort<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.060> caster

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450

about something I'm going for you I'm a

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.810 
about something I'm going for you I'm a
little<00:05:15.860> scared<00:05:16.010> but<00:05:16.130> oh<00:05:16.280> yeah<00:05:16.460> keep<00:05:16.639> flesh

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820

little scared but oh yeah keep flesh
shoving<00:05:17.090> lichter<00:05:17.750> alpha<00:05:18.229> really<00:05:18.500> should<00:05:18.620> have

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
shoving lichter alpha really should have

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.870 
shoving lichter alpha really should have
flesh<00:05:18.919> hooked<00:05:19.130> one<00:05:19.340> of<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:19.490> people<00:05:19.729> off<00:05:19.850> the

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
flesh hooked one of the people off the

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.460 
flesh hooked one of the people off the
platform<00:05:20.210> because<00:05:20.600> then<00:05:20.870> they'd<00:05:21.020> be<00:05:21.200> down<00:05:21.320> to

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
platform because then they'd be down to

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.690 
platform because then they'd be down to
two<00:05:21.620> squad<00:05:21.890> members<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:22.370> it's<00:05:22.460> just<00:05:22.580> that

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
two squad members and it's just that

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.010 
two squad members and it's just that
much<00:05:22.820> easier<00:05:22.880> to<00:05:23.210> push<00:05:23.360> it<00:05:23.510> off<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:23.900> they

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
much easier to push it off and they

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.510 
much easier to push it off and they
they'd<00:05:24.320> have<00:05:24.500> to<00:05:24.620> retreat<00:05:24.919> sooner<00:05:25.190> and<00:05:25.310> stuff

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
they'd have to retreat sooner and stuff

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.090 
they'd have to retreat sooner and stuff
like<00:05:25.610> that<00:05:25.669> but<00:05:25.910> um<00:05:26.500> see<00:05:27.500> like<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.770> flat<00:05:27.919> ones

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
like that but um see like the flat ones

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.890 
like that but um see like the flat ones
in<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.340> building<00:05:28.610> but<00:05:29.030> in<00:05:29.240> any<00:05:29.419> case<00:05:29.510> it's

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
in the building but in any case it's

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.270 
in the building but in any case it's
usually<00:05:30.080> a<00:05:30.320> good<00:05:30.440> idea<00:05:30.560> to<00:05:30.830> use<00:05:30.919> your<00:05:31.100> flesh

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
usually a good idea to use your flesh

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.440 
usually a good idea to use your flesh
what<00:05:31.430> gives<00:05:31.580> off<00:05:31.729> as<00:05:31.910> possible<00:05:32.330> with<00:05:32.419> the

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
what gives off as possible with the

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.500 
what gives off as possible with the
lictor<00:05:32.810> because<00:05:33.080> if<00:05:33.380> you<00:05:33.740> save<00:05:34.070> it<00:05:34.220> up<00:05:34.340> for

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
lictor because if you save it up for

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.450 
lictor because if you save it up for
opportune<00:05:35.510> times<00:05:35.780> you<00:05:36.140> know<00:05:36.289> you're<00:05:37.010> probably

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
opportune times you know you're probably

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.450 
opportune times you know you're probably
not<00:05:37.789> gonna<00:05:38.350> end<00:05:39.350> up<00:05:39.500> using<00:05:39.650> it<00:05:39.860> as<00:05:39.950> much<00:05:40.100> as<00:05:40.130> you

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
not gonna end up using it as much as you

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.219 
not gonna end up using it as much as you
possibly<00:05:40.669> could<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:41.210> the<00:05:41.720> other<00:05:41.840> important

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
possibly could and the other important

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:43.870 
possibly could and the other important
thing<00:05:42.260> is<00:05:42.500> that<00:05:42.530> it<00:05:42.890> recharges<00:05:43.250> a<00:05:43.460> recharge<00:05:43.789> is

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
thing is that it recharges a recharge is

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.940 
thing is that it recharges a recharge is
slowly<00:05:44.090> but<00:05:44.360> I'm<00:05:44.570> your<00:05:44.840> energy<00:05:45.470> recharge<00:05:45.830> is

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
slowly but I'm your energy recharge is

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.020 
slowly but I'm your energy recharge is
pretty<00:05:46.130> passing<00:05:46.520> it's<00:05:46.639> not<00:05:46.820> like<00:05:46.940> you're

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
pretty passing it's not like you're

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.340 
pretty passing it's not like you're
going<00:05:47.150> to<00:05:47.210> use<00:05:47.330> it<00:05:47.450> for<00:05:47.600> a<00:05:47.630> little<00:05:47.780> much<00:05:48.139> else

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
going to use it for a little much else

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.779 
going to use it for a little much else
and<00:05:48.590> cloaking<00:05:48.770> different<00:05:49.160> pictage<00:05:49.430> energy

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
and cloaking different pictage energy

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.420 
and cloaking different pictage energy
show<00:05:49.970> so<00:05:50.650> it's<00:05:51.650> pretty<00:05:51.830> much<00:05:51.950> an<00:05:52.100> insta-kill

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
show so it's pretty much an insta-kill

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.250 
show so it's pretty much an insta-kill
against<00:05:52.970> space<00:05:53.270> marines<00:05:53.630> it's<00:05:53.870> not<00:05:54.050> gonna<00:05:54.139> be

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
against space marines it's not gonna be

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.760 
against space marines it's not gonna be
an<00:05:54.320> insta-kill<00:05:54.620> against<00:05:56.289> maybe<00:05:57.289> just<00:05:57.530> like<00:05:57.740> a

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
an insta-kill against maybe just like a

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.409 
an insta-kill against maybe just like a
tyranid<00:05:58.220> warriors<00:05:58.639> that<00:05:58.970> could<00:05:59.090> be<00:05:59.150> instant

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
tyranid warriors that could be instant

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.029 
tyranid warriors that could be instant
instant<00:05:59.630> kill<00:05:59.900> obviously<00:06:00.500> it<00:06:00.740> gives<00:06:00.889> their

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
instant kill obviously it gives their

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.560 
instant kill obviously it gives their
commanders<00:06:01.460> non<00:06:01.639> conveniens<00:06:01.850> to<00:06:02.180> kill<00:06:02.360> but

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
commanders non conveniens to kill but

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.640 
commanders non conveniens to kill but
against<00:06:02.810> most<00:06:03.020> things<00:06:03.229> this<00:06:03.350> could<00:06:03.500> be<00:06:03.560> an

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
against most things this could be an

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.560 
against most things this could be an
instant<00:06:03.800> kill<00:06:04.160> so<00:06:04.400> that's<00:06:04.970> just<00:06:05.030> an<00:06:05.240> easy<00:06:05.389> way

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
instant kill so that's just an easy way

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.410 
instant kill so that's just an easy way
to<00:06:05.720> kill<00:06:06.050> one<00:06:06.229> guy<00:06:06.470> on<00:06:06.680> the<00:06:06.800> opponent's

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
to kill one guy on the opponent's

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.750 
to kill one guy on the opponent's
