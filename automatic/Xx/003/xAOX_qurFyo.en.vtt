fish or you drown interestingly I always

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.960

preferred the surfing when I was younger
but<00:04:42.270> but<00:04:42.540> I<00:04:42.600> got<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.840> say<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.080> skating<00:04:43.380> is<00:04:43.680> the

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
but but I got to say the skating is the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.830 
but but I got to say the skating is the
better<00:04:44.220> part<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.670> game<00:04:44.940> but<00:04:45.540> it's<00:04:45.660> not

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
better part of the game but it's not

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.550 
better part of the game but it's not
that<00:04:45.990> good<00:04:46.200> either

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560

you skate along and you can jump over

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.060 
you skate along and you can jump over
things<00:04:51.300> and<00:04:51.480> avoid<00:04:51.780> obstacles<00:04:52.070> scoring

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
things and avoid obstacles scoring

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.190

the song is actually not bad once it
gets<00:04:57.540> going<00:04:57.960> but<00:04:58.170> most<00:04:58.410> of<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.620> time<00:04:58.860> you're
