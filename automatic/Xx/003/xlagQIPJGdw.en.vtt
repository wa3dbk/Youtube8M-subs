here there's her ear right here there is
gonna<00:02:01.710> be<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.100> little<00:02:02.490> ribbon<00:02:03.210> loop<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:03.990> you

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
gonna be a little ribbon loop if you

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.679 
gonna be a little ribbon loop if you
guys<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.500> see<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:04.979> right<00:02:05.250> there<00:02:05.689> okay

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
guys can see that it's right there okay

guys can see that it's right there okay
this<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> ribbon<00:02:07.469> loop<00:02:07.920> right<00:02:08.280> here<00:02:08.310> you're

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
this is a ribbon loop right here you're

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.940 
this is a ribbon loop right here you're
going<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.479> take<00:02:09.690> deke<00:02:09.989> one<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> clip

going to take deke one of the clip

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.830 
going to take deke one of the clip
extensions<00:02:11.610> from<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.150> left<00:02:12.420> or<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.720> right

the clip in and then right here this

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.190 
the clip in and then right here this
piece<00:02:22.290> right<00:02:22.769> here<00:02:22.829> is<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.700> hair<00:02:24.269> extension

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
piece right here is the hair extension

piece right here is the hair extension
if<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.409> guys<00:02:25.530> can<00:02:26.189> see<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:26.639> so<00:02:27.090> that's<00:02:27.299> where

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
if you guys can see that so that's where

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.140 
if you guys can see that so that's where
one<00:02:27.719> of<00:02:27.749> the<00:02:27.959> main<00:02:28.139> clips<00:02:28.409> is<00:02:28.939> definitely<00:02:29.939> guys

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
one of the main clips is definitely guys

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.959 
one of the main clips is definitely guys
look<00:02:30.689> for<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.379> ear<00:02:31.680> look<00:02:32.250> for<00:02:32.430> an<00:02:32.519> ear<00:02:32.730> and

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
look for the ear look for an ear and

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.970 
look for the ear look for an ear and
then<00:02:33.090> look<00:02:33.359> right<00:02:33.719> near<00:02:34.049> it<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.349> you<00:02:34.829> will

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
then look right near it and you will

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.349 
then look right near it and you will
find<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.400> loop<00:02:35.549> you<00:02:35.700> have<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.969> look<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.209> little

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
find the loop you have to look a little

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.929 
find the loop you have to look a little
bit<00:02:36.629> it's<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.870> little<00:02:36.900> bit<00:02:37.170> hard<00:02:37.439> to<00:02:37.500> get<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.939> or

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
bit it's a little bit hard to get in or

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.459 
bit it's a little bit hard to get in or
it's<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.329> little<00:02:39.510> bit<00:02:39.629> hard<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.810> find<00:02:40.019> but<00:02:40.290> once

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
it's a little bit hard to find but once

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:41.899 
it's a little bit hard to find but once
you<00:02:40.620> get<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.829> in<00:02:40.950> it's<00:02:41.189> not<00:02:41.430> gonna<00:02:41.609> fall<00:02:41.879> out

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
you get it in it's not gonna fall out

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.909 
you get it in it's not gonna fall out
you<00:02:42.090> want<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.510> cover<00:02:42.659> it<00:02:42.840> up<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.109> little<00:02:43.169> bit<00:02:43.469> you

and that's where one of the clips is the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.599 
and that's where one of the clips is the
other<00:02:51.719> clip<00:02:52.049> is<00:02:52.199> on<00:02:52.379> the<00:02:52.590> other<00:02:52.829> side<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.459> her

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
other clip is on the other side of her

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.119 
other clip is on the other side of her
ear<00:02:53.819> right<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.569> same<00:02:54.750> place<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.379> then<00:02:55.889> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
just kind of go right down the middle

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.159 
just kind of go right down the middle
you<00:03:04.040> will<00:03:05.040> find<00:03:05.699> if<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.150> search<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.689> little<00:03:07.019> bit

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
harder you'll find the third little loop

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.369 
harder you'll find the third little loop
right<00:03:11.340> here<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:11.939> you<00:03:12.180> want<00:03:12.389> to<00:03:12.449> push<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.139> clip

right here and you want to push the clip

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.199 
right here and you want to push the clip
through<00:03:13.859> it<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.250> there<00:03:14.609> you<00:03:14.760> go<00:03:14.909> you<00:03:14.969> got<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
through it and there you go you got the

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.000 
through it and there you go you got the
hair<00:03:15.419> extension<00:03:15.750> can<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.019> guys<00:03:16.169> see<00:03:16.379> this<00:03:16.829> is

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
hair extension can you guys see this is

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.819 
hair extension can you guys see this is
where<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.219> hair<00:03:17.370> extension<00:03:17.790> starts<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.709> then

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
where the hair extension starts and then

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.490 
where the hair extension starts and then
it<00:03:19.859> keeps<00:03:20.159> going<00:03:20.459> down<00:03:20.759> so<00:03:21.120> look<00:03:21.599> for<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:21.959> and

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
it keeps going down so look for that and

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.990 
it keeps going down so look for that and
