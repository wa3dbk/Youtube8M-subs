now<00:02:52.390> what<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:52.600> was<00:02:52.780> doing<00:02:53.080> in<00:02:53.380> this<00:02:55.470> walkthrough

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
now what I was doing in this walkthrough

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.650 
now what I was doing in this walkthrough
is<00:02:58.470> what<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.500> was<00:02:59.710> going<00:02:59.860> to<00:02:59.950> do<00:03:00.100> is<00:03:00.660> start

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
is what I was going to do is start

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.940 
is what I was going to do is start
taking<00:03:02.020> everybody<00:03:02.320> out<00:03:02.380> from<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.770> right

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
taking everybody out from the right

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.650 
taking everybody out from the right
because<00:03:03.190> from<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.820> right<00:03:04.000> side<00:03:04.180> it's<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.510> lot

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
because from the right side it's a lot

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.910 
because from the right side it's a lot
easier<00:03:04.870> because<00:03:05.380> that<00:03:06.340> beats<00:03:06.790> are<00:03:06.910> 80<00:03:07.240> into

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
easier because that beats are 80 into

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.010 
easier because that beats are 80 into
the<00:03:08.920> most<00:03:09.100> part<00:03:09.310> isn't<00:03:09.490> going<00:03:09.850> but<00:03:10.570> I<00:03:10.630> went

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
the most part isn't going but I went

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.960 
the most part isn't going but I went
ahead<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.200> shot<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.590> with<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.970> rocket

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
ahead and shot it with the rocket

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.730 
ahead and shot it with the rocket
launcher<00:03:13.240> and<00:03:13.390> everyone<00:03:14.380> freaking

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
launcher and everyone freaking

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.520 
launcher and everyone freaking
disappeared<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:16.000> will<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.930> strategy<00:03:17.470> is

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
disappeared so that will of strategy is

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
disappeared so that will of strategy is
better<00:03:18.990> but<00:03:19.990> anyways<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.980> actually<00:03:21.190> probably

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
better but anyways you actually probably

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.820 
better but anyways you actually probably
pick<00:03:21.850> up<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.060> rocket<00:03:22.390> launcher<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:23.050> lot<00:03:23.380> earlier

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
pick up a rocket launcher a lot earlier

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.530 
pick up a rocket launcher a lot earlier
than<00:03:23.920> having<00:03:24.460> a<00:03:24.520> late<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:25.050> getting<00:03:27.300> to<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.420> top

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
than having a late to getting to the top

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:37.250 
than having a late to getting to the top
of<00:03:28.600> every<00:03:30.120> but<00:03:31.120> um

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.589 

so<00:03:38.260> this<00:03:38.409> first<00:03:38.590> part<00:03:38.860> as<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.099> see<00:03:39.480> what<00:03:40.480> we're

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
so this first part as you see what we're

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.830 
so this first part as you see what we're
doing<00:03:40.930> is<00:03:42.959> moving<00:03:43.959> up<00:03:44.200> pretty<00:03:44.379> slowly<00:03:44.709> because

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
doing is moving up pretty slowly because

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.289 
doing is moving up pretty slowly because
certain<00:03:46.840> spots<00:03:47.110> you<00:03:47.290> get<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.909> know<00:03:48.909> trigger

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
certain spots you get to know trigger

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.440 
certain spots you get to know trigger
and<00:03:49.689> it<00:03:49.870> used<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.140> come<00:03:50.319> out

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.410 

plan<00:03:54.450> on<00:03:54.599> sprinting<00:03:55.200> then<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:57.060> know<00:03:57.209> just

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
plan on sprinting then you know just

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.680 
plan on sprinting then you know just
running<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.870> end

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
running to the end

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.690 
running to the end
keep<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.410> window

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
keep the window

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.180 
keep the window
the<00:04:01.420> problem<00:04:01.750> is<00:04:01.840> if<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:02.860> do<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.099> whole

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
the problem is if you do the whole

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:10.800 
the problem is if you do the whole
sprint<00:04:03.580> team<00:04:08.160> holes<00:04:09.160> you<00:04:09.489> know

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
sprint team holes you know

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.970 
sprint team holes you know
no<00:04:11.349> sprinting<00:04:11.920> thing<00:04:12.840> she<00:04:13.840> stopped<00:04:14.200> there's

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
no sprinting thing she stopped there's

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.349 
no sprinting thing she stopped there's
gonna<00:04:15.130> be<00:04:15.280> all<00:04:15.520> those<00:04:15.730> enemies<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.209> you

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
gonna be all those enemies that you

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.729 
gonna be all those enemies that you
triggered<00:04:16.810> they're<00:04:17.139> gonna<00:04:17.260> all<00:04:17.440> be<00:04:17.470> behind

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
triggered they're gonna all be behind

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:31.409 
triggered they're gonna all be behind
you

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.209
