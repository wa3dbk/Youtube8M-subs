in<00:00:02.159> my<00:00:02.340> last<00:00:02.550> video<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.030> said<00:00:03.540> I<00:00:03.570> wasn't<00:00:03.870> going

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
in my last video I said I wasn't going

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.690 
in my last video I said I wasn't going
to<00:00:04.020> be<00:00:04.140> covering<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.710> work<00:00:04.890> done<00:00:05.250> on<00:00:05.490> the

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
to be covering the work done on the

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.519 
to be covering the work done on the
front<00:00:06.000> half<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.660> roof

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
front half of the roof

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.129 
front half of the roof
I<00:00:07.560> sent<00:00:08.400> changed<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:08.880> mind<00:00:09.120> on<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.870> took<00:00:10.110> a

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
I sent changed my mind on that I took a

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.080 
I sent changed my mind on that I took a
bunch<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.530> pictures<00:00:10.769> mainly<00:00:11.639> for<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.880> website

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
bunch of pictures mainly for the website

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.580 
bunch of pictures mainly for the website
article<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:13.049> also<00:00:13.860> took<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.610> series<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.269> pictures

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
article I also took a series of pictures

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.460 
article I also took a series of pictures
to<00:00:16.590> make<00:00:17.010> up<00:00:17.220> kind<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.850> time-lapse<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.750> me

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
to make up kind of a time-lapse of me

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.929 
to make up kind of a time-lapse of me
shingling<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.070> roof<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.640> thought<00:00:20.789> it

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
shingling the roof and I thought it

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.230 
shingling the roof and I thought it
would<00:00:21.029> be<00:00:21.119> neat<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.539> make<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> video<00:00:22.020> from<00:00:22.500> that

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
would be neat to make a video from that

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.970 
would be neat to make a video from that
to<00:00:24.240> begin<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.810> stripped<00:00:25.140> off<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.500> old<00:00:25.650> fascia

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
to begin I stripped off the old fascia

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.759 
to begin I stripped off the old fascia
board<00:00:26.369> along<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> front<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.599> overhang<00:00:28.080> to

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
board along the front of the overhang to

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.939 
board along the front of the overhang to
get<00:00:28.949> ready<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.580> extend<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.420> out<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.830> was

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
get ready to extend that out that was

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.410 
get ready to extend that out that was
one<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.309> things<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.759> really<00:00:32.880> bothered

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
one of the things that really bothered

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.389 
one of the things that really bothered
me<00:00:33.450> about<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.899> house<00:00:34.230> how<00:00:34.680> narrow<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
me about the house how narrow the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.150 
me about the house how narrow the
overhangs<00:00:35.910> are<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.480> all<00:00:36.690> sides<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.410> roof<00:00:37.950> was

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
overhangs are on all sides the roof was

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.729 
overhangs are on all sides the roof was
originally<00:00:38.700> framed<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.210> cantilever<00:00:39.840> out<00:00:40.170> over

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
didn't go up to the roof at all so I

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.200 
didn't go up to the roof at all so I
made<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> new<00:00:52.469> beam<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.070> support<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.730> part<00:00:54.059> of

made a new beam to support this part of
the<00:00:54.329> roof<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.320> held<00:00:55.590> up<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.190> couple<00:00:56.489> of

the roof and it's held up on a couple of
posts<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:58.020> finish<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.649> overhang

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
posts I can then finish the overhang

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.299 
posts I can then finish the overhang
along<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.820> front<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.109> sides<00:01:01.379> with

weather<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:08.400> start<00:01:08.640> stripping<00:01:09.150> off<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
weather I can start stripping off the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.390 
weather I can start stripping off the
old<00:01:09.689> shingles<00:01:09.990> even<00:01:10.680> though<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> boards<00:01:11.250> are

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
old shingles even though the boards are

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.280 
old shingles even though the boards are
in<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.580> lot<00:01:11.790> better<00:01:11.970> shape<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.840> side<00:01:13.140> of

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
in a lot better shape on this side of

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.870 
in a lot better shape on this side of
the<00:01:13.409> roof<00:01:13.680> there<00:01:14.040> was<00:01:14.220> still<00:01:14.460> quite<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.760> few

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the roof there was still quite a few

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.780 
the roof there was still quite a few
that<00:01:15.420> were<00:01:15.570> broken<00:01:15.930> since<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.890> had<00:01:17.159> extended

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
that were broken since I had extended

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.580 
that were broken since I had extended
the<00:01:17.909> eaves<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.479> would<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> cover<00:01:19.320> that

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
the eaves and would have to cover that

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.670 
the eaves and would have to cover that
as<00:01:19.830> well<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.369> decided<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.540> best<00:01:21.720> approach<00:01:22.259> was

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
as well I decided the best approach was

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.240 
as well I decided the best approach was
to<00:01:22.950> reshoot<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.759> whole<00:01:23.790> roof<00:01:24.240> with<00:01:24.900> OSB<00:01:25.500> to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
to reshoot the whole roof with OSB to

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.880 
to reshoot the whole roof with OSB to
get<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> sheets<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:27.060> onto<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.930> roof<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.439> set<00:01:28.860> up

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
get the sheets up onto the roof I set up

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.670 
get the sheets up onto the roof I set up
a<00:01:29.130> couple<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.490> long<00:01:29.759> two<00:01:30.060> by<00:01:30.240> fours<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.900> drove

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
a couple of long two by fours and drove

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.370 
a couple of long two by fours and drove
in<00:01:32.009> two<00:01:32.250> nails<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.970> hold<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.420> sheets<00:01:33.720> up<00:01:33.960> in

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
in two nails to hold the sheets up in

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.800 
in two nails to hold the sheets up in
place<00:01:34.860> until<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.670> got<00:01:35.850> up<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.299> pulled<00:01:36.540> them<00:01:36.689> up

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
place until I got up and pulled them up

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.719 
place until I got up and pulled them up
I<00:01:37.079> use<00:01:37.500> three<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.950> quarter<00:01:38.130> inch<00:01:38.460> nails

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
I use three and a quarter inch nails

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.330 
I use three and a quarter inch nails
through<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.540> OSB<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.500> through<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> roof

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
through the OSB and through the roof

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.999 
through the OSB and through the roof
boards<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.030> into<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> rafters<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.320> hold

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
boards and into the rafters to hold

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.639 
boards and into the rafters to hold
everything<00:01:44.610> down<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.079> done<00:01:46.320> I

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
everything down and with that done I

00:01:46.649 --> 00:03:08.380 
everything down and with that done I
could<00:01:46.890> get<00:01:47.100> started<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.060> shingling

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.920 

you

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.930 

for<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.020> ridge<00:03:14.140> cap<00:03:14.410> I'm<00:03:14.680> using<00:03:15.220> ordinary

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
for the ridge cap I'm using ordinary

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.000 
for the ridge cap I'm using ordinary
three<00:03:16.480> tab<00:03:16.690> shingles<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.380> are<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.680> pretty

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
three tab shingles that are a pretty

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.710 
three tab shingles that are a pretty
close<00:03:18.340> color<00:03:18.700> match<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.420> what<00:03:19.570> I've<00:03:19.690> used

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
close color match to the what I've used

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.760 
close color match to the what I've used
on<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.260> roof

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
on the roof

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.920 
on the roof
just<00:03:21.430> going<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.640> cut<00:03:21.820> it<00:03:21.970> into<00:03:22.210> three<00:03:22.690> pieces

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
just going to cut it into three pieces

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.010 
just going to cut it into three pieces
here<00:03:23.830> I<00:03:23.860> just<00:03:23.950> cut<00:03:24.280> on<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.430> slight<00:03:24.730> angle<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.780> get

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
here I just cut on a slight angle to get

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.050 
here I just cut on a slight angle to get
rid<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.560> part<00:03:26.830> that<00:03:27.070> protrudes<00:03:27.580> on<00:03:27.940> the

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
rid of the part that protrudes on the

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.160 
rid of the part that protrudes on the
end<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:29.380> same<00:03:29.620> in<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:29.890> middle<00:03:30.840> pick<00:03:31.840> up<00:03:31.990> that

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
end the same in the middle pick up that

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.840 
end the same in the middle pick up that
section<00:03:35.160> separate<00:03:36.160> these<00:03:36.400> two<00:03:38.520> and<00:03:39.520> the<00:03:39.610> same

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
section separate these two and the same

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.140 
section separate these two and the same
on<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.120> end<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:42.310> what<00:03:42.460> that<00:03:42.610> does<00:03:42.790> is<00:03:43.030> it

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
on the end and what that does is it

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.620 
on the end and what that does is it
hides<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.870> edge<00:03:44.020> of<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:45.270> shingle<00:03:46.270> so<00:03:46.480> you

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
hides the edge of the shingle so you

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.800 
hides the edge of the shingle so you
only<00:03:46.870> see<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.410> brown<00:03:47.880> part<00:03:48.880> not<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.540> black

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
only see the brown part not the black

00:03:49.810 --> 00:04:06.570 
only see the brown part not the black
part<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.380> would<00:03:50.530> stick<00:03:50.860> out<00:04:05.580> whenever

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
part that would stick out whenever

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.520 
part that would stick out whenever
possible<00:04:06.820> you<00:04:07.420> should<00:04:07.450> start<00:04:07.870> putting<00:04:08.320> the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
possible you should start putting the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.740 
possible you should start putting the
ridge<00:04:08.680> cap<00:04:08.980> on<00:04:09.220> from<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.090> direction<00:04:10.420> away

my case the prevailing winds from behind

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.690 
my case the prevailing winds from behind
me<00:04:16.510> so<00:04:17.260> I'm<00:04:17.590> starting<00:04:18.010> on<00:04:18.070> this<00:04:18.250> end<00:04:18.520> and

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
me so I'm starting on this end and

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.210 
me so I'm starting on this end and
working<00:04:19.000> my<00:04:19.299> way<00:04:19.330> across<00:04:19.920> sometimes<00:04:20.920> you<00:04:21.190> just

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
working my way across sometimes you just

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.750 
working my way across sometimes you just
give<00:04:21.610> the<00:04:21.930> cap<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:22.960> little<00:04:23.170> bit<00:04:23.500> of<00:04:23.590> a<00:04:23.710> bend<00:04:23.920> then

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
give the cap a little bit of a bend then

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.230 
give the cap a little bit of a bend then
I<00:04:24.880> can<00:04:25.090> line<00:04:26.020> it<00:04:26.050> up<00:04:26.430> normally<00:04:27.430> you<00:04:28.090> would

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
I can line it up normally you would

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.170 
I can line it up normally you would
chalk<00:04:28.480> align<00:04:28.840> for<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.290> edge<00:04:29.440> up<00:04:30.040> here<00:04:30.490> I'm<00:04:30.880> not

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
chalk align for the edge up here I'm not

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.820 
chalk align for the edge up here I'm not
too<00:04:31.420> concerned<00:04:31.840> about<00:04:31.960> that<00:04:32.140> if<00:04:32.500> it's<00:04:32.620> got<00:04:32.800> a

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
too concerned about that if it's got a

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.290 
too concerned about that if it's got a
little<00:04:33.100> bit<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.370> wave<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.580> it<00:04:33.940> you'll<00:04:34.090> never

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
little bit of a wave to it you'll never

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.540 
little bit of a wave to it you'll never
see<00:04:34.600> it<00:04:34.630> from<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.020> ground<00:04:35.310> whenever<00:04:36.310> you

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
see it from the ground whenever you

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.190 
see it from the ground whenever you
don't<00:04:36.670> have<00:04:36.880> a<00:04:36.910> line<00:04:37.150> of<00:04:37.330> sight<00:04:37.540> it's<00:04:37.900> usually

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
don't have a line of sight it's usually

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.430 
don't have a line of sight it's usually
better<00:04:38.950> just<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.550> lay<00:04:40.000> it<00:04:40.180> as<00:04:40.330> you<00:04:40.540> see<00:04:40.750> it<00:04:40.870> so

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
better just to lay it as you see it so

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.680 
better just to lay it as you see it so
hold<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:41.710> down<00:04:41.920> tight<00:04:42.310> just<00:04:42.910> put<00:04:43.150> a<00:04:43.180> nail<00:04:43.420> on

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
hold it down tight just put a nail on

00:04:43.690 --> 00:05:26.890 
hold it down tight just put a nail on
either<00:04:43.870> side<00:04:49.200> then<00:04:50.200> you<00:04:50.350> can<00:04:50.380> blade<00:04:50.680> next<00:04:51.130> one

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.210 

now<00:05:27.900> you<00:05:28.110> get<00:05:28.200> to<00:05:28.350> the<00:05:28.470> end<00:05:28.590> you<00:05:28.740> got<00:05:28.830> a<00:05:28.890> piece

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
now you get to the end you got a piece

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.330 
now you get to the end you got a piece
that<00:05:29.610> needs<00:05:30.060> to<00:05:30.240> go<00:05:30.390> here<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:31.050> finish<00:05:31.410> it<00:05:31.740> off

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
that needs to go here to finish it off

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.840 
that needs to go here to finish it off
one<00:05:33.150> way<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.420> hold<00:05:33.780> that<00:05:34.050> in<00:05:34.260> place<00:05:34.440> is<00:05:34.920> just<00:05:35.490> to

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
one way to hold that in place is just to

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.240 
one way to hold that in place is just to
nail<00:05:36.300> down<00:05:36.330> through<00:05:36.930> it<00:05:37.080> and<00:05:37.290> then<00:05:37.530> some<00:05:37.800> dab

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
nail down through it and then some dab

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.680 
nail down through it and then some dab
some<00:05:39.170> sealant<00:05:40.170> on<00:05:40.380> there<00:05:40.710> a<00:05:41.190> better<00:05:41.820> way<00:05:41.970> is<00:05:42.390> to

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
some sealant on there a better way is to

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.970 
some sealant on there a better way is to
get<00:05:42.840> a<00:05:43.140> good<00:05:43.830> quality<00:05:44.100> roof<00:05:45.030> patch<00:05:45.980> type

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
get a good quality roof patch type

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.830 
get a good quality roof patch type
adhesive<00:05:47.580> and<00:05:48.650> glue<00:05:49.650> the<00:05:49.860> back<00:05:50.040> of<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.370> piece

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.520 

right<00:05:53.590> here

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.420 

and<00:05:58.620> then<00:05:58.800> put<00:05:59.550> that<00:05:59.580> in<00:05:59.880> place<00:06:01.010> now<00:06:02.010> I've<00:06:02.220> got

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
and then put that in place now I've got

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.320 
and then put that in place now I've got
a<00:06:02.460> piece<00:06:02.820> of<00:06:02.880> wood<00:06:03.240> here<00:06:03.690> this<00:06:04.260> is<00:06:04.410> actually

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
a piece of wood here this is actually

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.810 
a piece of wood here this is actually
outriggers<00:06:06.330> that<00:06:06.570> I<00:06:06.600> made<00:06:06.900> earlier<00:06:07.370> to<00:06:08.370> frame

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
outriggers that I made earlier to frame

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.330 
outriggers that I made earlier to frame
and<00:06:09.600> what<00:06:09.750> they'll<00:06:09.900> do<00:06:10.050> is<00:06:10.200> they'll<00:06:10.350> mimic<00:06:10.590> the

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
and what they'll do is they'll mimic the

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.550 
and what they'll do is they'll mimic the
slope<00:06:11.610> of<00:06:11.700> the<00:06:11.820> roof<00:06:11.910> on<00:06:12.120> both<00:06:12.300> sides<00:06:12.630> and<00:06:12.960> hold

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
slope of the roof on both sides and hold

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.780 
slope of the roof on both sides and hold
that<00:06:13.890> piece<00:06:14.220> in<00:06:14.430> place<00:06:14.580> until<00:06:15.180> the<00:06:15.330> glue<00:06:15.360> dries
