prices in which potion you should do and
I'm<00:03:25.320> going<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.500> simplify<00:03:25.830> this<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.400> put<00:03:26.640> two

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
I'm going to simplify this and put two

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.180 
I'm going to simplify this and put two
pictures<00:03:27.120> on<00:03:27.570> screen<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.290> I'll<00:03:28.890> talk<00:03:29.130> about

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
pictures on screen and I'll talk about

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.610 
pictures on screen and I'll talk about
these<00:03:29.550> pictures<00:03:30.000> which<00:03:30.630> will<00:03:30.840> make<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.170> easier

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
these pictures which will make it easier

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.130 
these pictures which will make it easier
to<00:03:31.739> follow<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:32.489> these<00:03:33.450> two<00:03:33.630> pictures<00:03:33.810> on

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
to follow so these two pictures on

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.040 
to follow so these two pictures on
screen<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:35.760> retina<00:03:36.540> or<00:03:36.570> in<00:03:36.810> the

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
screen is the retina or in the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.440 
screen is the retina or in the
Snapdragon<00:03:37.709> now<00:03:38.070> Snapdragon<00:03:38.700> is<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.030> highest

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
Snapdragon now Snapdragon is the highest

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.000 
Snapdragon now Snapdragon is the highest
at<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.690> moment<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.170> don't<00:03:40.620> want<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.920> do

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
at the moment and you don't want to do

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.250 
at the moment and you don't want to do
the<00:03:41.130> highest<00:03:41.459> just<00:03:41.880> because<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.840> highest

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
the highest just because the highest

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.870 
the highest just because the highest
will<00:03:43.620> make<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:44.100> lose

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
will make you lose

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.150 
will make you lose
a<00:03:44.910> lot<00:03:45.270> of<00:03:45.540> money<00:03:45.630> just<00:03:46.500> because<00:03:46.890> everyone's

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
a lot of money just because everyone's

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.220 
a lot of money just because everyone's
going<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:47.940> be<00:03:48.030> doing<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:49.020> actually

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
going to be doing it and you actually

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.130 
going to be doing it and you actually
will<00:03:49.560> lose<00:03:49.830> money<00:03:50.130> if<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.640> do<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.540> graph

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
will lose money if you do it this graph

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.010 
will lose money if you do it this graph
is<00:03:52.320> just<00:03:52.530> going<00:03:52.650> off<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.980> GE<00:03:53.190> prices<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.020> let's

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
is just going off the GE prices so let's

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.750 
is just going off the GE prices so let's
just<00:03:55.200> take<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.530> off<00:03:55.710> and<00:03:55.740> put<00:03:56.100> our<00:03:56.220> filter<00:03:56.610> on

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
just take that off and put our filter on

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.730 
just take that off and put our filter on
now<00:03:57.330> we<00:03:57.720> want<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:57.990> take<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.290> look<00:03:58.380> at<00:03:58.620> this
