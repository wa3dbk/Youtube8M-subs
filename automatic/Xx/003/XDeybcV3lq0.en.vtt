install<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.489> first<00:00:47.789> video<00:00:49.340> go<00:00:50.340> ahead

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
install it in this first video go ahead

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.650 
install it in this first video go ahead
and<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:50.730> put<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.120> my

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
and just put in my

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.330 
and just put in my
password<00:00:53.649> and<00:00:53.859> username<00:00:54.219> there

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.640 

okay<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.360> all<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.600> need<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.810> do<00:01:01.110> is<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.440> take

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
okay so all we need to do is just take

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.430 
okay so all we need to do is just take
this<00:01:01.860> line<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.370> code<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:02.910> these<00:01:03.420> few<00:01:03.870> small

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
this line of code for these few small

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.460 
this line of code for these few small
lines<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.920> code<00:01:05.190> just<00:01:05.940> hit<00:01:06.090> ctrl<00:01:06.540> C<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.870> copy<00:01:07.230> it

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
lines of code just hit ctrl C to copy it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.550 
lines of code just hit ctrl C to copy it
once<00:01:08.460> you've<00:01:08.670> highlighted<00:01:08.910> it<00:01:09.390> okay

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
once you've highlighted it okay

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.310 
once you've highlighted it okay
post<00:01:10.980> it<00:01:11.160> into<00:01:11.310> your<00:01:11.520> script<00:01:11.910> editor<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
post it into your script editor and you

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.740 
post it into your script editor and you
can<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.800> it<00:01:13.920> comes<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:15.120> big<00:01:15.420> line

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
can see that it comes in in one big line

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.530 
can see that it comes in in one big line
and<00:01:16.140> we<00:01:17.100> can't<00:01:17.370> necessarily<00:01:17.550> run<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> code

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and we can't necessarily run the code

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.840 
and we can't necessarily run the code
this<00:01:18.780> way<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.800> you<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.130> grab<00:01:20.340> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
this way so you just grab it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.850 
this way so you just grab it
middle<00:01:21.420> click<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.810> drag<00:01:22.050> it<00:01:22.230> to<00:01:22.260> your<00:01:22.530> shelf

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
middle click and drag it to your shelf

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.250 
middle click and drag it to your shelf
okay<00:01:23.640> go<00:01:24.240> ahead<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.540> close<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:24.930> script

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
okay go ahead and close your script

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.040 
okay go ahead and close your script
editor<00:01:25.700> I'm<00:01:26.700> gonna<00:01:26.970> run<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.420> code<00:01:27.750> and

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
editor I'm gonna run that code and

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.910 
editor I'm gonna run that code and
you're<00:01:29.040> you're<00:01:30.030> gonna<00:01:30.150> see<00:01:30.480> a<00:01:31.200> bunch<00:01:31.740> of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
you're you're gonna see a bunch of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.950 
you're you're gonna see a bunch of
different<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.369> windows<00:01:32.820> here<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.750> make

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
different little windows here just make

Maya the only problem that I've noticed
in<00:02:33.600> Maya<00:02:34.010> 2014<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.190> when<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.520> run<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:36.030> little

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
in Maya 2014 is when you run that little

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.040 
in Maya 2014 is when you run that little
line<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.960> code<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:38.060> won't<00:02:39.060> actually<00:02:39.330> get<00:02:39.780> this

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
line of code you won't actually get this

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.110 
line of code you won't actually get this
button<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.800> have<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.420> run<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.660> UI<00:02:43.230> command
