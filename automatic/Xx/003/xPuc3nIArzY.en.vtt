firm rubberized grip that is pretty

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610 
firm rubberized grip that is pretty
effective<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:48.090> what<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.329> does<00:00:48.510> there's<00:00:49.379> also

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
effective for what it does there's also

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.380 
effective for what it does there's also
a<00:00:49.770> little<00:00:49.950> latch<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.250> extends<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.239> it

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390

so<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.109> leave<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:58.890> easily

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so if you leave it on you can easily

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.189 
so if you leave it on you can easily
connect<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.910> by<00:01:00.149> turning<00:01:00.449> your<00:01:00.660> own<00:01:00.719> Bluetooth

to do that on the back there's an

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.289 
to do that on the back there's an
auxiliary<00:01:09.990> jack<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.860> connect<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.490> 3.5

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.359 
auxiliary jack to connect a 3.5
millimeter<00:01:12.630> device<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.560> luckily<00:01:14.040> they

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
millimeter device to it luckily they

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.249 
millimeter device to it luckily they
supply<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.939> an<00:01:15.030> auxiliary<00:01:15.210> cable<00:01:16.049> so

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
supply with an auxiliary cable so

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.289 
supply with an auxiliary cable so
there's<00:01:16.770> no<00:01:16.920> hassle<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.340> go<00:01:17.490> out<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.060> buy

there's no hassle to go out and buy

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.840 
there's no hassle to go out and buy
another<00:01:18.570> cable<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:20.100> probably<00:01:20.430> notice<00:01:20.820> that

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
another cable you probably notice that

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.999 
another cable you probably notice that
there's<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.240> USB<00:01:21.540> port<00:01:21.930> there<00:01:22.080> too<00:01:22.320> that's<00:01:22.710> just

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
there's a USB port there too that's just

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.950 
there's a USB port there too that's just
there<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.310> take<00:01:23.490> advantage<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> 18<00:01:24.840> hour

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
there to take advantage of the 18 hour

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.469 
there to take advantage of the 18 hour

details<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.189> enjoy<00:01:50.490> about<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.880> speaker<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
details I enjoy about the speaker is a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.719 
details I enjoy about the speaker is a
little<00:01:51.780> cutout<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.259> back<00:01:52.470> camera<00:01:53.460> audio

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
little cutout in the back camera audio

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.120 
little cutout in the back camera audio
calls<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.509> active<00:01:54.960> base<00:01:55.170> radiator<00:01:55.770> where

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
calls it the active base radiator where

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.130 
calls it the active base radiator where
the<00:01:56.250> mink<00:01:56.490> Cisco<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.240> able<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.750> pump<00:01:57.960> out<00:01:58.110> a

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the mink Cisco is able to pump out a

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.440 
the mink Cisco is able to pump out a
good<00:01:58.439> amount<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.740> base<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.729> sort<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.240> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
good amount of base it's sort of like a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.179 
good amount of base it's sort of like a
built-in<00:02:00.869> subwoofer<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.979> pretty

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
built-in subwoofer and it's pretty

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.370 
built-in subwoofer and it's pretty
decent<00:02:02.369> too<00:02:02.670> I'd<00:02:03.360> say<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.689> speaker<00:02:04.020> isn't

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
decent too I'd say the speaker isn't

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.359 
decent too I'd say the speaker isn't
anything<00:02:04.619> special

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
anything special

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.069 
anything special
it's<00:02:05.610> rather<00:02:05.790> straightforward<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.840> what<00:02:06.960> it

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
it's rather straightforward for what it

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.979 
it's rather straightforward for what it
does<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.670> for<00:02:08.670> what<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:08.910> made<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.629> would

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
does and for what it's made for I would

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.440 
does and for what it's made for I would
deem<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.319> as<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> relatively<00:02:11.009> nice<00:02:11.280> speaker<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
deem it as a relatively nice speaker the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.430 
deem it as a relatively nice speaker the
base<00:02:12.629> is<00:02:12.810> there<00:02:13.050> at

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
base is there at

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.620 
base is there at
packs<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.770> nice<00:02:13.920> punch<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.490> overall<00:02:15.240> I<00:02:15.390> can't

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
packs a nice punch and overall I can't

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.480 
packs a nice punch and overall I can't
complain<00:02:15.960> for<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.260> price<00:02:16.470> but<00:02:17.070> I<00:02:17.100> think<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
complain for the price but I think the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.550 
complain for the price but I think the
main<00:02:17.700> selling<00:02:18.000> point<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
main selling point of this is the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.980 
main selling point of this is the
massive<00:02:19.920> battery<00:02:20.280> life<00:02:20.460> so<00:02:21.060> far<00:02:21.300> I've<00:02:21.540> had<00:02:21.570> no

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
massive battery life so far I've had no

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.690 
massive battery life so far I've had no
need<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.320> charge<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:22.920> I've<00:02:23.130> been<00:02:23.160> using<00:02:23.370> it

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
need to charge it and I've been using it

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.880 
need to charge it and I've been using it
almost<00:02:23.910> every<00:02:24.360> night<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.780> past<00:02:24.960> week<00:02:25.230> so

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890
