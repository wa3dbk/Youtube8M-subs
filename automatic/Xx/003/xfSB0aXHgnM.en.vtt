00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.480 
on oculus going through a tunnel right
now<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:22.650> were<00:01:22.710> some<00:01:22.920> sparks<00:01:23.310> for

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
now there were some sparks for

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.240 
now there were some sparks for

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
construction now i'm bout to hit sort of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.249 
construction now i'm bout to hit sort of
a<00:01:26.720> valley<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.560> down<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> steep<00:01:29.400> hill

a valley here going down a steep hill
there's<00:01:31.259> definitely<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.799> sense<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.159> speed<00:01:32.400> a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
there's definitely a sense of speed a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.609 
there's definitely a sense of speed a
little<00:01:32.670> bit<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.030> rush<00:01:33.409> butterflies<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.590> my

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
little bit of a rush butterflies in my

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.859 
little bit of a rush butterflies in my
stomach<00:01:34.710> I'd<00:01:35.220> say<00:01:38.150> up<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.630> shot<00:01:39.840> through

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
stomach I'd say up just shot through

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.539 
stomach I'd say up just shot through
another<00:01:40.860> truck<00:01:41.159> there

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.950 

and<00:01:45.549> again<00:01:45.760> you<00:01:45.790> don't<00:01:46.060> need<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.450> PS<00:01:46.720> Move

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
and again you don't need the PS Move

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.330 
and again you don't need the PS Move
controllers<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:48.490> navigate<00:01:49.360> in<00:01:49.509> this<00:01:49.840> demo<00:01:50.340> so

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
controllers to navigate in this demo so

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.060 
controllers to navigate in this demo so
we're<00:01:51.430> about<00:01:51.580> to<00:01:51.790> enter<00:01:52.000> a<00:01:52.210> tunnel<00:01:52.920> I'm<00:01:53.920> going

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
we're about to enter a tunnel I'm going

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.550 
we're about to enter a tunnel I'm going
to<00:01:54.159> go<00:01:54.250> underneath<00:01:54.520> up<00:01:54.940> let's<00:01:55.330> see<00:01:55.509> I've<00:01:56.350> been
