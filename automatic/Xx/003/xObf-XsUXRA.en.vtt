Lightning connection which means it
won't<00:00:26.730> dock<00:00:27.180> inside<00:00:27.570> any<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.859> old-style

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
just has a boost to it which makes it

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.450

about<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.329> right<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:48.870> I

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
about it you can see it right here as I

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.950 
about it you can see it right here as I
open<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.340> has<00:00:50.489> no<00:00:50.789> pairing<00:00:51.270> needed

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
open it up is it has no pairing needed

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.959 
open it up is it has no pairing needed
there's<00:00:52.170> no<00:00:52.289> code<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.980> essentially<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
there's no code so essentially it's a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.420 
there's no code so essentially it's a
OneTouch<00:00:54.449> pairing<00:00:54.960> process<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.770> I'm<00:00:56.280> just

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
OneTouch pairing process so I'm just

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.450 
OneTouch pairing process so I'm just
going<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.610> place<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.120> over<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:58.460> 30-pin

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
going to place it over the 30-pin

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.130 
going to place it over the 30-pin
connection<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.390> hear<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.629> makes<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.930> sound

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
connection you can hear it makes a sound

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.650 
connection you can hear it makes a sound
and<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> light<00:01:02.100> starts<00:01:02.550> blinking<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.149> then

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and the light starts blinking and then

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.149 
and the light starts blinking and then
on<00:01:03.809> my<00:01:03.899> iPod<00:01:04.320> Touch<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.769> I'm<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> go

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
on my iPod Touch here I'm going to go

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.060 
on my iPod Touch here I'm going to go
into<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> Bluetooth<00:01:05.880> settings<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.830> wait<00:01:07.830> for

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
into the Bluetooth settings and wait for

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.789 
into the Bluetooth settings and wait for
it<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> pop<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.409> sometimes<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.680> these

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
it to pop up so sometimes with these

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.350 
it to pop up so sometimes with these
Bluetooth<00:01:11.220> devices<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.880> know<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.240> to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
Bluetooth devices you know you have to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.630 
Bluetooth devices you know you have to
put<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> four-digit<00:01:13.350> code<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.340> all<00:01:14.580> I

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
put in a four-digit code with this all I

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.109 
put in a four-digit code with this all I
do<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.060> tap<00:01:15.360> dock<00:01:15.960> boss<00:01:16.259> air<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.640> will<00:01:17.790> pair

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
do is tap dock boss air and it will pair

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.999 
do is tap dock boss air and it will pair
up<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:19.049> soon<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.320> light<00:01:19.680> stops

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
up and as soon as that light stops

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.710 
up and as soon as that light stops
blinking<00:01:20.280> I'll<00:01:20.670> know<00:01:20.850> I'm<00:01:21.000> good<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.360> go

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
blinking I'll know I'm good to go

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.499 
blinking I'll know I'm good to go
so<00:01:22.049> no<00:01:22.409> having<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.130> put<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.610> any<00:01:23.880> sort<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.240> code

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
so no having to put in any sort of code

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.780 
so no having to put in any sort of code
at<00:01:24.720> all<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:25.950> now<00:01:26.100> solid<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
can do it via bluetooth I've essentially

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.780 
can do it via bluetooth I've essentially
turned<00:01:33.630> my<00:01:33.869> older<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.590> kind<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.890> outdated<00:01:35.490> dock
