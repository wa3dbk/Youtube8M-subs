00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.379 
the Virginia's view challenge super
excited<00:00:10.139> about<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.759> topic<00:00:12.210> is

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
excited about this and the topic is

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.950 
excited about this and the topic is
geometry<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.009> actually<00:00:14.480> googled<00:00:15.480> and

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
geometry so I actually googled and

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.349 
geometry so I actually googled and
Wikipedia<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.890> whatever<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.820> topic<00:00:18.090> of

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
Wikipedia and whatever the topic of

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.090 
Wikipedia and whatever the topic of
geometry<00:00:18.900> because<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.199> wasn't<00:00:19.560> sure<00:00:19.680> if<00:00:19.830> that's

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
geometry because I wasn't sure if that's

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.730 
geometry because I wasn't sure if that's
symmetry<00:00:21.029> or<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.510> not<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:22.260> seems<00:00:22.560> that

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
symmetry or is it not it seems that

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.700 
symmetry or is it not it seems that
symmetry<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> part<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.939> geometry<00:00:24.710> please

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
symmetry is a part of geometry please

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.650 
symmetry is a part of geometry please
forgive<00:00:25.980> me<00:00:26.189> my<00:00:26.310> school<00:00:26.609> days<00:00:26.760> are<00:00:26.939> very<00:00:26.970> far

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
forgive me my school days are very far

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.750 
forgive me my school days are very far
gone<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.349> was<00:00:28.560> really<00:00:28.949> not<00:00:29.130> good<00:00:29.400> at<00:00:29.519> math

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
gone and I was really not good at math

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.999 
gone and I was really not good at math
and<00:00:30.000> all<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.269> things<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:30.960> are<00:00:31.230> involved<00:00:31.650> but

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
and all the things that are involved but

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.120 
and all the things that are involved but
as<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.460> see<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.730> chose<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.570> interpret

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
as you can see I chose to interpret

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.209 
as you can see I chose to interpret
geometry<00:00:35.130> as<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.730> pattern<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:37.219> geometrical

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
geometry as a pattern as a geometrical

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.549 
geometry as a pattern as a geometrical
symmetrical<00:00:38.940> pattern<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.079> using<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
symmetrical pattern so I'm using the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.760 
symmetrical pattern so I'm using the
wonderful<00:00:41.219> doodle<00:00:41.879> bot<00:00:42.059> stamp<00:00:42.570> set<00:00:42.870> by<00:00:43.170> wplus9

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
wonderful doodle bot stamp set by wplus9

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.970 
wonderful doodle bot stamp set by wplus9
and<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:44.760> creating<00:00:45.360> my<00:00:45.390> own<00:00:45.980> geometrical

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and I'm creating my own geometrical

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.060 
and I'm creating my own geometrical
pattern<00:00:47.430> here<00:00:47.760> Leo<00:00:48.390> elm<00:00:48.690> I'm<00:00:49.110> only<00:00:49.440> stamping

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
pattern here Leo elm I'm only stamping

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.100 
pattern here Leo elm I'm only stamping
these<00:00:50.309> floral<00:00:50.879> images<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.449> black<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.930> white

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
these floral images in black and white

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.040 
these floral images in black and white
and<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.550> wonderful<00:00:54.239> invisible

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
and here I have the wonderful invisible

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
and here I have the wonderful invisible
stencil<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:56.039> just<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.399> piece<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.730> acetate

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
stencil it's just a piece of acetate

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.020 
stencil it's just a piece of acetate
actually<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.960> used<00:00:58.170> my<00:00:58.410> circ<00:00:59.030> circle

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
actually and I used my circ circle

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.450 
actually and I used my circ circle
shapes<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.600> die-cut<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> few<00:01:01.649> circles<00:01:02.039> from<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
shapes and die-cut a few circles from it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.340 
shapes and die-cut a few circles from it
and<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:03.000> use<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> stencil<00:01:03.780> I'm

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and so I can use it as a stencil I'm

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
and so I can use it as a stencil I'm
using<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.580> few<00:01:06.530> distress<00:01:07.530> inks<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.040> I'm<00:01:08.430> simply

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
using a few distress inks and I'm simply

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.469 
using a few distress inks and I'm simply
adding<00:01:09.600> circles<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:11.479> somewhat

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
adding circles to this like somewhat

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.390 
adding circles to this like somewhat
random<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.229> know<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.770> arrange<00:01:14.040> stuff

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
random you know I like to arrange stuff

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.370 
random you know I like to arrange stuff
in<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:15.600> groups<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.650> threes<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:18.380> hopefully

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
in in groups of threes and hopefully

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.320 
in in groups of threes and hopefully
it's<00:01:19.500> pleasing<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> eye<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.150> I'm<00:01:21.299> just

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
it's pleasing to the eye and so I'm just

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.560 
it's pleasing to the eye and so I'm just
arranging<00:01:21.979> geometrical<00:01:22.979> shapes<00:01:23.430> circles<00:01:24.360> on

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
arranging geometrical shapes circles on

arranging geometrical shapes circles on
this<00:01:25.290> symmetrical<00:01:26.250> pattern<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.360> see<00:01:27.720> I'm

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
this symmetrical pattern so you see I'm

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.770 
this symmetrical pattern so you see I'm
I<00:01:28.380> totally<00:01:29.159> should<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.460> aced<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.509> my

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
I totally should have aced you know my

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.140 
I totally should have aced you know my
college<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.619> math<00:01:31.890> classes<00:01:32.189> totally<00:01:32.939> should

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
college and math classes totally should

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.910 
college and math classes totally should
have<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.259> how<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.560> looking

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
have here you can see how it's looking

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
little more artsy but I was just happy

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.649 
little more artsy but I was just happy
to<00:01:40.290> try<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.650> out<00:01:40.920> I'm<00:01:41.220> using<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.060> bubble<00:01:42.390> box
