working<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.080> computer<00:00:37.500> science<00:00:37.920> project

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
working on a computer science project

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.280 
working on a computer science project
for<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.730> my<00:00:38.760> classes<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.630> there's<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.050> bug

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
for one of my classes and there's a bug

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.320 
for one of my classes and there's a bug
in<00:00:40.410> my<00:00:40.440> program<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.370> can't<00:00:41.670> find<00:00:41.970> I

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
in my program that I just can't find I

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.840 
in my program that I just can't find I
make<00:00:42.989> my<00:00:43.170> changes<00:00:43.620> compile<00:00:44.220> it

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
make my changes compile it

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.850 
make my changes compile it
check<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.330> with<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> debugger<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.170> make<00:00:46.620> more

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
check it with the debugger and make more

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.729 
check it with the debugger and make more
changes<00:00:47.040> and<00:00:47.570> it's<00:00:48.570> really<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.900> pain<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.530> takes

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
changes and it's really a pain it takes

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.950 
changes and it's really a pain it takes
so<00:00:49.890> long<00:00:50.160> Wow<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.150> think<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.570> takes<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
so long Wow if you think that takes a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.570 
so long Wow if you think that takes a
long<00:00:52.140> time<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.650> should<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.890> glad<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.460> were

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
long time you should be glad you were

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.939 
long time you should be glad you were
born<00:00:53.850> when<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.090> were<00:00:54.210> from<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.290> hear<00:00:55.590> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
born when you were from what I hear a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.250 
born when you were from what I hear a
long<00:00:56.370> time<00:00:56.610> ago<00:00:56.910> used<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.660> much<00:00:57.989> much

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
long time ago used to be much much

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.010 
long time ago used to be much much
harder<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.739> write<00:00:58.890> programs<00:00:59.750> primitive<00:01:00.750> you

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
harder to write programs primitive you

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.390 
harder to write programs primitive you
mean<00:01:01.170> back<00:01:01.440> when<00:01:01.470> there<00:01:01.800> were<00:01:01.949> no<00:01:02.129> color

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
mean back when there were no color

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.729 
mean back when there were no color
displays<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> stuff<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.809> well<00:01:04.500> yeah

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
displays and stuff like that well yeah

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.530 
displays and stuff like that well yeah
but<00:01:05.010> that's<00:01:05.250> really<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.940> start<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.420> it

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
but that's really just the start of it

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.390 
but that's really just the start of it
I've<00:01:06.750> seen<00:01:06.810> some<00:01:07.229> pictures<00:01:07.440> of<00:01:07.770> old<00:01:07.860> computers

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
I've seen some pictures of old computers

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.090 
I've seen some pictures of old computers
that<00:01:08.580> are<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.970> amazing<00:01:09.690> I<00:01:09.870> wish<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.830> had<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> way

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
that are just amazing I wish I had a way

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.310 
that are just amazing I wish I had a way
to<00:01:11.159> show<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.550> wait<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.300> know<00:01:12.600> I've<00:01:13.050> been

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
to show you wait I know I've been

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.750 
to show you wait I know I've been
working<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.710> writing<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> program<00:01:14.580> that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
working on writing a program that

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.000 
working on writing a program that
controls<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.210> holodeck<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:16.290> could<00:01:16.500> use<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
controls a holodeck we could use it to

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.100 
controls a holodeck we could use it to
go<00:01:17.130> back<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> past<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.450> look<00:01:18.720> at<00:01:18.870> some<00:01:19.020> of

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
go back in the past and look at some of

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.539 
go back in the past and look at some of
those<00:01:19.200> old<00:01:19.350> computers<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.100> could<00:01:20.310> show<00:01:20.520> you

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
those old computers so I could show you

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.910 
those old computers so I could show you
what<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.000> was<00:01:21.180> really<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.890> want

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
what it was really like then do you want

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.940 
what it was really like then do you want
to<00:01:23.070> give<00:01:23.190> it<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.340> try<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.880> holodeck<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:25.440> on<00:01:25.590> Star

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
to give it a try a holodeck like on Star

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:40.570 
to give it a try a holodeck like on Star
Trek<00:01:26.060> sure<00:01:27.060> I'll<00:01:27.210> try<00:01:27.360> that

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.530 

okay<00:01:41.580> well<00:01:41.790> we're<00:01:41.940> going<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.390> get

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
okay well we're going to have to get

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.750 
okay well we're going to have to get
this<00:01:42.660> thing<00:01:42.930> set<00:01:43.260> over<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.490> setting

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
this thing set over here on this setting

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.780 
this thing set over here on this setting
we<00:01:45.030> get<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.330> set<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.840> type<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.430> scene<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.580> want

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
we get to set the type of scene we want

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.430 
we get to set the type of scene we want
to<00:01:47.910> view<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.330> see<00:01:48.510> a<00:01:48.540> sports<00:01:48.930> arena<00:01:49.080> a

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
to view we can see a sports arena a

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.080 
to view we can see a sports arena a
computer<00:01:49.980> lab<00:01:50.160> that's<00:01:50.490> probably<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:50.940> we

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
computer lab that's probably what we

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.520 
computer lab that's probably what we
want<00:01:51.300> not<00:01:51.510> a<00:01:51.540> concert<00:01:52.020> home

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
want not a concert home

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.680 
want not a concert home
so<00:01:52.860> I'll<00:01:52.950> set<00:01:53.190> computer<00:01:53.670> lab<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.120> then<00:01:54.540> this

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
so I'll set computer lab and then this

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.510 
so I'll set computer lab and then this
slider<00:01:55.110> unfortunately<00:01:56.010> I<00:01:56.040> haven't<00:01:56.250> had<00:01:56.490> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
slider unfortunately I haven't had a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.070 
slider unfortunately I haven't had a
chance<00:01:56.730> to<00:01:56.910> calibrate<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.570> yet<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:57.960> this

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
chance to calibrate it yet but this

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.170 
chance to calibrate it yet but this
controls<00:01:58.530> how<00:01:58.800> far<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.280> future<00:01:59.340> or<00:01:59.910> past

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
controls how far in the future or past

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.630 
controls how far in the future or past
we<00:02:00.480> go<00:02:00.690> let's<00:02:01.380> go<00:02:01.530> back<00:02:01.740> about<00:02:02.010> this<00:02:02.310> far<00:02:02.610> I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
we go let's go back about this far I

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.880 
we go let's go back about this far I
hope<00:02:03.180> that's<00:02:03.480> right<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.140> then<00:02:04.650> we'll<00:02:04.740> get

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
hope that's right and then we'll get

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.680 
hope that's right and then we'll get
things<00:02:05.130> started<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.760> this<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.300> in<00:02:06.420> ten

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
things started like this and in ten

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:21.550 
things started like this and in ten
seconds<00:02:07.140> we'll<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.380> ready<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.160> scene

loud<00:02:41.130> what<00:02:41.430> kind<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.700> computer<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.510> it's<00:02:43.170> a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
loud what kind of computer is it it's a

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.160 
loud what kind of computer is it it's a
PDP<00:02:43.530> 1110<00:02:44.220> Wow<00:02:45.150> how<00:02:45.330> much<00:02:45.480> memory<00:02:45.720> does<00:02:45.989> it

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
PDP 1110 Wow how much memory does it

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.320 
PDP 1110 Wow how much memory does it
have<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.860> standard<00:02:47.220> model<00:02:47.520> comes<00:02:47.700> with<00:02:47.910> 16

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
have the standard model comes with 16

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.790 
have the standard model comes with 16
but<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:48.600> decided<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.110> go<00:02:49.200> with<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.440> extra

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
but we decided to go with the extra

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.949 
but we decided to go with the extra
money<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.100> get<00:02:50.220> 32<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:51.000> kind<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.660> doubt<00:02:51.780> if

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
money and get 32 I kind of doubt if

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.210 
money and get 32 I kind of doubt if
we'll<00:02:52.020> ever<00:02:52.200> need<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.470> much<00:02:52.800> but<00:02:52.980> we<00:02:53.070> thought

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
we'll ever need that much but we thought

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.100 
we'll ever need that much but we thought
miles<00:02:53.520> we'll<00:02:53.670> go<00:02:53.790> for<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.420> case<00:02:54.480> you

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
miles we'll go for it just in case you

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.050 
miles we'll go for it just in case you

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.340 
o3 can hold 40 megabytes
wow<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.450> can't<00:03:15.690> imagine<00:03:15.750> why<00:03:16.170> we'd

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
wow that I just can't imagine why we'd

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.470 
wow that I just can't imagine why we'd
ever<00:03:16.440> need<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.890> amount<00:03:17.220> but<00:03:17.489> anyway<00:03:18.239> we

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
ever need that amount but anyway we

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.390 
ever need that amount but anyway we
couldn't<00:03:18.780> afford<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.230> cost<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.680> an<00:03:19.800> RPO<00:03:20.070> three

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
couldn't afford the cost of an RPO three

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.920 
couldn't afford the cost of an RPO three
so<00:03:20.640> we<00:03:20.790> didn't<00:03:20.940> even<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.120> any<00:03:21.300> disk<00:03:21.690> drives

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
so we didn't even have any disk drives

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.080 
so we didn't even have any disk drives
on<00:03:22.080> this<00:03:22.230> computer<00:03:22.530> what<00:03:23.190> OS<00:03:23.489> does<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.910> have

on this computer what OS does it have

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.479 
on this computer what OS does it have

panel<00:04:04.830> here<00:04:05.190> is<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:05.490> the<00:04:05.670> switches<00:04:06.450> are<00:04:06.690> kind

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
panel here is that the switches are kind

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.560 
panel here is that the switches are kind
of<00:04:07.140> grouped<00:04:07.470> in<00:04:07.830> groups<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:09.000> three<00:04:09.300> with<00:04:09.480> the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
of grouped in groups of three with the

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.330 
of grouped in groups of three with the
colors<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.530> each<00:04:10.710> group<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.130> three

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
colors and so each group of three

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.370 
colors and so each group of three
switches<00:04:11.640> represents<00:04:12.330> one<00:04:12.510> octal<00:04:12.900> digit<00:04:13.260> a

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
switches represents one octal digit a

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.590 
switches represents one octal digit a
switch<00:04:13.950> up<00:04:14.160> is<00:04:14.430> going<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.760> mean<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:14.940> one<00:04:15.180> switch

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
switch up is going to mean a one switch

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.930 
switch up is going to mean a one switch
down<00:04:15.810> is<00:04:16.080> going<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.380> mean<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.530> zero<00:04:16.830> so<00:04:17.580> when<00:04:17.820> we

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
down is going to mean a zero so when we

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.009 
down is going to mean a zero so when we
start<00:04:18.239> you're<00:04:18.420> actually<00:04:18.630> I'll<00:04:18.690> give<00:04:18.810> this<00:04:18.959> to

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
start you're actually I'll give this to

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.650 
start you're actually I'll give this to
you<00:04:19.200> so<00:04:19.650> those<00:04:20.310> are<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.580> addresses<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.180> then

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
you so those are the addresses and then

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.970 
you so those are the addresses and then
those<00:04:21.870> are<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.049> contents<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.770> first

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
those are the contents so the first

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.380 
those are the contents so the first
thing<00:04:23.130> we<00:04:23.250> have<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.400> do<00:04:23.640> is<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.880> put<00:04:24.060> in<00:04:24.090> the

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
thing we have to do is to put in the

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.030 
thing we have to do is to put in the
address<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:24.960> first<00:04:24.990> instruction<00:04:25.350> which

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
address of the first instruction which

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.750 
address of the first instruction which
is<00:04:26.250> 1,000<00:04:26.910> so<00:04:27.060> we<00:04:27.150> do<00:04:27.300> zero<00:04:27.680> zero<00:04:28.680> one<00:04:29.490> zero

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
is 1,000 so we do zero zero one zero

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.890 
is 1,000 so we do zero zero one zero
zero<00:04:30.450> zero<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.470> we<00:04:32.220> then<00:04:32.490> do<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:32.850> load<00:04:33.180> load

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
zero zero and we then do a load load

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.020 
zero zero and we then do a load load
address<00:04:34.280> okay<00:04:35.280> so<00:04:35.340> that<00:04:35.520> tells<00:04:35.730> us<00:04:35.880> where

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
address okay so that tells us where

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.340 
address okay so that tells us where
we're<00:04:36.120> going<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.300> start<00:04:36.510> and<00:04:36.660> now<00:04:37.110> we'll<00:04:37.260> have

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
we're going to start and now we'll have

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.810 
we're going to start and now we'll have
to<00:04:37.470> put<00:04:37.620> in<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.830> content<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:38.520> why<00:04:38.640> don't<00:04:38.760> you

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
to put in the content so why don't you

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.870 
to put in the content so why don't you
read<00:04:39.030> that<00:04:39.180> to<00:04:39.390> me<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:39.690> oh<00:04:39.990> four<00:04:40.320> -<00:04:40.620> okay<00:04:41.190> zero

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
read that to me the oh four - okay zero

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.080 
read that to me the oh four - okay zero
four<00:04:42.240> two<00:04:42.320> five<00:04:43.320> one<00:04:43.740> zero<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.460> then<00:04:44.820> we<00:04:44.940> hit

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
four two five one zero and then we hit

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.940 
four two five one zero and then we hit
this<00:04:45.240> deposit<00:04:45.630> switch<00:04:46.080> which<00:04:46.290> puts<00:04:46.590> that<00:04:46.680> into

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
this deposit switch which puts that into

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.410 
this deposit switch which puts that into
memory<00:04:47.220> okay<00:04:47.430> now<00:04:47.520> just<00:04:47.760> read<00:04:47.970> me<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.210> next

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
memory okay now just read me the next

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.290 
memory okay now just read me the next
one<00:04:48.600> zero<00:04:49.230> four<00:04:49.590> six<00:04:50.540> one<00:04:51.540> one<00:04:51.570> four<00:04:52.400> okay<00:04:53.400> but

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
one zero four six one one four okay but

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.260 
one zero four six one one four okay but
then<00:04:54.420> the<00:04:54.540> switch<00:04:54.750> isn't<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:55.080> deposit<00:04:55.530> okay

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
then the switch isn't it deposit okay

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.720 
then the switch isn't it deposit okay
zero<00:04:57.270> two<00:04:57.419> zero<00:04:57.990> one<00:04:58.490> one<00:04:59.490> seven<00:05:01.160> okay<00:05:02.190> okay

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
zero two zero one one seven okay okay

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.659 
zero two zero one one seven okay okay
zero<00:05:03.390> zeros<00:05:03.810> over<00:05:03.990> there

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
zero zeros over there

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.140 
zero zeros over there
okay<00:05:06.409> programs<00:05:07.409> in<00:05:07.650> Wow<00:05:08.219> that's<00:05:08.580> kind<00:05:08.819> of<00:05:08.909> fun

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
okay programs in Wow that's kind of fun

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.899 
okay programs in Wow that's kind of fun
yeah<00:05:10.139> it<00:05:10.259> is<00:05:10.349> pretty<00:05:10.590> neat<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:10.979> once<00:05:11.610> we<00:05:11.759> have

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
yeah it is pretty neat and once we have

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.670 
yeah it is pretty neat and once we have
it<00:05:12.030> loaded<00:05:12.210> into<00:05:12.419> memory<00:05:12.659> now<00:05:13.110> what<00:05:13.259> we<00:05:13.379> can<00:05:13.560> do

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
it loaded into memory now what we can do

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.890 
it loaded into memory now what we can do
if<00:05:13.830> you<00:05:13.949> look<00:05:14.069> at<00:05:14.219> the<00:05:14.400> sheet<00:05:15.030> here<00:05:15.240> address

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
if you look at the sheet here address

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.010 
if you look at the sheet here address
120<00:05:16.560> 1020<00:05:17.219> is<00:05:17.430> a<00:05:17.569> starting<00:05:18.569> address<00:05:18.659> of<00:05:18.960> the

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
120 1020 is a starting address of the

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.860 
120 1020 is a starting address of the
program<00:05:19.409> so<00:05:19.590> we'll<00:05:19.680> toggle<00:05:19.919> in<00:05:20.280> 10<00:05:21.439> 2000<00:05:23.870> 102

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
program so we'll toggle in 10 2000 102

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.770 
program so we'll toggle in 10 2000 102
Oh<00:05:25.039> hit<00:05:26.039> load<00:05:26.280> address<00:05:26.460> halt<00:05:27.210> up<00:05:27.449> and<00:05:27.689> then

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
Oh hit load address halt up and then

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.180 
Oh hit load address halt up and then
when<00:05:27.900> we<00:05:27.960> hit<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.169> start<00:05:28.229> button<00:05:28.729> it<00:05:29.729> executes
