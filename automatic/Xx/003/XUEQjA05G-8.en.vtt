that's exactly what we need well why not
just<00:03:23.550> mark<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.300> out<00:03:24.450> on<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:25.050> clip<00:03:25.350> we've

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
turning on for my users when they

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.740 
turning on for my users when they

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
realized that they could go sit down

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.320 
realized that they could go sit down

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
to view things at my leisure online a

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.910 
to view things at my leisure online a
lot<00:04:06.240> of<00:04:06.660> our<00:04:06.810> executives<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.860> their

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
lot of our executives and their

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.280 
lot of our executives and their
assistants<00:04:08.520> have<00:04:08.700> been<00:04:08.850> amazed<00:04:09.270> at<00:04:09.780> how<00:04:09.900> fast

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
assistants have been amazed at how fast

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.800 
assistants have been amazed at how fast
they<00:04:10.650> can<00:04:10.710> call<00:04:11.100> down<00:04:11.570> thinking<00:04:12.570> that<00:04:12.720> it

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
they can call down thinking that it

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.300 
they can call down thinking that it
might<00:04:12.840> be<00:04:12.990> two<00:04:13.350> or<00:04:13.470> three<00:04:13.680> days<00:04:13.710> to<00:04:14.160> get

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
might be two or three days to get

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.590 
might be two or three days to get
something<00:04:14.850> and<00:04:14.910> then<00:04:15.030> we'll<00:04:15.150> call<00:04:15.300> them<00:04:15.390> back

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
something and then we'll call them back

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.630 
something and then we'll call them back
10<00:04:15.810> minutes<00:04:15.840> later<00:04:16.230> here<00:04:16.980> it<00:04:17.100> is<00:04:17.130> where<00:04:17.489> would

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
10 minutes later here it is where would

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.150 
10 minutes later here it is where would
you<00:04:17.730> like<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:19.310> yes<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.760> can<00:04:21.230> buy<00:04:22.230> disparate

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
you like it yes you can buy disparate

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.490 
you like it yes you can buy disparate
systems<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:24.210> put<00:04:24.570> these<00:04:24.810> things<00:04:25.110> together

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
systems and put these things together

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.140 
systems and put these things together
yourself<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:27.590> eventually<00:04:28.590> make<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.700> work<00:04:29.910> the

a lot of headache and time reinventing

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.010 
a lot of headache and time reinventing
the<00:04:40.930> wheel<00:04:41.310> what<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:42.340> see<00:04:42.730> in<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:42.970> harmonic<00:04:43.570> is
