00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
windows down lower change the roof for

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.210 
windows down lower change the roof for
you<00:01:50.060> an<00:01:50.119> extra<00:01:50.420> fireplaces<00:01:51.020> things<00:01:51.860> like<00:01:52.070> that

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
you an extra fireplaces things like that

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.380 
you an extra fireplaces things like that
but<00:01:52.400> it's<00:01:52.550> definitely<00:01:52.759> based<00:01:53.180> on<00:01:53.420> us

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
but it's definitely based on us

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.610 
but it's definitely based on us
just<00:01:56.390> about<00:01:56.630> I<00:01:56.900> think<00:01:56.960> that's<00:01:57.230> probably<00:01:57.380> about

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
just about I think that's probably about

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.310 
just about I think that's probably about
why<00:01:57.950> travelpod<00:01:58.520> sold<00:01:58.850> here<00:01:59.860> near<00:02:00.860> there
