00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 before they say something yes I already played the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.750
 game with the story that came out the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.639
 filtered campaign a friend bought it and I 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.099
 invited to play it and I said why not 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.139
 it's the worst that can happen so without 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.360
 more rodeos let's start criticizing a 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.010
 very expected game by me and by a great 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.010
 number of fans of this same 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.750
 Y 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.689
 bailon 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.070
 jairo 4 a game developed by 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.960
 microsoft studios and 343 industries al 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.120
 see the first cinematic of the game 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.340
 I was impressed as the characters 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.470
 they look more real than one or at least 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.120
 it was already the following kinematics for 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.460
 start the level went down a bit 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.990
 Looking like a normal game does not go down 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.970
 a lot but enough to 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.220
 distinguish it by starting to play the 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.290
 controls like every new game were 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.300
 a little modified but nothing that a 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.590
 button settings do not fix 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.800
 because the option of 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.570
 recognition on the buttons and if as 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.640
 I expected you will not be able to sit down and see 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.500
 every cinematic because now he asks you to 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.899
 interact with her telling you what 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.210
 buttons press the sound of weapons 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.490
 It was very good except for some 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.800
 like the gun that was heard as if 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.399
 hit a plastic after finishing 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.380
 the second mission congratulated 343 because 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.570
 after finishing that mission I felt 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.399
 as if he were playing and fighting it 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.979
 in ball I felt like the first time 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.080
 I played and I really congratulate you no longer 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.360
 are the typical enemies that you could 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.530
 go running towards them shooting at 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.720
 how crazy now 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.060
 much if the tactics to which you are 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.010
 accustomed will have changed apart from 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.560
 that now are the promises that are 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.630
 more difficult and montoneros and some are 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.850
 capable of killing you with a cut so 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.100
 you will have to pay attention to everything and to 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.179
 those who saw the gameplay of the e3 well 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.340
 forget about him 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.319
 that mission is very changed the only thing 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.270
 that retains the same is that you are in the 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.760
 jungle and you have to go to infinity to 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.770
 save those who were in it the band 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.900
 So it is not expected 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.090
 something more epic when you listen to them in 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.890
 youtube you hear little mother but 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.110
 when you hear them in the game as not 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.450
 combine the truth I still prefer the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.519
 work of martin or 'donnell I the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.560
 Game cinematics look very good 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.870
 a little hollywoodenses in certain 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.420
 Sometimes it looks like an action movie 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.430
 here I will make a point and separate at night and 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.530
 combat him in dust the last mission is 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.220
 grab a garden and run away in 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.230
 halo 3 the same in halo 3 odst well something 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.390
 seemed and I thought will continue with the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.850
 Yes tradition did and in two 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.010
 occasions one in the first missions and 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.110
 the other in the penultimate mission I will not say 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.280
 nothing for you to be so excited 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.740
 like me in me 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.750
 it was the best part of the game I'll just say 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.630
 which is great to play two and 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.810
 make a career I will only say that xd 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.090
 another thing is that 343 said that there would be 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.520
 Sentimental theme between cortana and the boss 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.620
 teacher and when I was watching the last 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.780
 mission I will not give spoilers I will just say something 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.700
 that I thought when I saw the cinematic I 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.709
 I thought Cortana would give a kiss 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.540
 master chief I swear they have to 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.120
 see it for yourselves and tell me that 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.400
 no and the truth in the last mission I thought 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.769
 that would be an epic fight like in halo 2 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.690
 but they left me with the desire in fact 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.790
 the story is not very good either 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.709
 story goes very fast so 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.780
 that in each mission you are in localities 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.150
 different requiem levels are 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.190
 very short the campaign itself is a bit 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.260
 longer than I left it and the three when 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.680
 I played it took five hours to finish 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.670
 the campaign I swear 343 left me with 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.160
 want more 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.900
 I hope Jairo 5 is better if it is that 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.060
 they do it but the truth was made 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.950
 much celebration for what is about the 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.260
 multiplayer I did not know anything because it 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.660
 occupies a second disk to install the 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.819
 maps which we did not have hahaha that 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.890
 go through buy pirate xd 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.079
 another thing is that you have several books by 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.150
 example there is a part where the soil 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.159
 it starts to fall and I did not notice and 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.139
 I fell but I did not die and I came to an area 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.269
 dark and from there I did not keep falling and 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:19.250
 I turned down and there was nothing that 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.289
 it was clear that it was not a problem 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.150
 I had a rocket backpack so I did not have to 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.979
 restart the control point when 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.259
 come out the game there will be a million 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.360
 updates to patch the game x 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:32.449
 of good to finish this I will give you a 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.849
 proper qualification that would be 85 like this 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.099
 It's an 8.5 I think is the most appropriate 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.349
 I can give you the truth I expected 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.360
 something else the most remarkable thing was the end 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.880
 has a good ending as I said very 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.949
 sentimental and unfortunately very sad 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.590
 well this would be all for criticism 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.780
 comment like the video if you are sexy 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.130
 and subscribe if I am jericho 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.130
 saying goodbye 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.880
 and
