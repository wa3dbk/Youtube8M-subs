00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:24.349
 and and that the minecraft rip and today I go 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.029
 review of solar survival but before 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.149
 start with her I will give you a 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.009
 recommendation and is that the 1.4 point 5 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.050
 there is a bug that does not allow us to convert 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.180
 maps and this map needs to be 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.280
 converted therefore I recommend you 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.219
 put the 1.3 point 2 as you see there 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.690
 top left is worth and after 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.929
 that you have turned into the map 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.190
 you just put in the 1.45 or the 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.829
 version that you want and you are going to play 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.399
 quietly this incredible map that 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.659
 is a ctm a complete of monument and of 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.159
 that goes a complete monument in 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.499
 complete the monument because we have a 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.420
 monument next to spam is worth 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:01.879
 we have to fill in the things that 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.949
 ask us in this case blocks of wool and 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.550
 some blocks of precious materials 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:12.350
 like metal or diamond or some other and by 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.750
 behind we have very very rich challenges 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.630
 pretty interesting challenges 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.060
 complicated for more fun 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.219
 Well, solar survival is like 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.890
 our solar system as such but in 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:27.079
 minecraft is very entertaining worth is 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.020
 pretty complicated it's worth a map of 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:32.600
 one level a bit higher because 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.329
 has edited spammers there are quite 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.000
 good stamps is complicated and as 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.909
 you see here we are seeing the sun is worth and 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.220
 it's pretty cool, you know that 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.490
 It has different dimensions is also worth 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.380
 the leader is edited is not going to go 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.450
 nothing flattered is worth everything is empty 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.580
 for which you put in pharr and you can 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.729
 see it perfectly I will not spend it 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.369
 beyond this planet because if you do not 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.959
 I'm going to support too much but you have good 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.909
 the link in the description that very many 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:06.979
 what you want is the link and nothing 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.530
 truth is that I would be quite excited 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.720
 I'll try it 6 because it's not easy 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.150
 As you can see here you are watching Saturn 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.819
 which is totally of mother stone a 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.819
 very very troll planet 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.239
 and those guys very many do not think that 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.579
 You can overcome this map because it is very 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.739
 complicated but if you manage to get to the 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.799
 last wool and I think he knows 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.109
 perfectly what is the last one so I 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.269
 you see a picture on my twitter and then - 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.819
 vÃ©lez but nothing of your items or of 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.079
 tricks or things like that is totally 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.150
 legal 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.219
 to see if you are able to arrive so 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.169
 far like me or even overcome some 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:48.499
 challenge around here but nothing guys 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:51.469
 tell you that it is an incredible map worth and 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:53.569
 tell you a little thing that if you believe more 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.310
 powerful that I better that all that 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.900
 you want or I just want to spend it 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.449
 to better what I've been through 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.250
 playing this map is worth and making a 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:04.790
 series you will have another link in the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.180
 description that is the map the same map 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.219
 but for nazas it's worth it and I'm sorry for 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.469
 the insult but it is a map for threats 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.900
 because it 's a lot more complicated 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:16.400
 it's a lot harder I played the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.680
 normal version but you have a version 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.060
 much more complicated and as you see 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.439
 when the sun goes down at night 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.480
 rival creates a quite environment 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:25.970
 pretty with all the stars 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.390
 decorative around good guys up 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.519
 here the solar survival review a map 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.900
 amazing, there's a lot more 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.290
 planets for there and other dimensions 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.129
 It is quite long and gives a lot of play and a 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.860
 guys I hope you liked it and I'll 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.020
 other 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.390
 this is a lie, that is, you are 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.540
 a liar for god do not you go back to me 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.540
