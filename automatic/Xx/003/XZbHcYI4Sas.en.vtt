I happen to be a cinnamon bun Finn
obviously<00:00:29.820> yeah<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> small<00:00:30.480> company

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
obviously yeah this is a small company

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.759 
obviously yeah this is a small company
you<00:00:30.900> probably<00:00:30.960> never<00:00:31.320> heard<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.619> them<00:00:31.710> before

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
you probably never heard of them before

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.800 
you probably never heard of them before
I'd<00:00:32.310> never<00:00:32.610> heard<00:00:32.820> them<00:00:33.000> before<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.420> Europa

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
I'd never heard them before the Europa

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.810 
I'd never heard them before the Europa
but<00:00:34.110> they<00:00:34.530> give<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.710> these<00:00:34.920> samples<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.640> we

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
but they give you these samples and we

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.120 
but they give you these samples and we
are<00:00:35.940> big<00:00:36.090> fans<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.480> pure<00:00:36.750> whey<00:00:36.870> isolates<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.650> get

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
are big fans of pure whey isolates I get

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.550 
are big fans of pure whey isolates I get
a<00:00:38.160> lot<00:00:38.370> less<00:00:38.400> gas<00:00:38.820> issues<00:00:39.390> overall<00:00:40.350> less

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
a lot less gas issues overall less

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.250 
a lot less gas issues overall less
bloating<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.040> less<00:00:41.160> cramping<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:43.050> pure

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
bloating and less cramping so the pure

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.800 
bloating and less cramping so the pure
isolate<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:44.130> to<00:00:44.270> basically<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
isolate is going to basically you have a

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.020 
isolate is going to basically you have a
higher<00:00:46.170> filtration<00:00:46.950> than<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.460> whey<00:00:47.640> protein

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
higher filtration than a whey protein

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.790 
higher filtration than a whey protein
concentrate<00:00:48.060> they<00:00:48.960> filter<00:00:49.320> out<00:00:49.380> more<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.650> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
concentrate they filter out more of the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.730 
concentrate they filter out more of the
lactose<00:00:50.010> milk<00:00:50.730> sugars<00:00:51.150> so<00:00:51.450> pure<00:00:52.260> isolate

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
lactose milk sugars so pure isolate

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.710 
lactose milk sugars so pure isolate
sometimes<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.550> tastes<00:00:53.760> worse<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.330> we're

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
sometimes it tastes worse so that we're

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.340 
sometimes it tastes worse so that we're
going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> find<00:00:55.110> out<00:00:56.870> we're<00:00:57.870> mixing<00:00:57.990> with<00:00:58.230> 8

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
going to find out we're mixing with 8

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.630 
going to find out we're mixing with 8
ounces<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.920> water<00:00:59.480> here<00:01:00.480> which<00:01:00.900> I<00:01:01.530> rarely<00:01:02.220> see

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
ounces of water here which I rarely see

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.530 
ounces of water here which I rarely see
a<00:01:02.670> protein<00:01:03.240> in<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.199> kind<00:01:04.410> of<00:01:04.500> container

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
a protein in this kind of container

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.180 
a protein in this kind of container
business<00:01:06.540> small<00:01:06.750> companies<00:01:07.200> though<00:01:07.380> given

that this bear is delicious well just
like<00:01:16.200> most<00:01:16.380> isolates<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.040> mixes<00:01:17.340> very<00:01:17.370> easily

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
like most isolates it mixes very easily

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.940 
like most isolates it mixes very easily
yeah<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.720> actually<00:01:18.810> pretty<00:01:18.990> thin<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.770> says

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
yeah it's actually pretty thin it says

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.500 
yeah it's actually pretty thin it says
it<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.190> sisses<00:01:20.550> that's<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:20.970> went<00:01:21.090> with

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
it on sisses that's what we went with

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.620 
it on sisses that's what we went with
I<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.990> SS<00:01:22.290> let's<00:01:23.100> give<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.340> go<00:01:26.630> into

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
I like it it SS let's give it a go into

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.450 
I like it it SS let's give it a go into
flour<00:01:27.810> chocolate<00:01:27.960> that's<00:01:28.409> not<00:01:28.530> bad<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.310> too

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
flour chocolate that's not bad it is too

flour chocolate that's not bad it is too
thin<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.820> would<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.060> done<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.390> four<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.990> six

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
outs of the water do I touch gritty

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.620 
outs of the water do I touch gritty
I'm<00:01:35.130> not<00:01:35.310> getting<00:01:35.610> gritty<00:01:35.820> online<00:01:36.210> I'm<00:01:36.479> just

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
a cinnamon bun let me yeah okay set up

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.480 
a cinnamon bun let me yeah okay set up
and<00:01:58.640> I'm<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:58.910> fan<00:01:59.090> overall<00:01:59.840> um<00:02:00.160> to<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.250> team<00:02:01.400> we

and I'm a fan overall um to the team we

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.920 
and I'm a fan overall um to the team we
need<00:02:01.550> to<00:02:01.700> bear<00:02:01.850> I<00:02:02.030> would<00:02:02.150> recommend<00:02:02.600> actually

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
need to bear I would recommend actually

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.780 
need to bear I would recommend actually
less<00:02:03.290> water<00:02:03.500> with<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:03.830> weight<00:02:04.340> ISIL<00:02:04.700> is

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
less water with this weight ISIL is

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.330 
less water with this weight ISIL is
typically<00:02:05.479> are<00:02:05.990> like<00:02:06.320> more<00:02:06.440> watery<00:02:06.860> as<00:02:07.040> it<00:02:07.220> is

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
typically are like more watery as it is

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.680 
typically are like more watery as it is
they're<00:02:07.670> not<00:02:07.850> they're<00:02:08.090> not<00:02:08.119> as<00:02:08.330> thick<00:02:08.539> as<00:02:08.660> a

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
they're not they're not as thick as a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.229 
they're not they're not as thick as a
lot<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:08.929> concentrates<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:09.700> with<00:02:10.700> less<00:02:10.850> water<00:02:11.090> I

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
lot of concentrates so with less water I

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.470 
lot of concentrates so with less water I
yeah<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.570> approve<00:02:12.230> this<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:13.150> don't<00:02:14.150> want<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.330> lot

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
yeah I approve this I don't want a lot

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.180 
yeah I approve this I don't want a lot
of<00:02:14.600> nonsense<00:02:14.959> in<00:02:15.140> my<00:02:15.170> throat<00:02:15.470> in<00:02:15.650> my<00:02:15.680> protein

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
of nonsense in my throat in my protein

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.710 
of nonsense in my throat in my protein
you<00:02:16.520> know<00:02:16.580> it's<00:02:16.730> best<00:02:16.880> if<00:02:17.030> I'm<00:02:17.120> using<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:17.480> as<00:02:17.690> a

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
you know it's best if I'm using it as a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.560 
you know it's best if I'm using it as a
snack<00:02:17.900> or<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.709> quick<00:02:19.300> post-workout<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.360> I'm

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
snack or a quick post-workout and I'm

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.720 
snack or a quick post-workout and I'm
keeping<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.930> carbs<00:02:21.170> low<00:02:21.350> I'm<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.370> fan<00:02:22.520> of<00:02:22.550> this

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
keeping the carbs low I'm a fan of this

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.979 
keeping the carbs low I'm a fan of this
myself<00:02:23.120> what<00:02:23.209> do<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.330> think<00:02:23.480> white<00:02:23.570> chocolate

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
myself what do you think white chocolate

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.600 
myself what do you think white chocolate
it's<00:02:24.260> it's<00:02:24.620> good<00:02:24.770> I<00:02:24.800> mean<00:02:24.920> both<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.190> flavors

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
it's it's good I mean both the flavors

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.330 
it's it's good I mean both the flavors
are<00:02:25.730> really<00:02:25.760> good<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.900> like<00:02:27.530> Mike<00:02:27.709> said<00:02:27.950> I'm<00:02:28.280> a

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
are really good and like Mike said I'm a

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.729 
are really good and like Mike said I'm a
nice<00:02:28.610> lip<00:02:28.910> fan<00:02:29.150> I've<00:02:29.450> been<00:02:30.260> jacked<00:02:30.500> up<00:02:30.680> a

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
nice lip fan I've been jacked up a

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:31.990 
nice lip fan I've been jacked up a
little<00:02:30.890> too<00:02:31.010> much<00:02:31.190> on<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.430> concentrate

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
little too much on the concentrate

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.420 
little too much on the concentrate
sometimes<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.680> pure<00:02:33.920> ice<00:02:34.100> would

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
sometimes so the pure ice would

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.470 
sometimes so the pure ice would
definitely<00:02:34.910> good<00:02:35.750> stuff<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:37.209> like<00:02:38.209> that<00:02:38.360> is

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
definitely good stuff I like that is

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.970 
definitely good stuff I like that is
creative<00:02:38.870> flavor<00:02:39.110> too<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:39.680> know<00:02:39.769> II<00:02:39.830> mean

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
creative flavor too you know II mean

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.160 
creative flavor too you know II mean
it's<00:02:40.100> not<00:02:40.220> just<00:02:40.400> plain<00:02:40.730> plain<00:02:41.630> chocolate<00:02:41.840> yeah

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
it's not just plain plain chocolate yeah

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.750 
it's not just plain plain chocolate yeah
they<00:02:42.290> gave<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.620> they<00:02:42.739> give<00:02:42.890> us<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.010> good<00:02:43.190> one<00:02:43.340> so

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
they gave it they give us a good one so

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.699 
they gave it they give us a good one so
we<00:02:43.880> always<00:02:44.000> cool<00:02:44.269> about<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:44.600> is<00:02:44.930> with<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> pure

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
we always cool about this is with a pure

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.440 
we always cool about this is with a pure
isolate<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.220> have<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.640> more<00:02:46.850> filtration

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
isolate you have that more filtration

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.060 
isolate you have that more filtration
you're<00:02:47.570> getting<00:02:47.750> more<00:02:47.900> more<00:02:48.260> protein<00:02:48.799> per

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
you're getting more more protein per

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.210 
you're getting more more protein per
like<00:02:49.640> scoop<00:02:50.120> per<00:02:51.110> Mille<00:02:51.350> gram<00:02:51.650> with<00:02:51.830> products

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
like scoop per Mille gram with products

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.250 
like scoop per Mille gram with products
so<00:02:52.340> for<00:02:52.579> instance<00:02:52.910> there's<00:02:53.360> like<00:02:53.570> 30<00:02:53.810> grams<00:02:54.079> in

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
so for instance there's like 30 grams in

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.410 
so for instance there's like 30 grams in
a<00:02:54.320> scoop<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.860> 25<00:02:55.519> of<00:02:55.730> those<00:02:55.820> grams<00:02:56.180> are

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
a scoop and 25 of those grams are

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.470 
a scoop and 25 of those grams are
protein<00:02:57.019> no<00:02:57.440> nonsense<00:02:57.769> amino<00:02:58.220> acids<00:02:58.700> oh<00:02:58.880> yeah

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
protein no nonsense amino acids oh yeah

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.000 
protein no nonsense amino acids oh yeah
I'm<00:02:59.840> having<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.260> product<00:03:00.440> it's<00:03:00.709> gonna<00:03:00.799> come

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
I'm having the product it's gonna come

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.650 
I'm having the product it's gonna come
down<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.280> price<00:03:01.400> for<00:03:01.700> me<00:03:01.820> but<00:03:02.299> with<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.450> pure

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
down to price for me but with a pure

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.120 
down to price for me but with a pure
isolate<00:03:03.019> it's<00:03:03.170> typically<00:03:03.530> more<00:03:04.070> expensive

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
isolate it's typically more expensive

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.460 
isolate it's typically more expensive
but<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.820> do<00:03:04.970> get<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.299> higher<00:03:05.450> density<00:03:05.989> these

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
but you do get that higher density these

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.930 
but you do get that higher density these
taste<00:03:06.709> pretty<00:03:06.890> good<00:03:06.980> just<00:03:07.519> wants<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.790> get<00:03:07.910> a
