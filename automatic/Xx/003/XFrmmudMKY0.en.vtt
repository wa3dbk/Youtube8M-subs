future<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:09.750> don't<00:04:10.020> forget<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:10.620> guys<00:04:11.510> for

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
future so don't forget that guys for

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.970 
future so don't forget that guys for
this<00:04:12.600> first<00:04:12.840> example<00:04:13.320> I'm<00:04:13.440> going<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.650> use<00:04:13.860> the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
this first example I'm going to use the

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.220 
this first example I'm going to use the
metronome<00:04:14.280> with<00:04:14.910> just<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.180> basic<00:04:15.330> clean<00:04:15.840> signed

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
metronome with just a basic clean signed

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:42.110 
metronome with just a basic clean signed
here<00:04:16.739> we<00:04:16.830> go<00:04:40.190> for<00:04:41.190> this<00:04:41.310> example<00:04:41.670> I'm<00:04:41.910> going<00:04:42.060> to

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
here we go for this example I'm going to

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.000 
here we go for this example I'm going to
use<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:42.300> blue<00:04:42.600> setting<00:04:43.230> on<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.530> rhythm<00:04:43.770> guide

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
use a blue setting on the rhythm guide

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.280 
use a blue setting on the rhythm guide
and<00:04:44.370> we're<00:04:44.640> going<00:04:44.790> to<00:04:44.820> start<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.870> pattern

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
and we're going to start the pattern

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.860 
and we're going to start the pattern
with<00:04:46.590> my<00:04:46.740> foot<00:04:46.980> on<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.490> foot<00:04:47.730> switch<00:04:48.000> we<00:04:48.720> have

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
with my foot on the foot switch we have

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.890 
with my foot on the foot switch we have
the<00:04:48.990> FS<00:04:49.470> v<00:04:49.890> u<00:04:50.280> which<00:04:50.550> is<00:04:50.670> a<00:04:50.700> single<00:04:51.150> pedal<00:04:51.330> but

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
the FS v u which is a single pedal but

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.990 
the FS v u which is a single pedal but
there's<00:04:52.080> also<00:04:52.200> a<00:04:52.380> double<00:04:52.980> pedal<00:04:53.310> available

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
there's also a double pedal available

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.450 
there's also a double pedal available
which<00:04:54.150> is<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.450> FS<00:04:54.930> six<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:55.920> that<00:04:56.100> allows<00:04:56.310> you

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
which is the FS six and that allows you

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.880 
which is the FS six and that allows you
to<00:04:56.580> do<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.850> tap<00:04:57.060> tempo<00:04:57.320> with<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.440> foot<00:04:58.650> as

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
to do the tap tempo with the foot as

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.770 
to do the tap tempo with the foot as
well<00:04:59.370> as<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.610> start<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.060> stopping<00:05:00.480> but<00:05:00.630> we'll

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
well as the start and stopping but we'll

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.150 
well as the start and stopping but we'll
get<00:05:00.900> onto<00:05:01.050> that<00:05:01.200> in<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.350> moment<00:05:01.470> so<00:05:01.860> for<00:05:02.070> this

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
get onto that in a moment so for this

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:34.100 
get onto that in a moment so for this
example<00:05:02.520> this<00:05:03.030> is<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.330> blues

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.240 

for<00:05:35.110> this<00:05:35.170> next<00:05:35.350> example<00:05:35.860> we're<00:05:35.950> going<00:05:36.070> to<00:05:36.160> use

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
for this next example we're going to use

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.040 
for this next example we're going to use
the<00:05:36.400> country<00:05:36.790> setting<00:05:37.150> on<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.660> written<00:05:37.840> guide

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
the country setting on the written guide

00:05:38.050 --> 00:06:04.870 
the country setting on the written guide
let's<00:05:38.470> have<00:05:38.620> a<00:05:38.650> listen<00:05:39.130> to<00:05:39.160> that

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.030 

as<00:06:05.880> I<00:06:06.180> mentioned<00:06:06.510> earlier<00:06:06.900> we<00:06:07.230> have<00:06:07.500> the<00:06:07.800> tap

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
as I mentioned earlier we have the tap

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.250 
as I mentioned earlier we have the tap
tempo<00:06:08.250> and<00:06:09.000> the<00:06:09.330> start/stop<00:06:09.780> button<00:06:09.810> which

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
tempo and the start/stop button which

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.850 
tempo and the start/stop button which
can<00:06:10.470> be<00:06:10.590> controlled<00:06:11.010> via<00:06:11.310> the<00:06:11.550> foot<00:06:12.000> switch

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
can be controlled via the foot switch

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.930 
can be controlled via the foot switch
however<00:06:13.860> for<00:06:14.070> this<00:06:14.130> example<00:06:14.490> I'll<00:06:14.700> show<00:06:14.730> you

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
however for this example I'll show you

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.640 
however for this example I'll show you
how<00:06:15.090> to<00:06:15.150> do<00:06:15.300> it<00:06:15.389> on<00:06:15.480> the<00:06:15.600> actual<00:06:15.750> amp<00:06:16.139> itself

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
how to do it on the actual amp itself

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.260 
how to do it on the actual amp itself
we're<00:06:16.919> going<00:06:17.070> to<00:06:17.130> use<00:06:17.280> the<00:06:17.430> bounce<00:06:17.700> setting

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
we're going to use the bounce setting

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.240 
we're going to use the bounce setting
and<00:06:18.720> I'm<00:06:19.200> also<00:06:19.380> going<00:06:19.650> to<00:06:19.710> show<00:06:19.919> you<00:06:19.980> that

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
and I'm also going to show you that

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.000 
and I'm also going to show you that
there<00:06:20.460> are<00:06:20.490> three<00:06:20.880> variations<00:06:21.830> for<00:06:22.830> each

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
there are three variations for each

00:06:23.010 --> 00:07:05.140 
there are three variations for each
patch<00:06:23.760> so<00:06:24.180> let's<00:06:24.630> have<00:06:24.750> a<00:06:24.780> listen<00:06:24.900> to<00:06:25.080> that

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.150 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.360 

that<00:07:06.150> about<00:07:06.330> wraps<00:07:06.539> up<00:07:06.810> the<00:07:06.960> micro<00:07:07.260> Cubase<00:07:07.770> rx

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
that about wraps up the micro Cubase rx

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.880 
that about wraps up the micro Cubase rx
overview<00:07:09.030> for<00:07:09.330> today<00:07:09.600> let<00:07:10.380> me<00:07:10.440> just<00:07:10.620> remind

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990 
you some of the features as we mentioned

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.440 
you some of the features as we mentioned
earlier<00:07:13.080> we<00:07:13.470> have<00:07:13.500> seven<00:07:13.979> amp<00:07:14.220> models<00:07:14.640> we<00:07:15.270> have

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:15.450 
earlier we have seven amp models we have

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.080 
earlier we have seven amp models we have
a<00:07:15.479> rhythm<00:07:15.780> guide<00:07:16.169> for<00:07:16.530> practicing<00:07:17.090> there's

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.090 
a rhythm guide for practicing there's

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.300 
a rhythm guide for practicing there's
actually<00:07:18.360> two<00:07:18.660> amps<00:07:19.200> in<00:07:19.350> there<00:07:19.590> two<00:07:19.860> two<00:07:20.130> and<00:07:20.220> a

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.310 
actually two amps in there two two and a

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.070 
actually two amps in there two two and a
half<00:07:20.430> watt<00:07:20.700> amps<00:07:21.120> which<00:07:21.300> gives<00:07:21.690> you<00:07:21.780> five

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 
half watt amps which gives you five

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.920 
half watt amps which gives you five
watts<00:07:22.350> in<00:07:22.500> total<00:07:23.030> for<00:07:24.030> specially<00:07:24.600> designed

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:24.930 
watts in total for specially designed

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.740 
watts in total for specially designed
speakers<00:07:25.530> four<00:07:26.070> inch<00:07:26.220> speakers<00:07:26.669> which<00:07:27.570> also

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:27.750 
speakers four inch speakers which also

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.870 
speakers four inch speakers which also
means<00:07:28.050> it's<00:07:28.320> true<00:07:28.650> stereo<00:07:29.010> so<00:07:29.340> if<00:07:29.430> you<00:07:29.520> do<00:07:29.640> plug

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 
means it's true stereo so if you do plug

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.500 
means it's true stereo so if you do plug
in<00:07:30.030> your<00:07:30.150> mp3<00:07:30.360> players<00:07:31.669> laptops<00:07:32.669> or<00:07:32.970> what<00:07:33.300> have

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:33.510 
in your mp3 players laptops or what have

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.680 
in your mp3 players laptops or what have
you

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.690 
you

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.159 
you
you'll<00:07:34.470> get<00:07:34.590> a<00:07:34.650> true<00:07:34.979> stereo<00:07:35.280> sine<00:07:35.729> so<00:07:36.210> that's

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:37.169 
you'll get a true stereo sine so that's

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:39.200 
you'll get a true stereo sine so that's
it<00:07:37.320> really<00:07:37.470> for<00:07:37.710> me<00:07:37.889> and<00:07:38.100> I'll<00:07:38.880> leave<00:07:39.090> you<00:07:39.120> with

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.210 
it really for me and I'll leave you with

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.770 
it really for me and I'll leave you with
that<00:07:39.389> same<00:07:39.570> example<00:07:39.840> again<00:07:39.990> here<00:07:40.530> we<00:07:40.620> go
