would be to get onto raw foods okay as

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.619 
would be to get onto raw foods okay as
much<00:00:30.920> raw<00:00:31.280> fruits<00:00:31.700> and<00:00:31.910> vegetables<00:00:32.329> as<00:00:32.480> you

and to digest so your body is able to
get<00:00:39.949> that<00:00:40.100> energy<00:00:40.280> out<00:00:40.730> of<00:00:40.789> it<00:00:41.059> quickly<00:00:41.719> and

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:41.929 
get that energy out of it quickly and

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.369 
get that energy out of it quickly and
easily<00:00:42.579> number<00:00:43.579> two<00:00:43.879> would<00:00:44.210> be<00:00:44.390> that<00:00:44.600> add<00:00:44.839> in

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
easily number two would be that add in

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.399 
easily number two would be that add in
green<00:00:45.980> juices<00:00:46.280> into<00:00:46.730> your<00:00:47.030> diet<00:00:47.260> reason<00:00:48.260> why

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
is that green juices fibers been taken

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.099 
is that green juices fibers been taken
out<00:00:51.019> of<00:00:51.079> it<00:00:51.319> so<00:00:51.589> it's<00:00:51.859> just<00:00:52.249> pure<00:00:53.120> juice<00:00:53.780> it's

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
out of it so it's just pure juice it's

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.119 
out of it so it's just pure juice it's
pure<00:00:54.559> energy<00:00:54.969> okay<00:00:55.969> it's<00:00:56.239> got<00:00:56.539> all<00:00:56.809> the

it's it's like pure electricity pretty
much<00:01:10.399> liquid<00:01:11.060> electricity<00:01:11.990> I<00:01:12.020> like<00:01:12.409> to<00:01:12.530> look

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
much liquid electricity I like to look

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.819 
much liquid electricity I like to look
at<00:01:12.770> it<00:01:12.860> like<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:14.149> is<00:01:14.329> perfect<00:01:14.540> to<00:01:14.960> increase

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
at it like and it is perfect to increase

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.010 
at it like and it is perfect to increase
the<00:01:16.040> energy<00:01:16.159> because<00:01:16.880> since<00:01:17.570> it<00:01:17.689> doesn't<00:01:17.840> have

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
the energy because since it doesn't have

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.510 
the energy because since it doesn't have
the<00:01:18.049> fiber<00:01:18.350> in<00:01:18.560> it<00:01:18.649> you<00:01:18.829> don't<00:01:19.100> need<00:01:19.219> to<00:01:19.340> break

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
the fiber in it you don't need to break

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.149 
the fiber in it you don't need to break
it<00:01:19.640> down<00:01:19.789> your<00:01:20.090> body<00:01:20.450> just<00:01:20.930> absorb<00:01:21.590> set<00:01:21.890> and

or muscles nothing it's just kind of
heavy<00:01:55.549> weight<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.630> if<00:01:56.929> you<00:01:57.020> get<00:01:57.200> out<00:01:57.409> there<00:01:57.679> and

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
heavy weight so if you get out there and

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.469 
heavy weight so if you get out there and
exercise<00:01:58.310> it's<00:01:58.609> like<00:01:58.789> you're<00:01:59.000> waking<00:01:59.359> up

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
exercise it's like you're waking up

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.300 
exercise it's like you're waking up
every<00:01:59.840> single<00:02:00.170> muscle<00:02:00.350> every<00:02:00.649> single<00:02:01.070> cell

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
every single muscle every single cell

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.919 
every single muscle every single cell
you're<00:02:01.850> getting<00:02:02.119> things<00:02:02.359> going<00:02:02.539> you're

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
you're getting things going you're

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.840 
you're getting things going you're
getting<00:02:03.200> your<00:02:03.320> lymphatic<00:02:03.679> system<00:02:04.280> moving<00:02:04.520> and

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
getting your lymphatic system moving and

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.539 
getting your lymphatic system moving and
getting<00:02:05.060> things<00:02:05.359> moved<00:02:05.719> out<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.439> at<00:02:07.249> the

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
getting things moved out and and at the

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.669 
getting things moved out and and at the
same<00:02:07.700> time<00:02:07.759> you're<00:02:08.450> also<00:02:08.690> once<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:09.410> start

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
same time you're also once you start

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.759 
same time you're also once you start
exercising<00:02:10.340> you're<00:02:10.729> also<00:02:11.650> increasing<00:02:12.650> your

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
exercising you're also increasing your

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.190 
exercising you're also increasing your
breathing<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.489> that's<00:02:14.180> super<00:02:14.690> important

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
breathing and that's super important

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.030 
breathing and that's super important
because<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.650> more

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
because the more

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.369 
because the more
string<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.519> get<00:02:16.700> in<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.450> better<00:02:17.689> off<00:02:17.930> that

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
string you get in the better off that

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.890 
string you get in the better off that
also<00:02:18.769> helps<00:02:19.159> to<00:02:19.219> give<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.819> more<00:02:20.150> energy<00:02:20.689> and

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
also helps to give you a more energy and

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.410 
also helps to give you a more energy and
so<00:02:21.439> when<00:02:21.650> we<00:02:21.680> get<00:02:21.950> our<00:02:22.069> heart<00:02:22.310> rate<00:02:22.489> up<00:02:22.670> we<00:02:23.269> also

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
so when we get our heart rate up we also

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.559 
so when we get our heart rate up we also
get<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.930> oxygen<00:02:24.290> level<00:02:24.739> up<00:02:24.859> as<00:02:25.040> well<00:02:25.569> number

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
get the oxygen level up as well number

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.259 
get the oxygen level up as well number
four<00:02:27.170> would<00:02:27.650> be<00:02:27.829> to<00:02:27.950> get<00:02:28.129> and<00:02:28.340> that's<00:02:28.519> asleep<00:02:28.969> a
