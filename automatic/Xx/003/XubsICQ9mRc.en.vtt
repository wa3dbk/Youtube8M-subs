 and you were welcome again to my channel 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 as you will see I still have red hair in 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.480
 the previous video I said that I was going to 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.880
 change but I did not have time to change 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.680
 what Christmas was and you already know that 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.720
 true I hope even if they had a 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.760
 Pretty Christmas together with her family and 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.410
 your friends good that I bring you this what 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.720
 which is like for the new year so very 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.480
 dramatic so if you want to know 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.210
 how is this look no more keep watching 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.010
 well let's start apply a little bit of base 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.559
 of shadows in the flame of your fingers and 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.840
 rub the heat from your fingers will help 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.550
 that the base is applied much better and 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.450
 this will also prevent your shadow from 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.520
 wrinkle 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.110
 Apply a silver shade on the 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.110
 eyelid without passing the crease 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.960
 Apply a piece of tape on 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.270
 angle about one centimeter of 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.110
 distance from the tip of the eyebrow to 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.610
 create a super-defined shadow border 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.220
 apply a gray eye shadow 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.340
 smoked in layers in the crease of the eye 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.720
 until reaching the desired darkness 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.110
 we blur with gentle movements and 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.110
 light 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.079
 now apply a pearl shade 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.119
 smooth along the eyebrow bone and 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.600
 we blur where these two colors are 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.600
 find 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.480
 apply a matte black shadow on the 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.430
 external corner of the eye when we chop that 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.980
 color in layers until reaching the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.900
 desired darkness we blend very well 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.900
 with smooth and light movements 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.280
 the color of black shadow is the most color 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.769
 difficult to blur so to help 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.420
 to blur the black shadow applies a 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.940
 little more of the gray shadow to smoked 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.549
 over the edge of the black shadow and 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.950
 smudges very well removes excess 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.870
 Drop shadow with a brush and remove 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.160
 the adhesive tape with great care of 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.060
 do not pull the skin 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.489
 that will create that perfect edge 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.830
 we put some eyelash glue 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.959
 on the entire mobile eyelid but first 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.310
 Apply a layer of mascara to prevent 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.310
 the diamond enters the eye 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.550
 i 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.660
 Apply the silver shadow on the corner 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.980
 inner eye and then the gray shadow 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.980
 smoked in the middle 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.940
 and finally apply the black shadow in 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.970
 the outer corner of the eye connecting it 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.320
 with the edge of the shadow as such 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.500
 we blur where those colors are 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.080
 find apply the gel eyeliner 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.110
 black on the water line on both sides 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.070
 and we designed the eyeliner in the corner 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.070
 external eye 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.690
 to give the appearance of a few more eyes 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.319
 awake, apply a little shadow 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.450

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.920
 eyelashes above and also in those of 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.709

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.900
 apply false eyelashes with the help of 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.700
 one pulls eyebrows starting at the corner 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.480
 outside of the eye until you reach the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.480
 inner corner 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.100
 and ready now we go with the face 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.700

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.950
