that's good that's pretty good for us I

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.840 
that's good that's pretty good for us I
guess<00:02:06.350> but<00:02:06.650> we<00:02:06.890> got<00:02:07.070> more<00:02:07.280> people<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.670> fight

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
guess but we got more people to fight

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.320 
guess but we got more people to fight
you<00:02:08.119> for<00:02:08.720> example<00:02:08.899> this<00:02:09.140> guy<00:02:09.700> SP<00:02:10.700> geologist

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
you for example this guy SP geologist

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.410 
you for example this guy SP geologist
well<00:02:11.959> known<00:02:12.200> kit<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.909> we<00:02:13.909> better<00:02:14.060> take<00:02:14.269> him

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
well known kit and we better take him

well known kit and we better take him
down<00:02:14.599> I<00:02:15.340> think<00:02:16.340> he<00:02:16.400> noticed<00:02:16.580> us<00:02:16.909> he's<00:02:17.569> probably

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
down I think he noticed us he's probably

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.199 
down I think he noticed us he's probably
going<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.739> turn<00:02:18.920> around<00:02:19.069> shortly<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.030> should

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
going to turn around shortly so I should

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.930 
going to turn around shortly so I should
be<00:02:20.330> ready<00:02:20.600> here<00:02:21.110> oh<00:02:21.260> yeah<00:02:22.100> oh<00:02:22.340> there's<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.790> lot

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
be ready here oh yeah oh there's a lot

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.550 
be ready here oh yeah oh there's a lot
of<00:02:22.970> people<00:02:23.240> in<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.390> in<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.569> mix<00:02:23.810> though<00:02:24.020> all

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
of people in the in the mix though all

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.910 
of people in the in the mix though all
right

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
right

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.440 
right
so<00:02:25.130> I'm<00:02:25.220> just<00:02:25.370> gonna<00:02:25.459> keep<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:25.790> chasing<00:02:26.209> this

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
so I'm just gonna keep on chasing this

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.960 
so I'm just gonna keep on chasing this
guy<00:02:26.660> i<00:02:26.690> think<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.110> case<00:02:27.290> if<00:02:27.740> this<00:02:28.220> guy<00:02:28.400> stops<00:02:28.790> I

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
guy i think the case if this guy stops I

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.400 
guy i think the case if this guy stops I
can<00:02:29.120> kill<00:02:29.300> him<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.510> then<00:02:29.569> also<00:02:29.780> kill<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.200> guy

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
can kill him and then also kill that guy

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.790 
can kill him and then also kill that guy
there<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:31.730> potential<00:02:32.720> for<00:02:32.930> two<00:02:33.140> kills<00:02:33.500> right

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
there so potential for two kills right

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.620 
there so potential for two kills right

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
the death match I think we got this

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.850 
the death match I think we got this
let's<00:06:00.700> see<00:06:00.850> we<00:06:01.570> still<00:06:01.780> have<00:06:01.930> two<00:06:02.200> full<00:06:02.560> teams

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
let's see we still have two full teams

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.620 
let's see we still have two full teams
though<00:06:03.220> so<00:06:03.850> gotta<00:06:04.090> watch<00:06:04.210> out<00:06:04.389> for<00:06:04.419> them

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
though so gotta watch out for them

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.690 
though so gotta watch out for them
usually<00:06:05.410> there's<00:06:05.590> only<00:06:05.770> like<00:06:05.919> solo<00:06:06.430> players

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
usually there's only like solo players

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.850 
usually there's only like solo players
left<00:06:07.000> at<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.450> end<00:06:07.539> of<00:06:07.660> games<00:06:07.840> but<00:06:08.020> in<00:06:08.560> this

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
left at the end of games but in this

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.100 
left at the end of games but in this
game<00:06:08.979> we<00:06:09.610> got<00:06:09.789> this<00:06:10.360> ship<00:06:10.630> date<00:06:10.810> and<00:06:11.020> they

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
game we got this ship date and they

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.529 
game we got this ship date and they
stripped<00:06:11.350> one<00:06:11.560> all<00:06:12.310> intact<00:06:12.850> as<00:06:13.090> well<00:06:13.240> as<00:06:13.360> our

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.080 
stripped one all intact as well as our
team<00:06:13.750> so<00:06:14.160> this<00:06:15.160> might<00:06:15.490> be<00:06:15.520> a<00:06:15.789> really

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090

that<00:07:05.500> is<00:07:05.530> a<00:07:05.680> very<00:07:05.920> weird<00:07:06.190> technique<00:07:06.640> you<00:07:06.790> got

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
that is a very weird technique you got

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.450 
that is a very weird technique you got
there<00:07:07.500> we<00:07:08.500> gotta<00:07:08.650> kill<00:07:08.830> him<00:07:08.920> no<00:07:09.040> I<00:07:09.220> think<00:07:09.400> he

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
did more damage to himself than me

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.410 
did more damage to himself than me
that's<00:07:11.620> a<00:07:11.710> bit<00:07:11.830> awkward<00:07:11.860> I<00:07:12.460> got<00:07:13.150> him<00:07:13.270> though

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.440 
that's a bit awkward I got him though
and<00:07:13.750> that<00:07:13.810> should<00:07:14.590> be<00:07:14.620> the<00:07:14.710> game<00:07:14.980> that<00:07:15.490> should

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.450 
and that should be the game that should

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.690 
and that should be the game that should
indeed<00:07:16.720> be<00:07:16.780> the<00:07:16.960> game<00:07:17.170> look<00:07:17.560> at<00:07:17.770> that<00:07:18.040> coming

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:18.700 
indeed be the game look at that coming
