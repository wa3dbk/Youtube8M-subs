really checked any of the class changes
i<00:01:35.560> just<00:01:35.709> kind<00:01:35.920> of<00:01:35.950> threw<00:01:36.159> talent<00:01:36.490> points

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
i just kind of threw talent points

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.940 
i just kind of threw talent points
together<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.509> that<00:01:37.959> does<00:01:38.080> not<00:01:38.200> excuse<00:01:38.740> that

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
together and that does not excuse that

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.999 
together and that does not excuse that
horrible<00:01:39.340> pool<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:41.229> was<00:01:41.350> just<00:01:41.380> that<00:01:41.950> was

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
horrible pool and that was just that was

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.830 
horrible pool and that was just that was
just<00:01:42.399> terrible<00:01:42.789> everything<00:01:43.270> about<00:01:43.450> that<00:01:43.509> was

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
just terrible everything about that was

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.520 
just terrible everything about that was
terrible<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:45.330> so<00:01:46.330> I<00:01:46.360> think<00:01:46.509> I'll<00:01:46.959> just<00:01:47.020> run

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
terrible and so I think I'll just run

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.149 
terrible and so I think I'll just run
back<00:01:47.770> i<00:01:47.830> guess<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:49.299> i<00:01:49.959> realized<00:01:50.860> that<00:01:50.920> i<00:01:51.009> could

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
back i guess but i realized that i could

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.969 
back i guess but i realized that i could
heart<00:01:51.520> so<00:01:52.000> then<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.840> hardbound<00:01:53.259> teleport<00:01:53.860> back

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
heart so then a hardbound teleport back

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.949 
heart so then a hardbound teleport back
in<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:54.459> it<00:01:54.819> brings<00:01:54.970> me<00:01:55.090> back<00:01:55.299> to<00:01:55.569> the<00:01:55.659> fight

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
in and it brings me back to the fight

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:00.119 
in and it brings me back to the fight
and<00:01:58.080> it<00:01:59.080> was<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.500> was<00:01:59.590> really<00:01:59.769> it<00:01:59.890> was<00:01:59.920> really

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:00.129 
and it was that was really it was really

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:01.979 
and it was that was really it was really
