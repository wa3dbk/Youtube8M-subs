00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
many times on many different levels that

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:51.770 
many times on many different levels that
she's<00:00:51.120> capable<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.719> example

on<00:00:53.670> social<00:00:54.030> media<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.840> turn<00:00:54.989> things<00:00:55.199> around<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
on social media to turn things around to

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.160 
on social media to turn things around to
build<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.920> brand<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:57.899> Asia

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
build a brand and to do so in Asia

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.130 
build a brand and to do so in Asia
especially<00:00:58.620> which<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> huge<00:00:59.699> thing<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.329> for

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
especially which is a huge thing for for

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.229 
especially which is a huge thing for for
Apple<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.710> guess<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.489> risks<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.879> if<00:01:03.059> she

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
Apple I guess one of the risks is if she

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.270 
Apple I guess one of the risks is if she
is<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.260> more<00:01:04.379> than<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.769> title<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
is if this is more than just a title and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.789 
is if this is more than just a title and
she's<00:01:05.430> given<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.360> guess<00:01:07.020> ownership<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
she's given I guess ownership of the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.590 
she's given I guess ownership of the
retail<00:01:08.189> operation<00:01:08.640> especially<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.270> physical

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.670 
SmartWatch that's more my color you know
it's<00:02:16.460> about<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:17.690> know<00:02:17.780> straddling<00:02:18.230> those<00:02:18.440> two

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
it's about you know straddling those two

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.680 
it's about you know straddling those two
worlds<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.190> that's<00:02:19.280> much<00:02:19.580> bigger<00:02:19.760> than<00:02:20.000> much

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690

I'd<00:02:22.970> like<00:02:23.180> if<00:02:23.600> we<00:02:23.780> can<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.080> camera<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.410> have<00:02:24.500> a

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
I'd like if we can the camera to have a

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.810 
I'd like if we can the camera to have a
look<00:02:24.740> at<00:02:24.830> your<00:02:24.950> watch<00:02:25.130> because<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.550> this<00:02:25.670> the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
look at your watch because is this the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.370 
look at your watch because is this the
future<00:02:25.940> also<00:02:26.360> for<00:02:26.540> Apple<00:02:26.780> this<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.050> Pebble

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
future also for Apple this is a Pebble

future also for Apple this is a Pebble
watch<00:02:27.410> yes<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.100> represents<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.760> beginning

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
watch yes this represents the beginning

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.610 
watch yes this represents the beginning
of<00:02:29.210> what<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.360> SmartWatch<00:02:29.750> can<00:02:29.960> be<00:02:30.110> it's

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
of what a SmartWatch can be it's

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.810 
of what a SmartWatch can be it's
colorful<00:02:31.040> all<00:02:31.160> different<00:02:31.430> colors<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.790> choose

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
just the beginning you know pebbles

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.960 
just the beginning you know pebbles
going<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:39.830> take<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.250> another<00:02:40.340> another

going to take it to another another

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.340 
going to take it to another another
place<00:02:41.240> another<00:02:41.510> step<00:02:41.690> further<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.050> I'm<00:02:42.110> sure

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
place another step further and I'm sure

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.710 
place another step further and I'm sure
Apple<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.800> an<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.370> year<00:02:43.730> at<00:02:43.910> least<00:02:43.940> ahead<00:02:44.540> it

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
Apple is an is a year at least ahead it

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.060 
Apple is an is a year at least ahead it
is<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:44.960> all<00:02:45.080> other<00:02:45.260> ways<00:02:45.350> of<00:02:45.500> Technology

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
is in all other ways of Technology

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.500 
is in all other ways of Technology
pretty<00:02:46.250> much<00:02:46.460> fingerprint<00:02:47.240> scanners<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
pretty much fingerprint scanners the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.050 
pretty much fingerprint scanners the
rest<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.280> mean<00:02:49.280> we're<00:02:49.730> pretty<00:02:49.760> sure

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
rest of it so I mean we're pretty sure

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.700 
rest of it so I mean we're pretty sure
that<00:02:50.210> this<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.510> what<00:02:50.960> Apple<00:02:51.110> is<00:02:51.320> working<00:02:51.650> on

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
that this is what Apple is working on

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.590 
that this is what Apple is working on
and<00:02:51.890> when<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.370> has<00:02:52.550> has<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.030> sell<00:02:53.240> those<00:02:53.360> things

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
and when it has has to sell those things

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.240 
and when it has has to sell those things
in<00:02:53.780> stores<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.440> mean<00:02:54.620> it's<00:02:54.890> already<00:02:55.010> been

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
in stores I mean it's already been

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.350 
in stores I mean it's already been
radical<00:02:55.610> in<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.820> way<00:02:55.910> it's<00:02:56.150> laid<00:02:56.300> out

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.240 
cleanly through things that others are
attempting<00:03:41.900> maybe<00:03:42.080> even<00:03:42.380> like<00:03:42.560> what<00:03:42.950> pebble

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
attempting maybe even like what pebble

attempting maybe even like what pebble
is<00:03:43.340> attempting<00:03:43.700> it<00:03:43.790> can<00:03:43.940> take<00:03:44.330> that<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:44.720> just

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
is attempting it can take that and just

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.970 
is attempting it can take that and just
take<00:03:44.959> it<00:03:45.080> to<00:03:45.200> another<00:03:45.290> level
