the<00:00:34.750> nokia<00:00:35.530> dt<00:00:36.390> 900<00:00:37.390> over<00:00:37.930> to<00:00:38.050> this<00:00:38.170> one<00:00:38.440> which

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
the nokia dt 900 over to this one which

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.549 
the nokia dt 900 over to this one which
is<00:00:38.980> a<00:00:39.160> charging<00:00:39.970> pad<00:00:40.300> now<00:00:40.930> all<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.440> these

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
is a charging pad now all of these

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.700 
is a charging pad now all of these
things<00:00:41.800> have<00:00:42.010> various<00:00:42.460> inputs<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.500> house

things have various inputs the house
charger<00:00:45.280> with<00:00:45.460> this<00:00:45.489> I<00:00:45.879> mean<00:00:46.000> it<00:00:46.239> uses<00:00:46.510> a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
charger with this I mean it uses a

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.210 
charger with this I mean it uses a
microUSB<00:00:47.110> and<00:00:47.769> the<00:00:48.839> AC<00:00:49.839> charger<00:00:50.470> for<00:00:51.070> your

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
microUSB and the AC charger for your

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.960 
microUSB and the AC charger for your
home<00:00:51.809> outputs<00:00:52.809> 5<00:00:53.080> volts<00:00:53.470> at<00:00:53.589> 1.8<00:00:54.309> amps

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
home outputs 5 volts at 1.8 amps

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.570 
home outputs 5 volts at 1.8 amps
I<00:00:55.000> did<00:00:55.600> try<00:00:55.870> another<00:00:56.379> charger<00:00:56.920> that<00:00:57.100> outputted

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
I did try another charger that outputted

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.020 
I did try another charger that outputted
5<00:00:57.820> volts<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.330> just<00:00:58.690> one<00:00:58.900> amp<00:00:59.110> and<00:00:59.320> it<00:00:59.530> still

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
5 volts and just one amp and it still

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.630 
5 volts and just one amp and it still
works<00:01:01.030> so<00:01:01.180> right<00:01:01.420> now<00:01:01.570> I<00:01:01.600> have<00:01:01.900> it<00:01:02.019> hooked<00:01:02.229> into

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
works so right now I have it hooked into

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.060 
works so right now I have it hooked into
my<00:01:03.640> vehicle<00:01:03.879> it<00:01:04.239> comes<00:01:04.570> out<00:01:04.930> back<00:01:05.379> around<00:01:05.710> and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
my vehicle it comes out back around and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.730 
my vehicle it comes out back around and
plugs<00:01:06.790> into<00:01:07.090> this<00:01:07.270> which<00:01:07.720> is<00:01:07.960> just<00:01:08.290> an<00:01:08.440> output

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
plugs into this which is just an output

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.010 
plugs into this which is just an output
of<00:01:08.799> one<00:01:09.070> amp<00:01:09.250> I<00:01:09.520> will<00:01:10.000> go<00:01:10.210> ahead<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:10.479> upgrade

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
of one amp I will go ahead and upgrade

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.620 
of one amp I will go ahead and upgrade
that<00:01:11.200> so<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:11.770> can<00:01:12.040> get<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.280> maximum<00:01:12.760> potential

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
that so I can get the maximum potential

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.310 
that so I can get the maximum potential
out<00:01:13.960> of<00:01:13.990> this<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:15.310> it<00:01:15.880> has<00:01:16.090> an<00:01:16.240> input<00:01:16.390> of<00:01:16.540> 1.8

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
out of this if it has an input of 1.8

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.230 
out of this if it has an input of 1.8
amps<00:01:17.650> it<00:01:17.740> should<00:01:17.980> be<00:01:18.100> able<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.610> output<00:01:19.000> at

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
amps it should be able to output at

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.200 
amps it should be able to output at
least<00:01:19.660> 1<00:01:20.260> amp<00:01:20.500> which<00:01:20.950> will<00:01:21.130> charge<00:01:21.430> most

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
least 1 amp which will charge most

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.850 
least 1 amp which will charge most
phones<00:01:22.990> at<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:23.980> normal<00:01:24.850> rate<00:01:25.410> here<00:01:26.410> I<00:01:26.440> have<00:01:26.650> the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
phones at a normal rate here I have the

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.100 
phones at a normal rate here I have the
Verizon<00:01:27.460> version<00:01:27.910> of<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.180> galaxy<00:01:28.660> note<00:01:28.690> 2

Verizon version of the galaxy note 2

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.650 
Verizon version of the galaxy note 2
we've<00:01:29.590> added<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.730> Qi<00:01:31.300> enabled<00:01:32.010> receiver<00:01:33.010> pad

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
we've added the Qi enabled receiver pad

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.990 
we've added the Qi enabled receiver pad
so<00:01:34.660> that<00:01:34.690> it<00:01:35.050> can<00:01:35.290> be<00:01:35.770> used<00:01:35.980> with<00:01:36.250> this<00:01:36.400> of

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
so that it can be used with this of

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.090 
so that it can be used with this of
course<00:01:37.090> this<00:01:37.450> does<00:01:37.660> have<00:01:37.870> a<00:01:38.050> magnetic<00:01:38.590> base<00:01:38.740> it

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
course this does have a magnetic base it

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.520 
course this does have a magnetic base it
comes<00:01:39.550> ship<00:01:39.850> with<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.090> little<00:01:40.480> plastic<00:01:40.630> wrap<00:01:41.020> if

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
comes ship with a little plastic wrap if

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.870 
comes ship with a little plastic wrap if
you're<00:01:41.680> trying<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:41.980> use<00:01:42.130> that<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:42.370> test<00:01:42.640> it<00:01:42.820> out

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
you're trying to use that to test it out

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.600 
you're trying to use that to test it out
pretty<00:01:43.630> much<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:44.140> will<00:01:44.530> not<00:01:44.770> stick<00:01:45.340> at<00:01:45.580> all

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
pretty much it will not stick at all

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.280 
pretty much it will not stick at all
with<00:01:46.030> that<00:01:46.060> on<00:01:46.360> it<00:01:46.540> so<00:01:46.720> go<00:01:46.840> ahead<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.080> take

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
with that on it so go ahead and take

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.220 
with that on it so go ahead and take
that<00:01:47.350> wrapping<00:01:47.890> off<00:01:48.150> in<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.420> user<00:01:49.660> manual<00:01:49.870> it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
that wrapping off in the user manual it

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.120 
that wrapping off in the user manual it
says<00:01:50.440> it<00:01:50.590> supports<00:01:51.040> two<00:01:52.380> positions<00:01:53.380> either<00:01:53.980> a

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
says it supports two positions either a

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.399 
says it supports two positions either a
vertical<00:01:54.670> or<00:01:54.880> horizontal<00:01:55.150> you<00:01:55.990> can<00:01:56.020> see<00:01:56.260> it's

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
vertical or horizontal you can see it's

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.990 
vertical or horizontal you can see it's
charging<00:01:57.010> right<00:01:57.190> there<00:01:57.400> we<00:01:57.580> get<00:01:57.730> the<00:01:57.820> little

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
charging right there we get the little

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.680 
charging right there we get the little
notification<00:01:58.800> and<00:01:59.800> you<00:02:00.700> can<00:02:00.790> go<00:02:00.940> horizontal

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
notification and you can go horizontal

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.200 
notification and you can go horizontal
and<00:02:01.960> it<00:02:02.440> would<00:02:02.560> charge<00:02:02.830> if<00:02:03.070> I<00:02:03.190> could<00:02:03.400> fit<00:02:04.000> this

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
and it would charge if I could fit this

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.510 
and it would charge if I could fit this
huge<00:02:04.810> behemoth<00:02:05.260> of<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.590> phone<00:02:05.860> in<00:02:06.159> that

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
huge behemoth of a phone in that

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.430 
huge behemoth of a phone in that
position

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
position

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.820 
position
upside<00:02:08.920> down<00:02:09.209> depending<00:02:10.209> on<00:02:10.690> if<00:02:10.989> you<00:02:11.170> get<00:02:11.650> it

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
upside down depending on if you get it

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.070 
upside down depending on if you get it
just<00:02:12.040> centered<00:02:12.370> around<00:02:12.550> that<00:02:13.480> thing<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.959> would

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
just centered around that thing it would

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.390 
just centered around that thing it would
probably<00:02:14.260> work<00:02:14.530> as<00:02:14.739> well

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
probably work as well

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.640 
probably work as well
this<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:15.970> really<00:02:16.569> sticky<00:02:17.019> around<00:02:17.080> here<00:02:17.409> this

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
this is really sticky around here this

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.879 
this is really sticky around here this
rubberized<00:02:18.360> piece<00:02:19.360> in<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.200> center<00:02:20.439> pretty

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:20.889 
rubberized piece in the center pretty

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.089 
rubberized piece in the center pretty
much<00:02:21.010> all<00:02:21.249> this<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.909> rubberized<00:02:22.499> so<00:02:23.499> with<00:02:23.980> the

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
much all this is rubberized so with the

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.080 
much all this is rubberized so with the
magnet

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
magnet

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.970 
magnet
that<00:02:26.090> rubberized<00:02:26.510> piece<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.989> don't<00:02:27.650> think<00:02:27.890> I'll

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
that rubberized piece I don't think I'll

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.089 
that rubberized piece I don't think I'll
have<00:02:28.129> a<00:02:28.159> problem<00:02:28.370> with<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:28.730> flying<00:02:29.409> off<00:02:30.409> the

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
have a problem with this flying off the

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.750 
have a problem with this flying off the
Mount<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:32.780> has<00:02:32.959> like<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.230> rubberized<00:02:33.760> TPU

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
Mount this has like a rubberized TPU

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.300 
Mount this has like a rubberized TPU
cover<00:02:35.180> on<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.659> right<00:02:35.870> now<00:02:36.019> as<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.379> can<00:02:36.409> see<00:02:36.530> so

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
cover on it right now as you can see so

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.699 
cover on it right now as you can see so
this<00:02:37.579> is<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.790> good<00:02:38.000> solution<00:02:38.480> for<00:02:38.720> in<00:02:39.170> vehicle

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
this is a good solution for in vehicle

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.130 
this is a good solution for in vehicle
not<00:02:40.189> as<00:02:40.340> easy<00:02:40.579> as<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:41.000> Nokia<00:02:41.420> versions<00:02:41.900> which

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
not as easy as the Nokia versions which

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.319 
not as easy as the Nokia versions which
take<00:02:42.769> a<00:02:42.799> 12<00:02:43.220> volt<00:02:43.430> input<00:02:43.879> which<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.209> could

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
take a 12 volt input which you could

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.030 
take a 12 volt input which you could
just<00:02:44.510> wire<00:02:44.659> directly<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.349> your<00:02:45.409> vehicle<00:02:45.890> so

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
just wire directly to your vehicle so

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.229 
just wire directly to your vehicle so
you<00:02:46.099> will<00:02:46.310> have<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.640> have<00:02:46.760> some<00:02:46.970> kind<00:02:47.000> of

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
you will have to have some kind of

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.289 
you will have to have some kind of
adapter<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:47.989> it<00:02:48.920> is<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.280> better<00:02:49.730> solution<00:02:50.090> than

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
adapter and it is a better solution than

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.309 
adapter and it is a better solution than
the<00:02:50.769> wcp<00:02:51.769> 700<00:02:52.579> which<00:02:52.730> is<00:02:52.909> the<00:02:53.060> version<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.599> the

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
the wcp 700 which is the version of the

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.569 
the wcp 700 which is the version of the
LG<00:02:55.720> charger<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.989> is<00:02:57.170> sold<00:02:57.470> at<00:02:57.739> Verizon<00:02:58.129> that

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
LG charger that is sold at Verizon that

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.729 
LG charger that is sold at Verizon that
one<00:02:58.730> takes<00:02:58.970> an<00:02:59.120> input<00:02:59.420> voltage<00:02:59.569> of<00:02:59.959> 18<00:03:00.379> volts

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
one takes an input voltage of 18 volts

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.339 
one takes an input voltage of 18 volts
this<00:03:00.950> is<00:03:01.250> made<00:03:02.090> by<00:03:02.239> LG<00:03:02.629> or<00:03:02.780> at<00:03:02.870> least<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.139> box
