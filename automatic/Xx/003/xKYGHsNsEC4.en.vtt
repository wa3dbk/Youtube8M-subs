able to see what you're trying to look

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.220 
able to see what you're trying to look
at<00:00:05.040> so<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.940> wouldn't<00:00:06.270> have<00:00:06.390> got<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.629> light<00:00:06.899> and

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
at so I wouldn't have got a light and

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.370 
at so I wouldn't have got a light and
I've<00:00:08.189> got<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.550> tilt<00:00:08.880> bed<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.840> tilt<00:00:10.200> bed

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
I've got the tilt bed this is tilt bed

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.680 
I've got the tilt bed this is tilt bed
part<00:00:10.769> who<00:00:11.250> knows<00:00:11.400> six<00:00:11.790> out<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.179> hundred

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
part who knows six out of a hundred

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.379 
part who knows six out of a hundred
but<00:00:13.170> anyway<00:00:13.500> honey<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.730> everything<00:00:15.030> is

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
but anyway honey this is everything is

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.410 
but anyway honey this is everything is
that<00:00:16.340> functioning<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.580> was<00:00:17.970> going<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.180> show<00:00:18.359> you

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
that functioning I was going to show you

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.410 
that functioning I was going to show you
where<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.160> this<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.369> view<00:00:20.670> you've<00:00:20.880> got<00:00:21.090> once

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
where the this is a view you've got once

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.810 
where the this is a view you've got once
your<00:00:21.600> bed<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.170> up<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.769> I've<00:00:23.189> got<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.550> at<00:00:23.670> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
your bed is up and I've got it at the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.939 
your bed is up and I've got it at the
raised<00:00:24.119> level<00:00:24.720> where<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.109> had<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.500> manually

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
raised level where I had to manually

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.269 
raised level where I had to manually
push<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.550> up<00:00:26.840> you<00:00:27.840> know<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.859> explain<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
push it up you know I can explain a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.339 
push it up you know I can explain a
little<00:00:29.490> bit<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.880> later<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.140> lets

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
little bit of that later but this lets

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.090 
little bit of that later but this lets
you<00:00:31.500> see<00:00:31.529> where<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:31.980> had<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.309> fabricate<00:00:34.100> this

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
you see where I had to fabricate this

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.850 
you see where I had to fabricate this
cross<00:00:35.880> brace<00:00:36.300> I've<00:00:36.630> welded<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.230> over<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.620> that

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
cross brace I've welded it over on that

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.090 
cross brace I've welded it over on that
side<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:39.180> then<00:00:39.420> I've<00:00:39.540> also<00:00:39.719> welded<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.530> back

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
side and then I've also welded it back

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.240 
side and then I've also welded it back
over<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:42.500> but<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.530> made<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.770> couple<00:00:44.040> of

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
over here but I made a couple of

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.090 
over here but I made a couple of
different<00:00:44.670> places<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.829> actuator<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
different places for the actuator to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.580 
different places for the actuator to
mount<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.940> pivots<00:00:48.180> within<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.530> I

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
mount and it pivots within this and I

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.080 
mount and it pivots within this and I
did<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.010> because<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.700> didn't<00:00:50.879> really<00:00:50.969> know

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
did that because I didn't really know

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.389 
did that because I didn't really know
where<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.420> was<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.719> go<00:00:52.070> but<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.250> I'll

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
where I was going to go but this I'll

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.110 
where I was going to go but this I'll
also<00:00:53.579> show<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.510> hinges<00:00:55.969> that's<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
also show you the hinges that's the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.250 
also show you the hinges that's the
front<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:58.910> there's<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.210> rear<00:01:00.449> hinge<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
front one there's the rear hinge and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.509 
front one there's the rear hinge and
those<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.399> look<00:01:02.550> at<00:01:02.670> parts<00:01:03.000> 1<00:01:03.329> &amp;<00:01:03.690> 4<00:01:03.989> 2<00:01:04.199> &amp;<00:01:04.379> 3

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
those if you look at parts 1 &amp; 4 2 &amp; 3

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.609 
those if you look at parts 1 &amp; 4 2 &amp; 3
you'll<00:01:05.519> see<00:01:05.729> how<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.880> fabricate<00:01:06.180> those<00:01:06.750> but

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
you'll see how to fabricate those but

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.340 
you'll see how to fabricate those but
you'll<00:01:07.830> also<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.520> right<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:09.020> where<00:01:10.020> all<00:01:10.170> of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
you'll also see right here where all of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.700 
you'll also see right here where all of
this<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.960> I'm<00:01:13.080> going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.260> sit<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.560> down

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
this is and I'm going to sit you down

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.340 
this is and I'm going to sit you down
here<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.250> stop<00:01:15.210> shaking<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.689> camera<00:01:15.960> around

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
here and stop shaking the camera around

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
here and stop shaking the camera around
that<00:01:16.619> probably<00:01:17.009> bothers<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:17.850> bad<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.299> it

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
that probably bothers you as bad as it

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.370 
that probably bothers you as bad as it
does<00:01:18.570> me<00:01:19.100> okay<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.570> order<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.869> bring<00:01:22.080> this

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
does me okay so in order to bring this

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.060 
does me okay so in order to bring this
down<00:01:22.790> as<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.210> see<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.600> actuator<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
down as you can see the actuator is that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.819 
down as you can see the actuator is that
an<00:01:26.189> angle<00:01:26.610> where<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.840> holding<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.290> bed<00:01:28.560> it's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
an angle where it's holding the bed it's

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.190 
an angle where it's holding the bed it's
got<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> very<00:01:29.280> secure<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.570> needed<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.900> come

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
got a very secure but I needed to come

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.160 
got a very secure but I needed to come
back<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.950> order<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.280> go<00:01:32.400> down<00:01:32.840> and<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:34.020> why

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
back in order to go down and that's why

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.289 
back in order to go down and that's why
I<00:01:34.229> put<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.470> bungee<00:01:34.890> cord<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.729> yeah

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
I put the bungee cord on there so yeah

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.999 
I put the bungee cord on there so yeah
it's<00:01:36.509> kind<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.750> hokey<00:01:37.110> at<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> moment<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:37.860> it

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
it's kind of hokey at the moment but it

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.120 
it's kind of hokey at the moment but it
works

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.770 

because<00:01:42.130> then<00:01:42.310> that's<00:01:42.549> as<00:01:42.789> far<00:01:43.060> as<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.390> will<00:01:43.509> go

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
because then that's as far as it will go

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.060 
because then that's as far as it will go
with<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.890> actuator<00:01:45.280> doing<00:01:45.759> all<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.030> work

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
with the actuator doing all the work

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.700 
with the actuator doing all the work
I've<00:01:48.070> reversed<00:01:48.579> the<00:01:49.509> polarity<00:01:50.079> on<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.409> switch

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
I've reversed the polarity on the switch

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.219 
I've reversed the polarity on the switch
so<00:01:51.009> I'm<00:01:51.100> grounding<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.759> positive<00:01:52.299> and<00:01:53.079> now

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
so I'm grounding the positive and now

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.309 
so I'm grounding the positive and now
I'm<00:01:53.380> putting<00:01:53.590> power<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.399> negative<00:01:55.319> and

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
I'm putting power to the negative and

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.850 
I'm putting power to the negative and
I'm<00:01:57.189> going<00:01:57.520> to<00:01:57.700> use<00:01:57.939> my<00:01:58.240> actuator<00:01:58.869> if<00:01:59.649> you're

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
I'm going to use my actuator if you're

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.940
