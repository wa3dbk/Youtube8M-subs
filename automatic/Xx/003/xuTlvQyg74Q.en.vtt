00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:23.000
 higher priced models as opposed to 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:27.270
 low prices they even have a clip 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.279
 compare here are two clips together this 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.329
 the clip is made with full forgive it 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.170
 by the way make and the main manufacturers 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.040
 power tools for all their 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.920
 screwdriver 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.899
 ude volts higher priced models 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.019
 the clip is made right here is closed and 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.539
 for which I can already be drilled somewhere in 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.679
 wall some pin and hang on it 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.730
 tool when the cut is complete 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:55.710
 accordingly, I can't do it 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.620
 it means that the price is more especially high 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.800
 segment for stationary goes to keep 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.510
 under the bit you can still try it 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.970
 tear off the circle with a clear effort just like that 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.200
 I have it does not fall from any there 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.200
 let's say touch 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:25.390
 another interesting moment about the juice itself 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.939
 and Tsanava roughly this 3 speed 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.450
 cordless screwdrivers that are still 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.130
 can work in hammer drill mode and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.830
 interestingly made switch selector 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:41.159
 between modes, see 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:43.840
 spacer selector that sets 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.570
 torque limit to 3 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.819
 the brush worked and there is a separate 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.459
 selector that allows you to choose 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:54.610
 mode of operation that is, I set myself 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:57.250
 necessary torque limit 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.679
 moment translated into screwdriving 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.080
 wrap screws ratchet works 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.140
 I need to be drilled with this tool 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.459
 no need to drive this grate 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.110
 back and forth transferring to other modes and 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.450
 just switched to drilling mode 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.880
 the seeds have already been drilled with a beat have retrained 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.830
 drill with a blow if i need again 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.480
 turn the screw I already put 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.830
 torque and should not remember 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.830
 what numbers do we have 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.680
 so at least she was exhibited in actual fact 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.459
 I do not translate screwdrivers and 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.830
 wrap up further but it's already 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.680
 high-priced tools 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.069
 which has a gear case from 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.500
 magnesium alloy notice there 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.810
 assembly is assembled but it is assembled inside 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:54.200
 most of the outer part is she 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:55.840
 plastic thief chip means everything 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.299
 manufacturers professional 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.640
 tool 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:04.750
 began to gradually move on so 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.549
 called brushless motor 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.790
 these tools from any manufacturer 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:14.000
 will have the designation was motor brush 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.840
 forest motor that is the engine in which 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.280
 absent 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.099
 brushes or even have the inscription walked 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.480
 review 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.489
 the main meaning of why 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.989
 was the manufacturer now try 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:32.299
 go on brushless motors matter in 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.380
 the fact that brushless motors are much 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:39.470
 higher efficiency 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.230
 so look when we have sparkling 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:48.620
 the anchor collector we have always 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:51.380
 the transition between brush and anchor and there 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.359
 voltage drop on this transition this 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.780
 there will be at least one volt or maybe 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.930
 more 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.920
 all so 2 and that we have a fall 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:04.599
 voltage into the void just into heat 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.950
 at least two three volts if we take 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.920
 any kind of cordless screwdrivers 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.880
 10 and 8 volts and subtract from it just 2 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.160
 or 3 volts going to heat here yet 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.549
 further engine efficiency but we already 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.360
 thirty percent took and ate tax 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.260
 transition on brushes well and except that 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.540
 when I turn 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.050
 rather it but the number of nodes that 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.200
 rubbing that can fail 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.490
 screwdriver 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.730
 it only becomes well and tools with their 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:41.990
 brushless motors become possible 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.640
 use in fire hazardous areas 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.370
 it could be for example a coal mine 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.400
 that is if it is sparkling 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.750
 collector motor then 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:59.530
 explosive environment use it 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:05:02.600
 fundamentally impossible means to 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.720
 today we actively deliver 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.830
 began to import the model but it is a shock 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.620
 screwdriver means somewhere since October we already 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.140
 Let's start to import the model, too, talk with by 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.460
 brush motor but outwardly ordinary 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.460
 screwdriver with chucks 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.210
 Spartak understood charging as usual 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.890
 these sides but I'm because here 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:34.430
 let's say on every contact bank years to 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:37.740
 here as usually associated with form or 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:42.060
 related items with a controversial form 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:44.640
 mean semi 36 volt on on phosphate 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.460
 battery them goes here is the same contact 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.380
 they are sliding for the first time shall be 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.210
 applied just such a contact group 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:56.340
 for each contact for each battery 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.750
 neighboring pairs are obtained we capture 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:05.160
 each demand and 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:08.130
 but each element individually but that's 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.200
 volt and so in plugin 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.410
 battery self charger 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.440
 the device allows you to charge 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.700
 the battery fully means 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.880
 if you open the instructions on any 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.420
 screwdrivers 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.940
 with inserted batteries it says there 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.930
 before the light bulb will initiate what 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.340
 there was a full how full charge 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.370
 battery but if you 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.100
 leave the battery in the charger for 8 hours 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.570
 device and will listen even in a cycle 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.380
 the following will happen 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:46.650
 after some time the controller is all 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.889
 the matter decides the charge is turned on 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.099
 rechargeable battery increased 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:51.099
 wife
