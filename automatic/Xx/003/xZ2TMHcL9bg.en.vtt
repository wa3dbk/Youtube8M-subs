alright<00:00:02.490> Eugene<00:00:02.939> here<00:00:03.570> like<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.470> show<00:00:04.620> you<00:00:04.680> how

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
alright Eugene here like to show you how

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.540 
alright Eugene here like to show you how
to<00:00:04.920> simplify<00:00:05.609> radicals<00:00:06.480> using<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.589> product

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
to simplify radicals using the product

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.749 
to simplify radicals using the product
rule<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:09.200> radicals<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:11.160> product<00:00:11.580> rule<00:00:11.610> says

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
rule of radicals the product rule says

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.410 
rule of radicals the product rule says
that<00:00:12.420> i<00:00:13.170> can<00:00:13.679> multiply<00:00:13.950> numbers<00:00:14.389> under<00:00:15.389> a

and<00:00:20.060> have<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.300> product<00:00:21.830> under<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> radical

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
and have that product under a radical

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.460 
and have that product under a radical
then<00:00:24.240> if<00:00:24.930> needed<00:00:25.619> i<00:00:25.830> can<00:00:26.519> simplify<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.470> watch

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
then if needed i can simplify it watch

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:46.069

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
square root of stabbing equals square

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.350 
square root of stabbing equals square
root<00:01:26.270> of<00:01:26.390> 49<00:01:26.870> under<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.530> radical<00:01:27.800> but<00:01:28.460> I<00:01:28.760> know

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
root of 49 under the radical but I know

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.100 
root of 49 under the radical but I know
the<00:01:29.570> square<00:01:29.810> root<00:01:29.930> of<00:01:29.960> 49<00:01:30.440> equals<00:01:32.110> seven

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
the square root of 49 equals seven

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.170 
the square root of 49 equals seven
therefore<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:34.190> radical<00:01:35.060> x<00:01:35.720> itself<00:01:36.550> equals<00:01:37.550> the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
therefore a radical x itself equals the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.810 
therefore a radical x itself equals the
number<00:01:38.420> that<00:01:38.750> was<00:01:38.900> under<00:01:39.170> that<00:01:39.320> radical<00:01:39.820> now

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
number that was under that radical now

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.690 
number that was under that radical now
I'm<00:01:41.810> going<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.259> use<00:01:42.410> this<00:01:42.619> product<00:01:42.979> rule<00:01:43.310> in

I'm going to use this product rule in

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.620 
I'm going to use this product rule in

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.639 

all<00:02:04.399> right<00:02:04.579> I<00:02:04.610> need<00:02:04.729> them<00:02:05.030> factor<00:02:05.450> of<00:02:05.600> 20<00:02:06.229> then

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
all right I need them factor of 20 then

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.210 
all right I need them factor of 20 then
is<00:02:06.860> a<00:02:07.070> perfect<00:02:08.030> square<00:02:08.539> since<00:02:09.440> that<00:02:09.649> index<00:02:10.009> is

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
is a perfect square since that index is

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.940 
is a perfect square since that index is
a<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:16.569> that<00:02:17.569> would<00:02:17.690> be<00:02:17.840> square<00:02:18.440> root<00:02:18.500> of<00:02:18.680> four

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
a to that would be square root of four

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.990 
a to that would be square root of four
times<00:02:19.790> square<00:02:20.510> root<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.720> five<00:02:21.340> because<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.670> know

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
times square root of five because I know

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.710 
times square root of five because I know
the<00:02:23.209> square<00:02:23.420> root<00:02:23.540> of<00:02:23.599> 4<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:25.060> 2

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.380 

so<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.620> final<00:02:31.980> answer<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.490> 2<00:02:33.860> square<00:02:34.860> root<00:02:35.040> of

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
so this final answer is 2 square root of

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:52.390 
so this final answer is 2 square root of
5<00:02:36.560> next<00:02:37.560> example

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400

square<00:02:53.400> root<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.580> 18<00:02:54.060> give<00:02:54.660> me<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.780> factor<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.230> 18

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
square root of 18 give me a factor of 18

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.000 
square root of 18 give me a factor of 18
that<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.129> a<00:02:56.310> perfect<00:02:56.849> square<00:02:57.480> because<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.890> that

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
that is a perfect square because of that

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:07.009 
that is a perfect square because of that
index<00:02:59.430> that<00:03:00.000> would<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:01.879> 9<00:03:05.269> so<00:03:06.269> notice<00:03:06.660> I'm

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
index that would be 9 so notice I'm

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.720 
index that would be 9 so notice I'm
still<00:03:07.349> keeping<00:03:07.530> nine<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.130> two<00:03:08.280> hundred<00:03:08.640> of

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.040 

variables<00:04:19.120> also<00:04:21.000> square<00:04:22.000> root<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:22.300> x<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:23.020> the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
variables also square root of x to the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.750 
variables also square root of x to the
5th<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.870> largest<00:04:26.350> factor<00:04:26.590> of<00:04:26.830> X<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.400> 5th

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
5th the largest factor of X to the 5th

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.640 
5th the largest factor of X to the 5th
that<00:04:28.030> is<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.420> perfect<00:04:29.230> square<00:04:29.500> muse<00:04:31.020> X<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.380> 4

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
that is a perfect square muse X to the 4

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.070 
that is a perfect square muse X to the 4
so<00:04:35.650> i<00:04:35.680> can<00:04:35.830> write<00:04:35.950> this<00:04:36.010> as<00:04:36.220> x<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.240> 4<00:04:37.570> times

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
so i can write this as x to the 4 times

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:46.980 
so i can write this as x to the 4 times
X<00:04:38.790> but<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.900> square<00:04:41.770> root<00:04:42.130> of<00:04:42.780> x<00:04:43.780> to<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.140> 4<00:04:44.440> is<00:04:45.990> x

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
X but the square root of x to the 4 is x

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.900 
X but the square root of x to the 4 is x
squared<00:04:47.230> and<00:04:48.090> then<00:04:49.090> I<00:04:49.270> still<00:04:49.540> have<00:04:49.870> my<00:04:50.910> square

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
squared and then I still have my square

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.670 
squared and then I still have my square
root<00:04:52.150> of<00:04:52.390> x<00:04:53.580> so<00:04:54.750> can<00:04:55.750> I<00:04:55.780> still<00:04:56.080> divide<00:04:56.440> these

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
root of x so can I still divide these

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.290 
root of x so can I still divide these

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
two goes into 52 times with a remainder

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.740 
two goes into 52 times with a remainder
of<00:05:06.880> 1<00:05:08.190> remember<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.790> exponent<00:05:10.420> under<00:05:10.630> the
