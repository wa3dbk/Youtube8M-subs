00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.240
 for a Saturday afternoon in which 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.490
 ye simulate Magnetto and lobezno 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.809
 all that panda of the x-men a good 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.750
 way to do this is with this in 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.980
 masters a camÃ­ x and main marvin that 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.110
 we have in our hands 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.050
 this dice game simulates a bit to 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.210
 magical to the typical lcg allowing 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.369
 allowing players to face 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.730
 with a kind of March pre built 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.100
 and that we are taking letters in each 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.380
 turn and two letters because here they are dice 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.480
 let's see how it works 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.340
 in beige master we have three types 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.110
 basic dice on the one hand are the 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.120
 character dice that are specific 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.740
 of each of the characters that 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.260
 are reflected in the letters by 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.960
 example here we have the cyclops worth there 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.470
 three cards in this basic set for each 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.970
 character 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.920
 we will have this cycle that we can 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.960
 take one and here already tells us the 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.030
 color a bit of the dice and also the 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.190
 special way that you have are how you see 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.390
 so brown and the cycle viewer appears 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.190
 that in addition to energy in the form of 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.080
 star and lightning bolt 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.030
 and we have for example here the man of 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.000
 ice that we have as greenish you see 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.510
 here that they have a lake with the star 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.060
 it was ice and also energy in 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.560
 lightning form a thing of two for each 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.970
 one of the characters that we have in the 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.150
 basic box and you have then those of 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.130
 juggernaut for example those of angel or 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.190
 the ninth is to say everyone has 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.450
 his own dice two for each character 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.000
 then we have a kind of something special 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.770
 that are like weaker characters 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.380
 all in white with the drawing on 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.770
 black that is called manuel sema comparsas 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.080
 they are like secondary characters that are 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.840
 weaker versions of these degrees of 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.970
 character and third in third place 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.790
 we have this kind of colored dice 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.150
 there are pink oranges there are browns and there are 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.979
 some more in violet color that are verbs 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.800
 of actions worth these are the three 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.740
 types basically this game is based on 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.290
 have a reserve of lakes as if it were 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.540
 a deck of cards that starts for example 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.100
 with eight comparsas and have 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.899
 available on one side characters 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.979
 special each player will have theirs 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.690
 and shares common to both 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.129
 players according to valls is going 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.569
 developing the game we can go 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.370
 increasing our reserve of 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.250
 ice creams that were in an opaque bag 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.720
 we can not see her buying characters 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.510
 or buying shares and in each shift 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.489
 we will roll the dice and we have to 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.410
 use the actions or rather the 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.940
 results that come to us within the 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.760
 We love the character like those of comparsa 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.709
 they have two basic sides modes functions 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.920
 basic problem provide energy from 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.700
 various types of radio or shield 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.440
 fist mask and we also have a 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.989
 question that is a bit generic 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.150
 as a wild card and on the other hand have a 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.650
 character or a face let's say that 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.569
 activate attack that in this case is 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.370
 a pawn as you see with some numbers that 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.650
 they represent the level that is needed 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.940
 to stop to explain it I think there 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.609
 that stop to deploy the attacks your 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.019
 defense if we see a character we will see 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.040
 that energy can be better 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.440
 because for example here we have two 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.879
 lightning rays is worth and the character 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.859
 It is also better here in the letter we 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.450
 indicates the levels that are more expensive 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.319
 deploy but also brings us 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.200
 more attack and more defense 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.139
 dust is this basically comes being 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.400
 so I have already started for example as os 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.780
 he said with eight comparsas that 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.670
 will be in an opaque bag and can not 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.139
 have already my turn I will take four dice 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.780
 without seeing logically at the beginning they will be 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.450
 I'll throw four comparsas and I'll have to 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.569
 decide what to the energy loads 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.480
 You can use them to buy other 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.849
 given for example I can buy dice from 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.829
 character or I can buy dice from 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.900
 action we are going to action has a cost 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.180
 of energy that comes here indicated in 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.560
 this case fix the three are three for 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.689
 these are two letters in one that we 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.969
 indicates they simply remain or are like a 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.560
 kind of guide plus the letter itself in 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:52.000
 Syria and several letters of action and 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.680
 we can choose either randomly or 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.780
 choosing us the letters that 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.489
 We want to use good because it tells me that 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.870
 costs three energies of any kind 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.969
 so I could use all three for 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.920
 buy a die that would go to me to my 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:05.440
 used reservation 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.090
 could use we use them for 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.590
 buy characters but yes for 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.569
 buy a character I need to have 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.550
 energy of the determined type for example 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.489
 to buy the name of ice I need 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.910
 4 energies of which one at 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.950
 less should be ray-type worth because 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.389
 it's there so that as they throw me there 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.150
 I could have done it 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.760
 get lightning at least and of course 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.260
 4 energy this way as I have 4 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.740
 of energy of which one meets the 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.050
 requirement yes I could have bought 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.900
 this is this given that the same thing 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.979
 I would take it to my reservation be it 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.340
 whatever it is I can buy for example 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.510
 from these sides then I use these three 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.370
 these three fingers and then with that 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.930
 it remains so can I have a zone of 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.880
 deployment where I can deploy it to 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.919
 try to attack my rival my rival 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.440
 You can block with played characters 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.479
 that he has and that way he will take damage 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.979
 is a character or mine or both or 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.930
 well directly the player who is the 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.669
 objective if I do not want to attack I can 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.380
 leave it prepared waiting for a defense 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.220
 is well worth living style car 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.410
 game 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.910
 later I would take 4 again you will return 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.680
 to throw et cetera what happens when I get 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.030
 finish the dice I will have to recover 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.910
 fill the bag with those already there 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.680
 bought in addition to the used ones so if 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.420
 com asked of these that I write them 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.820
 a bit like it goes or if you asked 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.530
 characters if I can afford it is possible 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.180
 that in a following a next turn 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.140
 catch four grams you take the dice 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.120
 special 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.160
 I think it will give me more advantage over everything 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.310
 with powerful attacks to try 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.310
 take my rival's life when my 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.900
 rival reaches zero he got then he 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.300
 the game ends because the one that is left 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.640
 alive wins these dice action which is 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.270
 they are a little different they give us two 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.220
 generic energy points is worth it or we 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.600
 allow to perform the action of the letter 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.760
 to each of these letters that's why the 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.220
 since in the same color as the letter 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.870
 indicates allow us to perform the action 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.150
 that here comes for example inflicting damage 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.980
 or what the letter binds the bums 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.320
 can also have action of the letter 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.690
 with an asterisk or even action of the 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.190
 letter with two asterisks if they do not come out 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.900
 these new addition to the action 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.460
 we will have to execute obligatorily 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.909
 of cantona this album as the two 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.740
 Asterisks according to the face that comes out 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:14.770
 let's say immediate bursts that's not 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.510
 optional and that's what this dais consists of 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.760
 masters 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.440
 a good way and a little cheaper 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.110
 to use the engine of a living car 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.120
 game in a dice game is also 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.180
 very well themed and we 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.920
 allows us to expand our deck rather 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.350
 in our dice reserve of a 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.070
 surprising way with the typical envelopes 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.070
 collectables
