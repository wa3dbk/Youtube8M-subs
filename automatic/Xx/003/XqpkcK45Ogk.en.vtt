00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.310
 This is my first video and I will show you 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.090
 make a pretty pretty pendant 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:18.640
 we will use a cd drawn with the pencil 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.030
 and a crescent and I cut with the 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.030
 scissors 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.130
 The pendant used egg shell 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:33.150
 hit him I made two layers in that and 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.370
 stuck two with a normal glue 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.470
 from the tip of the first line 6 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.680
 centimeters I made that drawing 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.530
 because I liked it 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.140
 chosen the two enamels to be able 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.820
 paint us you can choose 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.300
 tempera or acrylic paints or what 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.300
 have brands 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.810
 the egg shell was well stuck and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.640
 dry 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.680
 trimmed with scissors and then the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.460
 filed at the edges to make it more 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.280
 soft 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.770
 I have used is the glue is a 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.329
 glue sticking everything 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.329
 to wood leather 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.159
 in the mouse queue used the tail of 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.679
 mouse to be able to do it 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.990
 unused chains is worth because 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.590
 chains could not 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.690
 could not 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.820
 to make a hole in 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.710
 at the tips of the cde because I was 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.080
 they broke up so what I used is 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.080
 rope mouse to be able to make the rope 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.689
 I have cut all the strips 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.080
 I do not know the measure but you can 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.530
 use the measure you want of the long 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.530
 of the pendant 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.040
 and so that the tips have pasted the 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.710
 tips 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.700
 of both sides of the rope in the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.700
 cde tips 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.290
 and so that the tips of 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.850
 the tail of the mouse what I have done is 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.710
 catch another piece of mouse tail and 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.960
 cover it with the shaping tips 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.410
 given about 5 laps 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.930
 and I 've stuck with 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.200
 with the glue this they had for 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.200
 home 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.420
 As you can see I already have it painted 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.540
 of that color so medium 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.540
 in fact two lines with 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.630
 every time you cut the queue for all 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.210
 more tips because that way it will stay 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.110
 better because if I do not I do not know 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.110
 it slows down 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.190
 the enamel I have spent about three or 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.190
 four times so that it stayed well 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.900
 Once passed gave him a past 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.940
 let dry well because if you do not 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.260
 spoiled 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.260
 you have to measure the length 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.630
 you have to find half of the 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.550
 pendant or rope to be able 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.550
 put the terminals and the carabiner 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.020
 they betrayed me very well 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.540
 I have chosen some tiny terminals 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.540
 why 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.150
 the tail of mouse was that it came out 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.370
 these terminals I bought them on ebay not 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.209
 they are so copper colored I bought them makes 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.209
 a couple of weeks 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.840
 the burning of the tips as I say 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.670
 whenever you cut you burn the tips and 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.150
 I have put a little bit of glue on 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.280
 this we have 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.019
 and I have not bought either silicone or another 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.870
 glue because as I had this can 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.390
 be used this 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.490
 it's a little weird glue because it 's 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.460
 so yellowish and 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.110
 It is a little doughy seems gum by 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.090
 that came to the ground, little by little so that 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.310
 I did not leave the yellow color so 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.090
 strong 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.810
 and let it dry a little rÃ¡ting and 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.810
 I put the terminal 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.050
 and it's pretty strong 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.169
 if the other end 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.729
 the materials are very easy to 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.949
 find are a cedÃ© that you do not need 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.400
 that you are not going to miss and shell 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.400
 of egg and 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.440
 the only thing you can buy 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.050
 because this pendant 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.270
 the materials you will have at home what 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.480
 only one that you may need to go will be 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.830
 the terminals the mouse tail the 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.830
 carabiner and the big one 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.960
 because I believe that the other materials 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.960
 you have it at home 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.060
 Now I'm going to put him 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.979
 the tweezers 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.410
 the end of the terminal 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.840
 and as you can see is the result 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.639
 this is the video if you liked it 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.639
 you can subscribe 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:17.450
 if you can give me I like to give it to me 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.450
 also like a little kiss
