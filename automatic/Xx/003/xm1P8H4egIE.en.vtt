the reward you get from this quest isn't

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.390 
the reward you get from this quest isn't
amazing<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:24.470> it's<00:01:25.470> still<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> good<00:01:25.890> ring<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
amazing but it's still a good ring and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.740 
amazing but it's still a good ring and
it<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.610> probably<00:01:26.820> replace<00:01:27.180> any<00:01:27.390> one<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.689> you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
it can probably replace any one that you

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.109 
it can probably replace any one that you
get<00:01:28.020> from<00:01:28.290> other<00:01:29.280> quests<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:32.000> it's<00:01:33.000> pretty

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
get from other quests but it's pretty

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.630 
get from other quests but it's pretty
good<00:01:33.500> new<00:01:34.500> freaking<00:01:34.860> majors<00:01:35.250> most<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
good new freaking majors most of the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.670 
good new freaking majors most of the
tape<00:01:35.820> since<00:01:36.060> its<00:01:36.240> reflect<00:01:36.659> spell<00:01:36.990> damage<00:01:37.229> and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
tape since its reflect spell damage and

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.480 
tape since its reflect spell damage and
I<00:01:38.000> think<00:01:39.770> reflect<00:01:40.770> spells<00:01:41.100> something<00:01:41.400> like

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
I think reflect spells something like

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.160 
I think reflect spells something like
twelve<00:01:41.790> percent<00:01:42.150> dependent<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.869> level

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
twelve percent dependent it's level

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.649 
twelve percent dependent it's level
dependent<00:01:43.530> anyway<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.210> depends<00:01:45.509> but<00:01:45.570> you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
dependent anyway so just depends but you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.149 
dependent anyway so just depends but you
have<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:45.930> level<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.320> think<00:01:46.649> there's<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.979> level

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
have to be level I think there's a level

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.740 
have to be level I think there's a level
yeah<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.610> think<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> little

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
yeah I think it's to be a little

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.840 
yeah I think it's to be a little
tentative<00:01:49.250> strain<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:52.340> I'm<00:01:53.340> not<00:01:53.579> entirely

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
