00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
back the feel of a really well-built

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.340 
back the feel of a really well-built
1970s<00:00:20.340> type<00:00:20.880> DSLR<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.869> e<00:00:21.900> m5<00:00:22.080> was

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
1970s type DSLR and the e m5 was

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.349 
1970s type DSLR and the e m5 was
definitely<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> step<00:00:22.980> up<00:00:23.160> as<00:00:23.369> far<00:00:23.550> as<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.939> micro

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
definitely a step up as far as the micro

definitely a step up as far as the micro
four-thirds<00:00:24.570> cameras<00:00:25.260> went<00:00:25.500> for<00:00:26.189> design<00:00:26.490> but

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
four-thirds cameras went for design but

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.400 
four-thirds cameras went for design but
there's<00:00:27.539> always<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.779> feeling<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.289> can

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
there's always a feeling that you can

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.689 
there's always a feeling that you can
push<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.680> little<00:00:28.769> bit<00:00:29.130> further<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
push that a little bit further and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.060 
push that a little bit further and
olympus<00:00:30.420> has<00:00:30.539> done<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.199> year<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
olympus has done that this year with the

em1<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.969> shaped<00:00:33.270> very<00:00:33.510> similar<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> e<00:00:34.050> m5

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
em1 it's shaped very similar to the e m5

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.840 
em1 it's shaped very similar to the e m5
in<00:00:34.649> terms<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.950> size<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.520> little<00:00:35.730> bit

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
in terms of size it's a little bit

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.090 
in terms of size it's a little bit
bigger<00:00:36.090> has<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.630> slightly<00:00:36.960> larger<00:00:37.200> grip<00:00:37.620> but

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
bigger has a slightly larger grip but

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.770 
bigger has a slightly larger grip but
across<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> board<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.390> feels<00:00:39.570> like

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
across the board it just feels like

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.209 
across the board it just feels like
there<00:00:39.989> was<00:00:40.110> more<00:00:40.320> attention<00:00:40.770> paid<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
there was more attention paid to the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.280 
there was more attention paid to the
little<00:00:41.520> small<00:00:41.760> details<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.629> way<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> dials

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
little small details the way the dials

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.590 
little small details the way the dials
feel<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.680> way<00:00:43.770> they<00:00:43.800> click<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.910> resistance

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
feel the way they click the resistance

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.080 
feel the way they click the resistance
the<00:00:45.899> way<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> buttons<00:00:47.160> feel<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.789> soon<00:00:47.910> as<00:00:48.030> you

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the way the buttons feel as soon as you

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.510 
the way the buttons feel as soon as you
pick<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:49.620> feels<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.010> way<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
pick it up it just it feels the way a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.029 
pick it up it just it feels the way a
high-end<00:00:51.090> camera<00:00:51.270> should<00:00:51.629> feel<00:00:51.930> which<00:00:52.920> is

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
high-end camera should feel which is

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.590 
high-end camera should feel which is
good<00:00:53.190> because<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.489> also<00:00:53.820> costs<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.570> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
good because it also costs what a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.569 
good because it also costs what a
high-end<00:00:54.930> camera<00:00:55.140> might<00:00:55.620> cost<00:00:55.860> one<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
high-end camera might cost one of the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.189 
high-end camera might cost one of the
reasons<00:00:56.850> why<00:00:57.000> Olympus<00:00:57.239> has<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.870> know<00:00:57.960> gone

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
reasons why Olympus has you know gone

reasons why Olympus has you know gone
and<00:00:58.410> really<00:00:58.680> paid<00:00:59.280> attention<00:00:59.309> all<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.910> fine

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and really paid attention all the fine

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the big things we really love is the two

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.960 
the big things we really love is the two
by<00:01:34.079> two<00:01:34.140> control<00:01:34.680> scheme<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.159> what<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.939> is

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
by two control scheme and what that is

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.359 
by two control scheme and what that is
is<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.869> camera<00:01:37.170> itself<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.619> which<00:01:37.979> there's

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
is on the camera itself is which there's

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.980 
is on the camera itself is which there's
a<00:01:38.460> one<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.729> A<00:01:38.790> two<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.000> basically<00:01:39.570> allows<00:01:39.810> you

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
a one and A two and basically allows you

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.230 
a one and A two and basically allows you
to<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.860> two<00:01:41.009> dials<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.490> top<00:01:41.700> customize

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
to have the two dials on top customize

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
to have the two dials on top customize
to<00:01:42.420> your<00:01:42.450> liking<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.960> one<00:01:43.380> mode<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.770> then<00:01:43.860> you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
to your liking in one mode and then you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.440 
to your liking in one mode and then you
can<00:01:44.070> instantly<00:01:44.369> switch<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.909> another<00:01:45.180> mode

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
can instantly switch it to another mode

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
can instantly switch it to another mode
so<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:46.380> example<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.799> want<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.009> control<00:01:47.189> is

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
so for example if you want to control is

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.969 
so for example if you want to control is
0<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.990> then<00:01:49.290> suddenly<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.649> want<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.860> switch

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
0 and then suddenly you want to switch

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.510 
0 and then suddenly you want to switch
over<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.579> same<00:01:50.790> dial<00:01:51.119> control

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
over and have that same dial control

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.560 
over and have that same dial control
aperture<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.850> do<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.390> really

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
aperture you can do that it's a really

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.690 
aperture you can do that it's a really
easy<00:01:54.750> way<00:01:54.990> customize<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.799> camera<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.640> can

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
easy way customize the camera so you can

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.010 
easy way customize the camera so you can
shoot<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.909> way<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.390> want<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.960> course

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
shoot the way that you want of course

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.109 
shoot the way that you want of course

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
lenses don't really do much if the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.740 
lenses don't really do much if the
camera<00:02:02.040> doesn't<00:02:02.340> take<00:02:02.549> create<00:02:02.820> images<00:02:03.149> so

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
camera doesn't take create images so

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.950
