the<00:00:44.760> images<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:46.020> here<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.350> go<00:00:46.500> first<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.190> in

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
the images so here we go first one in

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.380 
the images so here we go first one in
this<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.200> it's<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.530> 0<00:00:50.219> 1<00:00:50.460> 2<00:00:50.579> 3<00:00:50.610> 4<00:00:50.940> 5<00:00:51.120> so

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
this one is it's like 0 1 2 3 4 5 so

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.240 
this one is it's like 0 1 2 3 4 5 so
they<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.660> learn<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.440> flip<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.800> over<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
they can learn that you flip it over and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.850 
they can learn that you flip it over and
what<00:00:53.910> about<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.300> number<00:00:54.570> line<00:00:54.750> 0<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.260> 5<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
what about the number line 0 to 5 so it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.720 
what about the number line 0 to 5 so it
learns<00:00:56.039> about<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.730> then<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:58.039> 9<00:00:59.039> he's

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
learns about that then we have 9 he's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.450 
learns about that then we have 9 he's
got<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.059> order<00:01:00.300> by<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.480> way<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.620> 9<00:01:01.920> cars

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
