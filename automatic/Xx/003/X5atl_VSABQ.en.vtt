and 12 to the stomach now then the
firing<00:01:29.909> speeds<00:01:30.210> now<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.570> m4<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> fastest

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
firing speeds now the m4 is the fastest

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.530 
firing speeds now the m4 is the fastest
of<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.920> three<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.520> gorillaz<00:01:32.970> ever<00:01:33.180> so

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
of the three but the gorillaz ever so

slightly faster than the AK and I'll

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.800 
slightly faster than the AK and I'll
repaired<00:01:35.700> again<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.030> slow<00:01:36.210> motion<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.780> that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
repaired again in slow motion so that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.390 
repaired again in slow motion so that
you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.229> see<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> difference<00:01:37.890> between<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
you can see the difference between the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:47.330 
you can see the difference between the
three

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.430 

reload<00:01:48.340> speeds<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:49.030> AK<00:01:49.420> has<00:01:49.600> fastest<00:01:50.229> of<00:01:50.409> the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
reload speeds the AK has fastest of the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.800 
reload speeds the AK has fastest of the
three<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.040> Galil<00:01:51.400> has<00:01:51.670> slowest<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.720> I'll

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
three and the Galil has slowest and I'll

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.270 
three and the Galil has slowest and I'll
replayed<00:01:53.110> again<00:01:53.320> in<00:01:53.440> slow<00:01:53.680> motion<00:01:53.890> so<00:01:54.250> that

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
replayed again in slow motion so that

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.880 
replayed again in slow motion so that
you<00:01:54.490> can<00:01:54.610> see<00:01:54.760> the<00:01:54.909> difference

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.560 

you

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.899 

the<00:02:06.200> Galil<00:02:06.530> in<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.830> m4<00:02:07.190> actually<00:02:07.610> had<00:02:07.760> the

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
the Galil in the m4 actually had the

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.029 
the Galil in the m4 actually had the
same<00:02:08.149> draw<00:02:08.600> speed<00:02:08.960> but<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.380> AK<00:02:09.710> is<00:02:09.830> slightly

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
same draw speed but the AK is slightly

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.800 
same draw speed but the AK is slightly
slower<00:02:10.340> than<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.610> two<00:02:10.820> I'll<00:02:11.090> replayed<00:02:11.570> again

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
slower than the two I'll replayed again

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.360 
slower than the two I'll replayed again
slow<00:02:12.140> motion<00:02:12.500> so<00:02:12.710> that<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:12.950> can<00:02:13.100> see<00:02:13.250> the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
slow motion so that you can see the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.960 
slow motion so that you can see the
difference<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:15.250> then<00:02:16.250> finally<00:02:16.430> my<00:02:16.820> own

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
difference and then finally my own

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.699 
difference and then finally my own
opinion<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.450> gun<00:02:17.600> now<00:02:17.780> first<00:02:18.410> off<00:02:18.560> when

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
opinion of the gun now first off when

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.620 
opinion of the gun now first off when
you<00:02:18.800> pick<00:02:18.920> up<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.130> gun<00:02:19.310> well<00:02:20.000> when<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.300> started

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
you pick up the gun well when I started

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.150 
you pick up the gun well when I started
using<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.050> gun<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.200> thought<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:21.590> was<00:02:21.740> great

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
using the gun I thought this was great

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.760 
using the gun I thought this was great
it<00:02:22.670> had<00:02:22.880> high<00:02:23.060> power<00:02:23.330> fairly<00:02:24.050> decent<00:02:24.380> firing

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
it had high power fairly decent firing

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.040 
it had high power fairly decent firing
rate<00:02:24.980> all<00:02:25.490> that<00:02:25.700> kind<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:25.940> malarkey<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.450> then

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
rate all that kind of malarkey and then

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.290 
rate all that kind of malarkey and then
you<00:02:27.530> start<00:02:27.860> spraying<00:02:28.160> with<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.700> you

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
you start spraying with it and you

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.940 
you start spraying with it and you
notice<00:02:29.660> recoil<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.670> its<00:02:31.670> massive<00:02:31.820> why<00:02:32.890> why<00:02:33.890> is

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
notice recoil and its massive why why is

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.640 
notice recoil and its massive why why is
the<00:02:34.280> recall<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.090> huge<00:02:35.840> on<00:02:36.140> this<00:02:36.320> gun<00:02:36.500> it's

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
the recall so huge on this gun it's

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.680 
the recall so huge on this gun it's
ridiculous<00:02:37.400> literally<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:37.970> first<00:02:38.180> two<00:02:38.480> shots

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
ridiculous literally the first two shots

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.000 
ridiculous literally the first two shots
are<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:38.989> only<00:02:39.170> two<00:02:39.440> shots<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.800> will<00:02:39.890> go<00:02:39.980> on

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
are the only two shots that will go on

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.310 
are the only two shots that will go on
target<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.550> rest<00:02:40.790> will<00:02:41.000> go<00:02:41.110> skyrocketing<00:02:42.110> I

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
target the rest will go skyrocketing I

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.060 
target the rest will go skyrocketing I
don't<00:02:42.980> know<00:02:43.040> why<00:02:43.900> it's<00:02:44.900> like<00:02:45.200> they've<00:02:45.830> taken

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
don't know why it's like they've taken

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.160 
don't know why it's like they've taken
the<00:02:46.250> ache<00:02:46.400> right<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:47.060> AK<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.600> then<00:02:47.720> doubled

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
the ache right the AK and then doubled

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.850 
the ache right the AK and then doubled
the<00:02:48.290> recoil<00:02:48.910> why<00:02:50.080> it's<00:02:52.540> it's<00:02:53.540> ludicrous<00:02:53.989> but<00:02:54.680> I

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
the recoil why it's it's ludicrous but I

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.470 
the recoil why it's it's ludicrous but I
mean<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.400> gun<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.880> good<00:02:56.239> fun<00:02:56.510> it's<00:02:57.470> not<00:02:58.480> really

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
mean the gun is good fun it's not really

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.900 
mean the gun is good fun it's not really
like<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.680> you're<00:03:00.980> not<00:03:01.220> going<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.459> get<00:03:01.580> a<00:03:01.640> bad

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
like it you're not going to get a bad

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.550 
like it you're not going to get a bad
gun<00:03:02.209> with<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.510> it's<00:03:02.660> just<00:03:02.959> you've<00:03:03.230> got<00:03:03.440> it

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
gun with it it's just you've got it

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.790 
gun with it it's just you've got it
you've<00:03:03.769> got<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.670> manage<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:05.180> recall<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:06.440> much

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
you've got to manage that recall so much

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.080 
you've got to manage that recall so much
you've<00:03:07.430> got<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.570> little<00:03:09.190> like<00:03:10.190> room<00:03:10.580> for<00:03:10.910> error

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
you've got so little like room for error

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.990 
you've got so little like room for error
with<00:03:11.360> this<00:03:11.540> gun<00:03:11.810> if<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:13.220> if<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.459> just

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
with this gun if it if you just

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.490 
with this gun if it if you just
literally<00:03:14.330> spray<00:03:14.690> with<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.930> gun<00:03:15.080> you<00:03:15.350> get

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
literally spray with the gun you get

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.430 
literally spray with the gun you get
pretty<00:03:15.709> much<00:03:15.830> dead<00:03:16.190> if<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.489> don't<00:03:17.350> handle<00:03:18.350> the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
pretty much dead if you don't handle the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.650 
pretty much dead if you don't handle the
recoil<00:03:18.590> as<00:03:18.920> such<00:03:19.070> but<00:03:19.700> I<00:03:19.760> mean<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.390> gun<00:03:20.540> itself

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
recoil as such but I mean the gun itself

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.810 
recoil as such but I mean the gun itself
is<00:03:21.200> fairly<00:03:21.380> good<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:21.890> like<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.250> sound<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:22.670> like

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
is fairly good I like the sound I like

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.020 
is fairly good I like the sound I like
the<00:03:23.000> skin<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.780> reload<00:03:24.620> near<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.790> drawer

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
the skin that the reload near the drawer

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.850 
the skin that the reload near the drawer
speeds<00:03:26.299> pretty<00:03:26.540> good<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.989> firing<00:03:27.410> rates<00:03:27.590> good

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
speeds pretty good the firing rates good

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.470 
speeds pretty good the firing rates good
I<00:03:29.920> mean<00:03:30.920> there's<00:03:31.100> not<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.280> lot<00:03:31.549> bad<00:03:31.850> with<00:03:32.239> the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
I mean there's not a lot bad with the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.640 
I mean there's not a lot bad with the
gun<00:03:32.690> it's<00:03:33.049> just<00:03:33.380> that<00:03:34.030> Rijo<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.510> such<00:03:36.350> a

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
gun it's just that Rijo is such a

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.170 
gun it's just that Rijo is such a
downside<00:03:37.519> to<00:03:37.850> it<00:03:37.880> I<00:03:39.040> was<00:03:40.040> expecting<00:03:40.310> less<00:03:40.790> for

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
downside to it I was expecting less for

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.800 
downside to it I was expecting less for
a<00:03:41.410> black-market<00:03:42.410> gun<00:03:42.799> but<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:43.160> mean<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:44.239> is

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
a black-market gun but I mean it is

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.289 
a black-market gun but I mean it is
different<00:03:45.079> it<00:03:45.440> is<00:03:45.739> challenging<00:03:46.280> it<00:03:46.880> is<00:03:46.910> quite

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
different it is challenging it is quite

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.479 
different it is challenging it is quite
you<00:03:47.989> won't<00:03:48.230> have<00:03:48.410> to<00:03:48.530> put<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.680> lot<00:03:48.920> of<00:03:48.950> time<00:03:49.280> into

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
you won't have to put a lot of time into

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.569 
you won't have to put a lot of time into
getting<00:03:49.640> used<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:50.540> this<00:03:50.660> gun<00:03:50.959> but<00:03:51.260> if<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:52.400> want

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
getting used to this gun but if you want

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.180 
getting used to this gun but if you want
something<00:03:52.640> that<00:03:53.450> hardly<00:03:53.930> anyone<00:03:54.380> has<00:03:54.799> and

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
something that hardly anyone has and

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.520 
something that hardly anyone has and
hardly<00:03:55.549> anyone<00:03:55.790> uses<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.450> can<00:03:56.630> partly

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
hardly anyone uses I can partly

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.710 
hardly anyone uses I can partly
understand<00:03:58.040> why<00:03:58.250> but<00:03:58.700> I<00:03:58.850> mean<00:03:59.269> if<00:03:59.390> you<00:03:59.540> want

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
understand why but I mean if you want

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.330 
understand why but I mean if you want
this<00:04:00.049> gun<00:04:00.320> you're<00:04:00.560> going<00:04:00.709> to<00:04:00.769> be<00:04:00.860> one<00:04:01.160> in

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
this gun you're going to be one in

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.930 
this gun you're going to be one in
probably<00:04:01.760> a<00:04:02.140> hundred<00:04:03.140> or<00:04:03.650> 400<00:04:04.370> or<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:04.579> people

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
probably a hundred or 400 or so people

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.000 
probably a hundred or 400 or so people
that<00:04:05.480> will<00:04:05.810> actually<00:04:05.930> bother<00:04:06.290> using<00:04:06.500> this<00:04:06.799> gun

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
that will actually bother using this gun

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.050 
that will actually bother using this gun
because<00:04:08.350> no<00:04:09.350> I<00:04:09.560> haven't<00:04:09.890> seen<00:04:10.190> this<00:04:10.310> gun<00:04:10.549> once

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
because no I haven't seen this gun once

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.090 
because no I haven't seen this gun once
since<00:04:11.810> it's<00:04:12.049> been<00:04:12.200> out<00:04:12.410> like<00:04:12.560> I<00:04:12.620> saw<00:04:12.829> her<00:04:12.890> a<00:04:12.980> few

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
since it's been out like I saw her a few

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.860
