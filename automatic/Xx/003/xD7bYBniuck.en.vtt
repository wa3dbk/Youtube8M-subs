anything go on to anything else either

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.690 
anything go on to anything else either
he'll<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.689> stays<00:01:34.100> well<00:01:35.100> away<00:01:35.130> from<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
he'll just stays well away from the

he'll just stays well away from the
inside<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.150> buggy<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.860> didn't<00:01:37.860> notice

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
inside of the buggy and didn't notice

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.149 
inside of the buggy and didn't notice
any<00:01:38.159> moisture<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.670> battery<00:01:39.060> either<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:40.409> I

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
any moisture on the battery either so I

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.620 
any moisture on the battery either so I
would<00:01:41.790> suggest<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.649> most<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.040> water

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
would suggest that most of the water

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.880 
would suggest that most of the water
assumes<00:01:45.630> you're<00:01:45.810> not<00:01:45.930> running<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.770> know

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
assumes you're not running in you know

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.940 
assumes you're not running in you know
into<00:01:47.549> standing<00:01:48.000> water<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.630> think<00:01:49.619> most<00:01:49.770> of

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
into standing water I think most of

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.289 
into standing water I think most of
water<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.220> actually<00:01:50.340> coming<00:01:50.729> off<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:50.970> these

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
wheels you know big spray effects rather

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.310 
wheels you know big spray effects rather
than<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.470> she<00:01:55.649> coming<00:01:55.979> into<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> car<00:01:56.549> and

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
than that she coming into the car and

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.990 
than that she coming into the car and
which<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.500> good<00:01:58.740> they<00:01:59.159> had<00:01:59.369> dust<00:01:59.579> that's<00:01:59.820> what

going to get some more footage of this
we've<00:02:56.730> got<00:02:56.910> some<00:02:57.660> GoPros<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.440> Mobius<00:03:00.200> cameras

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
we've got some GoPros and Mobius cameras

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.750 
we've got some GoPros and Mobius cameras
that<00:03:01.410> we<00:03:01.500> can<00:03:01.680> stick<00:03:01.950> on<00:03:02.070> this<00:03:02.250> in<00:03:02.370> various

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
that we can stick on this in various

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.180 
that we can stick on this in various
positions<00:03:03.530> one<00:03:04.530> thing<00:03:04.770> we're<00:03:04.890> going<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.130> be

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
positions one thing we're going to be

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.430 
positions one thing we're going to be
looking<00:03:05.310> at<00:03:05.580> doing<00:03:07.190> if<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.340> look<00:03:08.550> where<00:03:09.440> these

looking at doing if you look where these
males<00:03:10.830> are<00:03:11.959> consuming<00:03:12.959> on<00:03:13.050> this<00:03:13.230> camera

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
males are consuming on this camera

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.870 
males are consuming on this camera
there's<00:03:15.360> plenty<00:03:16.080> of<00:03:16.160> places<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.810> attach<00:03:18.810> stuff

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
there's plenty of places to attach stuff

there's plenty of places to attach stuff
so<00:03:20.880> what<00:03:21.030> we're<00:03:21.209> looking<00:03:21.239> at<00:03:21.540> going<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.780> be

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
so what we're looking at going to be

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.840 
so what we're looking at going to be
doing<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.600> just<00:03:24.930> pop<00:03:25.320> that<00:03:25.350> back<00:03:25.800> on

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850

alright so what we want to be out there
is<00:03:33.030> fpv<00:03:33.570> this<00:03:33.840> but<00:03:34.230> we<00:03:34.320> want<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.590> be<00:03:34.680> able<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.920> do

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
is fpv this but we want to be able to do

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.460 
is fpv this but we want to be able to do
in<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.250> way<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.670> is<00:03:35.820> if<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.750> rolls<00:03:36.930> over<00:03:37.170> it's

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
in a way that is if it rolls over it's

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.130 
in a way that is if it rolls over it's
not<00:03:37.620> going<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.830> knacker<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:39.140> transmitter

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
not going to knacker the transmitter

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.740 
not going to knacker the transmitter
lots<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.739> bog<00:03:40.920> about<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.400> aerial<00:03:41.820> that's<00:03:42.570> on

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
lots of bog about the aerial that's on

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.110 
lots of bog about the aerial that's on
an<00:03:42.840> extender<00:03:43.410> anyway<00:03:43.799> and<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.730> was<00:03:44.910> probably

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
an extender anyway and it was probably

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.610 
an extender anyway and it was probably
just<00:03:45.330> going<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.630> have<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.780> whole<00:03:46.019> job<00:03:46.260> strength

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
just going to have a whole job strength

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.590 
just going to have a whole job strength
for<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:46.860> similar<00:03:47.190> spoiler<00:03:47.640> run<00:03:48.330> through

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
for that similar spoiler run through

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.240 
for that similar spoiler run through
that<00:03:48.750> gap<00:03:48.959> there<00:03:49.260> an<00:03:49.440> app<00:03:49.709> so<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.010> have<00:03:50.130> an

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
that gap there an app so you have an

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.759 
that gap there an app so you have an
area<00:03:50.430> like<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:51.110> standards<00:03:52.110> omnidirectional

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
area like that standards omnidirectional

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.070 
area like that standards omnidirectional
and<00:03:53.459> doesn't<00:03:54.150> need<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.299> be<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.450> patch<00:03:54.630> antenna

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
and doesn't need to be a patch antenna

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.949 
and doesn't need to be a patch antenna
on<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.260> ground<00:03:55.560> vehicle<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.720> especially<00:03:57.720> the

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
on a ground vehicle and especially the

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.140 
on a ground vehicle and especially the
range<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.290> we<00:03:58.440> saw<00:03:58.680> driving<00:03:59.489> this<00:03:59.670> anyway

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
range that we saw driving this anyway

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.180 
range that we saw driving this anyway
and<00:04:00.360> but<00:04:01.170> what<00:04:01.290> we're<00:04:01.440> looking<00:04:01.709> at<00:04:01.769> doing<00:04:01.980> is

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
and but what we're looking at doing is

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.140 
and but what we're looking at doing is
putting<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.640> hoop<00:04:03.530> between<00:04:04.530> these<00:04:04.799> two<00:04:05.190> towers

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
putting a hoop between these two towers

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.539 
putting a hoop between these two towers
so<00:04:06.930> be<00:04:07.110> up<00:04:07.140> like<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.680> del<00:04:07.980> Allah<00:04:08.250> and

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
so be up like that and del Allah and

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.300 
so be up like that and del Allah and
have<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.690> camera<00:04:10.410> here<00:04:11.299> because<00:04:12.299> I<00:04:12.480> reckon<00:04:13.310> if

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
have the camera here because I reckon if

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.259 
have the camera here because I reckon if
you<00:04:14.459> look<00:04:14.730> at<00:04:14.970> her<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:17.430> just<00:04:17.669> about<00:04:17.880> get<00:04:18.090> that

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
you look at her and just about get that

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.220 
you look at her and just about get that
in<00:04:18.450> line<00:04:19.400> you<00:04:20.400> see<00:04:20.930> there's<00:04:21.930> quite<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.560> bit<00:04:22.830> of

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
in line you see there's quite a bit of

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.460 
in line you see there's quite a bit of
quite<00:04:25.230> a<00:04:25.260> bit<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.650> height<00:04:26.220> there<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.990> I<00:04:28.080> reckon

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
quite a bit of height there and I reckon

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.220 
quite a bit of height there and I reckon
if<00:04:28.920> we<00:04:29.100> can<00:04:29.220> get<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:29.460> in<00:04:29.580> there<00:04:29.880> it'll<00:04:30.870> stop<00:04:31.200> the

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
if we can get it in there it'll stop the

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.150 
if we can get it in there it'll stop the
camera<00:04:31.650> from<00:04:31.920> becoming<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:33.870> know<00:04:34.040> broken<00:04:35.040> or

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
camera from becoming you know broken or

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.770 
camera from becoming you know broken or
damaged<00:04:35.610> in<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.850> event<00:04:36.150> of<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.330> rollover

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
wolves curves in all the rest of it it's

solid no bother at all some people have
asked<00:05:09.300> about<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.630> battery<00:05:11.510> this<00:05:12.510> is<00:05:12.630> the

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
asked about the battery this is the

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.360 
asked about the battery this is the
battery<00:05:13.110> turner<00:05:14.270> g4s<00:05:15.270> familiar<00:05:15.660> 2's<00:05:16.350> it's<00:05:17.250> a

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
battery turner g4s familiar 2's it's a

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.270 
battery turner g4s familiar 2's it's a
hard<00:05:17.610> case<00:05:17.790> back<00:05:18.320> and<00:05:19.320> getting<00:05:19.770> 10<00:05:19.980> minutes

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
hard case back and getting 10 minutes

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.770 
hard case back and getting 10 minutes
runtime<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:23.430> that's<00:05:23.669> flat-out<00:05:24.330> pretty

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
runtime and and that's flat-out pretty

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.920 
runtime and and that's flat-out pretty
much<00:05:25.880> giving<00:05:26.880> it<00:05:26.970> loads<00:05:27.180> of<00:05:27.330> stick<00:05:27.570> and<00:05:27.810> that

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
much giving it loads of stick and that

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.890 
much giving it loads of stick and that
was<00:05:28.050> in<00:05:28.169> wet<00:05:28.380> grass<00:05:28.410> so<00:05:29.040> I<00:05:29.250> would<00:05:30.090> imagine<00:05:30.210> in

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
was in wet grass so I would imagine in

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.990 
was in wet grass so I would imagine in
different<00:05:31.440> circumstances<00:05:31.770> and<00:05:32.400> run<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.580> warmer

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
different circumstances and run a warmer

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.510 
different circumstances and run a warmer
day<00:05:33.030> it<00:05:33.810> would<00:05:34.169> probably<00:05:34.470> be<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:34.890> may<00:05:35.370> be<00:05:35.430> a

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
day it would probably be it may be a

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.080 
day it would probably be it may be a
fraction<00:05:36.030> longer<00:05:36.500> but<00:05:37.500> temenus<00:05:37.980> is<00:05:38.190> that's

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
fraction longer but temenus is that's

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.680 
fraction longer but temenus is that's
fine<00:05:39.360> i'm<00:05:39.600> used<00:05:40.200> to<00:05:40.380> planes<00:05:41.160> that<00:05:41.340> give<00:05:41.610> me<00:05:41.790> in

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
fine i'm used to planes that give me in

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.659 
fine i'm used to planes that give me in
some<00:05:42.960> circumstances<00:05:43.290> to<00:05:43.919> two<00:05:44.310> or<00:05:44.400> three

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
some circumstances to two or three

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:52.130 
some circumstances to two or three
minutes<00:05:44.850> runtime<00:05:45.240> and<00:05:48.710> this<00:05:49.710> thing<00:05:50.600> the<00:05:51.600> older

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
minutes runtime and this thing the older

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.180 
minutes runtime and this thing the older
FS<00:05:52.620> gt3<00:05:53.520> see<00:05:54.080> well<00:05:55.080> there's<00:05:55.590> a<00:05:55.650> reason<00:05:55.710> why<00:05:56.130> is

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
FS gt3 see well there's a reason why is

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.730 
FS gt3 see well there's a reason why is
cheap<00:05:56.550> and<00:05:56.760> that's<00:05:57.060> because<00:05:57.270> it<00:05:57.600> is<00:05:57.750> made<00:05:58.680> out

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
cheap and that's because it is made out

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.690 
cheap and that's because it is made out
of<00:05:59.450> crap<00:06:00.450> components<00:06:01.110> basically<00:06:01.590> and<00:06:01.800> it<00:06:02.490> does

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
of crap components basically and it does

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.530 
of crap components basically and it does
the<00:06:02.820> job<00:06:03.030> it's<00:06:04.640> you<00:06:05.640> know<00:06:05.669> it's<00:06:05.970> a

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
the job it's you know it's a

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.719 
the job it's you know it's a
three-channel<00:06:07.760> 2.4<00:06:08.760> gig<00:06:09.560> transmitter<00:06:10.729> does

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.930 
three-channel 2.4 gig transmitter does
the<00:06:11.880> job<00:06:12.120> it's<00:06:12.990> fine<00:06:13.860> you<00:06:14.430> know<00:06:14.550> for<00:06:14.820> my

the job it's fine you know for my

the job it's fine you know for my
purposes<00:06:15.450> it's<00:06:16.020> absolutely<00:06:16.620> fine<00:06:16.830> it's

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
purposes it's absolutely fine it's

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.719 
purposes it's absolutely fine it's
nowhere<00:06:17.970> even<00:06:18.120> close<00:06:18.270> to<00:06:18.600> the<00:06:18.990> quality<00:06:19.200> of

futaba or spectrum or anything like that

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.750 
futaba or spectrum or anything like that
but<00:06:23.540> yeah<00:06:24.540> it's<00:06:25.290> built<00:06:25.560> a<00:06:25.740> price<00:06:26.010> main

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
but yeah it's built a price main

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.980 
but yeah it's built a price main
complaint<00:06:27.330> and<00:06:27.570> the<00:06:28.500> phone<00:06:28.740> on<00:06:29.220> here<00:06:29.780> it<00:06:30.780> just

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
complaint and the phone on here it just

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.700 
complaint and the phone on here it just
it<00:06:31.140> just<00:06:31.169> falls<00:06:31.500> off<00:06:31.650> or<00:06:31.970> it<00:06:32.970> goes<00:06:33.539> closer<00:06:34.289> to

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
it just falls off or it goes closer to

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.430 
it just falls off or it goes closer to
the<00:06:35.360> transmitter<00:06:36.360> body<00:06:36.690> itself

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
the transmitter body itself

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.620 
the transmitter body itself
easily<00:06:37.980> and<00:06:38.340> then<00:06:38.700> it<00:06:38.820> jumps<00:06:39.120> the<00:06:39.180> steering<00:06:39.540> up

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
easily and then it jumps the steering up

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.220 
easily and then it jumps the steering up
so<00:06:39.780> you<00:06:39.870> can<00:06:40.020> see<00:06:40.050> that<00:06:41.810> there's<00:06:42.810> supposed<00:06:43.140> to

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230 
so you can see that there's supposed to

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.850 
so you can see that there's supposed to
spring<00:06:43.500> back<00:06:43.820> move<00:06:44.820> this<00:06:45.030> sponge<00:06:45.960> away<00:06:46.110> and

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
spring back move this sponge away and

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.700 
spring back move this sponge away and
obviously<00:06:47.280> goes<00:06:47.490> back<00:06:47.730> again<00:06:48.440> they<00:06:49.440> said<00:06:49.620> it

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
obviously goes back again they said it

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.230 
obviously goes back again they said it
come<00:06:49.860> out<00:06:49.950> for<00:06:50.160> you<00:06:50.220> told<00:06:50.430> it<00:06:50.580> looks<00:06:50.760> tacky<00:06:51.060> as

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
come out for you told it looks tacky as

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.910 
come out for you told it looks tacky as
hell<00:06:51.300> already<00:06:52.370> but<00:06:53.370> looks<00:06:54.150> like<00:06:54.270> 30<00:06:54.900> quid<00:06:55.170> I'll

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920 
hell already but looks like 30 quid I'll

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.430 
hell already but looks like 30 quid I'll
go<00:06:56.070> wrong<00:06:56.250> Kenya<00:06:56.580> really<00:06:56.880> i<00:06:57.150> think<00:06:57.870> the<00:06:58.080> total

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 
go wrong Kenya really i think the total

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.090 
go wrong Kenya really i think the total
spend<00:06:58.710> here<00:06:59.010> is<00:06:59.780> around<00:07:00.780> about<00:07:00.960> a<00:07:01.440> hundred<00:07:01.800> and

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
spend here is around about a hundred and

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.620 
spend here is around about a hundred and
ten<00:07:02.400> quid<00:07:03.000> for<00:07:03.270> the<00:07:03.390> car<00:07:03.660> and<00:07:03.690> the<00:07:04.250> transmitter

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630 
ten quid for the car and the transmitter

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.860 
ten quid for the car and the transmitter
maybe<00:07:06.630> another<00:07:06.900> fake<00:07:07.230> which<00:07:07.530> the<00:07:07.680> batteries

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
maybe another fake which the batteries

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.600 
maybe another fake which the batteries
cheap<00:07:09.870> as<00:07:10.110> chips<00:07:10.140> I<00:07:10.800> don't<00:07:11.100> think<00:07:11.160> you<00:07:11.340> can<00:07:11.460> do

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610 
cheap as chips I don't think you can do

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.250 
cheap as chips I don't think you can do
any<00:07:11.790> better<00:07:11.820> is<00:07:12.780> it's<00:07:13.410> quick<00:07:13.740> enough<00:07:14.040> it's<00:07:15.260> you

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:16.260 
any better is it's quick enough it's you

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.590 
any better is it's quick enough it's you
know<00:07:16.350> it<00:07:16.710> is<00:07:17.010> agile<00:07:17.550> it's<00:07:17.790> the<00:07:18.120> steering's

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 
know it is agile it's the steering's
