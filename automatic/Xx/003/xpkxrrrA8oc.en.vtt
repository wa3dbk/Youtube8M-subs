 goo 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.560
 This is bent and tortuous properly because it does not have to say that not a FLET of beans 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.970

 Hmm 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.210
 First of all, this is half , so one octave name of the open string comes out. 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.200
 Now from here Once you have 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:29.880
 This from nut 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.909
 Half of the 12th fret is n't chocolate rock, but it's not half communication, but from scratch 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.140
 It will be 17 minutes later It is half in distance 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.140

 Thus the phone south 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:06.670
 First, my rice planting of burger of open strings will continue to appear at the point where going to half half 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:08.810
 Raised by pulling topped luck carefully this kind of face we make change for the grandchildren at a major for more and more narrowly and coin

 Boo Boo Niño

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.140
 I'm the same sound is this is Poi 1/3 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.740
 Hey! 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:37.700
 After the nine touching 1 point 4 of the 5 minutes 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:42.739
 16 red is also used because it is this, but it is almost this to use so often 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.480
 1/3 points 7 frets 9 frets and 12 frets in half 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.480
 After 4 minutes and increasing 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.750

 I think the kana hope this side also us remember a 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.489
 In this way , the harmony shoes do not come out at a point where they make a fraction of their performance 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.640
 Is it 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.420
 So it also determines the pitch, so use it 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.900
 a 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:28.780
 India road cars are good, backings are good and still good 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.750
 I also mix and say that play in that harmonics 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.490
 I made a simple phrase in

 5 Touch to make that sound 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.950
 It is a phrase 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.880
 Then let's play or not 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.880
 So let's go one more time 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.009
 Four days 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.249
 Hmm
