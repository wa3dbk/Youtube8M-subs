shred<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.229> by<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.409> way<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.770> comes<00:01:06.040> in<00:01:06.600> shreds

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
shred and by the way it comes in shreds

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.620 
shred and by the way it comes in shreds
and<00:01:07.899> it<00:01:08.020> also<00:01:08.200> comes<00:01:08.649> in<00:01:09.070> chunks<00:01:09.820> so<00:01:10.000> that<00:01:10.240> you

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
and it also comes in chunks so that you

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.690 
and it also comes in chunks so that you
can<00:01:10.869> shred<00:01:11.140> it<00:01:11.320> yourself<00:01:11.679> or<00:01:11.950> that<00:01:12.369> you<00:01:12.520> can

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
can shred it yourself or that you can

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.969 
can shred it yourself or that you can
slice<00:01:13.090> it<00:01:13.329> into<00:01:13.600> cheese<00:01:13.990> for<00:01:14.350> sandwiches<00:01:14.799> or

very specific diet to get it to get

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.440 
very specific diet to get it to get
something<00:01:32.619> that<00:01:32.770> looks<00:01:33.219> and<00:01:33.520> smells<00:01:33.969> and

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
something that looks and smells and

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.660 
something that looks and smells and
tastes<00:01:34.990> like<00:01:35.079> cheese<00:01:35.560> but<00:01:35.920> does<00:01:36.340> not<00:01:36.460> have

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
tastes like cheese but does not have

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.550 
tastes like cheese but does not have
those<00:01:36.819> three<00:01:37.090> things<00:01:37.270> it's<00:01:37.659> really<00:01:37.749> kind<00:01:38.439> of<00:01:38.469> a

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
those three things it's really kind of a

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.520 
those three things it's really kind of a
conundrum<00:01:38.829> but<00:01:39.579> then<00:01:39.729> on<00:01:39.850> top<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:40.240> it<00:01:40.539> to<00:01:41.409> get

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
conundrum but then on top of it to get

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.859 
conundrum but then on top of it to get
something<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.130> melts<00:01:43.030> like<00:01:43.210> real<00:01:43.569> cheese

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
something that melts like real cheese

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.160 
something that melts like real cheese
well<00:01:44.259> this<00:01:44.829> is<00:01:45.399> where<00:01:45.819> this<00:01:46.179> cheese<00:01:46.479> is<00:01:46.810> having

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
well this is where this cheese is having

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.599 
well this is where this cheese is having
shoulders<00:01:47.499> above<00:01:47.770> everything<00:01:48.009> else<00:01:48.249> because

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
shoulders above everything else because

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:49.950 
shoulders above everything else because
it<00:01:48.729> doesn't<00:01:49.090> have<00:01:49.179> gluten<00:01:49.539> doesn't<00:01:49.689> have

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
it doesn't have gluten doesn't have

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.859 
it doesn't have gluten doesn't have
casein<00:01:50.409> doesn't<00:01:51.310> have<00:01:51.460> soy<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:52.060> it<00:01:52.210> melts

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
casein doesn't have soy and it melts

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.249
