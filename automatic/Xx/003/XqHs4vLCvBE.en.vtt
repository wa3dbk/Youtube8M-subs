00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.830
 the ball greets dijon on the paper 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.090
 days should be favorite yet 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.110
 there is little difference between the two teams 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.220
 laval 10th dijon 7th the dijonnais relegated 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.140
 of league 1 must do better 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.090
 he's suffering right now they're coming out 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.820
 of a win after a run of seven 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.140
 unsuccessful matches and lunch that 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.180
 decides to take the match at arm's length 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.820
 body outside with this first 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.170
 possibility the center the recovery admits 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.480
 yet not because the ball is 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.410
 picked up by the Laval goaltender is the 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.620
 substitute goalkeeper mike vanhamel who 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.570
 replace balijon absent for this match of 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.890
 work still in prospect for van 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.870
 damme is she on this shot but the 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.190
 ball is well captured the keeper 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.050
 replacing Laval is showing himself at the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.850
 height remains to his attackers a 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.770
 also to be in tune because 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.810
 it's still dijon that still dominated 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.980
 a strike that will miss the 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.420
 dijonnais are nevertheless deprived of 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.930
 a lot of offensive players jovial 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.490
 courgnaud thil are not there and 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.170
 maybe laval who finally shows up 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.490
 attack with this balloon recovered in the 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.290
 surface to repair 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.600
 the center back and here is the strike 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.820
 she is saved by the guardian of Dijon 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.530
 baptist reynet only one opportunity in 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.280
 this first period for laval she 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.560
 was pretty clear 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.280
 laval may have a chance in second 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.390
 period 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.799
 Laval residents have tried to insist 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.999
 but it's still dijon because the 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.469
 most opportunities of the laval match and 

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:31.149
 on two consecutive wins that 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.909
 have it rather trust the mayennais 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.789
 right now but he suffers against a 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.130
 dijon team who always rebels 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.399
 the Dijonnais who are in the process of 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.399
 revive 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.940
 and with this balloon in the surface of 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.620
 repair and the carton pulled out by 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.230
 the referee the second is the 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.720
 change of the match pape pie learns this 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.760
 red card in the 59th minute and dijon 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.090
 who dominate and end up at ten against 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.620
 eleven 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.510
 from then on it's much simpler for 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.850
 Laval, who scores the first goal 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.870
 thanks to jérôme lebouc three minutes 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.900
 only after the red card 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.210
 Dijon 62nd minute laval leads 1 0 2nd 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.880
 goal of the season for lebouc dijon 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.520
 try to come back with one or two 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.600
 interesting situations 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.160
 equalization is always possible even 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.560
 to ten against eleven with here this shot 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.580
 closed angle and mike vanhamel in half 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.470
 time saving his camp 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.630
 the advantage for the Dijonnais is 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.340
 always incisive to even to new nice 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.840
 hit square but it does not pass they 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.060
 are cursed the Dijonnais on this match 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.400
 and Laval residents are ultra realistic 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.380
 with the second goal it is signed stone 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.739
 talmont the 68th minute 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.959
 this is his first goal of the season and 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.440
 here is laval leading 2-0 after having 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.209
 suffered many opportunities the superiority 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.250
 digital has helped Laval residents 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.720
 in this match because dijon fails 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.820
 to return at the end of the match the tangos 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.650
 can insist and why not mark 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.549
 a third goal passes it back and 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.160
 was the goal of julien viale 87th 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.530
 minute superb score for laval 3 0 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.500
 against dijon this is the fourth goal of 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.299
 the season for Julien viale and that's it 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.130
 how dijon having dominated the match 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.519
 fall back in it by losing 3 0 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.519
