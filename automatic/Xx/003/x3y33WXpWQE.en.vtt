arena<00:00:52.590> itself<00:00:53.039> which<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.030> weird<00:00:54.780> because<00:00:54.899> some

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
arena itself which is weird because some

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.290 
arena itself which is weird because some
people<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> different<00:00:56.640> arena<00:00:56.879> when<00:00:57.210> they

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
people see a different arena when they

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.860 
people see a different arena when they
go<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> same<00:00:57.870> place<00:00:58.079> because<00:00:58.920> I've<00:00:59.070> been

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
go in the same place because I've been

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.849 
go in the same place because I've been
discovered<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.260> has<00:01:01.410> been<00:01:01.530> discovered

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
discovered this has been discovered

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.630 
discovered this has been discovered
before<00:01:02.359> but<00:01:03.359> uh<00:01:03.860> they<00:01:04.860> get<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> different<00:01:05.309> real

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
before but uh they get a different real

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.310 
before but uh they get a different real
and<00:01:05.820> they<00:01:05.880> go<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.119> same<00:01:06.270> location<00:01:06.320> because

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
and they go in the same location because

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.359 
and they go in the same location because
I<00:01:07.439> looked<00:01:07.650> at<00:01:07.770> where<00:01:07.950> they<00:01:08.070> weren't<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
I looked at where they weren't in the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.149 
I looked at where they weren't in the
map<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.260> found<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.350> out<00:01:10.560> before<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.979> even

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
map but I found this out before I even

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.690 
map but I found this out before I even
flipped<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.090> YouTube<00:01:12.390> actually<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.409> me<00:01:14.369> me

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
flipped on YouTube actually and me me

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.530 
flipped on YouTube actually and me me
and<00:01:14.729> my<00:01:14.850> friend<00:01:15.119> actually<00:01:15.270> did<00:01:17.030> it's<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.180> shark

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and my friend actually did it's a shark

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.499 
and my friend actually did it's a shark
attack<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:19.049> these<00:01:19.200> billboards<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:21.240> I

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
attack on these billboards and what I

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.859 
attack on these billboards and what I
suggest<00:01:22.140> shark<00:01:22.860> attack<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:24.360> relative

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
suggest shark attack is it's a relative

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.390 
suggest shark attack is it's a relative
to<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> shark<00:01:25.409> attack<00:01:25.710> TLC<00:01:27.350> which<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
to the shark attack TLC which is the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.420 
to the shark attack TLC which is the
shark<00:01:30.090> gun<00:01:30.710> that's<00:01:31.710> what<00:01:31.890> I'm<00:01:31.979> thinking

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
shark gun that's what I'm thinking

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.450 
shark gun that's what I'm thinking
that's<00:01:32.579> about<00:01:36.320> this<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> weird<00:01:37.860> kinky<00:01:38.130> face

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
that's about this is a weird kinky face

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.389 
that's about this is a weird kinky face
is<00:01:38.610> still<00:01:38.700> gotta<00:01:38.939> say<00:01:39.150> about<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.590> it's<00:01:40.590> huge
