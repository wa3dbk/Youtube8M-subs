00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
their PCI Express video capture card now

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.850 
their PCI Express video capture card now
this<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.880> an<00:00:09.000> internal<00:00:09.330> device<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.080> there<00:00:10.590> I

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
this is an internal device and there I

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.459 
this is an internal device and there I
like<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.000> idea<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.330> internal<00:00:12.750> device<00:00:12.990> capture

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
like the idea of internal device capture

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.320 
like the idea of internal device capture
cards<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.980> these<00:00:14.610> things<00:00:14.790> can<00:00:15.059> do<00:00:15.150> all<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
cards and these things can do all the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.939 
cards and these things can do all the
processing<00:00:15.509> for<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.350> you'll<00:00:16.830> have

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
processing for you and you'll have

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.260 
processing for you and you'll have
something<00:00:17.130> on<00:00:17.310> your<00:00:17.400> desk<00:00:17.580> they're<00:00:17.970> really

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
on the box we have gasps we should have

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.429 
on the box we have gasps we should have
a<00:00:24.510> PCI<00:00:25.080> Express<00:00:25.350> card<00:00:25.769> inside<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:27.439> component

butter<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.509> demonstration<00:01:27.960> I'm<00:01:28.320> going

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
butter for this demonstration I'm going

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.109 
butter for this demonstration I'm going
to<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.770> using<00:01:28.890> HDMI<00:01:29.340> because<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> bit<00:01:29.820> plug<00:01:30.000> in

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
to be using HDMI because a bit plug in

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.249 
to be using HDMI because a bit plug in
my<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.680> Xbox<00:01:31.680> into<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.009> thing<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:33.259> let's

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
my and Xbox into this thing so let's

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.140 
my and Xbox into this thing so let's
have<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> look<00:01:34.770> software<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.640> see<00:01:35.759> how<00:01:35.880> simple

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
have a look software and see how simple

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.190 
have a look software and see how simple
it<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.630> use<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.259> thing<00:01:38.509> okay<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.540> here's

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it is to use this thing okay so here's

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200 
it is to use this thing okay so here's
the<00:01:40.290> software<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.670> quite<00:01:42.000> literally

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the software and it's quite literally

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.109 
the software and it's quite literally
called<00:01:42.450> stream<00:01:42.750> catcher<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:44.009> go<00:01:44.280> into<00:01:44.490> my

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
called stream catcher if we go into my

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.889 
called stream catcher if we go into my
old<00:01:45.360> programs<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.460> have<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> look<00:01:47.729> for<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.869> a

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
old programs and have a look for on a

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.670 
old programs and have a look for on a
minute<00:01:49.170> think<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:50.509> there<00:01:51.540> yes<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.409> called

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
minute think it's there yes it's called

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.469 
minute think it's there yes it's called
stream<00:01:53.009> capture<00:01:53.369> once<00:01:53.939> you've<00:01:54.060> installed<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
stream capture once you've installed the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.630 
stream capture once you've installed the
software<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.170> latest<00:01:55.439> version<00:01:55.640> it's

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
software is the latest version it's

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.010 
software is the latest version it's
really<00:01:56.850> quite<00:01:57.030> simple<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.509> put<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.840> on

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
really quite simple just put this on

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.359 
really quite simple just put this on
full<00:01:58.469> screen<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.670> get<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> better<00:02:00.030> idea<00:02:00.119> so

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
full screen you get a better idea so

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.069 
full screen you get a better idea so
we'll<00:02:02.369> start<00:02:02.579> from<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.880> top<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> list<00:02:03.930> on

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
we'll start from the top of the list on

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.870 
we'll start from the top of the list on
the<00:02:04.170> left<00:02:04.350> hand<00:02:04.500> side<00:02:04.770> you've<00:02:05.159> got<00:02:05.189> snapshot

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
the left hand side you've got snapshot

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
the left hand side you've got snapshot
files<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.450> that's<00:02:06.630> literally<00:02:07.200> where<00:02:07.590> you've

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
files so that's literally where you've

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.820 
files so that's literally where you've
taken<00:02:07.920> screenshots<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:09.020> take<00:02:10.020> screenshot<00:02:10.619> if

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830

was<00:08:04.600> exactly<00:08:04.930> what<00:08:05.080> you<00:08:05.170> would<00:08:05.290> see<00:08:05.470> straight

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:06.190 
was exactly what you would see straight

from the Xbox

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.660
