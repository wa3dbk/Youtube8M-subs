00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
here you want to put that on the second

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.950 
here you want to put that on the second
springboard<00:01:46.320> page<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.390> springboard<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.600> mean

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
springboard page and springboard I mean

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.090 
springboard page and springboard I mean
newsstand<00:01:49.439> itself<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.520> third<00:01:50.880> ok<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.100> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
newsstand itself on the third ok so the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.270 
newsstand itself on the third ok so the
glitch<00:01:53.399> has<00:01:54.210> three<00:01:54.810> steps<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.590> of

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
glitch has three steps to it and of

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.569 
glitch has three steps to it and of
course<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:57.689> first<00:01:57.930> step<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.680> press<00:01:59.430> your

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
course the first step is to press your

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.639 
course the first step is to press your
home<00:01:59.850> button<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.299> when<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.509> do<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.469> does

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
home button so when you do that it does

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.160 
home button so when you do that it does
Oh<00:02:01.860> sir<00:02:02.159> not<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:03.180> when<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.780> press<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
Oh sir not that but when you press the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.440 
Oh sir not that but when you press the
home<00:02:04.350> button<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.219> happens<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.729> goes

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
home button this is what happens it goes

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.900 
home button this is what happens it goes
back<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> first<00:02:07.229> page<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.920> your<00:02:08.009> swing

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
back to the first page of your swing

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.999 
back to the first page of your swing
board<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.450> what<00:02:10.440> I'm<00:02:10.500> doing<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.860> you

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
board so what I'm doing that you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.770 
board so what I'm doing that you
probably<00:02:11.220> can't<00:02:11.459> see<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.640> because<00:02:11.819> um

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
probably can't see it because um

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.480 
probably can't see it because um
you<00:02:12.900> know<00:02:12.990> it's<00:02:13.170> kind<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.410> dark<00:02:13.530> in<00:02:13.680> here<00:02:13.830> so

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
you know it's kind of dark in here so

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.340 
you know it's kind of dark in here so
yeah<00:02:15.060> that's<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.450> first<00:02:15.690> step<00:02:15.840> second<00:02:16.319> step

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
yeah that's the first step second step

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.970 
yeah that's the first step second step
is<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.830> whole<00:02:17.130> down<00:02:17.550> newsstand<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:19.770> do

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
is the whole down newsstand and we do

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.980 
is the whole down newsstand and we do
that<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.400> turns<00:02:20.790> back<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.300> first<00:02:21.480> page<00:02:21.690> but

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
that it turns back to the first page but

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.270 
that it turns back to the first page but
also<00:02:22.560> you're<00:02:23.040> holding<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.610> down<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:25.350> yet<00:02:26.040> this

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
also you're holding it down so yet this

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.910 
also you're holding it down so yet this
is<00:02:26.550> what<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.150> looks<00:02:27.300> like<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.660> click<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.590> hold

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
is what it looks like you click and hold

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.000 
is what it looks like you click and hold
so<00:02:29.700> that's<00:02:29.880> that's<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.600> first<00:02:31.260> two<00:02:31.500> steps<00:02:31.739> and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
so that's that's the first two steps and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.650 
so that's that's the first two steps and
the<00:02:32.100> last<00:02:32.340> step<00:02:32.459> you're<00:02:32.730> going<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.910> need<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.180> to

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
the last step you're going to need is to

so<00:03:58.980> those<00:03:59.190> are<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.370> tips<00:03:59.670> and<00:03:59.880> let<00:04:00.120> me

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
so those are the tips and let me

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.840 
so those are the tips and let me
demonstrate<00:04:00.570> this<00:04:00.900> again<00:04:01.380> so<00:04:01.829> this<00:04:02.489> time<00:04:02.519> I'll

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
demonstrate this again so this time I'll

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.800 
demonstrate this again so this time I'll
be<00:04:02.970> counting<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.450> here<00:04:04.320> we<00:04:04.350> go<00:04:04.500> one<00:04:04.859> to<00:04:05.310> 0<00:04:05.810> then

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
be counting and here we go one to 0 then

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.849 
be counting and here we go one to 0 then
1<00:04:06.959> 1<00:04:07.230> 2<00:04:08.070> 3<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.970> as<00:04:09.570> you<00:04:09.930> can<00:04:10.079> see<00:04:10.109> it<00:04:10.440> did<00:04:10.680> work

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
1 1 2 3 and as you can see it did work

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.330 
1 1 2 3 and as you can see it did work
and<00:04:11.239> boom<00:04:12.239> it's<00:04:12.540> in<00:04:12.630> there<00:04:12.780> now<00:04:13.260> with<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:13.980> same

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
and boom it's in there now with the same

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.880 
and boom it's in there now with the same
technique<00:04:14.880> you<00:04:15.120> can<00:04:15.299> also<00:04:15.540> put<00:04:15.810> apps<00:04:16.079> in<00:04:16.470> new

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
technique you can also put apps in new

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.340 
technique you can also put apps in new
