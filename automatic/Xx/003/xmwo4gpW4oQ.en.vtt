I were in my last video I said it was
January<00:00:43.649> 12<00:00:43.979> but<00:00:44.909> again<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> rumor<00:00:46.350> so

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
January 12 but again that was a rumor so

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.559 
January 12 but again that was a rumor so
it<00:00:46.800> wasn't<00:00:46.949> exactly<00:00:47.159> true<00:00:47.699> it<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.059> close

it wasn't exactly true it was close
enough<00:00:48.989> i<00:00:49.229> guess<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.769> missed<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.670> by<00:00:50.699> like<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
enough i guess it missed it by like a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.149 
enough i guess it missed it by like a
month<00:00:51.359> but<00:00:51.809> officially<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.440> remember<00:00:52.859> Sony

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
said it was on in March so at least our

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:57.889 
said it was on in March so at least our

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
estimates were close enough that we got

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.869 
estimates were close enough that we got
it<00:00:57.989> right<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.289> between<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.949> that's<00:00:59.699> pretty
