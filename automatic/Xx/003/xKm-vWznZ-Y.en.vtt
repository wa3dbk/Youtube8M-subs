00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
right down here and they would type it

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.230

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
single web browser by the way so it

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.170 
single web browser by the way so it
doesn't<00:01:43.770> matter<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.490> Google<00:01:44.820> Chrome

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.399 
doesn't matter if it's a Google Chrome

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
or as you can see I'm using Firefox so

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.350 
or as you can see I'm using Firefox so
then<00:01:53.040> let's<00:01:53.340> say<00:01:53.460> say<00:01:53.670> what<00:01:53.970> should<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.210> done

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
then let's say say what should be done

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.700 
then let's say say what should be done
to<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> carpenter<00:01:54.990> who<00:01:55.079> builds<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> house<00:01:55.530> that

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
to a carpenter who builds a house that

to a carpenter who builds a house that
falls<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.189> kills<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> owner<00:01:56.670> well<00:01:57.360> if<00:01:57.570> I

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
falls and kills the owner well if I

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.420 
falls and kills the owner well if I
believe<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.380> he<00:01:58.469> should<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.770> sued<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.280> was

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
believe that he should be sued I was

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.590 
believe that he should be sued I was
just<00:01:59.579> simply<00:01:59.700> right<00:02:00.060> he<00:02:00.869> should<00:02:01.909> be<00:02:02.909> sued

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
just simply right he should be sued

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.539 
just simply right he should be sued
now<00:02:03.960> I'm<00:02:04.259> participating<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.100> one<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.490> a

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
now I'm participating in this one as a

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.109 
now I'm participating in this one as a
student<00:02:06.210> but<00:02:06.689> if<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.170> want<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.970> foster<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
student but if I want to foster the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.400 
student but if I want to foster the
discussion<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.660> could<00:02:09.840> ask<00:02:09.989> follow-up

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
discussion I could ask follow-up

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.140 
discussion I could ask follow-up
questions<00:02:10.530> for<00:02:11.400> example<00:02:11.459> how<00:02:12.090> much

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
questions for example how much

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.530 
questions for example how much
should<00:02:14.150> he<00:02:14.870> be<00:02:15.250> sued<00:02:16.250> for<00:02:17.440> raid<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:20.269> we<00:02:20.360> can

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
should he be sued for raid and we can

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.059 
should he be sued for raid and we can
continue<00:02:20.959> with<00:02:21.080> that<00:02:21.260> now<00:02:21.379> that's<00:02:21.560> one<00:02:21.890> way<00:02:22.040> to

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
continue with that now that's one way to

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.530 
continue with that now that's one way to
have<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.430> discussion<00:02:22.909> the<00:02:23.000> other<00:02:23.030> way<00:02:23.360> would

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
have the discussion the other way would

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.390 
have the discussion the other way would
be<00:02:23.569> to<00:02:23.659> use<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.110> text<00:02:24.379> feature<00:02:24.560> right<00:02:24.890> here

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
be to use the text feature right here

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.809 
be to use the text feature right here
and<00:02:26.080> that<00:02:27.080> would<00:02:27.230> enable<00:02:27.470> me<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:28.040> simply<00:02:28.580> say

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
and that would enable me to simply say

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:35.619 
and that would enable me to simply say
how<00:02:29.659> much<00:02:30.370> should<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:32.319> plaintiffs<00:02:33.549> get<00:02:34.629> and

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
how much should the plaintiffs get and

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:36.430 
how much should the plaintiffs get and
of<00:02:35.720> course<00:02:35.900> I'm<00:02:35.989> gonna<00:02:36.140> miss<00:02:36.260> spell

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
of course I'm gonna miss spell

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.449 
of course I'm gonna miss spell
plaintiff's<00:02:36.890> good<00:02:37.040> as<00:02:37.099> well

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
plaintiff's good as well

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.300 
plaintiff's good as well
spelling<00:02:37.790> ain't<00:02:37.940> my<00:02:38.030> thing<00:02:38.829> so<00:02:39.829> that's<00:02:40.010> one

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
spelling ain't my thing so that's one

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.720 
spelling ain't my thing so that's one
way<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:40.549> could<00:02:40.730> probably<00:02:41.720> use<00:02:42.470> twiddlin<00:02:43.280> in<00:02:43.519> the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
way I could probably use twiddlin in the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.819 
way I could probably use twiddlin in the
classroom<00:02:44.180> now<00:02:44.360> I'm<00:02:45.349> gonna<00:02:45.530> show<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.709> some

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
classroom now I'm gonna show you some

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.110 
classroom now I'm gonna show you some
other<00:02:46.010> features<00:02:46.069> and<00:02:46.579> I'm<00:02:46.640> gonna<00:02:46.730> clear<00:02:46.940> this

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
other features and I'm gonna clear this

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.210 
other features and I'm gonna clear this
page<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.690> go<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.109> another<00:02:48.620> way<00:02:48.859> I<00:02:48.890> think<00:02:49.040> that

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
page and go to another way I think that

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.830 
page and go to another way I think that
it<00:02:49.400> could<00:02:49.549> be<00:02:49.640> used<00:02:49.879> and<00:02:50.090> I've<00:02:50.720> already

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
it could be used and I've already

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.720 
it could be used and I've already
uploaded<00:02:51.109> some<00:02:51.440> images<00:02:51.859> so<00:02:52.069> this<00:02:52.340> image<00:02:52.519> is

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
uploaded some images so this image is

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
rafael's so I've uploaded it here now

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.420 
rafael's so I've uploaded it here now
you<00:02:56.510> can<00:02:56.599> see<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.900> trash<00:02:57.140> can<00:02:57.470> up<00:02:57.709> here<00:02:58.280> if<00:02:58.370> I

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
you can see the trash can up here if I

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.800 
you can see the trash can up here if I
simply<00:02:58.730> want<00:02:58.909> to<00:02:58.970> drag<00:02:59.239> this<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.599> trash

tremendous amount of detail so I could

uses that you could use for example

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.529

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
could go down here through the widgets

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.340 
could go down here through the widgets
and<00:05:16.040> code<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.490> embed<00:05:16.580> things<00:05:16.940> but<00:05:17.900> this<00:05:18.050> and

I've<00:05:18.500> just<00:05:18.650> got<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:18.979> volume<00:05:19.130> down<00:05:19.430> so<00:05:19.669> it

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
I've just got the volume down so it

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.950 
I've just got the volume down so it
doesn't<00:05:19.790> cause<00:05:20.180> any<00:05:20.300> problems<00:05:20.720> but<00:05:20.810> it's

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
doesn't cause any problems but it's

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.450 
doesn't cause any problems but it's
about<00:05:21.139> binge<00:05:21.350> drinking<00:05:21.770> so<00:05:21.919> I<00:05:21.950> could<00:05:22.310> as<00:05:22.430> a

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
about binge drinking so I could as a

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.010 
about binge drinking so I could as a
teacher<00:05:22.790> for<00:05:23.060> example<00:05:23.389> use<00:05:23.570> this<00:05:23.810> for<00:05:23.990> a

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
teacher for example use this for a

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.170 
teacher for example use this for a
current<00:05:24.320> event<00:05:24.560> pull<00:05:24.800> up<00:05:24.950> some<00:05:25.160> news<00:05:25.370> cast<00:05:25.910> or

health class for example we could stop

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.719 
health class for example we could stop
and<00:05:32.360> we<00:05:32.450> can<00:05:32.630> say<00:05:32.890> what<00:05:33.890> percentage<00:05:34.070> if<00:05:34.580> maybe

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
and we can say what percentage if maybe

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.110 
and we can say what percentage if maybe
they've<00:05:34.940> talked<00:05:35.180> about<00:05:35.270> it<00:05:35.860> you<00:05:36.860> know<00:05:37.120> how

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
they've talked about it you know how

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:45.040 
they've talked about it you know how
many<00:05:38.890> people<00:05:40.360> binge<00:05:43.090> drink<00:05:44.090> according<00:05:44.690> to<00:05:44.870> the

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
many people binge drink according to the

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
video now obviously that's one of maybe

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.370 
video now obviously that's one of maybe
be<00:05:50.000> an<00:05:50.150> easy<00:05:50.360> question<00:05:50.600> for<00:05:50.900> everyone<00:05:51.050> answer

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
be an easy question for everyone answer

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.540 
be an easy question for everyone answer
because<00:05:51.530> they<00:05:51.620> just<00:05:51.800> went<00:05:51.950> through<00:05:52.190> it<00:05:52.370> in<00:05:52.460> the

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
because they just went through it in the

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.219 
because they just went through it in the
video<00:05:52.820> so<00:05:53.419> maybe<00:05:53.600> I<00:05:53.690> want<00:05:53.810> to<00:05:53.960> ask<00:05:54.050> some

video so maybe I want to ask some

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.870 
video so maybe I want to ask some
higher-level<00:05:54.710> questions<00:05:55.010> or<00:05:55.460> maybe<00:05:55.550> I<00:05:55.669> want

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
higher-level questions or maybe I want

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
to direct the questions to one or two

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.620 
to direct the questions to one or two
people<00:05:57.729> there's<00:05:58.729> some<00:05:58.850> other<00:05:59.060> features<00:05:59.450> as

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
exactly how to say it this is again

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.180 
exactly how to say it this is again
another<00:06:09.020> way<00:06:09.260> that<00:06:09.289> you<00:06:09.440> can<00:06:09.650> have<00:06:09.830> an<00:06:09.979> online

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
another way that you can have an online

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.580 
another way that you can have an online
discussion<00:06:10.669> when<00:06:11.570> I<00:06:11.660> was<00:06:11.810> in<00:06:11.930> the<00:06:11.990> classroom<00:06:12.260> I

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
discussion when I was in the classroom I

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.080 
discussion when I was in the classroom I
used<00:06:12.800> it<00:06:12.979> when<00:06:13.100> we<00:06:13.220> were<00:06:13.310> readings<00:06:13.760> to<00:06:13.910> things

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
used it when we were readings to things

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.879 
used it when we were readings to things
and<00:06:14.300> I<00:06:14.750> would<00:06:14.900> use<00:06:15.050> it<00:06:15.169> for<00:06:15.200> the<00:06:15.380> students<00:06:15.800> to

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
and I would use it for the students to

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.120 
and I would use it for the students to
learn<00:06:16.010> it<00:06:16.190> summarization<00:06:16.550> techniques<00:06:17.210> so<00:06:18.130> for

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
learn it summarization techniques so for

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.920 
learn it summarization techniques so for
example<00:06:19.520> I've<00:06:20.150> already<00:06:20.360> started<00:06:20.570> something

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
example I've already started something

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.740 
example I've already started something
here<00:06:21.289> but<00:06:21.979> I<00:06:22.010> could<00:06:22.220> say<00:06:22.340> I<00:06:22.370> believe<00:06:22.789> that<00:06:23.150> the

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
here but I could say I believe that the

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.450 
here but I could say I believe that the
main<00:06:23.930> idea<00:06:23.990> of<00:06:24.410> this<00:06:24.889> story<00:06:25.510> is<00:06:26.800> dot<00:06:27.800> dot<00:06:27.830> and

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
main idea of this story is dot dot and

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.100 
main idea of this story is dot dot and
then<00:06:28.880> I<00:06:28.910> would<00:06:29.090> just<00:06:29.270> continue<00:06:29.479> with<00:06:29.870> that<00:06:30.050> and

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
then I would just continue with that and

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.570 
then I would just continue with that and
then<00:06:30.320> when<00:06:30.530> someone<00:06:30.740> else<00:06:30.919> participates

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
then when someone else participates

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.690 
then when someone else participates
their<00:06:32.950> parts<00:06:33.950> that<00:06:34.099> they're<00:06:34.280> going<00:06:34.460> to<00:06:34.520> enter

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
their parts that they're going to enter

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.240 
their parts that they're going to enter
here<00:06:34.849> will<00:06:35.840> come<00:06:36.140> up<00:06:36.349> in<00:06:36.680> a<00:06:36.770> different<00:06:36.919> color

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
here will come up in a different color

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.640 
here will come up in a different color
so<00:06:37.430> you<00:06:37.460> can<00:06:37.669> know<00:06:37.820> who<00:06:38.060> is<00:06:38.260> participating

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
so you can know who is participating

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.439 
so you can know who is participating
now<00:06:39.740> I<00:06:39.800> can<00:06:40.040> also<00:06:40.220> ask<00:06:40.490> prompting<00:06:41.000> questions

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
now I can also ask prompting questions

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.180 
now I can also ask prompting questions
here<00:06:41.840> for<00:06:42.380> example<00:06:42.710> if<00:06:42.800> that's<00:06:42.949> a<00:06:43.040> way<00:06:43.160> that

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
here for example if that's a way that

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.060 
here for example if that's a way that
we're<00:06:43.520> summarizing<00:06:44.270> I<00:06:44.990> could<00:06:45.440> say<00:06:45.650> to<00:06:45.710> the

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
we're summarizing I could say to the

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:52.379 
we're summarizing I could say to the
student<00:06:46.490> read<00:06:47.030> do<00:06:47.810> you<00:06:47.990> think<00:06:48.260> it's<00:06:48.500> necessary

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:52.389

to start your summary like that and that

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.580 
to start your summary like that and that
might<00:06:59.389> clue<00:06:59.630> him<00:06:59.840> then<00:07:00.110> he<00:07:00.199> might<00:07:00.320> be<00:07:00.350> able<00:07:00.500> to

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:29.389 
when I first tried it some of the

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:31.150 
when I first tried it some of the
comments<00:07:29.810> were<00:07:29.930> pretty<00:07:30.199> silly<00:07:30.620> and<00:07:30.889> sort<00:07:31.100> of

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 
comments were pretty silly and sort of

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.159 
comments were pretty silly and sort of
stupid<00:07:31.580> but<00:07:32.180> once<00:07:32.360> the<00:07:32.479> kids<00:07:32.660> got<00:07:32.810> the<00:07:32.930> hang<00:07:33.080> of

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:33.169 
stupid but once the kids got the hang of

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:35.140 
stupid but once the kids got the hang of
it<00:07:33.260> it<00:07:33.380> was<00:07:33.470> much<00:07:33.710> much<00:07:33.979> better<00:07:34.250> so<00:07:34.850> as<00:07:34.970> you<00:07:35.090> can

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150 
it it was much much better so as you can

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.659 
it it was much much better so as you can
see<00:07:35.300> I<00:07:35.330> think<00:07:35.419> there<00:07:35.690> are<00:07:35.720> many<00:07:35.930> uses<00:07:36.560> to<00:07:37.370> twiba

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:37.669 
see I think there are many uses to twiba

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:39.159 
see I think there are many uses to twiba
and<00:07:37.910> I<00:07:37.970> hope<00:07:38.120> that<00:07:38.270> you<00:07:38.360> can<00:07:38.510> find<00:07:38.720> some<00:07:38.840> uses

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:39.169 
and I hope that you can find some uses

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:43.090 
and I hope that you can find some uses
and<00:07:39.350> in<00:07:39.800> your<00:07:40.070> classroom<00:07:40.490> for<00:07:40.520> it<00:07:40.820> as<00:07:40.940> well
