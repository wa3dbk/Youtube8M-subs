Parenthood is you know it does breast
beings<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.600> does<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.439> many<00:02:07.890> things<00:02:08.099> for<00:02:08.849> women

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
beings it does so many things for women

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.720 
beings it does so many things for women
and<00:02:09.939> it's<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.569> place<00:02:10.869> for<00:02:11.200> people<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.709> go<00:02:11.950> when

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
and so I think that was really it was

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.610 
and so I think that was really it was
just<00:02:17.469> a<00:02:17.709> big<00:02:18.249> mistake<00:02:19.139> will<00:02:20.139> lighten<00:02:20.349> things
