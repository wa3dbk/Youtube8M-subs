crap<00:03:49.770> kicked<00:03:50.040> out<00:03:50.160> of<00:03:50.220> him<00:03:50.370> several<00:03:51.030> times<00:03:51.450> so

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
crap kicked out of him several times so

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.930 
crap kicked out of him several times so
he's<00:03:52.440> all<00:03:52.560> bruised<00:03:52.890> up<00:03:53.100> he's<00:03:53.280> got<00:03:53.430> black<00:03:53.670> eyes

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
he's all bruised up he's got black eyes

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.350 
he's all bruised up he's got black eyes
and<00:03:54.560> all<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.490> one's<00:03:56.730> obviously

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
and all that so this one's obviously

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.270 
and all that so this one's obviously
just<00:03:57.720> like<00:03:57.780> you<00:03:57.990> just<00:03:58.110> yanked<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.770> mask<00:03:59.010> off

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
just like you just yanked the mask off

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.130 
just like you just yanked the mask off
before<00:03:59.700> he<00:03:59.850> gets<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.540> crap<00:04:00.750> kicked<00:04:00.930> out<00:04:01.080> of

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
before he gets the crap kicked out of

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.950 
before he gets the crap kicked out of
him<00:04:01.820> so<00:04:02.820> that's<00:04:03.360> a<00:04:03.540> little<00:04:03.660> disappointing

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
him so that's a little disappointing

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.840 
him so that's a little disappointing
some<00:04:04.530> bruising<00:04:04.920> would<00:04:05.040> have<00:04:05.130> made<00:04:05.580> it<00:04:05.700> better

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
some bruising would have made it better

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.060 
some bruising would have made it better
but<00:04:06.060> no<00:04:06.270> well<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:07.530> mask<00:04:07.770> is<00:04:08.010> real<00:04:08.190> cloth<00:04:08.810> it's

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
but no well the mask is real cloth it's

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.720 
but no well the mask is real cloth it's
easy<00:04:11.070> to<00:04:11.370> put<00:04:11.550> on<00:04:11.580> and<00:04:11.760> off<00:04:12.000> but<00:04:12.390> sometimes<00:04:12.990> the

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
easy to put on and off but sometimes the

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.039 
easy to put on and off but sometimes the
skarphol<00:04:14.730> bunch<00:04:14.940> up<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.270> you<00:04:15.390> have<00:04:15.570> to<00:04:15.720> fuss

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
skarphol bunch up and you have to fuss

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.810 
skarphol bunch up and you have to fuss
with<00:04:16.170> it<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.470> get<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:16.680> pulled<00:04:16.890> back<00:04:17.010> onto<00:04:17.520> his

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
with it to get it pulled back onto his

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.240 
with it to get it pulled back onto his
head<00:04:18.140> which<00:04:19.140> is<00:04:19.290> disappointing<00:04:19.709> but<00:04:19.980> it's<00:04:20.100> not

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
head which is disappointing but it's not

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.960 
head which is disappointing but it's not
a<00:04:20.280> total<00:04:21.030> loss<00:04:21.180> okay

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
a total loss okay

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.630 
a total loss okay
here's<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.930> grapple<00:04:24.290> gun<00:04:24.410> on<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.340> back<00:04:25.490> of

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
here's the grapple gun on the back of

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.190 
here's the grapple gun on the back of
the<00:04:25.730> box<00:04:25.910> it<00:04:26.000> said<00:04:26.180> it<00:04:26.270> came<00:04:26.480> with<00:04:26.630> four<00:04:26.900> hooks

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
the box it said it came with four hooks

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.380 
the box it said it came with four hooks
which<00:04:27.500> was<00:04:27.680> kind<00:04:27.920> of<00:04:28.010> strange<00:04:28.130> seeing<00:04:28.760> as<00:04:28.880> it

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
which was kind of strange seeing as it

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.430 
which was kind of strange seeing as it
only<00:04:29.510> had<00:04:29.690> three<00:04:29.720> in<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.050> movie

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
only had three in the movie

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.670 
only had three in the movie
and<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.340> does<00:04:31.490> not<00:04:31.610> come<00:04:31.880> with<00:04:31.940> four<00:04:32.240> hooks<00:04:32.680> it

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
and it does not come with four hooks it

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.030 
and it does not come with four hooks it
comes<00:04:33.890> with<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.480> one<00:04:35.480> second<00:04:35.810> like<00:04:35.960> hooks<00:04:36.890> out

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
comes with the one second like hooks out

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.100 
comes with the one second like hooks out
on<00:04:37.190> this<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:38.060> only<00:04:38.210> comes<00:04:38.480> with<00:04:38.600> three<00:04:38.870> just

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
on this it only comes with three just

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.180 
on this it only comes with three just
like<00:04:39.200> in<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.410> movie<00:04:39.680> so<00:04:39.800> I<00:04:39.830> guess<00:04:40.010> that's

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
like in the movie so I guess that's

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.950 
like in the movie so I guess that's
something<00:04:41.030> wrong<00:04:41.210> with<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.390> box<00:04:41.660> I'm<00:04:41.840> not

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
something wrong with the box I'm not

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.370 
something wrong with the box I'm not
really<00:04:42.080> sure<00:04:42.730> okay<00:04:43.730> there<00:04:44.450> it<00:04:44.570> is<00:04:44.690> with<00:04:44.930> all

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
really sure okay there it is with all

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.640 
really sure okay there it is with all
four<00:04:45.710> folks<00:04:46.700> popped<00:04:46.970> out<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:48.050> doesn't<00:04:48.350> detach

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
four folks popped out it doesn't detach

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.330 
four folks popped out it doesn't detach
this<00:04:49.100> is<00:04:49.310> as<00:04:50.060> much<00:04:50.330> as<00:04:50.450> it<00:04:50.540> does<00:04:51.130> it's<00:04:52.130> still

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
this is as much as it does it's still

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.100 
this is as much as it does it's still
very<00:04:52.520> cool<00:04:52.790> but<00:04:53.240> he<00:04:53.510> doesn't<00:04:53.750> use<00:04:53.870> it<00:04:53.990> that

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
very cool but he doesn't use it that

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.380 
very cool but he doesn't use it that
much<00:04:54.140> I<00:04:54.410> think<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.860> homemade<00:04:55.850> flamethrower

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
much I think the homemade flamethrower

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.350 
much I think the homemade flamethrower
is<00:04:56.510> a<00:04:56.570> lot<00:04:56.780> cooler<00:04:56.930> than<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.790> he<00:04:58.790> also<00:04:58.970> came

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
is a lot cooler than that he also came

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.170 
is a lot cooler than that he also came
with<00:04:59.720> two<00:05:00.500> hands<00:05:00.800> just<00:05:00.920> like<00:05:01.280> this<00:05:01.490> a<00:05:01.790> balled

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
with two hands just like this a balled

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.630 
with two hands just like this a balled
up<00:05:02.300> fist<00:05:02.570> that<00:05:02.720> can't<00:05:02.930> hold<00:05:03.110> anything<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:04.460> two

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.070 
up fist that can't hold anything and two
hands<00:05:04.880> like<00:05:05.090> this<00:05:05.300> just<00:05:05.540> like<00:05:05.720> he's<00:05:05.840> letting

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
hands like this just like he's letting

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.730 
hands like this just like he's letting
them<00:05:06.170> hang<00:05:06.350> by<00:05:06.530> his<00:05:06.650> side<00:05:06.890> nothing<00:05:07.760> there<00:05:07.940> and

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
them hang by his side nothing there and

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
the cloth pulling it on and off and it

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.560 
the cloth pulling it on and off and it
getting<00:06:30.880> pushed<00:06:31.880> around<00:06:32.060> you<00:06:32.390> have<00:06:32.479> to

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
getting pushed around you have to

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.939 
getting pushed around you have to
straighten<00:06:32.810> it<00:06:32.930> out

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:33.949 
straighten it out

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.589 
straighten it out
but<00:06:34.949> the<00:06:35.099> accessories<00:06:35.639> are<00:06:35.759> cool<00:06:35.939> one<00:06:36.269> thing<00:06:36.479> I

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
but the accessories are cool one thing I

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:37.729 
but the accessories are cool one thing I
thought<00:06:36.749> it<00:06:36.869> lacked<00:06:37.080> though<00:06:37.259> was<00:06:37.439> that<00:06:37.589> could

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:37.739 
thought it lacked though was that could

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:40.009 
thought it lacked though was that could
have<00:06:37.830> had<00:06:37.979> a<00:06:38.009> journal<00:06:38.489> and<00:06:38.749> like<00:06:39.749> a<00:06:39.779> little

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:40.019 
have had a journal and like a little

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:42.379 
have had a journal and like a little
pencil<00:06:40.379> he<00:06:40.469> could<00:06:40.589> have<00:06:40.769> like<00:06:41.189> hold<00:06:41.429> I<00:06:41.610> think

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
pencil he could have like hold I think

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:43.459 
pencil he could have like hold I think
that<00:06:42.479> would<00:06:42.569> have<00:06:42.659> been<00:06:42.689> a<00:06:42.779> really<00:06:42.929> nice<00:06:43.139> touch

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:43.469 
that would have been a really nice touch

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:44.779 
that would have been a really nice touch
I<00:06:43.619> would<00:06:43.709> have<00:06:43.799> definitely<00:06:43.949> posed<00:06:44.429> him<00:06:44.579> that

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:44.789 
I would have definitely posed him that

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:45.889 
I would have definitely posed him that
way<00:06:44.939> like<00:06:45.149> he<00:06:45.209> was<00:06:45.329> scribbling<00:06:45.569> in<00:06:45.839> the

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:45.899 
way like he was scribbling in the

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:49.399 
way like he was scribbling in the
journal<00:06:46.489> but<00:06:47.489> overall<00:06:47.929> it's<00:06:48.929> still<00:06:49.229> a<00:06:49.259> great

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:49.409 
journal but overall it's still a great

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.379 
journal but overall it's still a great
figure<00:06:49.709> I<00:06:49.979> still<00:06:50.339> recommend<00:06:50.579> him<00:06:50.819> maybe<00:06:51.089> one

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:51.389 
figure I still recommend him maybe one

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:52.669 
figure I still recommend him maybe one
hundred<00:06:51.599> dollars<00:06:51.809> is<00:06:51.929> a<00:06:51.959> little<00:06:52.199> pricey<00:06:52.349> but

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:52.679 
hundred dollars is a little pricey but

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:57.919 
hundred dollars is a little pricey but
this<00:06:53.399> is<00:06:53.519> Gerry<00:06:53.969> 997<00:06:54.769> signing<00:06:55.769> off
