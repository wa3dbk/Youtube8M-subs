cheddar or a Monterey Jack or a
combination<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:31.470> both<00:04:31.620> we're<00:04:31.919> using<00:04:32.070> both

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
combination of both we're using both

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.190 
combination of both we're using both
here<00:04:32.610> now<00:04:32.940> we<00:04:33.360> can<00:04:33.389> spread<00:04:33.720> some<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:34.050> our

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
here now we can spread some of our

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.060 
here now we can spread some of our
mixture<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.919> vegetable<00:04:35.340> mixture<00:04:35.550> on<00:04:35.700> top<00:04:36.950> so<00:04:37.950> on

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
mixture a vegetable mixture on top so on

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.450 
mixture a vegetable mixture on top so on
top<00:04:38.220> of<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:38.460> goes<00:04:38.940> our<00:04:39.240> second<00:04:39.750> tortilla

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.770 

then<00:04:44.460> we'll<00:04:44.580> take<00:04:44.729> a<00:04:44.760> little<00:04:45.000> bit<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.150> oil<00:04:45.360> and

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
then we'll take a little bit of oil and

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.700 
then we'll take a little bit of oil and
drizzle<00:04:46.380> it<00:04:46.590> over<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.919> top<00:04:51.260> and<00:04:52.260> just<00:04:52.440> spread

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
drizzle it over the top and just spread

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.510 
drizzle it over the top and just spread
it<00:04:52.740> around<00:04:52.919> with<00:04:53.190> your<00:04:53.280> spatula<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.760> little<00:04:53.940> bit

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
it around with your spatula a little bit

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.719 
it around with your spatula a little bit
now<00:04:56.520> here's<00:04:56.729> a<00:04:56.820> tricky<00:04:57.120> part<00:04:58.639> we're<00:04:59.639> gonna

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
now here's a tricky part we're gonna

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.820 
now here's a tricky part we're gonna
scoop<00:05:00.060> it<00:05:00.180> up<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.539> try<00:05:01.260> to<00:05:01.320> flip<00:05:01.560> it<00:05:01.710> over

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
scoop it up and try to flip it over

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:15.680 
scoop it up and try to flip it over
without<00:05:02.130> all<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.760> filling<00:05:03.060> coming<00:05:03.539> out<00:05:14.690> the

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
without all the filling coming out the

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.240 
without all the filling coming out the
other<00:05:15.840> option<00:05:16.260> you<00:05:16.380> can<00:05:16.500> do<00:05:16.680> is<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:17.100> know<00:05:17.220> just

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
other option you can do is you know just

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.150 
other option you can do is you know just
fill<00:05:18.120> up<00:05:18.240> half<00:05:18.570> of<00:05:18.630> it<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.229> just<00:05:19.500> fold<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:20.039> over

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
fill up half of it and just fold it over

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.029 
fill up half of it and just fold it over
so<00:05:20.669> it's<00:05:21.240> just<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.510> little<00:05:21.720> easier<00:05:21.930> and<00:05:22.590> again

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
so it's just a little easier and again

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.650 
so it's just a little easier and again
