good<00:01:37.549> now<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.820> problem<00:01:39.180> I've<00:01:39.240> had<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> can

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
good now the one problem I've had I can

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.480 
good now the one problem I've had I can
illustrate<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.439> next<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.250> really

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
illustrate on this next one it's really

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.609 
illustrate on this next one it's really
hard<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.790> see<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.270> there's<00:01:42.540> some<00:01:42.899> black<00:01:43.200> City

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
hard to see but there's some black City

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.609 
hard to see but there's some black City
now<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.430> cuff<00:01:45.210> where<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> cuff<00:01:46.049> attaches

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
now in that cuff where the cuff attaches

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.149 
now in that cuff where the cuff attaches
to<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> lower<00:01:47.070> boot<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:48.390> joint<00:01:49.140> has<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.680> a

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
to the lower boot that joint has is a

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.679 
to the lower boot that joint has is a
bit<00:01:50.490> lacks<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:52.729> think<00:01:53.729> that's<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.030> product<00:01:54.479> of

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
bit lacks I think that's a product of

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.499 
bit lacks I think that's a product of
the<00:01:55.350> fact<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.460> cuff<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.299> slowly

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the fact that the cuff is just slowly

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.450 
the fact that the cuff is just slowly
wearing<00:01:57.990> away<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.500> carbon<00:01:58.890> fiber<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.219> get

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
wearing away that carbon fiber you get

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.580 
wearing away that carbon fiber you get
this<00:01:59.610> kind<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.909> black<00:02:00.210> graphite<00:02:01.140> look<00:02:01.409> and

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
this kind of black graphite look and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.260 
this kind of black graphite look and
stuff<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> lower<00:02:02.460> cuff<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.119> can

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
stuff on the lower cuff that you can

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.130 
stuff on the lower cuff that you can
wash<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.689> away<00:02:03.750> after<00:02:04.290> every<00:02:04.560> tour<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:06.140> sure

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
wash that away after every tour and sure

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.650 
wash that away after every tour and sure

well<00:02:20.520> skis<00:02:21.060> great<00:02:21.330> cons<00:02:22.320> it's<00:02:23.100> expensive<00:02:23.670> and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
well skis great cons it's expensive and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.960 
well skis great cons it's expensive and
I<00:02:25.260> think<00:02:25.470> there's<00:02:25.650> some<00:02:25.920> real<00:02:26.340> durability

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
I think there's some real durability

I think there's some real durability
issue<00:02:27.120> with<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.630> cuff<00:02:27.900> they<00:02:28.260> need<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.500> put

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
issue with that cuff they need to put

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.260 
issue with that cuff they need to put
like<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.830> metal<00:02:29.220> bushing<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.760> there<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.180> it

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
like a metal bushing in there so it

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.020 
like a metal bushing in there so it
won't<00:02:30.390> wear<00:02:30.630> down<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:32.040> all<00:02:32.520> in<00:02:32.730> all<00:02:32.820> I'm<00:02:33.000> happy

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.730 
won't wear down so all in all I'm happy
to<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> bottom<00:02:33.840> but<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.080> might<00:02:34.350> go<00:02:34.500> with<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
to the bottom but I might go with the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.560 
to the bottom but I might go with the
mountain<00:02:35.070> if<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.370> had<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.670> do<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.880> over<00:02:36.000> again

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
mountain if I had to do it over again
