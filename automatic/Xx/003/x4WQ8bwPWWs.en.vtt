rucksack you just get this up to open it

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.580 
rucksack you just get this up to open it
up<00:01:05.100> simple<00:01:06.100> as<00:01:06.550> that<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:07.810> as<00:01:07.990> you<00:01:08.080> can<00:01:08.170> see<00:01:08.380> it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
up simple as that and as you can see it

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.840 
up simple as that and as you can see it
opens<00:01:08.830> up<00:01:09.250> in<00:01:09.460> one<00:01:10.000> big<00:01:10.500> space<00:01:11.500> but<00:01:12.220> there<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:12.820> a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
opens up in one big space but there is a

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.210 
opens up in one big space but there is a
nice<00:01:13.210> little<00:01:13.240> trick<00:01:13.840> like<00:01:14.500> this<00:01:14.650> actual<00:01:15.040> work

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
nice little trick like this actual work

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.360 
nice little trick like this actual work
sake<00:01:15.430> has<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.960> you<00:01:17.170> see<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.560> zip<00:01:17.770> on<00:01:17.980> the<00:01:18.010> side

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
sake has so you see the zip on the side

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.820 
sake has so you see the zip on the side
here<00:01:18.670> let's<00:01:19.360> show<00:01:19.660> you<00:01:19.750> there<00:01:19.930> it<00:01:20.680> actually

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
here let's show you there it actually

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.800 
here let's show you there it actually
doubles<00:01:21.310> up<00:01:21.580> as<00:01:21.730> another<00:01:22.060> entry<00:01:22.540> point<00:01:22.750> so

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
doubles up as another entry point so

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.300 
doubles up as another entry point so
what<00:01:22.990> I<00:01:23.020> actually<00:01:23.170> find<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.710> zips<00:01:23.890> there<00:01:24.190> we

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
what I actually find the zips there we

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.600 
what I actually find the zips there we
go<00:01:25.230> right<00:01:26.230> unclip<00:01:26.800> the<00:01:26.980> compression<00:01:27.430> straps

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
go right unclip the compression straps

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.800 
go right unclip the compression straps
on<00:01:27.730> the<00:01:27.820> bottom<00:01:27.940> it's<00:01:28.330> probably<00:01:28.570> gonna<00:01:28.660> make

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
on the bottom it's probably gonna make

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.490 
on the bottom it's probably gonna make
it<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:28.990> bit<00:01:29.110> easier<00:01:30.030> unzip<00:01:31.030> that<00:01:31.320> don't<00:01:32.320> make

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
it a bit easier unzip that don't make

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.170 
it a bit easier unzip that don't make
sure<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:32.740> doesn't<00:01:32.890> snag<00:01:33.610> on<00:01:33.730> the<00:01:33.820> bag<00:01:34.000> like

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
sure it doesn't snag on the bag like

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.130 
sure it doesn't snag on the bag like
I've<00:01:34.330> just<00:01:34.360> done<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.870> there

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
I've just done it there

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.590

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
that has done is that has opened up the
