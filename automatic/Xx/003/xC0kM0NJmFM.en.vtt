00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.460
 direction nike action sports 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.900
 i.e. sneakers for active species 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.370
 sports basically they kept all those 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.409
 their properties that were known 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.360
 when first appeared in the 90s 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.950
 that is, it really is basically 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.409
 durable waterproof often low-key and 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.790
 very comfortable shoes to 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.979
 walk off-road 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.510
 as a rule the vegetable moment is still the whole 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.120
 this shoe is such here 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.550
 shoelaces that mimic dynamic 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.159
 shoelaces that are known to all lovers 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.860
 rock climbing 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.170
 though of course they are not as strong and 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.319
 the mountains on these laces we climb all the same 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.230
 do not recommend what else is nice that 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.630
 publishing new models in the series and CJ they 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.830
 just passing passing some hits 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.720
 nike has kept almost everything 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.310
 what the wind would have known in advance plus 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.310
 a little bit and and of course adapted under 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.110
 today's technology and makes us happy 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.680
 new models but as for example 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.880
 this model is called idler low 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.470
 model which is positioned for 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.660
 Off-road hike for light mountains 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.400
 has all the distinctive features of a shoe like 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.910
 just here for off-road that is it 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.440
 and very comfortable shoes gave here here 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.030
 soft notebook soft suede 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.890
 tight and synthetic materials 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.940
 rubber parts are very big well 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.740
 shock absorbing outsole and such 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.870
 technologies like a trail frame that is 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.670
 non-slip very comfortable shoes 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.310
 which is just right and in order to 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.200
 walk now if suddenly you think that 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.690
 for the cold season 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.090
 low sneakers will not help and not 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.950
 fit no problem there is such 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.770
 wonderful model how tall 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.930
 1 sneakers that is the same thing the same 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.140
 look at the model itself, they are very similar 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.980
 but already higher which already protect your 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.320
 ankles and also performed in the same 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.989
 very colors that are very characteristic for 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.950
 russia g series and retain almost all 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:36.630
 those moments and important characteristics about 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.959
 whom I said before yes all weather 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.130
 sneakers that too stake in the mountains that 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.980
 it is still interesting that 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.810
 and CJ are painted in such a way that 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.269
 even when they get a little 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.450
 dirty it is dirt like scars 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.489
 adorn a man and dirt adorns 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.470
 these are all weather sneakers weight g 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.140
 understandably what follows them too 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.690
 follow wipe them handle them but 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.430
 chris beer such white white 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.010
 pure white clean sneakers yah 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.780
 it should not be clear that you are neither 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.150
 what mountains do not go if you have them 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.130
 clean better on the contrary walk on 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.110
 off road a little bit to test that 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.690
 everyone saw a real boy who 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.080
 knows firsthand what a bend is 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.890
 guitars yellow and easier sand around the fire 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.380
 hiking 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.080
 another interesting model to hike in 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.050
 Mount model rhombus 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.060
 I think that when you saw the review 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.370
 first two sneakers but probably from 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.349
 different in the language of the question which spun 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.719
 many may have already set off 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:39.000
 There are no comments like A and Che Cortex 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:41.159
 Gortex guys are in this model 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.500
 Generally cortex is not the only membrane 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.250
 moisture resistant but one of the most 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.620
 known 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.310
 one of the most reliable and one of those of may 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.840
 one 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.419
 this is one of those materials that 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.729
 traditionally put in such off-road 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.330
 sneakers like this one 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.979
 called wrong but 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.289
 also very interesting colors 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.930
 could be called coloring guchi but 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.539
 although the gutsi colors themselves 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.129
 all this luxury style and off-road 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.319
 hiking shoes for the forest 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:12.240
 incompatible understandable thing is that when 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:15.319
 speak in the forest well, a little cunning, yes 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.580
 all the same we live in the stone jungle and 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:20.580
 Sorry we are not yet so clean 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:25.500
 weather that does not make us happy 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.330
 precipitation in the cold season is like 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.520
 once and creates all the conditions to 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.979
 just walk off that road 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.889
 running shoes therefore 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.870
 we remove our snow-white sneakers goes 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.270
 such sneakers and feel 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.889
 really wonderful especially since 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.889
 now that we have all this 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:44.699
 madonna hery floor climbing 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.490
 equipment 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:50.000
 it's time to wear these sneakers 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.560
 Understandably my story about such here 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.449
 demi-season all weather and front 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.120
 running shoes would be incomplete without 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.819
 mentions of such wonderful 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.909
 dunk oh yes yes friends this classic 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:05.219
 nike dunk model but already in such off-road 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.339
 I consider the performance one of the most 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:09.449
 amazing one of the most interesting 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:12.389
 models that appeared last year 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:13.949
 and this year was re-launched on 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:16.139
 the market is due to the fact that everyone 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:19.550
 It liked that there is interesting 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:22.199
 this is a nike free sole 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.750
 which is very light very comfortable it 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:29.310
 such lacing which is probably known 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:31.409
 to all lovers of shoes for about Frodo and this 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:35.819
 such a contrast to what sneakers themselves 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:37.900
 really such here for the movement 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:40.389
 cross country practically 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.910
 IS-3 colors and these are bright laces 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:46.300
 which can be said as if to say 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:48.280
 the British are not even shoelaces a certain statement 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.660
 we will not say the site he just 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.490
 let's say that this is a very bright accent 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.800
 who makes shoes 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:57.250
 additionally attractive plus 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:00.970
 classic silhouette nike dunk called 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.960
 This model nike dunk high of m l m 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.150
 stands for 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.870
 of mountain service 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.910
 Once a model in the mountains on the road 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:12.520
 Here is a small selection of sneakers 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:15.460
 for getting around the city and not only 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.729

 wear when dry and clean and warm 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.419
 remember that there are sneakers that 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.699
 just fit not to wear 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:32.199
 dirt but the main thing is not to forget that 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:33.160
 sneakers can be worn practically 

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:35.410
