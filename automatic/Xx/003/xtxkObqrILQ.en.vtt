00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.040
 ah 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.849
 this is no longer a problem of 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.890
 fisherfolk entrepreneurs 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.960
 fishing this is a problem of the country 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.610
 it's a problem the youth is a 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.400
 problem of young people is being 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.770
 discussing the fate of heritage 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.689
 fishing in the country and unfortunately the 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.700
 congress is giving a sad 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.520
 show delivering resources 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.989
 fishing to seven families and they are 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.610
 favoring big business 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.940
 fishermen we fishermen 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.620
 craft if this project is approved 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.910
 in the way that the Minister Longueira in 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.860
 the company they want, we're going to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.570
 disobey we are calling the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.480
 disobedience to the fishermen we 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.030
 we refuse to die and therefore we are 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.310
 here supporting the mobilization of 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.500
 students in santiago and we hope that 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.690
 young people youth and citizenship 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.630
 take care of this one of this problem 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.280
 that is a real problem is the future of 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.810
 patrimony I want to tell you the one that is 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.369
 at stake I think this is a law that 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.020
 harms not only fishermen 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.149
 artisanal also to all citizens 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.740
 remember that here the resources of 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.479
 all Chileans they are giving away 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.189
 Mr. Longueira to seven family this 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.509
 country by the act we come to support it to 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.790
 them and we are supporting all 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.310
 mobilizations that are being heard here 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.540
 very well all across the country today are 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.890
 the fishermen yesterday was the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.420
 students and tomorrow they will leave 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.250
 being more sectors that are adding the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.200
 struggle to build a better country by 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.640
 recover what belongs to us and is for 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.050
 the same thing that they found fundamental is 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.130
 important that the students are 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.170
 they find supporting these struggles 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.870
 sectoral and that we can articulate that 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.820
 future a project as organizations 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.020
 social since we want a 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.610
 different country that is not a country that 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.229
 really belong to the Chileans and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.640
 that whose communities they are 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.620
 empower the more decisions 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.780
 with respect to becoming your own country 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.460
 the social movement manages to achieve with 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.290
 autonomy constitute its own 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.520
 political representation or to make a 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.400
 movement of a political head of its own 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.830
 that we can not continue to depend on 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.869
 senators who are oblivious to the problems 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.460
 that live that end up representing 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.259
 our interests in the congress is 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.119
 important I think the movement 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.390
 social constitutes political alternatives 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.530
 and that in the background to break this 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.880
 tremendous abyss that exists between 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.160
 representatives and represented and of 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.350
 chile are going to maintain the status that 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.209
 we have currently that is that four 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.370
 conglomerates seven families continue 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.830
 being the great owners of the 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.860
 chili fish as of the chilean sea 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.920
 so what it is about opposing 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.720
 so that it does not happen I think that this law is 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.830
 a policy of eliminating fishing 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.390
 gradual artisanal and that definitely 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.830
 are destined to disappear through 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.860
 of this law with the reduction of 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.110
 quotas and with the policy that is 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.150
 oriented just to finish with this 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.250
 important sector of the country in the 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.770
 peru of this problem that there has been 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.250
 modification of laws on fishing and what 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.190
 which we put a total brake 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.290
 all that is now changing the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.360
 law of the fishery because this is a 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.890
 abuse not only the government but 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.020
 comes from the big vested interests 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.450
 by employers it is very bad what 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.520
 does the Chinese is now carrying the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.550
 fish having a multi at the fair 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.170
 to do what this eco-friendly feels 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.930
 I am not all the boats of the 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.580
 flour and here we are eating shit 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.680
 and the government that does 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.410
 they come 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.780
 the outsiders 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.610
 nothing more then in the dileo stick but 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.160
 the most terrible thing that's happening because 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.250
 these masters are doing the masters 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.020
 and then the currency because it's more there 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.940
 said and then that is known 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.220
 and that does not go 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.490
 that is not done, he never told that there 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.490
 one 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.460
 but 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.570
 all right 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.570
 but not
