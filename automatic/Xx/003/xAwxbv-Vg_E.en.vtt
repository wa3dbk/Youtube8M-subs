 Thank always Thank you for you can see the video 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:17.449
 Although live that and I also became easy to understand that and we have accustomed we think by yourself 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.940
 How are you all 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:26.610
 Is it easy to understand? 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:30.450
 Purchase decisions to say or when say your questions there or that by all means do so 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:34.020
 I also want to fix it 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:38.160
 In we will answer you the following questions: 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:42.540
 It is the judgment standard that it is good or bad of awareness 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.740
 Where do we go for the half standard ? 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.410
 time 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:54.290
 I it is that was taken in meet to time outside of that 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:57.710
 Crowded by way of Tteyuu in IutoKon is that Parkway Well 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:03.640
 I there first home that Sheer common name from it 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:08.400
 Because there are many cases in which a is a relative or long-lived 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.190
 Finish dressing up of the kimono outside time 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.620
 It is about to 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:18.100
 Then 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:23.890
 Instead of saying that good or bad, there are good and bad places to meet that 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:26.950
 But I'm sorry I said the bad place first 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.610
 That first customer will be the look you 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.610
 That the Tteyuu that sometimes where to do I put the calibration 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:39.650
 No tortoise 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:40.850
 1 There must also be media in the system , so still those who are boxy will be in the form of a shame 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:49.580
 If it is soon 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:51.630
 If you're hungry, you have to do an appointment at the bottom of the room and ask if you have a question 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:57.180
 The thinner is and where to leave the correction 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.140
 Oh there are many full reference should and do not tell me one by one after all the reference 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.840
 It is not 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:07.079
 Among our 100 customers who are not good at doing so 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.620
 All 100 are all different 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:17.530
 We think that there is difficulty in positioning there, so we set it up like that 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:20.010
 It is a point I want to experience, but I would like to see it behind for the first time 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.010
 is not it
