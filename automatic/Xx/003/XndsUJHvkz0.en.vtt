in<00:02:28.010> that<00:02:28.989> court<00:02:29.989> respect<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:31.459> I'll<00:02:31.580> play<00:02:31.820> a<00:02:31.850> bit

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
in that court respect so I'll play a bit

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.050 
in that court respect so I'll play a bit
slower<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.989> can<00:02:33.380> try<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:33.920> find<00:02:34.130> out<00:02:34.459> which

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
slower so you can try and find out which

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:57.550 
slower so you can try and find out which
notes<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:36.560> play<00:02:36.800> on<00:02:37.550> your<00:02:37.610> guitar<00:02:56.260> then<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.410> go

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.949 

to<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.310> verse<00:03:04.970> okay<00:03:06.000> think<00:03:06.360> there's<00:03:06.569> still

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
to the verse okay think there's still

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.140 
to the verse okay think there's still
something<00:03:07.230> wrong<00:03:07.470> with<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.069> chorus<00:03:08.489> but<00:03:08.760> this

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
something wrong with the chorus but this

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.220 
something wrong with the chorus but this
the<00:03:09.300> best<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.630> can<00:03:09.690> do
