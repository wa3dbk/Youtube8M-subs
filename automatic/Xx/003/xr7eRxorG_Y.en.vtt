generations<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:44.010> tight<00:00:44.520> something<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.180> what

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
generations in tight something so what

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.260 
generations in tight something so what
this<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.710> basically<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:47.340> unlock<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.059> at

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
this is is basically you unlock it at

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.299 
this is is basically you unlock it at
level<00:00:48.629> 50<00:00:49.200> or<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.649> least<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.070> most

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
level 50 or at least this is the most

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.490 
level 50 or at least this is the most
likely<00:00:50.550> thing<00:00:50.899> it's<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.110> be<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.379> reason

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
likely thing it's going to be the reason

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.560 
likely thing it's going to be the reason
I<00:00:52.710> say<00:00:52.739> level<00:00:53.129> 50<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.520> because<00:00:53.910> through<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
I say level 50 is because through the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.020 
I say level 50 is because through the
similar<00:00:54.989> kind<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.350> packing<00:00:55.800> method<00:00:56.010> where<00:00:56.579> UK

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
similar kind of packing method where UK

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
similar kind of packing method where UK
was<00:00:57.270> able<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.719> find<00:00:57.989> out<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.440> fact<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
was able to find out the fact that the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.680 
was able to find out the fact that the
last<00:00:59.070> item<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.850> be<00:00:59.879> unlocked<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.390> unlike

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
last item to be unlocked is unlike

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.260 
last item to be unlocked is unlike
locked<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.320> level<00:01:01.559> 49<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.730> level<00:01:02.969> pick<00:01:03.120> these

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
locked at level 49 so level pick these

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.660 
locked at level 49 so level pick these
pretty<00:01:03.570> logical<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:05.040> there<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.369> 10

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
pretty logical and there are 10

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.990 
pretty logical and there are 10
generation<00:01:06.540> ranks<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.500> start<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.189> generation

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
generation ranks you start on generation

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.640 
generation ranks you start on generation
1<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.570> that's<00:01:09.750> where<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:09.990> start<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.439> game

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
1 and that's where you start the game

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.410 
1 and that's where you start the game
with<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.100> then<00:01:11.520> every<00:01:11.909> time<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.240> reach<00:01:12.390> level

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
with and then every time you reach level

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.359 
with and then every time you reach level
50<00:01:13.080> you'll<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.380> an<00:01:13.530> option<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.860> reset

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
everything is reset the only thing is

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.350 
everything is reset the only thing is
something<00:01:25.740> such<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:25.979> your<00:01:26.189> stats<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.820> your

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
pilot's and what this does is basically

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.190 
pilot's and what this does is basically
it<00:01:29.159> regenerates<00:01:29.939> your<00:01:30.810> pilot<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.500> new<00:01:31.650> body

it regenerates your pilot in a new body
it's<00:01:34.200> unclear<00:01:34.619> whether<00:01:34.770> or<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.070> there's

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
it's unclear whether or not there's

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.649 
it's unclear whether or not there's
could<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.400> any<00:01:35.520> particular<00:01:35.820> benefits<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.540> do

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
could be any particular benefits to do

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.609 
could be any particular benefits to do
this<00:01:36.979> but<00:01:37.979> apparently<00:01:38.869> according<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.200> some

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
this but apparently according to some

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.889 
this but apparently according to some
text<00:01:41.040> later<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.670> was<00:01:41.790> taken<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.360> from<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
text later that was taken that from the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.780 
text later that was taken that from the
beta<00:01:43.170> there<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> line<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.250> says<00:01:44.579> you'll<00:01:44.759> be

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
beta there is a line that says you'll be

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.020 
beta there is a line that says you'll be
better<00:01:45.090> sharper<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.979> acquire<00:01:47.700> experience

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
better sharper and acquire experience

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.359 
better sharper and acquire experience
even<00:01:48.720> faster<00:01:49.320> than<00:01:49.350> before<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.189> gonna<00:01:50.310> be

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
even faster than before so it's gonna be

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.100 
even faster than before so it's gonna be
interesting<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.909> see<00:01:51.149> what<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.420> reward<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.899> I

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
interesting to see what the reward is I

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.480 
interesting to see what the reward is I
think<00:01:52.439> it'd<00:01:52.649> be<00:01:52.710> pretty<00:01:52.860> cool<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.159> there<00:01:53.399> were

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
think it'd be pretty cool if there were

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.249 
think it'd be pretty cool if there were
some<00:01:53.670> burn<00:01:53.939> cards<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.689> got<00:01:54.869> for<00:01:55.079> may<00:01:55.200> be

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
some burn cards that you got for may be

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.380 
some burn cards that you got for may be
going<00:01:55.560> up<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.860> generation<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.579> regenerating

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
going up a generation and regenerating

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.330 
going up a generation and regenerating
or<00:01:57.540> something<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.079> nature<00:01:58.250> that<00:01:59.250> would

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
or something of that nature that would

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.980 
or something of that nature that would
be<00:01:59.430> really<00:01:59.610> cool<00:01:59.880> what<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.810> see<00:02:00.960> on

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
be really cool what you can see on

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.170 
be really cool what you can see on
screen<00:02:01.200> now<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.590> actually<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.310> logos<00:02:02.759> for<00:02:03.000> the
