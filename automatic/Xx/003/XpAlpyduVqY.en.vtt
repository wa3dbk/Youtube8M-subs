00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.889
 yes 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.210
 or pencils consist of the service very 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.389
 special 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.699
 Caesar vite here you are promised is 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.110
 We provide debt by asking all 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.270
 who want to see the tutorials here the 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.100
 we will have for you very well to 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.439
 this exercise of long shots of the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.580
 red that is good good to send 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.609
 centers in this case to di maria the level 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.980
 bronze is very simple the truth is 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.560
 that made me very easy with the r &amp; b 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.140
 or the l1 plus his center are going to throw passes 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.300
 bottoms to the bottom and can 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.160
 exist these boxes that are going to do it 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.690
 in a very simple way and those of this 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.250
 type to make it faster 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.230
 now we are going to silver level which is the 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.629
 more difficult and here the only thing that counts 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.129
 is the force from the front to the back 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.079
 we have to put all the strength and 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.690
 always press raise the e1 by walking 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.930
 our breasts for the penultimate pot is 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.760
 three and a half bars practically for 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.829
 that the ball gets there and you can 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.600
 put three and a half bars everything is about 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.130
 the force 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.020
 the other boat the third boat is a bit 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.509
 riquillo or attitude of luck but I 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.820
 I consider that with three just bars it goes 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.430
 to get the ball very well 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.820
 after the second same as we say one 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.160
 little the game is almost three less than 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.050
 the three hours I was going to get there and 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.729
 for the first good are two bars 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.830
 you passed two and a half bars so that 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.340
 the ball is a little exercise 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.460
 frustrating do not despair but it's with 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.110
 this technique very easy to do now the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.000
 equal gold level is also an exercise 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.790
 pretty tricky llosa I only 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.250
 I pressed the center button and you 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.350
 it really is calculate overflow is 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.050
 really that you are living 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.060
 they have many opportunities to 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.820
 be able to do this this exercise 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.800
 they have almost 20 20 opportunities a 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.380
 little bit more are really it's calculable 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.240
 is to calculate at all times who does not 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.700
 based all the repetitions because 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.160
 It would be super tedious but it is an exercise 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.619
 a little slow because you gain time was not 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.570
 more progressing and the important thing is that 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.790
 go calculating and hit the post 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.950
 then he will go measuring with force 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.190
 and this will be very easy, which is the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.310
 skill challenge 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.220
 does not have a greater challenge with the lt or the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.720
 l2 so the center calculates in force what 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.180
 important is that the ball does not fall and 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.410
 Maybe you're going through it because it's going to happen 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.330
 more points 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.480
 here I am giving me the very good are bases 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.060
 they calculated the strength 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.069
 It can be a very light ride 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.420
 both when you stop the center button and 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.500
 they will not have any problem but what 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.750
 important is to calculate the force 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.250
 they're really going to be like almost song to 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.470
 a bar and a half what they will be 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.180
 doing and if they do it right it's going to be very 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.459
 easy for you to achieve this exercise 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.010
 well how fast do I do it and it's even a 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.840
 super super good match and it does not have 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.349
 greater difficulty the key is to maintain 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.940
 pressed the lt or the l 2 is what 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.160
 important because if it passes pumping that 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.140
 it will be that they will be able to walk 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.349
 the passes from here that was fast was 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.690
 tillage was the property of four inmates 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.060
 how much I believe if he touches the ball 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.959
 layout and raising the bars but 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.520
 Well, it will not have a bigger problem 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.290
 technical collection 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.650
 good friends, I hope you liked it 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.660
 it's tutorial you know something special 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.610
 specific web, please write to me in the 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.550
 part and we'll gladly see you 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.470
 you very well I will be zero and remember 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.630
 I giving passes pumped and lying 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.630
 put a bottle without for life
