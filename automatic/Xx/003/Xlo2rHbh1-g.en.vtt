00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 plans of the house these are the planes 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.240
 which obviously made the architect streets 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.360
 is there the signature of him is the plane 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.320
 general now the ground floor where is 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.639
 the kitchen obviously a living a place 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.109
 that those who called us the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.940
 confessionary the families of manu 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.770
 officials because it was a place where 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.539
 Nestor sat had two armchairs one 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.279
 in front of another where he sat with 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.580
 the politicians to talk about politics is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.630
 I was sitting across the front that this part is the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.630
 that is apart from this house 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.990
 reeds was the architect who did all the 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.240
 work or as with all the tape the only 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.989
 modification they asked for is the 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.390
 space for the vault and he knows that 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.920
 after the house was extended that the wide 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
 Pablo Grippo who is the architect who 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.980
 did the willows hotel that is at 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.410
 side that you have them that is next 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.050
 from this house what does not know what you do 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.520
 well that did cane knows that add a 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.440
 desk that cristina creates a 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.040
 desk but I listen to the versions of 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.440
 that we could just talk about the 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.730
 that we have sure is that this is 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.070
 that will appear now in a little while in 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.810
 the planes that is this in this one that is 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.900
 in this place below is the place where 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.970
 Cristina makes ribbons like the gym 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.040
 we saw a picture of the interior this is the 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.810
 place has five plasmas and that is 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:22.299
 yellow is the barrier is a room 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.720
 machines our ladder goes up to the 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.830
 high floor is in the vault as 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.620
 specific streets one meter 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.180
 Depth 2 in width 2 meters 50 in 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.950
 high has input to give a name 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.040
 very loud is not that the voice is great and 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.260
 because 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.580
 reproduce we made a scale plane 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.160
 reproducing exactly how 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.590
 would that subsoil look this is this 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.689
 stairs 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.049
 this is the entire top floor of the 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.719
 family here come down from the ground floor of 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.939
 the top floor and already this house do that 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.819
 sort of semi-subsoil and you found yourself 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.829
 with a door a normal door is the 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.810
 door that cagna said the closed and 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:07.229
 barreiro got the key you open that 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.229
 door and there is another door 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.890
 it was said that this pole had cost 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.290
 about 15 thousand dollars an armored door 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.230
 while this 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.239
 it is the vault 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.709
 and then close this door so that 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.599
 see the exact dimension with the camera 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.040
 above with what is called plane 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.040
 to see if you do not see yourself to look 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:36.010
 arrives here from here to here 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.010
 I enter walking quite comfortable 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.650
 this vault 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.860
 look at this drawer we put it as 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.960
 sample 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.240
 500 euro bills 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.080
 this drawer nothing else any of these 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.710
 drawers has two and a half million of 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.050
 euros any of these drawers 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.050
 has two and a half million euros 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.480
 go figure 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.140
 multiply the drawers that you only see here 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.610
 that they are not at all the box full I 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.319
 they showed from the back and this 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:18.640
 good part here in only what you see there 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.640
 127 million five hundred thousand euros 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.340
 127 million five hundred thousand euros in 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.200
 500 notes 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.540
 to two and a half million per drawer 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.940
 if all this vault were covered 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.450
 of money 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.640
 there would be 3000 million 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.560
 three billion euros 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.870
 this is the famous vault here is the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.130
 famous vault you saw in the planes and 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.959
 the time now physically that's why 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.790
 we wanted to make it so that it would be understood 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.260
 what we were talking about is not a box 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.270
 strong within the unemployed as 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.030
 quite quite higher than I 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.430
 I measure metro 82 this is pretty much higher 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.110
 and good and look pretty longest 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.780
 space I do not know we started the block 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.650
 talking to arnold and I wanted to show 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.989
 of what Arnold said when I asked him 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.940
 why cristina does not answer us because 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.800
 does not talk about everything we're 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.800
 showing look at home us back 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.870
 when he arrived before Christina 30 years 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.370
 30 years because he does not say a word of 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.160
 All this 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.040
 because I guess you should follow 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.360
 pretending to be unpolluted she always 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.850
 it was handled like I did not know 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.680
 absolutely nothing of the machinations that 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.220
 they started seeing here in the last time 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.690
 but at least what I started to see 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.780
 and he always had a much lower profile 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:51.310
 that she with all the 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.800
 appearance in all receptions more 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.200
 once the old is first the 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.510
 hard for a choker of 50 thousand 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.960
 dollars to use for them and he does not 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.419
 he liked nothing is a man who does not 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.610
 he wore if he had another custom 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.530
 the rents for example at the beginning 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.760
 I liked having it several days in the 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.240
 pocket in dadaab pockets 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.120
 huge full of silver were charged 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.950
 copetti that is worth it I think that or if 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.760
 there is a month in an investigation in 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:26.160
 contrast 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:27.810
 but it depends of course where they got it from and 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.880
 in that obviously she can not be 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.710
 agent I'm sure there's a lot of 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.480
 business that has now made her 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.930
 It has nothing to do or feel to know 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.600
 but lazaro gas goes shotgun 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.280
 gardener who has hotels for all 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.950

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.870
 transportation companies partner

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.530
 house where it is in the vault 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.350
