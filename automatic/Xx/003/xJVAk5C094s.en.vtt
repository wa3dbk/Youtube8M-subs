 of 5 megapixels now let's go back to the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.329
 esthetically equipment is well live tour 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.429
 It comes in two colors white and 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.830
 black in a plastic construction 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.410
 quite elegant and in a format without 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.040
 so much curvature what it reminds 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.170
 an iphone 5 or 5 s its 5 inches 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.880
 a screen with very good quality of 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.340
 image thanks to the use of 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.620
 ips technology and systems that enhance 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.630
 sharpness of the content displayed in it 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.150
 the sad ones are the benchmark 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.280
 having a great machine inside very 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.440
 superior to several phones on the market 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.180
 does not have great performance next to 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.360
 other smartphones that are even 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.240
 discontinued is more blue comparison 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.550
 live with a galaxy s 4 but at the time of 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.530
 execute a tutu your performance arrives 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.860
 to be lower than the average that delivers 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.750
 a galaxy s3 with respect to your camera and in 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.580
 relation to photography there is a praiseworthy 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.140
 work for the captured images 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.270
 diaz both light and flash 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.340
 question that really was a pleasure 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.110
 surprise for us the photography is 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.460
 that capture live tour can have a 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.440
 size of 4,163 by three thousand 122 pixels 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.110
 and its good result is due to the 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.930
 technology blue bright blast which makes 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.119
 the good result that we exemplify by 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.610
 another part the hd video record or 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.610
 full hd at 30 frames per second that 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.709
 does this device let you want your 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.400
 Image stabilizer is not the best and 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.650
 your registration 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.829
 is very high in compression when using 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.799
 3gp format in a more advanced standard 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:28.409
 now in a matter of software away is 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.030
 the best of the phone as it includes a 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.250
 modified version of the interface 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.590
 quite simple android to what 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.450
 we usually see when you unlock a 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.970
 live your what you see are immediately 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.069
 shortcut icons to all 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.200
 programs and services very different from what 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.480
 which usually offers android to have 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.489
 widgets as inputs and a section 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.180
 different where all the 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.400
 Applications 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.349
 for that reason good point for blue in 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.659
 exemplify the android experience in 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.909
 conclusion light view is a great team 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.489
 but incomparable as blue waits with 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:02.040
 other successful devices they are 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.750
 parts of the new medium / high range and 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.879
 they have a good chance to fight 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.379
 in the segment where others are 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.170
 device developers like 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.090
 alcatel one touch or huawei but looking 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.239
 still in the distance to a samsung from the 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.069
 line so an htc with its line one 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.530
 it is worth noting that the live tour includes 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.930
 a housing and screen protectors 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.400
 gift to protect your team question 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.400
 that really very little
