now<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:01.469> might<00:00:01.709> seem<00:00:01.979> like<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.220> bit<00:00:02.460> of<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.610> non

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
now this might seem like a bit of a non

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.460 
now this might seem like a bit of a non
sequitur<00:00:03.060> but<00:00:03.570> did<00:00:03.720> you<00:00:03.840> know<00:00:03.959> that<00:00:03.990> all<00:00:04.319> the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
sequitur but did you know that all the

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.740 
sequitur but did you know that all the
classes<00:00:04.920> are<00:00:05.040> color-coded<00:00:05.700> that's<00:00:06.420> right

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
classes are color-coded that's right

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.540 
classes are color-coded that's right
each<00:00:07.020> class<00:00:07.440> has<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.740> particular<00:00:08.280> color

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
each class has a particular color

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.879 
each class has a particular color
assigned<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.120> it<00:00:09.300> for<00:00:09.719> instance<00:00:10.080> warriors

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
assigned to it for instance warriors

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.160 
assigned to it for instance warriors
have<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.340> color<00:00:11.550> tan<00:00:11.969> assigned<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.719> them<00:00:12.870> that

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
have the color tan assigned to them that

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.379 
have the color tan assigned to them that
kind<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.500> makes<00:00:13.710> sense<00:00:13.889> tan<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.820> kind<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.240> an

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
kind of makes sense tan is kind of an

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.460 
kind of makes sense tan is kind of an
armor<00:00:15.750> color<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.710> yeah<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.520> makes<00:00:17.730> sense

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
armor color so yeah it makes sense

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.810 
armor color so yeah it makes sense
unfortunately<00:00:19.470> they<00:00:19.650> can't<00:00:19.920> use<00:00:20.130> red<00:00:20.460> because

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
unfortunately they can't use red because

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.519 
unfortunately they can't use red because
red<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.630> color<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.900> they<00:00:22.140> used<00:00:22.380> to

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
red is the color that they used to

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.200 
red is the color that they used to
indicate<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.920> player's<00:00:23.220> dead<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:23.970> can't

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
indicate a player's dead and they can't

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.730 
indicate a player's dead and they can't
use<00:00:24.390> gray<00:00:24.689> either<00:00:24.990> because<00:00:25.289> that's<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.619> color

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
use gray either because that's the color

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.560 
use gray either because that's the color
they<00:00:26.010> use<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.340> indicate<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.730> player's<00:00:27.029> offline

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
they use to indicate a player's offline

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.419 
they use to indicate a player's offline
but<00:00:28.380> there's<00:00:28.500> still<00:00:28.710> plenty<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.039> colors<00:00:29.310> in

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
but there's still plenty of colors in

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.150 
but there's still plenty of colors in
the<00:00:29.519> rainbow<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.880> choose<00:00:30.150> from<00:00:30.470> like<00:00:31.470> mages

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the rainbow to choose from like mages

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160 
the rainbow to choose from like mages
they<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.030> light<00:00:33.300> blue<00:00:33.570> for<00:00:33.600> their<00:00:33.899> color

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
they have light blue for their color

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.139 
they have light blue for their color
that<00:00:34.649> pretty<00:00:34.890> much<00:00:35.040> makes<00:00:35.250> sense<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.790> mean<00:00:35.850> I'm

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
that pretty much makes sense I mean I'm

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.260 
that pretty much makes sense I mean I'm
thinking<00:00:36.300> light<00:00:36.660> blue<00:00:36.960> electricity<00:00:37.950> energy

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
thinking light blue electricity energy

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.810 
thinking light blue electricity energy
magic<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.899> works<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.500> then<00:00:41.340> there's<00:00:41.520> rogues

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
magic it works and then there's rogues

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.940 
magic it works and then there's rogues
their<00:00:42.390> colors<00:00:42.690> yellow<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.320> guess<00:00:43.649> that's<00:00:43.860> not

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
their colors yellow I guess that's not

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.920 
their colors yellow I guess that's not
too<00:00:44.340> big<00:00:44.550> an<00:00:44.640> insult<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.120> them<00:00:45.300> considering

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
too big an insult to them considering

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.810 
too big an insult to them considering
that<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.260> energy<00:00:46.590> bar<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.920> also<00:00:47.280> yellow<00:00:47.550> I

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
that the energy bar is also yellow I

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.160 
that the energy bar is also yellow I
guess<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.360> kind<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.600> makes<00:00:48.780> sense

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
guess it kind of makes sense

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.619 
guess it kind of makes sense
the<00:00:49.950> Warlock<00:00:50.340> color<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.850> dark<00:00:51.120> purple<00:00:51.180> which

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
the Warlock color is dark purple which

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.240 
the Warlock color is dark purple which
makes<00:00:51.870> sense<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> dark<00:00:52.980> color

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
makes sense because it's a dark color

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.330 
makes sense because it's a dark color
and<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.969> want<00:00:54.149> darkness<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.870> warlocks<00:00:55.340> light

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
and you want darkness for warlocks light

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.920 
and you want darkness for warlocks light
green<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.910> hunters<00:00:57.210> color<00:00:57.449> which<00:00:57.690> also

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
green is the hunters color which also

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.689 
green is the hunters color which also
makes<00:00:58.260> sense<00:00:58.530> green<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> color<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
makes sense green is the color of the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.369 
makes sense green is the color of the
great<00:00:59.910> outdoors<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> great<00:01:00.780> outdoors<00:01:01.199> is

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
great outdoors and the great outdoors is

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.410 
great outdoors and the great outdoors is
where<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.649> hunt<00:01:01.859> priests<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> color

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
where you hunt priests have the color

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.149 
where you hunt priests have the color
white<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.019> white<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> color<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.739> purity

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
white and white is the color of purity

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.880 
white and white is the color of purity
so<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.460> also<00:01:05.640> makes<00:01:05.970> sense<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.619> druids<00:01:07.619> they

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
so that also makes sense and druids they

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.010 
so that also makes sense and druids they
have<00:01:08.100> orange<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.790> doesn't<00:01:09.360> quite<00:01:09.750> make

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
have orange that doesn't quite make

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.600 
have orange that doesn't quite make
sense<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.740> guess<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.220> works<00:01:11.430> because

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
sense but I guess it works because

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
sense but I guess it works because
orange<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> kind<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.659> naturist<00:01:12.990> color<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
orange is a kind of a naturist color and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.770 
orange is a kind of a naturist color and
druids<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.670> into<00:01:14.909> nature<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.570> still

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
druids are all into nature so it still

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.410 
druids are all into nature so it still
works<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.549> what<00:01:17.549> color<00:01:17.790> does<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.150> leave<00:01:18.390> for

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
works so what color does that leave for

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.890 
works so what color does that leave for
paladins<00:01:19.140> mm-hmm<00:01:20.159> well<00:01:20.909> considering<00:01:21.810> that

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
paladins mm-hmm well considering that

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.390 
paladins mm-hmm well considering that
we're<00:01:22.049> all<00:01:22.170> about<00:01:22.470> goodness<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.220> wear

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
we're all about goodness and we wear

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.990 
we're all about goodness and we wear
armor

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
armor

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.719

maybe our color is gold I mean gold

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.490 
maybe our color is gold I mean gold
armor<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.390> would<00:01:27.540> fit<00:01:27.750> perfectly<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
armor that would fit perfectly for a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.920 
armor that would fit perfectly for a
holy<00:01:28.680> warrior<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.820> yeah<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.299> bet<00:01:30.509> our<00:01:30.540> color<00:01:30.810> is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
holy warrior so yeah I bet our color is

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
maybe it'll clear something up if I take

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.670 
maybe it'll clear something up if I take
a<00:01:41.850> look<00:01:42.060> at<00:01:42.180> what<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> Shaymin<00:01:42.869> color<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.409> I
