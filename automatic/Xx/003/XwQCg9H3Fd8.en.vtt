ridiculous<00:02:03.280> like<00:02:04.280> not<00:02:04.759> even<00:02:04.939> close<00:02:05.240> like

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
ridiculous like not even close like

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.990 
ridiculous like not even close like
pretty<00:02:06.350> good<00:02:06.649> kind<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.219> getting<00:02:07.399> this<00:02:07.490> spin<00:02:07.850> of

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
pretty good kind of getting this spin of

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.120 
pretty good kind of getting this spin of
like<00:02:08.239> whatever<00:02:08.780> but<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.560> seems<00:02:09.800> like<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.009> need

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
turning and everything there's a whole

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.610 
turning and everything there's a whole
bunch<00:02:29.269> of<00:02:29.390> little<00:02:29.540> rocks<00:02:29.870> like<00:02:30.170> everywhere

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
bunch of little rocks like everywhere

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.640 
bunch of little rocks like everywhere
under<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.040> pavilion<00:02:31.519> so<00:02:32.450> i<00:02:32.780> tried<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.230> first

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
under the pavilion so i tried the first

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.350 
under the pavilion so i tried the first
trick<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.190> then<00:02:34.310> i<00:02:34.579> upload<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.269> it

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
trick and then i upload it and it

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.809 
trick and then i upload it and it
stopped<00:02:35.660> at<00:02:35.900> thirty-eight<00:02:36.890> percent<00:02:37.069> like

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
stopped at thirty-eight percent like

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.819 
stopped at thirty-eight percent like
because<00:02:38.209> there's<00:02:38.360> like<00:02:38.569> Wi-Fi<00:02:39.079> there<00:02:39.349> and

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
because there's like Wi-Fi there and

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.259 
because there's like Wi-Fi there and
stopped<00:02:40.099> at<00:02:40.220> thirty<00:02:40.489> percent<00:02:40.940> then<00:02:41.120> when

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
stopped at thirty percent then when

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.089 
stopped at thirty percent then when
going<00:02:41.420> back<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.780> house<00:02:41.930> then<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.860> round

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
going back to the house then that round

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.069 
going back to the house then that round
is<00:02:43.250> over<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.640> then<00:02:43.700> like<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.150> ground<00:02:44.840> was

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
is over and then like the ground was

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.420 
is over and then like the ground was
still<00:02:45.170> like<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.650> stopped<00:02:45.920> raining<00:02:46.099> but<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
still like it stopped raining but the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.680 
still like it stopped raining but the
ground<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:46.819> everything<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.239> still<00:02:47.480> wet<00:02:47.660> and

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
ground and everything is still wet and

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.289 
ground and everything is still wet and
also<00:02:48.319> is<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:48.590> hard<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:48.980> do<00:02:49.130> like<00:02:49.340> ever<00:02:50.180> like

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
also is so hard to do like ever like

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.440 
also is so hard to do like ever like
tricks<00:02:50.599> afterwards<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.030> actually<00:02:53.180> found

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
tricks afterwards so you actually found

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.210 
tricks afterwards so you actually found
like<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.690> pavilion<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.739> figured<00:02:55.040> out<00:02:55.160> like

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
like a pavilion and you figured out like

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.610 
like a pavilion and you figured out like
if<00:02:55.670> they<00:02:55.849> had<00:02:56.030> Wi-Fi<00:02:56.269> there<00:02:56.870> i<00:02:57.079> think<00:02:57.350> your<00:02:57.440> dad

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
if they had Wi-Fi there i think your dad

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.890 
if they had Wi-Fi there i think your dad
said<00:02:57.920> like<00:02:58.069> you<00:02:58.310> went<00:02:58.790> there<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.450> check<00:02:59.630> it<00:02:59.690> out

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
said like you went there to check it out

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.809 
said like you went there to check it out
and<00:03:00.079> see<00:03:00.139> if<00:03:00.319> you<00:03:00.440> could<00:03:00.590> upload<00:03:01.250> videos<00:03:01.700> from

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
and see if you could upload videos from

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.370 
and see if you could upload videos from
that<00:03:01.970> spot<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.540> right<00:03:02.780> yeah<00:03:03.139> we<00:03:03.319> went

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
that spot is that right yeah we went

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.690 
that spot is that right yeah we went
there<00:03:03.500> like<00:03:03.680> two<00:03:03.889> days<00:03:04.069> before<00:03:04.100> and

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
there like two days before and

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.400 
there like two days before and
everything<00:03:05.120> worked<00:03:05.329> out<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.870> stuff<00:03:06.049> i<00:03:06.230> guess

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
everything worked out and stuff i guess

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.379 
everything worked out and stuff i guess
because<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:07.040> day<00:03:07.220> we<00:03:07.549> like<00:03:07.790> i<00:03:07.940> went<00:03:08.090> there<00:03:08.209> to

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
because the day we like i went there to

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.370 
because the day we like i went there to
do<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.600> trick<00:03:08.750> because<00:03:08.930> of<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.200> rain

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
do the trick because of the rain

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.680 
do the trick because of the rain
everything<00:03:09.950> it's<00:03:10.579> just<00:03:10.790> like<00:03:10.850> just<00:03:11.510> like

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
everything it's just like just like

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.800 
everything it's just like just like
wasn't<00:03:12.230> enough<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.709> upload<00:03:12.859> a<00:03:12.980> video<00:03:13.690> so<00:03:14.690> on

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
wasn't enough to upload a video so on

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.559 
wasn't enough to upload a video so on
the<00:03:14.900> day<00:03:15.049> of<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:15.290> finals<00:03:15.680> did<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.970> do<00:03:17.120> like
