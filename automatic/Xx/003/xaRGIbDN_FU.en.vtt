00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.170
 before beginning this chapter of 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.779
 minecraft I know you have asked me 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.890
 I want to tell you a lot, I know that 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.420
 they're going to be asking in a lot of 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.800
 why I cut hair until hermann 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.660
 tilke little we cut the hair but 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.130
 because you'll leave bald imbecile and the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.289
 truth is that I was lazy 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.369
 hairdresser and I preferred to cut the hole and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.990
 this is the only way I could 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.400
 cut me the hole but do not worry 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.960
 because my hair already know that I grow 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.330
 super fast and the truth is not worth the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.740
 It's worth talking about that because I think that my 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.840
 dog is going to grow I think in a month 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.000
 and I'll have normal as a person 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.510
 normal and decent ops just voted me 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.800
 pay more and nothing nothing the truth not what 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.030
 I did for no particular reason 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.950
 about I was bored and I wanted to change 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.809
 a little look because my hair really 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.160
 already super long that I had him lead 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.620
 until here I had a little boring 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.940
 so I think it was time to change 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.510
 extremely now I already look like pit bull 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.700
 is pitbull or that type of the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.899
 transporter remember and good good 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.940
 I wanted to tell you going back to minecraft 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.680
 I already made my house remember I'll 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.940
 show them a little bit that outside the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.020
 here let's say in the last chapter ago 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.890
 like three months that is the last 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.969
 chapter 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.949
 I look super weird but I do not 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.329
 I used to see myself and we got there 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.730
 there were a lot of animals 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.350
 lions and I said here I'm going to make my house 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.970
 My little house was made of clay because 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.770
 I did not have wood or had anything else and I think 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.450
 I 'm going to be slower to do it auto 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.030
 material I'm going to show you my little 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.190
 little house that I was doing well before 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.180
 to show you my house I want to tell you 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.310
 another thing that says back I have dogs 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.280
 well in fact technically they are wolves and 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.150
 it cost me a million but a million 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.560
 years finding them was very difficult I was 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.350
 looking in google and they told me that 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.890
 first to train balloons needed 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.140
 bone bones skeleton answers 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.180
 that are only obtained by killing writings 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.910
 so I was actually marked in the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.740
 map in the area where was german house 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.960
 good cave in fact somewhere 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.150
 I have marked the place where I went to 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.770
 look for skeletons because work a lot 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.150
 many hours are the skeletons and I do not 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.940
 it seems entertaining to record that so 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.190
 well then find the bones I went to 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.720
 forest in fact I have engraved here not 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.210
 recorded but marked on the map there 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.770
 first mine where the wolf says it is 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.750
 where is the forest where supposedly 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.280
 the wolves appeared and I was made a 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.569
 small house like a small shelter there 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.609
 I was hours hours 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.319
 hours and hours waiting for them to appear 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:15.150
 the wolves then told them that later 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.920
 when I found it and how domestic and 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.549
 Now I have things that I say are wolves that 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.549
 they worried me 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.810
 when everything is wrong and the truth makes a 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.280
 bad time I wanted to have pets but not 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.280
 I had her because she comes with me 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.379
 I think I 'm not going to close the door 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.760
 if it is showing my house this is 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.139
 the house remembers that the other one 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.230
 time and I said I'm going to make a small house 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:44.639
 around here and I went on the side there is is 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.139
 a slightly large two-story house 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.669
 but I want this to be my house 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.049
 definitive and I'll fix it I'll 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.829
 keep changing the material 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.829
 google.org 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.080
 football 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.640
 no need food meal food 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.750
 I'm going to open food because I do not have 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.310
 community to move nor two demons 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.540
 because there is more life in this little 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.210
 detail I think when a little bit of 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.760
 food here to see leather mushrooms there's 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.620
 food I have to kill a pig to ok ok 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.720
 I visit food meal food meal and a 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.690
 sheep maybe they give me food I'm going to 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.070
 die 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.590
 I do not want to die starting the chapter 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.210
 more the box way are you that 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.770
 I need something to kill the horse 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.500

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.310
 horse food does not want to sacrifice 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.310
 but you die voting 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.690

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.750

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.320
 I want a tiger the tiger I do not like 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.800
 where there is food the sheep do not give 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.260
 food for the memory I'm going to die 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.660
 demon demons no no I want I'm going to 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.830
 lose all the things that I have 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.320
 but they are not so many things but they are 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:56.760
 many things for me 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.760
 I need food food no no no 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.040
 two 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:14.690
 to gay number great number just lets me 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:18.340
 until something 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.340
 a goat goats give food 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.620
 and me 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.690
 to know who gave me 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.310
 I did not give anything the stupid goat or that 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.720
 I really need something to eat now 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.720
 he was telling me 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.540
 deer deer to deny me some 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:41.540
 eating are good habits here 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.540
 benedito 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:48.179
 nobody gives me food seriously and salt hides 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.179
 and I can eat it 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:53.870
 and I was counting that memory very much 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.460
 in addis bring these good animals 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.810
 these wolves that are following me and 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.310
 now the next good task already 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.360
 I showed the house true the next task 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.800
 What I want to do is go find a 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.199
 cave and start looking for materials that 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.789
 the last chapter I lost all agree 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.789
 and now I need a lot of materials to 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:09.080
 start again this adventure that 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.090
 I already want that I want to start playing 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.379
 minecraft so a little later my 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.139
 home 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:16.849
 German is there and I'm going to start doing 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.620
 my house much more sorry I'm going to start 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.969
 minecraft play much more often because 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.340
 I think this playing from time to time 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:24.469
 every two months is not very entertaining 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.939
 so I'm going to play at least once 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.939
 a week or twice a week 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.120
 so much animal and nobody that gives me food 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.570
 so I'm going to leave my things 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.510
 I'm going to look for things there in my house and 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.630
 in fact I need food before but 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.930
 see that the pigs give me food but I do not 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.850
 there are pigs pigs 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.759
 that's the problem in this way I think that 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:55.009
 there is so much animal there is not so much 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.009
 food meal out for me 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:01.979
 good that seems here 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.979
 although I lost all my things 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:07.809
 look for materials if I find things 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:09.669
 at least find materials 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:11.229
 to be able to really start playing 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.490
 minecraft well and start to find 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:14.379
 diamond for example and start 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.729
 find materials that I can already occupy 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.469
 in the long term because I do not want to start 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.059
 again minecraft because I'm already 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:20.709
 tired of being a knot honestly 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:22.419
 I want to stop being a not so 

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:23.740
 first of all we are going to go to them 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.129
 finish by demonstrating the proven 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.330
 I was up I want to start making a 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.559
 aquarium species and I think I already did 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.330
 but I want to show but anyway 

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:34.259
 to find a couple of things that I think 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.259
 that our try 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:42.369
 what the fuck, that's just you 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:44.879
 let's save the one that the word 

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:48.249
 this because it probably needs to be 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:50.109
 he needs to make spikes and things like that 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:51.609
 to see and see, I had not shown 

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:53.079
 this I want to make a fish tank here good 

00:06:51.609 --> 00:06:55.029
 in fact the fish tank is already made but 

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:57.219
 I want to put fish and hopefully sharks and 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:58.299
 things like that I do not know if you can but I read by 

00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:00.099
 there you can so it would be 

00:06:58.299 --> 00:07:02.109
 interesting also that install a mode 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:04.589
 a mod sorry a pack pack 

00:07:02.109 --> 00:07:04.589
 textures
