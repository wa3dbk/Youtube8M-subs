hi I'm Tim Gipson and I want to show you
how<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.820> use<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.149> handsaw<00:00:03.720> now<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.710> first<00:00:04.980> thing

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
how to use a handsaw now the first thing

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.780 
how to use a handsaw now the first thing
we<00:00:05.339> want<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.580> do<00:00:05.790> is<00:00:06.060> we<00:00:06.270> want<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.629> mark<00:00:07.790> the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
we want to do is we want to mark the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.850 
we want to do is we want to mark the
area<00:00:09.179> that<00:00:09.420> we're<00:00:09.599> going<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.900> be<00:00:10.050> sawing

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
area that we're going to be sawing

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.050 
area that we're going to be sawing
so<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:12.000> this<00:00:12.150> case<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.870> want<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:15.560> cut<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.740> board

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
so in this case I want to cut this board

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.340 
so in this case I want to cut this board
73<00:00:18.060> inches<00:00:18.270> long<00:00:20.539> so<00:00:21.539> I'm<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.900> use<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.199> my

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
73 inches long so I'm going to use it my

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:30.529 
73 inches long so I'm going to use it my
tape<00:00:22.590> measure<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.220> make<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> mark<00:00:27.980> and<00:00:29.539> then

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
tape measure and make a mark and then

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.990 
tape measure and make a mark and then
use<00:00:31.109> my<00:00:31.140> speed<00:00:31.679> square<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:37.399> mark<00:00:38.399> my<00:00:38.640> square

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
use my speed square to mark my square

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.200 
use my speed square to mark my square
line<00:00:42.800> okay<00:00:43.829> now<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> important<00:00:44.879> thing<00:00:45.059> this

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
line okay now the important thing this

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.630 
line okay now the important thing this
is<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> an<00:00:46.320> actual<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.770> tool<00:00:47.280> box<00:00:47.520> saw<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:49.640> but

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
is a an actual a tool box saw and but

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.250 
is a an actual a tool box saw and but
the<00:00:50.789> principle<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.360> whether<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.840> tool<00:00:52.020> box

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the principle is whether it's a tool box

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.029 
the principle is whether it's a tool box
saw<00:00:52.820> such<00:00:53.820> as<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.210> size<00:00:54.539> or<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> full<00:00:55.469> size<00:00:55.739> saw

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
saw such as this size or a full size saw

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.500 
saw such as this size or a full size saw
the<00:00:56.520> principles<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.180> using<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.660> are<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> same

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
the principles of using it are the same

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.490 
the principles of using it are the same
now<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.600> want<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.870> make<00:01:00.989> sure<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
now you want to make sure you have a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.410 
now you want to make sure you have a
nice<00:01:01.770> firm<00:01:02.070> foundation<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.879> actually<00:01:03.090> have

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
nice firm foundation I actually have

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.469 
nice firm foundation I actually have
this<00:01:03.629> board<00:01:03.930> supported<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.970> workbench

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
this board supported on this workbench

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.500 
this board supported on this workbench
and<00:01:06.930> also<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.770> sawhorse<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.360> very

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
and also this sawhorse so it's very

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.170 
and also this sawhorse so it's very
important<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> good<00:01:11.820> steady

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
important that you have a good steady

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.070 
important that you have a good steady
platform<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.960> work<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.330> then<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.689> hold<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
platform to work on and then to hold the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.510 
platform to work on and then to hold the
saw<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.470> actually<00:01:16.770> want<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.009> point<00:01:17.280> your

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
saw you actually want to point your

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.800 
saw you actually want to point your
finger<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.869> direction<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:20.240> then<00:01:21.240> grip<00:01:21.630> it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
finger in the direction and then grip it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.340 
finger in the direction and then grip it
with<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.110> other<00:01:22.259> three<00:01:22.590> fingers<00:01:24.020> now<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.170> want

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
with the other three fingers now we want

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.160 
with the other three fingers now we want
to<00:01:25.439> line<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.920> saw<00:01:26.299> just<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> outside

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
to line up the saw just to the outside

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.460 
to line up the saw just to the outside
and<00:01:28.530> when<00:01:29.040> you're<00:01:29.189> cutting<00:01:30.110> when<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.229> cut

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
and when you're cutting when you cut

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.200 
and when you're cutting when you cut
that<00:01:31.650> dimension<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.130> dimensions<00:01:32.759> usually

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
that dimension that dimensions usually

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.630 
that dimension that dimensions usually
to<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> center<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> line<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.159> when<00:01:35.490> you're

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
to the center of the line so when you're

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.670 
to the center of the line so when you're
cutting<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.420> want<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.720> leave<00:01:36.869> about<00:01:37.170> half

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
cutting you want to leave about half

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.399 
cutting you want to leave about half
that<00:01:38.009> line<00:01:38.310> visible<00:01:39.060> as<00:01:39.240> you're<00:01:39.630> cutting<00:01:39.840> now

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that line visible as you're cutting now

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.010 
that line visible as you're cutting now
to<00:01:40.619> stock<00:01:40.920> your<00:01:40.950> saw<00:01:41.570> you're<00:01:42.570> going<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.810> set

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
to stock your saw you're going to set

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.330 
to stock your saw you're going to set
your<00:01:43.170> blade<00:01:44.000> about<00:01:45.110> 3/4<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> way<00:01:46.350> towards

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
your blade about 3/4 of the way towards

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.060 
your blade about 3/4 of the way towards
the<00:01:47.490> handle<00:01:47.880> from<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> end<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.799> want<00:01:50.009> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the handle from the end and you want to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.969 
the handle from the end and you want to
pull<00:01:50.430> back<00:01:54.020> okay<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.140> pulling<00:01:55.439> back<00:01:55.619> allows

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
pull back okay and pulling back allows

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.520 
pull back okay and pulling back allows
you<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> create<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.579> notch<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.600> actually<00:01:58.200> get

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
you to create a notch to actually get

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.920 
you to create a notch to actually get
your<00:01:58.710> cutting<00:01:59.070> now<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.759> saws<00:02:00.240> are<00:02:00.509> designed

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
your cutting now the saws are designed

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.440 
your cutting now the saws are designed
so<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:02.100> cut<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.640> actually<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.420> your

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
so that your cut is actually on your

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.359 
so that your cut is actually on your
down<00:02:03.899> stroke<00:02:05.630> okay<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.710> allows<00:02:08.039> us<00:02:08.250> a

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
down stroke okay so it allows us a

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.219 
down stroke okay so it allows us a
little<00:02:08.550> better<00:02:08.789> control<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.810> start<00:02:10.080> that

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
little better control to start that

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.340 
little better control to start that
notch<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> back<00:02:11.220> stroke<00:02:12.020> now

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
notch with a back stroke now

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.370 
notch with a back stroke now
as<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:13.770> start<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.630> we<00:02:15.630> want<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.900> use<00:02:15.960> nice

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
as we start this we want to use nice

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.680 
as we start this we want to use nice
smooth<00:02:17.720> firm<00:02:18.720> strokes<00:02:19.940> now<00:02:20.940> what<00:02:21.420> you've<00:02:21.570> got

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
smooth firm strokes now what you've got

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.210 
smooth firm strokes now what you've got
to<00:02:21.780> be<00:02:21.840> careful<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.380> when<00:02:22.560> you're<00:02:22.710> using<00:02:22.740> your

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
to be careful of when you're using your

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.830 
to be careful of when you're using your
hand<00:02:23.460> saw<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.120> want<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.360> be<00:02:24.420> careful<00:02:24.660> not
