00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.130
 very good everyone knew mania and this 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.540
 is a small informative video in the 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.400
 that I am going to tell you a project that 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.130
 I'm doing through my blog that 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.470
 leave the link here in the description 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.810
 where I'm collecting data in a 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.820
 survey to try to make the top 20 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.070
 of the best magic cards in the year 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.260
 2012 the only requirement that there is for 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.689
 voting a letter is not exclusive 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.390
 of type 1 say that is the legacy in 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.040
 go ahead because I do this restriction 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.860
 because we all know that the letters of 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.010
 type 1 are very brute beasts and 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.089
 It would be illogical to put them in this vote 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.640
 the voting has started this morning 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.949
 at 12 or so there is already a total of 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.559
 about 15 or 20 votes and they will be 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.850
 open until December 1 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.040
 It's worth later when the 1st of 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.989
 December I will put to collect the data and 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.390
 in written form and in video here in 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.799
 youtube I will put the results of this 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.049
 survey so I encourage you all to 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.220
 enter this survey that as I have 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.470
 said before you have it here in the 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.240
 description nothing else that brings you five 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.470
 Minutitos does not require registration or 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.390
 all the demos that you ask the mail 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.219
 electronic by the fact that it is not 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.100
 repeat votes are worth those that occupy not 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.439
 is going to send you 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.200
 or anything like that is simply for 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.939
 that so that votes are not repeated and good 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.640
 I think you can only vote maximum 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.310
 five letters the first one will be given to 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.369
 ten points the second nine the third 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.600
 seven the fourth six and the fifth five 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.700
 valuable that you have to take into account 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.710
 the order in which you put the letters do not 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.009
 is lying about the format you use 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.220
 play you can mark several to do 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.930
 a little balance of the players that you 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.600
 they have voted the poll they played the most 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.610
 ok and do not ask for anything else the survey are 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.560
 five minutes and from here to a mesecito 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.149
 we will have the results and know 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.539
 how is a more or less approximate 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.220
 made by you of the best letters 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.200
 currently in the magic 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.500
 good and nothing else I say goodbye if it has 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.880
 liked to give like favorites 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.050
 subscribe and see you in the next 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.050
