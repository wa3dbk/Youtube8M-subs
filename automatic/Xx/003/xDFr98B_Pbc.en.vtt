other words if the cow is worth 10,000

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.240 
other words if the cow is worth 10,000
hours<00:01:36.990> he<00:01:37.140> wants<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.380> buy<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.560> may<00:01:37.740> be<00:01:37.799> four

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
hours he wants to buy it may be four

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.030 
hours he wants to buy it may be four
five<00:01:38.460> or<00:01:38.490> six<00:01:38.880> seven<00:01:39.180> hours<00:01:39.270> okay<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.740> this

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
five or six seven hours okay so this

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.690 
five or six seven hours okay so this
this<00:01:41.549> difference<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.270> marginal<00:01:42.420> safety

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
this difference is the marginal safety

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.830 
this difference is the marginal safety
so<00:01:44.700> that's<00:01:44.909> what<00:01:45.090> investing<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.570> all<00:01:45.659> about

you<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.880> understand<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:49.710> figure<00:01:49.950> out<00:01:50.009> how

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
you can understand you figure out how

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.770 
you can understand you figure out how
much<00:01:50.280> they're<00:01:50.520> worth<00:01:50.670> figure<00:01:51.299> out<00:01:51.390> how<00:01:51.659> much

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
much they're worth figure out how much

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.420 
much they're worth figure out how much
discount<00:01:52.140> needs<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> fair<00:01:52.860> value<00:01:53.189> they'll

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
discount needs to the fair value they'll

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.700 
discount needs to the fair value they'll
use<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.640> buy<00:01:53.850> price<00:01:54.119> when<00:01:54.810> companies<00:01:55.409> get<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
use you buy price when companies get to

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.560 
use you buy price when companies get to
this<00:01:55.829> by<00:01:56.100> price<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.579> buy<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.820> otherwise<00:01:57.329> you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
this by price you buy it otherwise you

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.569 
this by price you buy it otherwise you
just<00:01:57.659> wait<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.320> what<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.920> about<00:01:59.070> sideways

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
just wait so what is it about sideways

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.310 
just wait so what is it about sideways
markets<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.270> invest<00:02:00.600> differently<00:02:01.170> than

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
markets that you invest differently than

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.410 
markets that you invest differently than
you<00:02:01.380> do<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.799> regular<00:02:02.670> uptrending<00:02:03.240> or<00:02:03.390> a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
you do in a regular uptrending or a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.319 
you do in a regular uptrending or a
bearish<00:02:03.869> market<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.820> my<00:02:06.000> book<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.299> talk

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
bearish market so the in my book I talk

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.320 
bearish market so the in my book I talk
about<00:02:06.829> secular<00:02:07.829> which<00:02:08.009> means

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
about secular which means

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.510 
about secular which means
long-term<00:02:08.900> sideways<00:02:09.440> markets<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:10.009> every<00:02:10.430> what

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
long-term sideways markets so every what

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.490 
long-term sideways markets so every what
happened<00:02:10.850> over<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.000> last<00:02:11.030> 200<00:02:11.360> years<00:02:11.600> every

happened over the last 200 years every

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.010 
happened over the last 200 years every
time<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:12.950> had<00:02:13.130> a<00:02:13.450> protracted<00:02:14.450> bull<00:02:14.690> market

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
time you had a protracted bull market

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.390 
time you had a protracted bull market
bull<00:02:15.320> market<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.710> lasted<00:02:15.980> for<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.190> long<00:02:16.220> period

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
bull market it lasted for a long period

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.170 
bull market it lasted for a long period
of<00:02:16.550> time<00:02:16.610> stags<00:02:17.150> got<00:02:17.330> expensive<00:02:17.810> as<00:02:17.990> a<00:02:19.180> sign

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
of time stags got expensive as a sign

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.700 
of time stags got expensive as a sign
when<00:02:20.540> during<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.870> sideways<00:02:21.200> mark<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.590> then

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
when during the sideways mark and then

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.830 
when during the sideways mark and then
sideways<00:02:22.370> market<00:02:22.670> started<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.180> use<00:02:23.660> in

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
sideways market started and use in

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.450 
sideways market started and use in
sideways<00:02:24.110> market<00:02:24.530> foliations<00:02:25.040> declined

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
sideways market foliations declined

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.180 
sideways market foliations declined
little<00:02:25.910> by<00:02:26.000> little<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.560> earnings<00:02:27.560> grown<00:02:27.830> so

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
little by little and earnings grown so

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.580 
little by little and earnings grown so
those<00:02:28.460> two<00:02:28.850> cornea<00:02:29.390> those<00:02:29.630> two<00:02:29.930> forces<00:02:30.230> can

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
those two cornea those two forces can

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.410 
those two cornea those two forces can
work<00:02:30.800> against<00:02:31.130> each<00:02:31.220> other<00:02:31.400> that's<00:02:31.670> why<00:02:31.820> you

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
work against each other that's why you

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.940 
work against each other that's why you
have<00:02:32.600> a<00:02:32.630> lot<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:32.870> volatility<00:02:33.290> would<00:02:33.680> be<00:02:33.800> so

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
have a lot of volatility would be so

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.980 
have a lot of volatility would be so
lost<00:02:34.220> ten<00:02:34.430> years<00:02:34.700> but<00:02:35.240> stocks<00:02:35.510> really<00:02:35.810> don't

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
lost ten years but stocks really don't

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.940 
lost ten years but stocks really don't
go<00:02:36.080> anywhere<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:36.500> it's<00:02:36.620> kind<00:02:36.740> of<00:02:36.770> hard<00:02:36.830> to

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
go anywhere so it's kind of hard to

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.500 
go anywhere so it's kind of hard to
figure<00:02:37.130> earners<00:02:37.550> in<00:02:37.640> those<00:02:37.820> periods<00:02:38.270> and<00:02:38.390> it's

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
figure earners in those periods and it's

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.460 
figure earners in those periods and it's
kind<00:02:38.660> of<00:02:38.720> hard<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.900> figure<00:02:39.080> what<00:02:39.380> an

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
kind of hard to figure what an

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.080 
kind of hard to figure what an
appropriate<00:02:39.650> multiple<00:02:40.310> is<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.640> exactly

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
appropriate multiple is that exactly

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.790 
appropriate multiple is that exactly
exactly<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:41.720> today's<00:02:42.020> economy<00:02:42.260> makes<00:02:42.560> me

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
exactly and today's economy makes me

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.140 
exactly and today's economy makes me
more<00:02:43.010> difficult<00:02:43.430> when<00:02:43.520> it<00:02:43.640> comes<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.910> earnings

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
more difficult when it comes to earnings

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.810 
more difficult when it comes to earnings
because<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:45.500> know<00:02:45.590> we<00:02:45.740> had<00:02:45.890> basically<00:02:46.310> the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
because you know we had basically the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.550 
because you know we had basically the
Federal<00:02:47.090> Reserve<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.840> know<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.350> know<00:02:48.410> it's

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
Federal Reserve you know you know it's

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.760 
Federal Reserve you know you know it's
create<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.100> lot<00:02:49.220> of<00:02:49.310> bubbles<00:02:49.459> okay<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:50.770> which

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
create a lot of bubbles okay so which

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.690 
create a lot of bubbles okay so which
you<00:02:51.920> know<00:02:52.010> which<00:02:52.160> makes<00:02:52.370> things<00:02:52.550> more

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
you know which makes things more

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.720 
you know which makes things more
difficult<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:53.600> that's<00:02:54.140> why<00:02:54.320> that's<00:02:55.280> why<00:02:55.340> what

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
difficult so that's why that's why what

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.640 
difficult so that's why that's why what
we<00:02:55.820> know<00:02:55.970> when<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.209> look<00:02:56.930> at<00:02:57.050> companies<00:02:57.230> today<00:02:57.530> I

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
we know when I look at companies today I

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.840 
we know when I look at companies today I
try<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:57.950> stay<00:02:58.130> away<00:02:58.310> from<00:02:58.340> Brittany<00:02:58.790> are

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
try to stay away from Brittany are

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.699 
try to stay away from Brittany are
cyclical<00:02:59.150> companies<00:02:59.690> because<00:03:00.320> it's<00:03:00.470> very

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
cyclical companies because it's very

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.050 
cyclical companies because it's very
difficult<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.190> figure<00:03:01.400> out<00:03:01.550> what<00:03:01.910> their

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
difficult to figure out what their

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.699 
difficult to figure out what their
earnings<00:03:02.390> power<00:03:02.600> is<00:03:02.900> on<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.200> stuff<00:03:03.410> okay

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
earnings power is on the stuff okay

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:04.960 
earnings power is on the stuff okay
Union<00:03:03.980> Pacific<00:03:04.400> something<00:03:04.700> like<00:03:04.820> that

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
Union Pacific something like that

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.820 
Union Pacific something like that
they're<00:03:05.150> doing<00:03:05.270> great<00:03:06.050> now<00:03:06.260> but<00:03:06.530> they're<00:03:06.650> just

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
they're doing great now but they're just

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.350 
they're doing great now but they're just
they're<00:03:07.250> tied<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.580> commodities<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.209> that's

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
they're tied to commodities and that's

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.850 
they're tied to commodities and that's
tied<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.750> bubble<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.260> that's<00:03:09.410> not

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
tied to the bubble and that's not

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.010 
tied to the bubble and that's not
sustainable<00:03:10.070> exactly<00:03:10.940> so<00:03:11.060> that's<00:03:11.240> why<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.450> will

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
sustainable exactly so that's why I will

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.900 
sustainable exactly so that's why I will
stay<00:03:12.170> away<00:03:12.350> from<00:03:12.410> this<00:03:13.220> kind<00:03:13.370> of<00:03:13.459> stocks<00:03:13.700> yes

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
stay away from this kind of stocks yes

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.220 
stay away from this kind of stocks yes
okay<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:14.540> what<00:03:14.690> are<00:03:14.720> you<00:03:14.810> looking<00:03:14.870> at<00:03:15.080> what

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
okay so what are you looking at what

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.810 
okay so what are you looking at what
something<00:03:15.650> something<00:03:16.190> stables<00:03:16.519> got<00:03:16.700> about

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
something something stables got about
