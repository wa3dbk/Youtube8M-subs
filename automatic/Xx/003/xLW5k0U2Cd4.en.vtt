00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.740
 has been excited to be more excited and 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.680
 You want to know, two reasons to 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.779
 you stay well ray priests speaking 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.180
 in almost 15 first the characters go 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.490
 have five times as many polygons as 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.380
 would be in the previous generation and the second 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.470
 face that might be a cat in the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.750
 game is been a while that square 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.960
 Enix has been talking about the indy graphics game 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.390
 No, the call of the light shots the act is the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.510
 master lume artist in the second he 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.850
 the nomination in version 1.4 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.420
 but the fantastic demo 15 that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.110
 will be released with the ufpe 0h of already goes 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.620
 be with the base of version 1.5 and version 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.510
 definitive will already be version 2.0 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.449
 that is if what we saw in the demo 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.160
 agnes philosopher was then 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.660
 imagination in the final version of the game and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.629
 to complete the issue of graphs 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.060
 he said the game will run in 1080p and 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.860
 will run at 30 frames per second 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.900
 cool is not a beautiful wonderful game 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.520
 mainly for you to look at all this 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.229
 in the skin of a cat, right? 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.390
 To understand the car the school already had 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.369
 presented the city so as to 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.530
 sources and 15 and shown that people 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.600
 could exploit the area there 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.759
 from the point of view of a dog, right? 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.700
 so now we know that 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.500
 we could be a cat too explore 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.420
 a bit of a huge train station 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.240
 but not very excited at first not 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.040
 because here eth that dog and me that can 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.909
 be it not in the final version 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.829
 of the game 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.259
 because it is at least not early in life 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.790
 and of the game they made this scheme only 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.860
 to show part that we will not go 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.259
 to see in the final version of the title 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.570
 or is it a joke but is not that 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.159
 can be part of the game if the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.799
 want too much 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.460
 This is what the hardware said, right? 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.290
 any less 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.329
 and for those who do not know the designer face 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.100
 boss of the game and said that it is not 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.170
 planned but I do not understand either 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.810
 this game mode is not impossible 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.560
 to actually happen let's hope 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.009
 the crane a saucerful lad we went 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.650
 cheated as is is an image in type 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.709
 game show about a possible the supposed 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.930
 half real in 2011 crazy but now 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.500
 Speak that everything lies a trick is the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.870
 Hi 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.130
 the video is the one you see and the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.690
 minute and 39 it this number 2 appears and 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.610
 this number two is watching he follows the 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.250
 same graphical style of the first game of 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.620
 series and that left everyone there to send 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.540
 only there came the little law that 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.160
 seems to be friends with the konami guys and 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.500
 stated that this has nothing to do with 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.450
 nothing is no twitter postings it 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.790
 said he had talked to the fifth shot in 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.920
 May assumes that it is the design of the producer 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.140
 and that the image that this has nothing to do 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.769
 watch with metal gear rising 2 nothing nothing 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.690
 has to do 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.790
 the journalist still recommends that fans 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.230
 disregard the rumors because they are not 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.299
 true, right? 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.620
 but although the designer insists that everything 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.590
 was nothing more than a simple propaganda of 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.819
 sony in the event fans insist that this 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.970
 It's the kind of thing that kojima productions 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.730
 do it there so it will certainly not be a game 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.070
 or the guys talking about right but you 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.630
 they really think it's not so there to go around 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.030
 and cleaning up your long awaited playstation 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.290
 4 will delete in the game of grace that the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.049
 young people have always found a 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.060
 deleting dog because so analyzed 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.570
 and the list of eight and three draws with 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.570
 times of europe 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.930
 the adventure that was the discovery of 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.340
 new continents is one of the themes of 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.109
 our today screen 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.970
 we found that the game will weigh 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:41.940
 only 50 giga and this value of mine 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.519
 expensive is just to start since 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.370
 will have possible game updates 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.780
 and the total should increase a lot and good already 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.730
 that the game will be massive and with 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.140
 hundreds of hours of exploration 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.319
 Size is not at all absurd, I do not know 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.140
 compare with others 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.780
 just like 10 5, for example, do not look at it 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.430
 the storage space 23 of the xbox 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.620
 the year has not yet been revealed 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.659
 while the pc version needs 40 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.310
 gb of free space is more incisive 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.900
 the game arrives for these three platforms 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.389
 and I ended up commenting 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.040
 and on May 19 of that year, then 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:17.289
 anxious is going to free up space I did not say 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.250
 because it's worth the people we tried tried 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.739
 everything there 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.630
 but the last guardian was really 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.789
 abandoned by sony 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.770
 But calm down, man, because there are people there. 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.530
 inside the sony wants to see the game live and 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.680
 shining and cornering just as I am 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.330
 You and everyone, interview and smile. 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.729
 of kobayashi that the former producer 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.490
 executive of the game spoke about this 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.949
 sony have even abandoned the project but 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.169
 do not worry guys since 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.520
 after the shock of the site would have the same 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.070
 brought the game back the guy 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.539
 resurrected for but unfortunately this 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.759
 it does not mean that it has any 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.550
 information about the game season 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.620
 launch for example the guy left the 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.900
 sony to work in ismai the 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.190
 made it clear that he expects the title 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.259
 as much as people 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.870
 That's what we can do, it's just 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.520
 wait but at least expect to know 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.650
 that there are people inside NGOs 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.320
 they even want to see the last of order 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:15.370
 being released is something more exciting, right? 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.990
 It's the worst soap opera it sometimes does. 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.580
 less than two months since the expansion of 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.009
 iphone was released and thanks to the success 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.169
 of the general game is also as soon as the 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.210
 rumors about new expansions there to 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.860
 This card game looks just like other 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.490
 rumors of the breeze we will also see this 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.680

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.780

 the enemy does not find another player 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.580
 furthermore it seems that the developers 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.630
 are also working on a module 2 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.940

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.240
 best business model of the other lot
