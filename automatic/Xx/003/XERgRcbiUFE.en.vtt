like<00:02:52.400> fix<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:52.760> be<00:02:52.910> magical<00:02:53.360> but<00:02:53.540> they

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
like fix it be magical but they

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.440 
like fix it be magical but they
basically<00:02:54.260> told<00:02:54.770> me<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.010> if<00:02:55.490> I<00:02:55.910> wanted<00:02:55.940> to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
basically told me that if I wanted to

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.350 
basically told me that if I wanted to
kill<00:02:56.660> my<00:02:57.290> hair<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.800> could<00:02:57.980> do<00:02:58.130> that<00:02:58.160> but<00:02:58.970> if<00:02:59.030> I

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
kill my hair I could do that but if I

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.600 
kill my hair I could do that but if I
wanted<00:02:59.510> hair<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.350> stay<00:03:00.530> on<00:03:00.680> my<00:03:00.830> head<00:03:01.040> there<00:03:01.490> was

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
wanted hair to stay on my head there was

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.100 
wanted hair to stay on my head there was
no<00:03:01.850> way<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.270> was<00:03:02.330> going<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.570> go<00:03:02.660> from<00:03:02.870> that

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
no way that it was going to go from that

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.920 
no way that it was going to go from that
black<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.860> blond<00:03:04.190> in<00:03:04.520> one<00:03:04.760> day<00:03:04.940> so<00:03:05.180> I'm

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
black to that blond in one day so I'm

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.420 
black to that blond in one day so I'm
still<00:03:06.230> in<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.500> process<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.980> doing<00:03:07.160> it

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
still in the process of doing it

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.010 
still in the process of doing it
basically<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.060> my<00:03:08.240> hair<00:03:08.480> grows<00:03:08.690> really

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
basically and my hair grows really

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.870 
basically and my hair grows really
slowly<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:09.830> I<00:03:09.860> was<00:03:10.070> like<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:10.400> know<00:03:10.459> it's<00:03:10.610> going

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
slowly so I was like I know it's going

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.610 
slowly so I was like I know it's going
to<00:03:10.940> take<00:03:11.120> forever<00:03:11.300> if<00:03:11.840> I<00:03:11.959> try<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.170> just<00:03:12.320> grow<00:03:12.560> it

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
to take forever if I try to just grow it

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.020 
to take forever if I try to just grow it
up<00:03:12.740> myself<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.280> am<00:03:13.400> still<00:03:13.640> trying<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.910> grow

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.580 
up myself and I am still trying to grow
it<00:03:14.060> out<00:03:14.240> but<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:14.450> was<00:03:14.660> like<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:14.990> want<00:03:15.380> some

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
is sort of just a bunch of different

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.949 
is sort of just a bunch of different
hair<00:03:43.100> colors<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.120> closest<00:03:44.600> one<00:03:44.720> that<00:03:44.900> I

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
hair colors to the closest one that I

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.330 
hair colors to the closest one that I
could<00:03:45.140> find<00:03:45.260> on<00:03:45.440> there<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.890> it's<00:03:46.040> actually

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
could find on there and it's actually

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.979 
could find on there and it's actually
not<00:03:46.489> a<00:03:46.550> perfect<00:03:46.910> match<00:03:47.209> like<00:03:47.510> if<00:03:47.630> you<00:03:47.720> hold<00:03:47.900> up

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
not a perfect match like if you hold up

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.170 
not a perfect match like if you hold up
my<00:03:48.110> end<00:03:48.140> to<00:03:48.680> my<00:03:48.830> roots<00:03:49.100> it<00:03:49.520> doesn't<00:03:49.910> match<00:03:50.000> what

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
my end to my roots it doesn't match what

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.150 
my end to my roots it doesn't match what
perfectly<00:03:50.630> but<00:03:50.810> when<00:03:51.020> it's<00:03:51.170> blended<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:51.920> like

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
perfectly but when it's blended and like

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.820 
perfectly but when it's blended and like
in<00:03:52.400> your<00:03:53.000> hair<00:03:53.360> it's<00:03:53.750> not<00:03:54.050> bad<00:03:54.290> at<00:03:54.470> all<00:03:54.560> so<00:03:54.770> if

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
in your hair it's not bad at all so if

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.470 
in your hair it's not bad at all so if
your<00:03:54.980> colors<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.280> little<00:03:55.610> bit<00:03:55.850> off<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.300> can

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
your colors a little bit off it can

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.080 
your colors a little bit off it can
usually<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:57.650> can<00:03:57.800> make<00:03:57.950> it<00:03:58.070> work<00:03:58.220> somehow<00:03:58.489> but

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
usually you can make it work somehow but

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.160 
usually you can make it work somehow but
since<00:03:59.300> these<00:03:59.450> are<00:03:59.510> one<00:03:59.900> hundred<00:03:59.989> percent

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
since these are one hundred percent

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.720 
since these are one hundred percent
human<00:04:00.620> hair<00:04:00.830> you<00:04:00.980> could<00:04:01.130> go<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.489> get<00:04:01.580> them

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
human hair you could go and get them

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.670 
human hair you could go and get them

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
basically I really like them this is my

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.879 
basically I really like them this is my
second<00:04:26.600> pair<00:04:26.780> of<00:04:26.870> clip<00:04:27.080> in<00:04:27.199> extensions<00:04:27.560> the

second pair of clip in extensions the

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.230 
second pair of clip in extensions the
first<00:04:28.100> one<00:04:28.310> I<00:04:28.520> didn't<00:04:28.820> like<00:04:28.910> that<00:04:29.090> much

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
first one I didn't like that much

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.240 
first one I didn't like that much
because<00:04:29.510> I<00:04:30.020> felt<00:04:30.470> like<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.740> wasn't<00:04:30.979> enough

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
because I felt like it wasn't enough

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.670 
because I felt like it wasn't enough
hair<00:04:31.550> like<00:04:31.850> you<00:04:32.000> could<00:04:32.150> just<00:04:32.270> really<00:04:33.199> really

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
hair like you could just really really

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.409 
hair like you could just really really
obvious<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:34.430> see<00:04:34.580> where<00:04:34.790> my<00:04:34.910> hair<00:04:35.150> stopped

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
obvious and see where my hair stopped

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.300 
obvious and see where my hair stopped
and<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.900> other<00:04:36.080> hair<00:04:36.350> started<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:36.979> you're

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
and the other hair started and you're

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.740 
and the other hair started and you're
always<00:04:37.550> going<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.030> see<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.330> little<00:04:38.690> bit

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
always going to see that a little bit

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.360 
always going to see that a little bit
it's<00:04:38.990> better<00:04:39.289> when<00:04:39.530> it's<00:04:39.680> curled<00:04:40.100> but<00:04:40.340> I

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
it's better when it's curled but I

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.560 
it's better when it's curled but I
didn't<00:04:40.639> feel<00:04:40.699> like<00:04:40.760> curling<00:04:41.000> my<00:04:41.240> hair<00:04:41.270> today

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
didn't feel like curling my hair today

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.060 
didn't feel like curling my hair today
but<00:04:41.900> I<00:04:41.960> feel<00:04:42.139> like<00:04:42.169> these<00:04:42.440> ones<00:04:42.650> come<00:04:42.919> with

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
but I feel like these ones come with

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.370 
but I feel like these ones come with
more<00:04:43.370> hair<00:04:43.669> and<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:44.510> it<00:04:44.690> blends<00:04:44.930> a<00:04:45.080> little<00:04:45.289> bit

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
more hair and so it blends a little bit

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.409 
more hair and so it blends a little bit
better<00:04:45.500> it<00:04:45.830> also<00:04:46.160> looks<00:04:46.520> really<00:04:46.910> good<00:04:47.030> if<00:04:47.270> you

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
better it also looks really good if you

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.060 
better it also looks really good if you
do<00:04:47.690> it<00:04:47.840> in<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.080> braid<00:04:48.380> if<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:48.680> pull<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:48.949> to<00:04:49.039> the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070
