00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.750
 yes very well already with 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.690
 and we disconnected a little but already 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.400
 we want to return to play that in the end 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.490
 It is our job from what we live 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.849
 and what we like is the weekend and 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.329
 the parties and we already want to 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:31.920
 back I do not think it's the same for 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.970
 all and not to affect I think the team 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.300
 have to continue with the same mentality 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.270
 with the same desire with the same 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.630
 work that he is doing and hopefully and 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.650
 we can continue to maintain and improve the 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.800
 level that we are having 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.820
 yes but it is clear that the team does not 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.130
 believe and we always try to play for 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.500
 I win and lately I was giving 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.490
 very well now it is the hardest thing that 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.480
 is to hold the fourth position or both 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.930
 ports of europe 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.390
 and hopefully hopefully and prove that the 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.690
 team is trained and we are going to 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.340
 try in every possible way 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.320
 I believe that 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.109
 all those who are close and have 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.799
 possibilities are going to try I think that 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:24.069
 there is no specific rival that we have 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.069
 what to have 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.660
 more scared I think any of those who 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.970
 are up is for something and that in 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.940
 any time you can grab a 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.840
 positive streak and escape others 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.640
 I think we have to worry more about 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.820
 us that for the other teams yes yes 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.280
 controller that I know very well and I know 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.450
 that will make me very difficult because it is 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.090
 a 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.329
 great coach and he has the team 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.310
 in a very good way and they come 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.590
 making good good matches 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.990
 results and they are with another 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.860
 confidence that when the league started 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.319
 The motivation of the team is a 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.500
 coach who lives the game of 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:11.680
 workouts in a very intense way 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.720
 and that transmits to the players gives you 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.799
 confidence but at the same time demands you the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.360
 maximum in each moment and that makes 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.030
 raise your level and that the team becomes 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.790
 more competitive and do not like losing one 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.970
 it's time to worry there are more things 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.400
 important how to fight for the champions 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.090
 for Europe to be thinking about those that 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.599
 are going to be or are not going to be I think what 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.819
 first the real first thing is the group and 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:44.500
 that the season ends well and since 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.000
 be finished and let's see what we could 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.000
 get let's see 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.090
 what follows next season I 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:59.680
 I'm not just outside of the item 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:03.219
 I think about training to work in following 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.099
 playing well and the rest and the 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:08.370
 managers the representative the people who 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.349
 takes care of that are the ones that have to 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.220
 move the subject and no no I devote myself to 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:19.620
 play and for now I just do it's always 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.620
 I said that a great team 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.190
 that gave me the possibility to come to 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.010
 Europe that I have a great affection 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.740
 but right now I 'm not there 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:35.030
 when I was there I did not have the opportunities 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:37.230
 that he thought he could have and he's already 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.590
 I do not think anymore 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.170
 in that I 'm focused on the real in 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.860
 my job and it's just no they have not spoken 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.650
 I tell you how I told you before I'm more or 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.900
 we are all focused on these ten 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.480
 matches that can give us play europe 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.000
 and when the league is over there will be time 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.959
 for to talk about my future and 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.739
 obviously it is not something comfortable to not know 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.860
 if you can and can not go back you can be 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.540
 here on the other hand I think what 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.230
 always talked about this ability to 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.299
 be able to be a quiet place without 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.670
 worry about other things clear 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.880
 help but already 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.670
 it's a subject that had to be given like that 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.740
 what the signal asked for but we are 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.560
 looking for everyone and it was the best option in 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.730
 its time now we will have to work 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.680
 another formula so that you can finish 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.350
 that topic and to be calmer 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.930
 all I want or I'm very happy 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.000
 here and yes no 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.560
 let's see another weird then I 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.560
 would like to stay to go the next
