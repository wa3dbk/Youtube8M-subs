00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
winter or day or night I think it's just

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.960

one<00:03:37.770> of<00:03:37.860> these<00:03:37.950> ones<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.370> can<00:03:38.520> wear<00:03:38.700> whenever

one of these ones you can wear whenever
you<00:03:39.209> like<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.750> but<00:03:40.709> personally<00:03:42.020> you<00:03:43.020> know<00:03:43.110> I

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
you like and but personally you know I

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.710 
you like and but personally you know I
think<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:44.070> would<00:03:44.190> be<00:03:44.340> great<00:03:44.550> to<00:03:44.580> wear<00:03:44.850> around

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
think it would be great to wear around

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.360 
think it would be great to wear around
springtime<00:03:46.110> because<00:03:46.530> it's<00:03:46.830> quite<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.070> fresh

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
springtime because it's quite a fresh

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.660 
springtime because it's quite a fresh
scent<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.620> but<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.650> also<00:03:49.920> think<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.430> could<00:03:50.580> be

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
scent and but I also think it could be

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.370 
scent and but I also think it could be
someone's<00:03:51.030> signature<00:03:51.239> scent<00:03:51.540> as<00:03:51.870> well<00:03:51.900> it

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
someone's signature scent as well it

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.630 
someone's signature scent as well it
does<00:03:52.620> remind<00:03:52.860> me<00:03:52.980> of<00:03:53.070> quite<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.310> lot<00:03:53.520> of

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
does remind me of quite a lot of

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.120 
does remind me of quite a lot of
signature<00:03:54.060> scents<00:03:54.330> I've<00:03:54.540> got<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.650> really

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
signature scents I've got and I really

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.670 
signature scents I've got and I really
think<00:03:56.700> that's<00:03:57.050> that<00:03:58.050> would<00:03:58.230> be<00:03:58.410> great<00:03:58.650> for

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
think that's that would be great for

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.520 
think that's that would be great for
someone<00:03:59.130> when<00:03:59.880> I'm<00:04:00.030> saying<00:04:00.300> about<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.870> being<00:04:01.170> a

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
someone when I'm saying about it being a

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.600 
someone when I'm saying about it being a
someone's<00:04:02.450> son<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.720> say<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.680> because<00:04:04.830> it

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
someone's son I say that because it

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.150 
someone's son I say that because it
really<00:04:05.670> reminds<00:04:06.330> me<00:04:06.450> of<00:04:06.570> my<00:04:07.020> mom's<00:04:07.290> she's<00:04:08.010> got

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
really reminds me of my mom's she's got

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.800 
really reminds me of my mom's she's got
like<00:04:08.280> three<00:04:08.640> main<00:04:08.790> scent<00:04:09.150> she<00:04:09.360> always<00:04:09.450> wears

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
like three main scent she always wears

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.750 
like three main scent she always wears
but<00:04:10.410> this<00:04:10.620> really<00:04:10.890> reminded<00:04:11.370> me<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.519> one<00:04:11.730> of

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
but this really reminded me of one of

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.180 
but this really reminded me of one of
hers<00:04:12.060> so<00:04:12.690> that's<00:04:13.320> why<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.560> think<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.920> could<00:04:14.070> be

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
hers so that's why I think it could be

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.650 
hers so that's why I think it could be
someone's<00:04:14.519> signature<00:04:14.730> scent<00:04:15.060> because<00:04:15.450> it

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
someone's signature scent because it

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.900 
someone's signature scent because it
reminds<00:04:16.200> me<00:04:16.260> of<00:04:16.380> my<00:04:16.980> mom's<00:04:17.160> signature<00:04:17.400> scent

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
reminds me of my mom's signature scent

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.970 
reminds me of my mom's signature scent
and<00:04:18.269> that's<00:04:18.480> another<00:04:18.780> good<00:04:18.989> reason<00:04:19.230> as<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.709> why

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
and that's another good reason as to why

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.320 
and that's another good reason as to why
it<00:04:20.340> could<00:04:20.459> be<00:04:20.519> someone's<00:04:20.850> signature<00:04:21.030> scent

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
it could be someone's signature scent

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.650 
it could be someone's signature scent
because<00:04:22.080> it<00:04:22.919> can<00:04:23.280> take<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.640> from<00:04:23.880> being<00:04:24.210> a

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
because it can take you from being a

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.080 
because it can take you from being a
young<00:04:25.050> age<00:04:25.289> to<00:04:25.320> an<00:04:25.710> older<00:04:25.979> age<00:04:26.070> because<00:04:26.880> it's

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
young age to an older age because it's

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.500 
young age to an older age because it's
just

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510
