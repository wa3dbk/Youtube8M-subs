00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
at the bottom and the gadgets I I forget

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.200 
at the bottom and the gadgets I I forget
what<00:00:58.830> I<00:00:58.890> use<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.490> but<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.730> think<00:00:59.790> I<00:01:00.060> might

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
what I use for that but I think I might

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.280 
what I use for that but I think I might
have<00:01:00.240> had<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> use<00:01:00.600> something<00:01:00.840> else<00:01:01.020> as<00:01:01.260> well

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
have had to use something else as well

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.179 
have had to use something else as well
as<00:01:01.590> vista<00:01:01.950> glass<00:01:03.439> but<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> effect<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.949> is

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
as vista glass but the effect is is

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.280 
as vista glass but the effect is is
really<00:01:05.580> neat<00:01:05.790> nifty<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.810> really<00:01:07.140> do

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
really neat nifty in that you really do

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.340 
really neat nifty in that you really do
have<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.530> completely<00:01:08.189> transparent<00:01:08.670> look<00:01:09.350> and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
have a completely transparent look and

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.080

had to tweak it's a one way or another
to<00:01:24.329> make<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.659> work<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:24.869> windows<00:01:25.469> 7<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.299> here

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
to make it work for windows 7 and here

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.719

let me show you that and that gives you

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.730 
let me show you that and that gives you
a<00:01:29.759> moving<00:01:30.359> background<00:01:30.569> so<00:01:31.289> you<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.560> actually

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
a moving background so you can actually

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.800 
a moving background so you can actually
use<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> video<00:01:32.609> as<00:01:32.819> the<00:01:32.969> back<00:01:33.179> as<00:01:33.450> your<00:01:33.630> desktop

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
use a video as the back as your desktop

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.520 
use a video as the back as your desktop
background<00:01:34.649> and<00:01:35.389> here<00:01:36.389> I'm<00:01:36.509> same<00:01:36.810> set<00:01:37.109> as<00:01:37.139> this

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
background and here I'm same set as this

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.859 
background and here I'm same set as this
movie<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> desktop<00:01:38.520> background<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.689> one

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
movie is the desktop background this one

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.679 
movie is the desktop background this one
is<00:01:39.990> called<00:01:40.200> Willow<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.389> sky<00:01:42.630> is

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
is called Willow and so the sky is

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.300 
is called Willow and so the sky is
moving<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> background<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.189> this

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
moving in the background of this

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.270 
moving in the background of this
particular<00:01:45.030> image<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.929> again<00:01:46.679> it<00:01:46.859> doesn't

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
particular image and again it doesn't

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.669 
particular image and again it doesn't
look<00:01:47.579> doesn't<00:01:48.030> reproduce<00:01:48.539> very<00:01:49.289> well<00:01:49.499> in<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
look doesn't reproduce very well in the

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.919 
look doesn't reproduce very well in the
video<00:01:49.950> as<00:01:50.159> far<00:01:50.429> as<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.639> can<00:01:50.700> tell<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.719> really

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
video as far as I can tell but it really

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:53.809 
video as far as I can tell but it really
looks<00:01:52.229> pretty<00:01:52.679> impressive<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.249> person<00:01:53.280> it

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
looks pretty impressive in person it

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.789 
looks pretty impressive in person it
makes<00:01:53.999> the<00:01:54.299> videos<00:01:54.959> that<00:01:54.990> I'm<00:01:55.229> playing<00:01:55.469> here

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
makes the videos that I'm playing here

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.440 
makes the videos that I'm playing here
look<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.429> they're<00:01:56.639> just<00:01:56.850> sort<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.119> floating

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
look like they're just sort of floating

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.270 
look like they're just sort of floating
in<00:01:57.719> mid-air<00:01:58.340> and<00:02:00.319> and<00:02:01.319> then<00:02:01.499> lastly<00:02:01.859> I've<00:02:02.069> got

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
in mid-air and and then lastly I've got

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.980 
in mid-air and and then lastly I've got
a<00:02:02.310> program<00:02:02.789> called<00:02:02.999> win<00:02:03.329> roll<00:02:03.569> which<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:03.959> a

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
a program called win roll which is a

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.929

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
center of mouse button so if you can

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:20.860 
center of mouse button so if you can
just

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
just

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.750

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
it's kind of transparent too so it ends

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.460 
it's kind of transparent too so it ends
up<00:02:25.700> getting<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.269> really<00:02:26.540> neat<00:02:26.750> flow<00:02:27.019> between

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
up getting a really neat flow between

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.259 
up getting a really neat flow between
all<00:02:27.799> these<00:02:28.340> programs<00:02:28.819> that<00:02:29.000> got<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.120> really

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
all these programs that got a really

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.619 
all these programs that got a really
neat<00:02:29.540> floating<00:02:30.019> effect<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:32.090> actually

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
neat floating effect and and I actually

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.600 
neat floating effect and and I actually
find<00:02:33.019> it<00:02:33.200> easier<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.560> work<00:02:33.860> like<00:02:34.069> this<00:02:34.250> then

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
find it easier to work like this then

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.729 
find it easier to work like this then
then<00:02:35.209> blowing<00:02:35.510> everything<00:02:35.840> up<00:02:36.110> full<00:02:36.349> screen

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
then blowing everything up full screen

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.000 
then blowing everything up full screen
and<00:02:37.010> having<00:02:37.310> black<00:02:37.519> borders
