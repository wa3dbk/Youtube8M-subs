finish so if you want to go high gloss

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.189 
finish so if you want to go high gloss
it<00:03:46.090> would<00:03:46.180> even<00:03:46.419> be<00:03:46.620> shinier<00:03:47.620> than<00:03:47.799> this<00:03:49.199> but

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
it would even be shinier than this but

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.740 
it would even be shinier than this but
I'm<00:03:50.349> going<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.560> be<00:03:50.650> hitting<00:03:50.889> this<00:03:51.069> with<00:03:51.340> the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
I'm going to be hitting this with the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.050 
I'm going to be hitting this with the
some<00:03:52.750> neon<00:03:53.409> green<00:03:54.389> for<00:03:55.389> pattern<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:56.940> when<00:03:57.940> it's

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
some neon green for pattern so when it's

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.789 
some neon green for pattern so when it's
all<00:03:58.209> done<00:03:58.479> I<00:03:58.510> might<00:03:58.750> actually<00:03:59.139> put<00:03:59.680> an

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
all done I might actually put an

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.000 
all done I might actually put an
enameled<00:04:00.280> clear<00:04:00.459> coat<00:04:00.699> on<00:04:00.879> it<00:04:01.030> is<00:04:01.229> the<00:04:02.229> plan

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
enameled clear coat on it is the plan

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.420 
enameled clear coat on it is the plan
so<00:04:03.870> yeah<00:04:04.870> it's<00:04:05.139> got<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.319> got<00:04:05.919> to<00:04:06.040> get<00:04:06.129> something

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
so yeah it's got a got to get something

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.069 
so yeah it's got a got to get something
like<00:04:06.519> that<00:04:06.549> going<00:04:06.940> on<00:04:07.120> but<00:04:07.299> it's<00:04:07.419> already<00:04:07.750> much

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
like that going on but it's already much

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.990 
like that going on but it's already much
better<00:04:08.349> than<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.769> gold<00:04:09.129> helmet<00:04:09.549> that<00:04:09.669> it<00:04:09.790> was

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
better than the gold helmet that it was

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.680 
better than the gold helmet that it was
I<00:04:10.329> think<00:04:11.139> you'd<00:04:11.319> agree<00:04:12.479> okay

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
I think you'd agree okay

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.059 
I think you'd agree okay
so<00:04:13.810> I<00:04:13.840> haven't<00:04:14.049> been<00:04:14.199> keeping<00:04:14.379> up<00:04:14.590> as<00:04:14.769> well<00:04:14.949> as

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
so I haven't been keeping up as well as

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.879 
so I haven't been keeping up as well as
I'd<00:04:15.159> hoped<00:04:15.190> but<00:04:15.669> I'm<00:04:16.299> using<00:04:16.599> engine<00:04:17.320> enamel

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
I'd hoped but I'm using engine enamel

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.330 
I'd hoped but I'm using engine enamel
it's<00:04:18.130> called<00:04:18.609> grabber<00:04:18.969> green

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
it's called grabber green

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.310 
it's called grabber green
this<00:04:21.970> is<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.240> first<00:04:22.510> coat<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:24.750> so<00:04:25.750> basically

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
this is the first coat and so basically

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.870 
this is the first coat and so basically
I<00:04:26.410> wanted<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.770> follow<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.130> contours<00:04:27.639> of<00:04:27.699> the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
I wanted to follow the contours of the

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.260 
I wanted to follow the contours of the
helmet<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:29.310> yes<00:04:30.310> it's<00:04:30.550> really<00:04:30.729> as<00:04:30.910> bright<00:04:31.150> as

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
helmet and yes it's really as bright as

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:40.680 
helmet and yes it's really as bright as
the<00:04:31.389> bike<00:04:37.979> and<00:04:38.979> for<00:04:39.910> freehand

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
the bike and for freehand

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.939 
the bike and for freehand
I<00:04:40.780> think<00:04:41.110> that's<00:04:41.229> pretty<00:04:41.440> great<00:04:43.770> pretty<00:04:44.770> much

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
I think that's pretty great pretty much

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.570 
I think that's pretty great pretty much
identical<00:04:45.460> on<00:04:45.669> both<00:04:45.699> sides<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:47.070> then<00:04:48.070> I<00:04:48.370> did<00:04:48.550> a

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
identical on both sides and then I did a

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.570 
identical on both sides and then I did a
freehand<00:04:49.030> stencil<00:04:49.690> on<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.580> back<00:04:51.580> as<00:04:51.790> well<00:04:52.000> so

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
freehand stencil on the back as well so

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.750 
freehand stencil on the back as well so
then<00:04:54.580> we'll<00:04:54.729> hit<00:04:54.850> it<00:04:54.970> with<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.889> engine<00:04:58.710> enamel

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
then we'll hit it with a engine enamel

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.940 
then we'll hit it with a engine enamel

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
didn't look like it matched from when I

was inside in the kitchen I guess it's

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.529

here<00:05:52.030> just<00:05:52.750> that's<00:05:53.440> more<00:05:53.650> than<00:05:53.830> enough<00:05:53.880> more

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
here just that's more than enough more

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.980 
here just that's more than enough more
than<00:05:55.000> that<00:05:55.150> it<00:05:55.270> was<00:05:55.389> going<00:05:55.510> to<00:05:55.539> look<00:05:55.660> really

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
than that it was going to look really

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.800 
than that it was going to look really
weird<00:05:56.289> but<00:05:56.650> at<00:05:57.099> night<00:05:57.610> this<00:05:57.940> piece<00:05:58.210> just<00:05:58.240> glows

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.930 
weird but at night this piece just glows
and<00:05:59.229> it<00:05:59.380> goes<00:05:59.560> really<00:05:59.950> bright<00:06:00.570> but<00:06:01.979> yeah<00:06:02.979> so<00:06:03.910> I

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940

thought it turned out really good
definitely<00:06:07.360> if<00:06:07.450> you<00:06:07.539> look<00:06:07.780> from<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.229> start<00:06:08.530> to

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
definitely if you look from the start to

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.620 
definitely if you look from the start to
finish

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630
