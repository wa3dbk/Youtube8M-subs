00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.220 
because he's very skinny very
self-conscious<00:03:37.550> about<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:38.030> way<00:03:38.150> he<00:03:38.390> looks<00:03:38.660> it

really<00:03:39.290> kind<00:03:39.890> of<00:03:39.920> reminds<00:03:40.280> me<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.430> little<00:03:40.640> bit

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
really kind of reminds me a little bit

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.430 
really kind of reminds me a little bit
about<00:03:41.000> myself<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:41.570> I<00:03:41.630> used<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:41.930> be<00:03:42.050> in<00:03:42.230> middle

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
about myself and I used to be in middle

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.810 
about myself and I used to be in middle
school<00:03:42.709> in<00:03:42.830> high<00:03:42.980> school<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.310> actually<00:03:43.489> was

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
school in high school I actually was

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.670 
school in high school I actually was
kind<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.090> like<00:03:44.239> that<00:03:44.420> a<00:03:44.480> little<00:03:44.780> bit<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:45.650> I

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
kind of like that a little bit and so I

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.530 
kind of like that a little bit and so I
can<00:03:45.950> actually<00:03:45.980> relate<00:03:46.459> to<00:03:46.640> sitting<00:03:47.090> Goku<00:03:47.360> as<00:03:47.510> a

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
can actually relate to sitting Goku as a

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.750 
can actually relate to sitting Goku as a
character<00:03:48.019> and<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.560> really<00:03:48.769> just<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.459> makes

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
character and it really just it makes

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.160 
character and it really just it makes
his<00:03:49.880> character<00:03:50.180> a<00:03:50.209> lot<00:03:50.300> more<00:03:50.510> likeable<00:03:50.930> in<00:03:50.989> my

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
his character a lot more likeable in my

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.530 
his character a lot more likeable in my
eyes<00:03:51.320> it<00:03:51.530> really<00:03:51.560> does<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.910> big<00:03:53.090> thing<00:03:53.330> though

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
eyes it really does the big thing though

chapters<00:04:49.580> this<00:04:49.729> month<00:04:49.970> like<00:04:50.180> chapter<00:04:50.600> you

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
chapters this month like chapter you

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.990 
chapters this month like chapter you
know<00:04:50.720> 39<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:51.680> 40<00:04:51.889> I<00:04:51.950> mean<00:04:52.070> even<00:04:52.250> though<00:04:52.340> 39<00:04:52.760> is

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
know 39 and 40 I mean even though 39 is

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.670 
know 39 and 40 I mean even though 39 is
technically<00:04:53.389> short<00:04:53.750> okay<00:04:54.050> let's<00:04:54.229> be<00:04:54.350> honest

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
technically short okay let's be honest

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.129 
technically short okay let's be honest
here<00:04:54.830> it's<00:04:55.370> still<00:04:55.760> it's<00:04:56.570> a<00:04:56.690> lot<00:04:56.840> more<00:04:57.080> work

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
here it's still it's a lot more work

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.680 
here it's still it's a lot more work
then<00:04:57.860> you<00:04:58.070> know<00:04:58.100> I<00:04:58.639> guess<00:04:58.940> an<00:04:59.090> average<00:04:59.389> weekly

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
then you know I guess an average weekly

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.360 
then you know I guess an average weekly
sterilisation<00:05:00.500> you<00:05:00.680> know<00:05:00.770> if<00:05:00.950> you're<00:05:01.100> to<00:05:01.250> do<00:05:01.340> a

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
sterilisation you know if you're to do a

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.129 
sterilisation you know if you're to do a
long<00:05:01.580> ago<00:05:01.760> like<00:05:01.910> every<00:05:02.150> week<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.810> so<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.020> got

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
long ago like every week and so you got

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.390 
long ago like every week and so you got
to<00:05:03.229> think<00:05:03.260> about<00:05:03.530> this<00:05:03.650> that<00:05:03.830> was<00:05:03.919> like<00:05:04.040> 32

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
to think about this that was like 32

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.640 
to think about this that was like 32
like<00:05:04.790> almost<00:05:05.150> 40<00:05:05.479> pages<00:05:05.900> worth<00:05:06.050> of<00:05:06.229> content

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
like almost 40 pages worth of content

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.830 
like almost 40 pages worth of content
right<00:05:06.889> there<00:05:07.130> about<00:05:07.520> 31<00:05:08.060> pages<00:05:08.300> actually<00:05:08.750> I

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
right there about 31 pages actually I

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.750 
right there about 31 pages actually I
think<00:05:08.900> about<00:05:09.139> 31<00:05:09.530> pages<00:05:09.770> of<00:05:10.039> content<00:05:10.580> and

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
think about 31 pages of content and

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.640 
think about 31 pages of content and
that's<00:05:11.150> close<00:05:11.479> to<00:05:11.630> a<00:05:11.690> lovely<00:05:11.870> manga<00:05:12.440> but<00:05:12.560> I

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
that's close to a lovely manga but I

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.920 
that's close to a lovely manga but I
mean<00:05:12.889> the<00:05:13.310> big<00:05:13.460> thing<00:05:13.669> is<00:05:13.820> is<00:05:14.030> why<00:05:14.389> is<00:05:14.450> the

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
mean the big thing is is why is the

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.290 
mean the big thing is is why is the
manga<00:05:15.260> cut<00:05:15.440> choosing<00:05:15.950> to<00:05:16.039> do<00:05:16.190> two<00:05:16.400> chapters<00:05:17.000> I

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
manga cut choosing to do two chapters I

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.120 
manga cut choosing to do two chapters I
mean<00:05:17.840> I'm<00:05:18.470> guessing<00:05:18.710> there<00:05:19.010> might<00:05:19.100> be

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
mean I'm guessing there might be

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.260 
mean I'm guessing there might be
something<00:05:19.520> in<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.669> works<00:05:19.880> that<00:05:19.970> we<00:05:20.120> don't

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
something in the works that we don't

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.450 
something in the works that we don't
know<00:05:20.360> about<00:05:20.479> like<00:05:20.690> a<00:05:20.720> possible<00:05:21.200> anime<00:05:21.650> I<00:05:21.860> know

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
know about like a possible anime I know

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.340 
know about like a possible anime I know
there's<00:05:22.700> an<00:05:22.760> OVA<00:05:22.970> series<00:05:23.060> of<00:05:23.479> this<00:05:23.720> Moldova

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
there's an OVA series of this Moldova

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.320 
there's an OVA series of this Moldova
Horomia<00:05:24.770> but<00:05:25.370> I've<00:05:25.669> never<00:05:25.789> watched<00:05:26.120> it

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
Horomia but I've never watched it

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.730 
Horomia but I've never watched it
because<00:05:26.419> I<00:05:26.660> just<00:05:27.050> never<00:05:27.169> got<00:05:27.350> around<00:05:27.410> to

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
because I just never got around to

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.350 
because I just never got around to
watching<00:05:27.830> it<00:05:28.220> and<00:05:28.340> I<00:05:28.430> know<00:05:28.520> for<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:28.910> fact<00:05:29.090> it's

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
watching it and I know for a fact it's

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.080 
watching it and I know for a fact it's
the<00:05:29.720> smallest<00:05:30.050> series<00:05:30.500> not<00:05:30.740> concluded<00:05:31.310> so<00:05:31.550> the

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
the smallest series not concluded so the

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.700 
the smallest series not concluded so the
LOV<00:05:32.600> a<00:05:32.630> is<00:05:32.720> most<00:05:32.990> likely<00:05:33.169> not<00:05:33.410> going<00:05:33.470> to

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
LOV a is most likely not going to

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.130 
LOV a is most likely not going to
satisfy<00:05:33.889> me<00:05:34.370> at<00:05:34.460> all

progression with the plot really there

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.080

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
wasn't much progression at all let's

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.390 
wasn't much progression at all let's
just<00:06:31.240> be<00:06:31.330> honest<00:06:31.660> here<00:06:31.840> and<00:06:32.170> then<00:06:32.530> characters

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
just be honest here and then characters

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.800 
just be honest here and then characters
like<00:06:33.640> personalities<00:06:34.150> and<00:06:34.270> development<00:06:34.660> being

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
like personalities and development being

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.900

fleshed<00:06:35.110> out<00:06:35.260> for<00:06:35.470> Sengoku<00:06:36.040> I<00:06:36.280> guess<00:06:36.610> I<00:06:36.790> would

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
fleshed out for Sengoku I guess I would

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.120 
fleshed out for Sengoku I guess I would
give<00:06:37.090> it<00:06:37.210> like<00:06:37.330> another<00:06:37.570> seven<00:06:38.080> so<00:06:38.620> for<00:06:39.070> the

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
give it like another seven so for the

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.200 
give it like another seven so for the
most<00:06:39.280> part<00:06:39.490> if<00:06:39.550> I<00:06:39.640> have<00:06:39.790> to<00:06:39.850> break<00:06:40.000> both

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
most part if I have to break both

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.030 
most part if I have to break both
chapters<00:06:40.660> together<00:06:40.840> chapter<00:06:41.470> I<00:06:41.650> guess<00:06:41.920> you

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040 
chapters together chapter I guess you

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.760 
chapters together chapter I guess you
know<00:06:42.160> 39<00:06:42.670> and<00:06:42.880> 40<00:06:43.180> for<00:06:43.810> my<00:06:43.930> enjoyment<00:06:44.080> value

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.960 
know 39 and 40 for my enjoyment value

a<00:06:49.210> nine<00:06:49.240> out<00:06:49.660> of<00:06:49.690> ten<00:06:49.930> honestly<00:06:50.590> it<00:06:50.710> was<00:06:51.100> a<00:06:51.130> very
