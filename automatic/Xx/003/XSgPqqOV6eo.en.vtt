ten<00:00:24.430> years<00:00:24.700> ago<00:00:24.760> John<00:00:25.480> was<00:00:25.660> in<00:00:25.750> Austria<00:00:26.200> for<00:00:26.500> a

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
ten years ago John was in Austria for a

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.970 
ten years ago John was in Austria for a
peace<00:00:26.740> conference<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:27.610> he<00:00:28.560> became<00:00:29.560> very<00:00:29.770> ill

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
peace conference and he became very ill

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.500 
peace conference and he became very ill
and<00:00:30.310> this<00:00:32.160> resulted<00:00:33.160> in<00:00:33.340> three<00:00:33.790> major

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
and this resulted in three major

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.820 
and this resulted in three major
abdominal<00:00:35.190> operations<00:00:36.190> and<00:00:37.680> period<00:00:38.680> in

intensive<00:00:39.519> care<00:00:39.790> with<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.449> ventilator<00:00:41.019> I<00:00:41.320> think

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
intensive care with a ventilator I think

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.890 
intensive care with a ventilator I think
at<00:00:42.160> that<00:00:42.190> stage<00:00:42.370> he<00:00:43.090> suffered<00:00:43.510> some<00:00:43.720> brain

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
at that stage he suffered some brain

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.979 
at that stage he suffered some brain
damage<00:00:43.960> and<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:47.260> he<00:00:47.890> has<00:00:48.160> memory<00:00:49.059> quite<00:00:49.660> severe

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
damage and so he has memory quite severe

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.079 
damage and so he has memory quite severe
memory<00:00:50.470> problems

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
these weren't manifested too quickly but

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.290 
these weren't manifested too quickly but
increasingly<00:00:59.170> since<00:00:59.559> he<00:00:59.739> retired<00:01:00.100> his<00:01:00.850> memory

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
increasingly since he retired his memory

very<00:01:37.479> much<00:01:37.690> involved<00:01:37.990> in<00:01:38.289> events<00:01:38.860> in<00:01:39.039> the<00:01:39.190> time

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
very much involved in events in the time

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:45.990 
very much involved in events in the time
and<00:01:41.190> just<00:01:42.190> a<00:01:42.250> bit<00:01:42.399> of<00:01:42.520> walking<00:01:42.729> so<00:01:45.000> so

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
and just a bit of walking so so

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.460 
and just a bit of walking so so
hopefully<00:01:46.539> that<00:01:46.780> will<00:01:46.929> continue

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
hopefully that will continue

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.889 
hopefully that will continue
I<00:01:50.310> used<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.399> reflect<00:01:51.580> about<00:01:51.819> why<00:01:52.509> it<00:01:52.569> took<00:01:52.840> so

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
I used to reflect about why it took so

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.880 
I used to reflect about why it took so
long<00:01:53.080> to<00:01:53.709> get<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.580> where<00:01:54.849> we<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.119> I<00:01:55.179> are<00:01:55.420> and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
long to get to where we and I are and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.050 
long to get to where we and I are and
one<00:01:56.890> of<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.099> reasons<00:01:57.459> is<00:01:57.610> that<00:01:57.640> there<00:01:57.910> wasn't

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
one of the reasons is that there wasn't

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.660 
one of the reasons is that there wasn't
somebody<00:01:58.330> prepared<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:59.770> break<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.099> cycle<00:02:00.459> and

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
somebody prepared to break the cycle and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:10.669 
somebody prepared to break the cycle and
John<00:02:01.149> Hume<00:02:01.390> did<00:02:01.599> that

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.520 

I've<00:02:11.250> no<00:02:11.519> doubt<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.730> he'll<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:12.330> seen<00:02:12.599> as<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
I've no doubt that he'll be seen as the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.530 
I've no doubt that he'll be seen as the
catalyst<00:02:13.980> for<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.280> entire<00:02:14.700> peace<00:02:15.000> process
