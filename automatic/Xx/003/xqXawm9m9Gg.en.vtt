and those elements we see from looking
at<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> genomes<00:01:05.729> today<00:01:06.150> may<00:01:06.689> well<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> key

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
at the genomes today may well be a key

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.200 
at the genomes today may well be a key
part<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.950> being<00:01:08.250> able<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.700> become

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
multicellular to being able to grow

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.580 
multicellular to being able to grow
there<00:01:12.479> seems<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> way<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
there seems to be a way that the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.499 
there seems to be a way that the
chemistry<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.130> almost<00:01:14.400> informing<00:01:15.090> or<00:01:15.240> feeding

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
chemistry is almost informing or feeding

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.960 
chemistry is almost informing or feeding
back<00:01:15.930> onto<00:01:16.259> these<00:01:16.530> major<00:01:16.830> evolutionary<00:01:17.640> steps

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
back onto these major evolutionary steps

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.090 
back onto these major evolutionary steps
so<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.450> actually<00:01:18.780> almost<00:01:19.290> trace<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
so we can actually almost trace the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.859 
so we can actually almost trace the
chemical<00:01:20.490> evolution<00:01:20.729> by<00:01:21.150> peering<00:01:21.600> into<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
chemical evolution by peering into the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.080 
chemical evolution by peering into the
genomes<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.619> what<00:01:23.189> idea<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.520> had<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> try

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.240 
genomes and what idea I had was to try
and<00:01:24.270> look<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.659> genome<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.350> Rubisco

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
and look in the genome of Rubisco

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.850 
and look in the genome of Rubisco
to<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:27.869> times<00:01:28.530> we're

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860

changing carbon dioxide has actually
affected<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.049> working<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.829> enzyme

rubisco is at the heart of much of this

about<00:01:48.570> Rubisco<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.590> really<00:01:49.829> seems<00:01:50.070> to

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.809 
evolve unlike Rubisco and that it's
evolved<00:02:31.840> at<00:02:31.989> least<00:02:32.200> five<00:02:32.439> different<00:02:32.819> families

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.009 
with very little genetic similarity
across<00:02:35.920> evolution<00:02:36.849> and<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:37.329> a<00:02:37.450> fantastic

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
across evolution and so it's a fantastic

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.860

example<00:02:38.139> of<00:02:38.590> convergent<00:02:39.040> evolution

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
I think it would be great to try and

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.699 
I think it would be great to try and
find<00:02:45.390> out<00:02:45.599> how<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.840> constraints<00:02:46.560> of

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
looked at its eye it would be arranged

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.170
