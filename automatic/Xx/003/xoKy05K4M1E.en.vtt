through the bottom here okay guys and

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.640 
through the bottom here okay guys and
what<00:03:59.819> I've<00:03:59.909> found<00:04:00.150> here<00:04:00.390> is<00:04:00.569> it's<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.140> close<00:04:01.470> to

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
what I've found here is it's so close to

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.500 
what I've found here is it's so close to
coming<00:04:01.830> out<00:04:02.010> I've<00:04:02.250> got<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.730> almost<00:04:03.120> out<00:04:03.330> here

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
coming out I've got it almost out here

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.710 
coming out I've got it almost out here
but<00:04:03.689> the<00:04:03.870> oil<00:04:04.080> filters<00:04:04.620> anyway<00:04:05.129> so<00:04:05.189> if<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:06.510> may

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
but the oil filters anyway so if you may

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.500 
but the oil filters anyway so if you may
at<00:04:06.870> this<00:04:07.019> point<00:04:07.349> in<00:04:07.730> you<00:04:08.730> are<00:04:08.970> serious<00:04:09.450> about

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
at this point in you are serious about

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.960 
at this point in you are serious about
getting<00:04:09.720> this<00:04:09.840> thing<00:04:09.930> out<00:04:10.170> go<00:04:10.980> ahead<00:04:11.069> and<00:04:11.519> also

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
getting this thing out go ahead and also

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.580 
getting this thing out go ahead and also
remove<00:04:12.360> your<00:04:12.510> oil<00:04:12.750> filter<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.409> should

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
remove your oil filter you should

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.110 
remove your oil filter you should
actually<00:04:13.709> probably<00:04:14.010> do<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.430> prior<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.819> you

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
actually probably do that prior to you

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.110 
actually probably do that prior to you
but<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:15.569> am<00:04:16.500> NOT<00:04:16.739> as<00:04:17.190> serious<00:04:17.579> as<00:04:17.729> getting<00:04:17.970> it

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
but I am NOT as serious as getting it

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.689 
but I am NOT as serious as getting it
off<00:04:18.239> because<00:04:18.479> I<00:04:18.630> don't<00:04:19.190> necessarily<00:04:20.190> need<00:04:20.639> to

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
off because I don't necessarily need to

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:21.789 
off because I don't necessarily need to
change<00:04:21.060> my<00:04:21.239> butt

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
change my butt

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.010

you<00:04:22.129> can<00:04:22.310> see<00:04:22.490> there<00:04:22.669> if<00:04:22.849> the<00:04:23.060> old<00:04:23.240> filter<00:04:23.690> was

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
you can see there if the old filter was

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.649 
you can see there if the old filter was
off<00:04:24.259> then<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:25.190> alternator<00:04:25.849> would<00:04:26.060> slide

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:26.659 
off then the alternator would slide

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:28.749 
off then the alternator would slide
right<00:04:26.990> out<00:04:27.020> there<00:04:27.349> so<00:04:27.650> go<00:04:28.370> ahead<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.550> take

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
right out there so go ahead and take

right out there so go ahead and take
that<00:04:28.789> old<00:04:29.120> filter<00:04:29.360> off<00:04:29.599> and<00:04:30.310> pull<00:04:31.310> that

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
that old filter off and pull that

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.390 
that old filter off and pull that
alternator<00:04:32.030> out<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.389> put<00:04:32.629> your<00:04:32.780> new<00:04:33.530> or<00:04:33.860> new
