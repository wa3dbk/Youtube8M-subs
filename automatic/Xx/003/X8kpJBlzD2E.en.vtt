00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
going to use a trap with an animal like

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.680 
going to use a trap with an animal like
a<00:03:41.280> bear<00:03:41.489> something<00:03:41.850> with<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.000> really<00:03:42.209> large<00:03:42.359> den

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
a bear something with a really large den

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.150 
a bear something with a really large den
where<00:03:43.230> you're<00:03:43.590> not<00:03:43.739> always<00:03:43.890> going<00:03:44.070> to

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
where you're not always going to

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.860 
where you're not always going to
encounter<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.760> when<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:44.970> enter<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.329> den<00:03:45.480> so

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
encounter it when you enter the den so

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.229 
encounter it when you enter the den so
you<00:03:45.930> can<00:03:46.079> sort<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.320> sneak<00:03:46.500> in<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.769> put<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:46.980> down

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
you can sort of sneak in and put it down

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.759 
you can sort of sneak in and put it down
now<00:03:48.239> what<00:03:48.420> we<00:03:48.540> just<00:03:48.720> witnessed<00:03:48.870> was<00:03:49.260> animals

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
now what we just witnessed was animals

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.860 
now what we just witnessed was animals
actually<00:03:49.950> walking<00:03:50.370> into<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.790> trap<00:03:51.060> as<00:03:51.269> we

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
actually walking into the trap as we

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.470 
actually walking into the trap as we
were<00:03:52.049> there<00:03:52.320> right<00:03:52.799> but<00:03:53.609> if<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:53.940> leave<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.180> den

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
were there right but if you leave a den

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.949 
were there right but if you leave a den
for<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:55.170> while<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.859> then<00:03:56.430> come<00:03:56.760> back<00:03:56.959> the

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
for a while and then come back the

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.349 
for a while and then come back the
probability<00:03:58.530> of<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.709> corpse<00:03:59.070> spawning<00:03:59.579> at<00:04:00.090> the

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
probability of a corpse spawning at the

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.630 
probability of a corpse spawning at the
trap<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.780> determined<00:04:01.410> by<00:04:01.859> how<00:04:02.310> high<00:04:02.489> you're

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
trap is determined by how high you're

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.920 
trap is determined by how high you're
trapping<00:04:02.910> skill<00:04:03.269> is<00:04:03.420> so<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.630> don't<00:04:03.780> actually

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
trapping skill is so you don't actually

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.289 
trapping skill is so you don't actually
have<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.200> depend<00:04:04.500> on<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.280> AI<00:04:05.459> blindly

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
have to depend on the AI blindly

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.870 
have to depend on the AI blindly

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
stumbling into a trap that you've said

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.580 
stumbling into a trap that you've said
so<00:04:09.090> it's<00:04:09.329> it's<00:04:09.900> sort<00:04:10.079> of<00:04:10.170> like<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.319> food

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
so it's it's sort of like a food

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
generator if you're trapping skill is

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.630 
generator if you're trapping skill is
high<00:04:12.329> enough<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:13.920> can<00:04:14.069> always<00:04:14.160> count<00:04:14.430> on<00:04:14.579> a

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
the best idea with a broken bone oh okay

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.330 
the best idea with a broken bone oh okay
all<00:04:28.199> right<00:04:28.620> that<00:04:29.490> was<00:04:29.639> stupid<00:04:30.350> respond<00:04:31.350> okay

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
all right that was stupid respond okay

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.100 
all right that was stupid respond okay
