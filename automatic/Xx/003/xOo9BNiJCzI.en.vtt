00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.510 
think when people hear hear microsoft
they<00:01:52.349> kind<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.590> do<00:01:52.679> that<00:01:52.800> oh<00:01:52.920> they<00:01:53.220> sort<00:01:53.459> of

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
they kind of do that oh they sort of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.800 
they kind of do that oh they sort of
recoil<00:01:53.789> a<00:01:53.940> little<00:01:54.149> bit<00:01:54.239> but<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.599> would<00:01:54.690> have

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
recoil a little bit but it would have

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.169 
recoil a little bit but it would have
microsoft<00:01:55.319> and<00:01:55.530> phone<00:01:55.979> they<00:01:56.670> automatically

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
microsoft and phone they automatically

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.330 
microsoft and phone they automatically
think<00:01:57.300> it's<00:01:57.690> windows<00:01:58.080> mobile<00:01:58.289> right<00:01:58.979> i<00:01:59.009> grab<00:01:59.310> a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
think it's windows mobile right i grab a

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.680 
think it's windows mobile right i grab a
shovel<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.849> Bend<00:02:00.090> burrow<00:02:00.300> into<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:00.599> ground

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
shovel and Bend burrow into the ground

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.240 
shovel and Bend burrow into the ground
and<00:02:01.050> hide<00:02:01.200> there<00:02:01.410> and<00:02:01.560> then<00:02:01.649> they<00:02:01.739> start<00:02:01.979> upper

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
and hide there and then they start upper

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.219 
and hide there and then they start upper
40s<00:02:02.700> exactly<00:02:03.239> but<00:02:03.720> that's<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:03.929> the<00:02:04.020> case<00:02:04.050> here

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
40s exactly but that's not the case here

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.109 
40s exactly but that's not the case here
because<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.739> kims<00:02:04.920> interface<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.520> purely<00:02:06.000> a

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
because the kims interface is purely a

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.270 
because the kims interface is purely a
social<00:02:06.450> network<00:02:06.899> aggregator<00:02:07.410> and<00:02:07.920> it

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
social network aggregator and it

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.620 
social network aggregator and it
actually<00:02:08.429> does<00:02:08.759> i<00:02:08.970> think<00:02:09.000> better<00:02:09.300> than<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
actually does i think better than the

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.850 
actually does i think better than the
motoblur<00:02:09.959> which<00:02:10.229> we<00:02:10.380> had<00:02:10.679> on<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.800> show

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
motoblur which we had on the show

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.740 
motoblur which we had on the show
yesterday<00:02:11.130> uh-huh<00:02:11.550> how<00:02:11.910> easy<00:02:12.180> did<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.540> think

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
yesterday uh-huh how easy did you think

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.330 
yesterday uh-huh how easy did you think
it<00:02:12.810> was<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.050> use<00:02:13.200> them<00:02:13.380> um<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.830> takes<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.190> little

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
it was to use them um it takes a little

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.640 
it was to use them um it takes a little
bit<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.640> set<00:02:14.849> up<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.360> think<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.050> know<00:02:16.140> like<00:02:16.380> five

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
bit to set up I think you know like five

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.470 
bit to set up I think you know like five
or<00:02:16.890> six<00:02:17.219> minutes<00:02:17.340> or<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:17.969> to<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.239> sign

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
or six minutes or so but to like I sign

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
something I need especially waiting for

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.470 
something I need especially waiting for
my<00:02:40.650> from<00:02:41.010> my<00:02:41.040> eyes<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.090> little<00:02:42.330> on<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
my from my eyes it's a little on the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.330 
my from my eyes it's a little on the
messy<00:02:42.720> side<00:02:42.870> yeah<00:02:43.410> but<00:02:43.650> if<00:02:43.740> you're<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.920> kid<00:02:44.190> if

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
messy side yeah but if you're a kid if

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.130 
messy side yeah but if you're a kid if
you're<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.490> younger<00:02:44.730> person<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.870> can<00:02:46.020> look

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
you're a younger person and you can look

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.110 
you're a younger person and you can look
at<00:02:46.320> 15<00:02:46.710> things<00:02:46.920> at<00:02:47.160> once<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.490> absorb<00:02:47.820> all<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
at 15 things at once and absorb all the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.640 
at 15 things at once and absorb all the
data<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.510> your<00:02:48.630> brain<00:02:48.870> right<00:02:49.110> then<00:02:49.470> it

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
data and your brain right then it

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.110 
data and your brain right then it
probably<00:02:49.860> makes<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.220> lot<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.400> sense<00:02:50.490> but<00:02:50.970> on

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
probably makes a lot of sense but on

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.060 
probably makes a lot of sense but on
here<00:02:51.390> go-gurt<00:02:51.810> here<00:02:52.110> it's<00:02:52.260> why<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.470> just<00:02:52.860> looked

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
here go-gurt here it's why I just looked

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.830 
here go-gurt here it's why I just looked
at<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.220> all<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.430> could<00:02:53.610> think<00:02:53.670> was<00:02:53.880> get<00:02:54.390> off<00:02:54.570> my

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
at it all I could think was get off my

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.250 
at it all I could think was get off my
lawn<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.910> totally<00:02:56.910> feel<00:02:57.300> old<00:02:57.600> look<00:02:57.870> at<00:02:58.110> that

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
lawn I totally feel old look at that

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.200 
lawn I totally feel old look at that
screen<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.560> can't<00:02:58.980> process<00:02:59.220> what<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.850> all<00:03:00.030> this

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
screen I can't process what is all this

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.970 
screen I can't process what is all this
stuff<00:03:00.270> but<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:00.960> looks<00:03:01.290> kind<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.590> neat<00:03:01.770> there's

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
stuff but it looks kind of neat there's

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.590 
stuff but it looks kind of neat there's
no<00:03:02.040> virtual<00:03:02.340> keyboard<00:03:02.820> though<00:03:03.060> everything

no virtual keyboard though everything

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.060 
no virtual keyboard though everything
needs<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.780> be<00:03:03.840> scribed<00:03:04.320> on<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.770> physical

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070
