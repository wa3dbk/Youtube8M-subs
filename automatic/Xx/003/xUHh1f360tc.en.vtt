00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
a little bit more about solutions how we

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.960 
a little bit more about solutions how we
can<00:00:21.510> take<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.990> Mitsubishi<00:00:22.590> product<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.670> turn

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
can take the Mitsubishi product and turn

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.450 
can take the Mitsubishi product and turn
it<00:00:24.119> into<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.300> solution<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.800> John<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.279> any

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
it into a solution so John you have any

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.460 
it into a solution so John you have any
questions<00:00:26.849> for<00:00:27.029> me<00:00:27.180> today<00:00:27.359> well<00:00:27.810> what<00:00:28.320> would<00:00:28.410> I

costs about 60 cents it depends on how
much<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.060> quality<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.150> very<00:01:18.240> nice<00:01:19.040> prints

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
much of it quality is very nice prints

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.420 
much of it quality is very nice prints
in<00:01:20.189> about<00:01:20.430> 6<00:01:20.820> seconds<00:01:21.439> I<00:01:22.439> tell<00:01:22.950> people<00:01:23.130> when

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
in about 6 seconds I tell people when

in about 6 seconds I tell people when
they<00:01:23.580> ask<00:01:23.610> me<00:01:23.939> all<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> time<00:01:24.210> how<00:01:24.600> long<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.049> it

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
they ask me all the time how long is it

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.580 
they ask me all the time how long is it
last<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.740> say<00:01:26.009> it'll<00:01:26.640> outlive<00:01:27.150> you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
last I say it'll outlive you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.120 
last I say it'll outlive you
the<00:01:28.829> technology<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:30.210> dye<00:01:30.659> sublimation<00:01:31.130> so

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the technology is dye sublimation so

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.710 
the technology is dye sublimation so
when<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.430> comes<00:01:32.670> out<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.270> machine

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
when it comes out of the machine

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.640 
when it comes out of the machine
it's<00:01:34.229> basically<00:01:34.920> dry<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:36.210> could

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
it's basically dry you could

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.990 
it's basically dry you could
you<00:01:36.830> could<00:01:36.980> do<00:01:37.130> anything<00:01:37.400> you<00:01:37.550> want<00:01:37.850> with<00:01:37.910> it

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
you could do anything you want with it

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.370 
you could do anything you want with it
you<00:01:38.120> can<00:01:38.330> put<00:01:38.510> it<00:01:38.540> down<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:38.870> put<00:01:39.020> your<00:01:39.140> coffee

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
you can put it down and put your coffee

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.620 
you can put it down and put your coffee
on<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.710> use<00:01:39.980> it<00:01:40.190> as<00:01:40.310> a<00:01:40.340> coaster<00:01:40.640> it'll<00:01:41.420> pretty

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
on it use it as a coaster it'll pretty

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.380 
on it use it as a coaster it'll pretty
much<00:01:41.720> last<00:01:42.140> forever<00:01:42.620> for<00:01:43.610> me<00:01:43.790> though<00:01:44.030> these

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
much last forever for me though these

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.830 
much last forever for me though these
machines<00:01:45.250> create<00:01:46.250> solutions<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:47.180> solutions

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
machines create solutions the solutions

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.290 
machines create solutions the solutions
are<00:01:48.110> instead<00:01:48.980> of<00:01:49.040> giving<00:01:49.490> out<00:01:49.640> a<00:01:49.670> business

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
are instead of giving out a business

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.600 
are instead of giving out a business
card<00:01:50.660> which<00:01:51.020> just<00:01:51.290> probably<00:01:51.560> has<00:01:52.040> your<00:01:52.400> name

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
card which just probably has your name

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.030 
card which just probably has your name
on<00:01:52.910> it<00:01:52.940> they're<00:01:53.690> giving<00:01:54.020> out<00:01:54.110> a<00:01:54.170> quality

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
on it they're giving out a quality

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.190 
on it they're giving out a quality
photograph<00:01:55.790> something<00:01:56.510> that<00:01:56.780> will<00:01:56.960> last

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
photograph something that will last

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.090 
photograph something that will last
forever

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
forever

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.360 
forever
and<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:58.910> gets<00:01:59.900> people<00:02:00.320> talking<00:02:00.560> about<00:02:01.070> it

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
and it gets people talking about it

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.130 
and it gets people talking about it
