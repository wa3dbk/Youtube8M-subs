00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.220
 and very good with all of us after 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.420
 of what I've done to date how 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.610
 save now very basic to 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.650
 for waters to avoid a bit of ancash 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.660
 and have a little vision as we will 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.810
 go to the advanced guide that is for 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.250
 get the most out of the wars 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.540
 let's start by top as in the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.900
 glasses and let's start by top and 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.760
 let's go down first let's go 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.940
 to put a guard in the guard that we have 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.670
 basic line we put you in this area 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.720
 this time because we are going to do is 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.010
 a little different 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.910
 let's place a guard 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.940
 here for that because in the union yes I think 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.519
 that we put it here but it's not 100% 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.440
 reliable because it has a cooler 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.289
 extremely fast as in karim 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.149
 grams something much speed as 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.769
 when we give it here it can already be 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.659
 pretty late that's how we are here 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.100
 posing and we see broadband here 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.190
 broadband 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.840
 pass past 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.720
 to suffer like a pig not 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.910
 then better try here and play what 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.040
 It is also advisable to put a 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.350
 guard here or really also 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.720
 we are looking for that we get with 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.620
 this is if we are far behind if we are 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.840
 here in this line 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.640
 let's see if they enter us through their jungle 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.110
 or if we entered found by line 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.550
 because maybe we 're here and 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.990
 do not enter us here without other people 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.939
 over here by line over here 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.079
 while of course we can not see it from 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.369
 none of the ways are we here 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.649
 stuck when we realize and 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.060
 advance a little bit will not leave the grass 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.560
 and make us stay like that 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.490
 seen so that war is also 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.530
 quite necessary 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.799
 We have this war but I'm saying 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.500
 moment but then how do we see the 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.729
 people who climb up river well that comes to 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.649
 be because it is supposed or because if you play 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.780
 in premium and our medium or our 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.100
 I will have to put a web what comes 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.869
 being the is lowered 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.150
 what do we get with this place with this 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.850
 what we get is to cover all this 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.410
 input that we get with it not 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.080
 we got to see if it becomes ghosts but 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.420
 we get to see that nothing is to say 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.220
 we see that it rises up here although in 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.750
 change make fall here we see that the 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.710
 player is over here and we see if it goes 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.810
 so much up 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:26.590
 it means that it goes above that has 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.239
 Neglected or so much if it goes straight 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.800
 that is to say that we will be in the middle 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:36.190
 then by plugging this output what 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.379
 we do is that you can not leave your board 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.440
 if you realize you have this much 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.090
 covered exit like this is to say no 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.950
 you can redeem we have also 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.440
 above covered that is impossible not 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.330
 see it is totally encased by wash 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.250
 or by a cover of these outputs 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.960
 has to come out yes or yes to try 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.790
 win 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.870
 so with this, we're going to see it 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.640
 pretty easy 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.420
 then stewart also helps a lot 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.950
 soul to the soul in the middle and then in between 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.530
 let's make some variations 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.680
 we put a guard here in the guide 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.879
 basic so to speak on this occasion 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.879
 let's place here 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.750
 I wanted to be a little the place this 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.850
 we have placed here and we are coming to 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.670
 be exactly the same nothing more than 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.290
 natural because well because in this 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.120
 occasion what we want to catch 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.430
 or say we can also put here a 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.260
 guard will have maximum security since 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.689
 that still come to us for children come what 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.040
 let's see but if we put a here 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.019
 what we do is when he comes here 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.909
 to enter through these lines we are going to 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.340
 see is to say let's see what is placed 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.590
 in these herbs and if they come from behind 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.409
 that are usually the most effective too 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.359
 we will see it but not only that but 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.799
 thanks to this to stewart we can see 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.329
 whether it is going to do our 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.060
 ghosts is to say if you do not have to steal 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.700
 the experience if it comes to make red 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.750
 or if on the other hand it can also 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.420
 be very likely and it comes very well 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.599
 save here is if it's going to go down to 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.340
 rank for you because in the sore on 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.769
 basic guide has been and has known 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.109
 account we have saved what comes 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.220
 being a river that is to say this area but if 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:16.620
 the together does not come from the back 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.290
 well, it will probably come to us 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.120
 that here for which we will not see it and 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.910
 it can be a pretty easy double kill 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.480
 in the pot so you can or we keep 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.460
 here 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.340
 and what we are going to do is save 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.870
 also in bot but we are not going to guards 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.880
 in this area but we 're going to save a 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.190
 little bit of the neighborhood we are going to save here 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.350
 with this we manage to control this 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.480
 exit 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.340
 and know when it stops blue too 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.940
 we control 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:49.080
 when they are going to make the dragon and 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.780
 we also see it a lot before 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.150
 if there are jungles working, that is if 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.860
 we put some here we can have 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.330
 serious problems if the young person is very 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.039
 fast because he can catch us and gloves 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.430
 we see it from here the truth is that it is 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.890
 impossible 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.750
 and then in this area you can not get 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.650
 because he can not get here or 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.060
 around here and then finally 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.850
 we would place 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:16.240
 another guard per line because it can be 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.980
 that the hummer is trying to get through 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.540
 line or here not then then 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.570
 depending on whether we are more or less 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.180
 listened to so we would place a couple of 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.040
 wash around here in this area too 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.510
 bother a little and know where it is in 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.360
 all times so come here 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.220
 down we'll see it with the software if 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.840
 you come by this exit we will see 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.060
 with stewart and we will also control 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.830
 the dragon we are going to see this exit 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.270
 let's find the river let's see the 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.940
 dragon let's see if they come to us 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.950
 below we will highlight a lot 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.010
 profit we keep it in these tribes 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.600
 because I also do not know is necessary because 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.850
 if he comes here we will see him and if 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.260
 it's coming down here we're not going to see it 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.360
 what is that tribes but we will see it 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.849
 much earlier thanks to the water that we have 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.580
 placed on me 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:03.129
 so with this signal the most basic 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.439
 that you have to keep in mind then you can 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.149
 remember above all that they do not have no 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:09.279
 must keep only his for these ua 

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:10.509
 they have to put on the whole team it 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:12.219
 usually make the goal ones put 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:14.529
 devotions 2 put the top and the 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.509
 of bill put those of mitt also 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:19.259
 recommend that it is quite interesting 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:21.909
 put here a couple of wars to control 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:23.770
 what is being is also nations 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:25.300
 we can depends on how the game goes 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.039
 if we have advanced a little more at home 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.319
 line if we want music a little more 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.819
 well put some wars in these our 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:32.469
 herbs to have maximum control 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:35.740
 also if we want to get the most out of it 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:37.149
 profit to the station a click click to take out 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.009
 the maximum benefit as we can save 

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:40.240
 in these areas to control everything 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.209
 that is being the enemy jungle and 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.869
 power stolen anyway these are the 

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:48.969
 more more interesting areas no longer what 

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:50.259
 so much to avoid a bench but to 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:51.490
 play arrives in a much more way 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:53.050
 aggressive 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.279
 that is, you see when you meet here that you are 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.519
 doing the blue well that's for 

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:59.169
 killed by it and it's stolen but about 

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:01.479
 everything to remember them guasch to see then 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.430
 three lines to prevent them from doing that in 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:04.990
 by anywhere 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.460
 so we're going to leave it here 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.650
 because I do not want to make a video either 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.480
 too extensive I hope that I have 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:14.440
 liked and above all that it serves you 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.760
 a lot and good this is all we see in 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.950
 the next video you already know that you can 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.230
 subscribe to the channel if you are not and give 

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.560
 I like the video a greeting and even 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.560
 then
