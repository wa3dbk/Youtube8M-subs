00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:16.990
 in the morning of the morning the program that goes 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.730
 mess with your head 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.769
 Hi folks, we're back with the 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.830
 morning program of the program the 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.359
 Is messing with our heads is not it? 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.089
 today as we promise we will 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.990
 explain a little bit what is 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:34.480
 neuroscience is the basis of the method 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.030
 neuroscience is the science that works the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.800
 our nervous system how it works 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.239
 its evolution 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.640
 how our behavior 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.010
 affects our mind our mind 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.620
 behavior in which all 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.609
 neural structures correspond to what 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.789
 you do 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.199
 The most important thing is to know that the 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.840
 neuroscience revealed something 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.300
 important our brain possesses. 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.719
 an extraordinary capacity of 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.670
 from changing the neural patterns to 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.629
 to be able to do exercises in a more 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.299
 efficient 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.939
 aquino surpasses you will learn how 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.100
 exercise your brain as you develop 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.080
 these skills that are multiple and 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.360
 several with exercises and techniques 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.220
 appropriate for you to get the best 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.770
 benefit of your brain 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.619
 our brain is so the more you 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.250
 exercises a certain skill 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.470
 stay 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.659
 What happens is you could do 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.329
 this alone for example learn a 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.640
 new language making knitting playing chess 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.280
 with some activity that you know in the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.049
 perhaps with some activity that 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.750
 be common for you 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.040
 now we can do something better 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.780
 very special 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.790
 for example if you decided to do 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.189
 home exercise you may not have 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.280
 discipline and efficiency of a teacher 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.950
 who can help in overcoming we can 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.140
 potentiate these skills with 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.149
 specific exercises that will 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.780
 you still more skilled with your 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.060
 brain 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.009
 a simple change in their way of 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.890
 make the activities simpler and 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.350
 shows you how you can take 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.110
 your autopilot brain 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.740
 comfort zone this is gymnastics for 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.870
 brain 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.670
 do what you normally do 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.650
 different way doing your brain 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.909
 create another way to make the 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.950
 same thing 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:23.440
 Let's look at another practical example on 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.420
 This I'm going to call teacher daniela. 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.000
 It will tip you a lot. 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.470
 I'm soon back in your brain. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.030
 day by day there alright 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.890
 today I'm making my list of 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.290
 supermarket you already stopped to think 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.790
 that the supermarket is all about 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.310
 brain gymnastics 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.530
 because it's really we can end it 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.549
 our brain a lot a little visit 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.200
 supermarket 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.879
 I'll start by giving some tips on 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.069
 How can you do brain gymnastics? 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.829
 on a visit to the supermarket, let's go 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.890
 start with the list of products that you 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.799
 Do you want to buy my tip for you? 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.000
 you separate the products write the 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:07.090
 products separated into fruit categories 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.379
 vegetables and cleaning products materials 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.329
 office 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.530
 this way separating you by 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.750
 categories 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.120
 you are stimulating your memory more 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.579
 The big challenge is not to take the list 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.310
 main market is to try to 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.769
 your memory and to the supermarket without 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.139
 list one more tip I have for you 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.450
 give on the trip to the supermarket is that 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.790
 you change the way you do there 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.220
 within in music by products 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.250
 You doing this will require your 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.560
 brain more attention and concentration 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.269
 one more tip is how you can work 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.120
 logical reasoning within the 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.609
 supermarket making over 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.739
 promotions by performing calculations on the 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.989
 value of the products and the products 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.650
 Are you going to buy how much is it going to be? 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.449
 and one last not least tip is 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.879
 how can you spur the question of 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:59.949
 sense of space in your brain and 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.989
 try to organize the 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:04.120
 cleaners Products 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.430
 inside the cart 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.590
 in an organized way of both you 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.410
 do this carefully I'm sure 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.569
 your brain will be turbid and you 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.699
 you will enjoy these benefits in your 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.539
 day- to- day activities that will require 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:20.229
 from you 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:23.169
 logical reasoning organization memory and 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.389
 a much more productive brain 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.719
 more creative this is my tip for 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.990
 in our program today the challenge of 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:30.990
 week 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.300
 good people are the votes with one more 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.669
 challenge of the week 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.710
 only that the angel I pass to you a 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.870
 new challenge for you mesh cuba 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.939
 during the week I'll show you the 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.979
 Challenge Response to present 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:50.229
 you one last week's program 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:05:04.539
 Come on, he will not even have 6 sticks to form 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:05:07.120
 three squares see only 123456 you 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.110
 Can you see the three rounds ? 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:16.360
 show you 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:20.349
 see only 1 2 and 3 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.409
 It's very easy, right, but we need it. 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:26.259
 strike is to blame because it is cheaper is 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:29.050
 important not only the challenge of this week 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:31.960
 take the paper for you to write down 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:35.110
 I'll write, I'll draw here like I do. 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.870
 can I do to connect the four points 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:41.319
 using three straight lines beginning and ending 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.050
 same place without taking the side of the 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:45.599
 paper and without passing through the same 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.569
 place 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:51.939
 think maressa cuca fish think I have 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.099
 sure you will not get the answer 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:55.899
 Break your guilt during the week leaves 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.149
 The answer on facebook that we are going 

00:05:55.899 --> 00:06:01.659
 raffle between the three hitters 

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:03.879
 people who will win a toast expect the 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:05.800
 our program is coming to an end 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.349
 but next week we are here 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.180
 again remember to make your 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:13.240
 brain activity on the way to 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.020
 supermarket and in the program that comes I 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.419
 showed the result of the challenge 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.789
 This week meanwhile you're going 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:34.159
 wetting his head until the next 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:38.650
