00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.610
 patriotism would like to ask you a question 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.950
 The main question of this video will be 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.859
 do you like your motherland so much 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.850
 do you value your homeland do you appreciate it because 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.279
 which is quite a large number 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.380
 teenagers now just just in 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.180
 that does not put my country and now I 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.699
 I’m talking about Russia, I don’t even know 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.039
 how to explain it maybe someone said 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.320
 and it started so that yes abroad 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.980
 there is not in Russia if you live it 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.399
 will be cooler and if you move and your 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.719
 life will be much better and much 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.670
 better I don't even know how sad 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.590
 becomes when i go into known 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.510
 Enough public in contact and see there 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.700
 and pictures where it says that Russia 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.480
 ready to litter Russia as soon as they can 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.190
 in fact 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.440
 and quite a lot of people 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.530
 comes to the side of these 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.570
 anti lovers say well I do n't know let's say 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.219
 then anti lovers Russia who 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.809
 set a goal and hit the road with this 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.059
 countries as quickly as possible yes that is 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.000
 eighteen knocks and i will leave you 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.250
 set themselves an ideal let's say for example 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.740
 let's say america set themselves from like 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.869
 I would like as long as you don't live in 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.659
 this country at least you will not understand the code 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.490
 cons you won't understand truths and cons and 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.380
 all the advantages of this country because 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.600
 all this did not seem nice from the side 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.490
 let's say we live in Russia and we look 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.350
 in the US, that's right, that's just my god 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.540
 there is an ideal state and some 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.430
 just there people love all that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.290
 of course every country is trying to show 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.780
 yourself and yes let's say for 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.100
 mass media and we often see only good 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.470
 but cons 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.939
 we can only see when we 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.799
 live in this country some 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.200
 a certain length of time we are now 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.930
 growing up yes that is this generation 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.240
 we can make the country different we can 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.549
 also love your country and not with all 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.370
 pluses with all and minuses because 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.560
 it's very pretty modern enough 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.510
 country yes I think it's not worth it 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.210
 categorically treat her very 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.210
 a blogger's blogger has launched a raider video on 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.680

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.170
 Russia will try to leave you a link 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.050
 just look at the bottom of all such I think 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.090
 there you will understand so threateningly that my 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.400
 peers and saying things like that could 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.170
 graduated from Okiya school here I study bye 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.840

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.920
 will help my parents I think 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.140
 that Russia can also be delivered 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.270

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.950

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.520
 make it better to bring a piece of yourself into
