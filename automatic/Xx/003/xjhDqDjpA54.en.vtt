00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
this game you Bonnie helped once and

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.130 
this game you Bonnie helped once and
then<00:04:32.910> as<00:04:33.030> soon<00:04:33.150> as<00:04:33.270> you<00:04:33.420> do<00:04:33.570> it<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.840> second

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
then as soon as you do it the second

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.540 
then as soon as you do it the second
time<00:04:34.200> you're<00:04:34.560> going<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.740> take<00:04:34.890> a<00:04:34.920> speed<00:04:35.250> slow

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
time you're going to take a speed slow

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.580 
time you're going to take a speed slow
down<00:04:35.730> third<00:04:36.090> time<00:04:36.300> even<00:04:36.780> slower<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.230> forth

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
down third time even slower and forth

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.890 
down third time even slower and forth
slow<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.310> eventually<00:04:38.760> going<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.030> stop<00:04:39.270> so<00:04:39.870> you

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
slow and eventually going to stop so you

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.630 
slow and eventually going to stop so you
can't<00:04:40.170> really<00:04:40.320> bunnyhop<00:04:40.830> consecutively<00:04:41.520> but

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
can't really bunnyhop consecutively but

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.090 
can't really bunnyhop consecutively but
you<00:04:41.880> can<00:04:42.090> hop<00:04:42.330> once<00:04:42.630> as<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.840> distraction<00:04:43.230> of

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
you can hop once as a distraction of

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.220 
you can hop once as a distraction of
course<00:04:44.370> going<00:04:45.030> along<00:04:45.360> with<00:04:45.510> that<00:04:45.570> is<00:04:45.870> strafing

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
course going along with that is strafing

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.050 
course going along with that is strafing
and<00:04:46.590> combining<00:04:47.220> these<00:04:47.460> when<00:04:47.670> you're<00:04:47.790> showing

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
and combining these when you're showing
