00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
problems obviously so let's start this

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.310 
problems obviously so let's start this
spike<00:00:23.010> was<00:00:23.460> 172<00:00:24.359> CCS

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
spike was 172 CCS

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.540 
spike was 172 CCS
but<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.599> didn't<00:00:27.599> really<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:27.990> me<00:00:28.170> anywhere

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
but it didn't really get me anywhere

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.070 
but it didn't really get me anywhere
well<00:00:29.550> not<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.300> I'm<00:00:30.420> heavyset<00:00:30.810> or<00:00:30.960> anything

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
well not that I'm heavyset or anything

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.350 
well not that I'm heavyset or anything
but<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> cars<00:00:32.009> here<00:00:32.550> are<00:00:33.210> not

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
but it's just that the cars here are not

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.580 
but it's just that the cars here are not
very<00:00:33.420> friendly<00:00:33.989> towards<00:00:34.380> motorbikes<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:36.590> so

look there it is oil cooler right in
there<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.629> don't<00:00:55.260> know<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.680> best

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
there I don't know if that's the best

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.350 
there I don't know if that's the best
position<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> only<00:00:57.149> one<00:00:57.329> I

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
position for it but it's the only one I

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.209 
position for it but it's the only one I
can<00:00:57.570> make<00:00:57.600> fit<00:00:58.050> because<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.710> carburetor<00:00:59.160> is

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
can make fit because that carburetor is

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.610 
can make fit because that carburetor is
freakin<00:00:59.550> huge<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.840> kick<00:01:01.050> start<00:01:01.320> only

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
freakin huge it's kick start only

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.579 
freakin huge it's kick start only
unfortunately<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.899> let's<00:01:04.260> go<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.530> other

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
unfortunately and let's go to the other

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.530 
unfortunately and let's go to the other
