 If there are two here we have two so that in 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.509

 these speakers have a diameter let's go 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.420
 only a diameter of 8 millimeters remains 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.000
 and in neodymium materials the 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.519
 frequency response of 16 claver are 24 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.669
 here the reds the connector there we can 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.129
 appreciate is 3.5 mm is bathed 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:02.930
 in gold and you may appreciate that you have a 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.700
 45 degree angle also comes 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.439
 accompanied with a microphone so if 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.659
 you are listening to music 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.099
 from your mobile they will be able to answer the 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.840
 calls without any problem that has 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.750
 a button to pause or to 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.840
 just answer the call and then 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.340
 we have that the material used in 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.340
 the back and you can see 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.740
 We'll see if they succeed in landscapes 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.260
 wood that is ebony 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.330
 which makes it unique and thanks to the 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.870
 materials because it provides sounds 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.120
 clear and natural we also have 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.420
 that the cable you can start 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.060
 do if he did not show well is 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.700
 braided which also provides you 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.800
 much more durability in terms of 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.890
 gummies here I have removed them and I have 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.100

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.450
 nice sizes not which is also 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.460
 very useful because for example I was 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.990
 listening to the music with which 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.460
 They came already borrowed and what I did was 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.010
 remove them and place the smallest 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.080
 consider doing the right ones for 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.690
 my ear and that's how it was and the music liked it 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.690

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.440
 description let's leave the link or 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.690
 simply text in berlin link 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.490
 here on screen now what I'm going to 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.260
 give you in the comments with 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.300
 about how it has been working 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.870
 these headphones when we have been 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.820
 using 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.820
 finally what can we say about these 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.770
 9 months headphones in classic months 11 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.290
 classic let's live not in two parts 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.090
 the first do with respect to the 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.250
 quality of materials used and a 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.780
 second is the sound quality in 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.190
 how many materials do you use? 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.580
 have been able to appreciate in this video that 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:08.090
 are made by hand are made of wood the cable 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.340
 It is made of a braided textile material that 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.060
 makes it much more resistant and in what 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.710
 refers to the 3.5 mm connector 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.900
 missed in gold so what material 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.270
 you will receive in this product 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.790
 They are of high quality allowing them 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.650
 you have therefore a better quality of 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.870
 audio a better sound quality a lot 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.310
 sharper and much more natural in 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.410
 terms of sound quality we have 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.360
 been very satisfied we have used 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.340
 these headphones with our 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.100
 mobile devices we have come out to 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.570
 run for a while and we have not had any 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.730
 problem that we drop that yes what 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.040
 we have done is to choose in lagoon 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.930
 special or the pump that is perfect for 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.880
 my ear that is small and this way 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.140
 Well, it's going to be maintained that this law does not 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.810
 will be silent for as long as I 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.980
 I go to run the other is also that 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.810
 used when working 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.860
 in our computer to be able to edit 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.419
 our videos and the truth that is 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.400
 listen much better has no point 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.950
 conversation if we compare it with 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.660
 the headphones that come in the iphone 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.220
 if they appreciated the iphone but in this 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.950
 If you are going to have a product of 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.930
 greater of better quality by providing you 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.880
 logically a better sound quality 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.440
 the only problem we are going to say is that 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.660
 at the time of us we have put the 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.460
 volume in a song that has a lot 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.810
 under the bass it distorts a bit is 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.040
 the only thing we could say but if 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.540
 you maintain a normal volume 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.310
 because nobody is going to be full volume 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.590
 of the noise, it will be heard by a 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.570
 way very nidia very clear and sound 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.430
 it's really spectacular so 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.510
 We really recommend these products not 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.850
 it's because he sent us 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.290
 these headphones but they really are 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.510
 very good at least with the experience 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.760
 that we have had when using 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.080
 these headphones if they are 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.520
 interested in the bass this video in the 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.290
 Exercise area is going to meet the 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.380
 link or simply here you go to 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:47.600
 can see on the website or in the 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.800
 address instead if in 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.970
 visit the machine that not only 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.080
 they have this type of products but 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.120
 they have others 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.590
 so we already know that the one that has them 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.599

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.680
