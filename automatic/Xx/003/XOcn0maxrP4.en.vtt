00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
you some for me now when you look at the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.339 
you some for me now when you look at the
actual<00:02:27.720> structure

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
actual structure

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.800 
actual structure
it's<00:02:29.310> quite<00:02:29.489> an<00:02:29.580> irregular<00:02:30.060> Crump<00:02:30.299> big<00:02:30.569> holes

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
it's quite an irregular Crump big holes

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.080 
it's quite an irregular Crump big holes
little<00:02:31.140> holes<00:02:31.349> it's<00:02:31.950> not<00:02:32.310> regular<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:32.849> that's

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
little holes it's not regular and that's

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.490 
little holes it's not regular and that's
the<00:02:33.269> crucial<00:02:33.660> thing<00:02:33.840> with<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.019> focaccia<00:02:34.349> and

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
the crucial thing with a focaccia and

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.410 
the crucial thing with a focaccia and
that<00:02:34.739> is<00:02:34.950> brought<00:02:35.220> about<00:02:35.519> by<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.030> sheer

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
that is brought about by the sheer

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.410 
that is brought about by the sheer
amount<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:37.110> volume<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:38.160> water<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:39.150> dough

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
amount of volume of water in that dough

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.979 
amount of volume of water in that dough
I<00:02:39.750> think<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:40.560> was<00:02:40.860> really<00:02:41.130> difficult<00:02:41.489> for<00:02:42.090> the

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
I think it was really difficult for the

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.350 
I think it was really difficult for the
bakers<00:02:43.319> because<00:02:43.799> when<00:02:44.549> you<00:02:44.730> go<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.030> buy<00:02:45.150> for

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
bakers because when you go and buy for

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.830 
bakers because when you go and buy for
capture<00:02:46.079> very<00:02:46.680> often<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.640> thick<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.450> I

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
capture very often it is thick and I

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.930 
capture very often it is thick and I
think<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.560> was<00:02:49.680> difficult<00:02:49.980> for<00:02:50.310> them<00:02:50.610> to

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
think that it was difficult for them to

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.599 
think that it was difficult for them to
get<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.900> thin<00:02:52.350> one<00:02:52.620> like<00:02:52.829> yours<00:02:53.069> they<00:02:53.220> weren't

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
get the thin one like yours they weren't

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.340 
get the thin one like yours they weren't
quite<00:02:53.880> sure<00:02:53.910> what<00:02:54.180> they<00:02:54.660> were<00:02:54.720> going<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.140> end

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
quite sure what they were going to end

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.930 
quite sure what they were going to end
up<00:02:55.590> with<00:02:55.829> it's<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.819> texture<00:02:57.420> it's<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.470> look

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
up with it's the texture it's the look

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.970 
up with it's the texture it's the look
and<00:02:59.940> obviously<00:03:00.299> olive<00:03:00.690> oil<00:03:00.870> lots<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.680> lots<00:03:01.829> of

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
and obviously olive oil lots and lots of

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.379

olive<00:03:02.250> oil<00:03:02.370> that's<00:03:02.730> what<00:03:03.000> gives<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.269> the

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
olive oil that's what gives you the

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.920 
olive oil that's what gives you the
