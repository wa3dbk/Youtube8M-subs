about seven a quarter inch overall but

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.830 
about seven a quarter inch overall but
let's<00:01:09.460> talk<00:01:09.610> about<00:01:09.670> what<00:01:10.060> you<00:01:10.090> use<00:01:10.330> this<00:01:10.510> for

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
let's talk about what you use this for

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.440 
let's talk about what you use this for
for<00:01:11.320> me<00:01:11.470> this<00:01:11.950> is<00:01:12.010> a<00:01:12.159> user<00:01:12.490> even<00:01:13.270> though<00:01:13.330> has

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
for me this is a user even though has

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.149 
for me this is a user even though has
the<00:01:13.600> carbon<00:01:13.900> fiber<00:01:14.140> even<00:01:14.950> though<00:01:15.040> it's<00:01:15.130> a

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
the carbon fiber even though it's a

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.149 
the carbon fiber even though it's a
little<00:01:15.340> expensive<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.840> for<00:01:17.049> the<00:01:17.140> sheer<00:01:17.920> size

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
little expensive just for the sheer size

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.220 
little expensive just for the sheer size
fits<00:01:18.850> perfectly<00:01:19.270> in<00:01:19.390> your<00:01:19.420> hand<00:01:19.690> doesn't<00:01:20.080> take

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
fits perfectly in your hand doesn't take

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.400 
fits perfectly in your hand doesn't take
up<00:01:20.260> a<00:01:20.440> lot<00:01:20.560> of<00:01:20.620> pocket<00:01:21.010> real<00:01:21.130> estate<00:01:21.520> I<00:01:21.730> mean

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
up a lot of pocket real estate I mean

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
up a lot of pocket real estate I mean
look<00:01:23.410> at<00:01:23.500> that<00:01:23.650> that's<00:01:23.980> how<00:01:24.100> it's<00:01:24.250> going<00:01:24.340> to

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
look at that that's how it's going to

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.240 
look at that that's how it's going to
ride<00:01:24.580> in<00:01:24.700> your<00:01:24.820> pocket<00:01:25.240> super<00:01:26.110> slim<00:01:26.410> and<00:01:26.680> for

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
ride in your pocket super slim and for

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.390 
ride in your pocket super slim and for
me<00:01:27.370> and<00:01:28.120> every<00:01:28.390> day<00:01:28.510> carry<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:29.530> for<00:01:30.310> me

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
me and every day carry it for me

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.700 
me and every day carry it for me
personally<00:01:30.790> it's<00:01:31.300> all<00:01:31.450> about<00:01:31.660> pocket<00:01:32.590> real

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
personally it's all about pocket real

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.740 
personally it's all about pocket real
estate<00:01:33.010> and<00:01:33.220> how<00:01:33.700> much<00:01:33.850> it's<00:01:34.330> going<00:01:34.480> to<00:01:34.570> take

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
estate and how much it's going to take

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.090 
estate and how much it's going to take
up<00:01:36.510> so<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.630> plus<00:01:37.840> is<00:01:37.990> on<00:01:38.140> this<00:01:38.350> you<00:01:38.860> got<00:01:39.010> the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
up so the plus is on this you got the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.310 
up so the plus is on this you got the
s30v<00:01:39.610> steel<00:01:41.190> zoom<00:01:42.190> in<00:01:42.370> there<00:01:42.550> s30v<00:01:43.210> steel<00:01:43.600> you

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
s30v steel zoom in there s30v steel you

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.700 
s30v steel zoom in there s30v steel you
got<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.560> carbon<00:01:44.920> fiber<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:46.450> size<00:01:46.750> is<00:01:47.020> near

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
got the carbon fiber the size is near

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.030 
got the carbon fiber the size is near
optimum<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.460> think<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.030> only<00:01:49.180> drawback

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
optimum I think the only drawback

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.120 
optimum I think the only drawback
becomes<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.190> cost<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.510> user<00:01:52.720> blade

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
becomes the cost for a user blade

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.200 
becomes the cost for a user blade
obviously<00:01:54.130> for<00:01:54.310> a<00:01:54.340> collection<00:01:54.790> it's<00:01:54.970> a<00:01:55.030> great

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
obviously for a collection it's a great

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.260 
obviously for a collection it's a great
addition<00:01:55.480> I<00:01:56.400> think<00:01:57.400> with<00:01:57.490> micro<00:01:57.760> tech<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.120> get

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
addition I think with micro tech you get

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.250 
addition I think with micro tech you get
what<00:01:58.360> you<00:01:58.420> pay<00:01:58.480> for<00:01:58.930> I<00:01:59.170> mean<00:02:00.010> even<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.400> screws

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
what you pay for I mean even the screws

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.670 
what you pay for I mean even the screws
are<00:02:02.260> milled<00:02:02.590> differently<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:05.110> in<00:02:05.560> the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
are milled differently then in the

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.710 
are milled differently then in the
average<00:02:05.980> screw<00:02:06.280> not<00:02:06.490> nothin<00:02:07.120> other<00:02:07.390> micro

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
average screw not nothin other micro

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.469 
average screw not nothin other micro
tech<00:02:07.870> screws<00:02:08.170> but<00:02:08.379> that<00:02:09.190> stands<00:02:09.550> out<00:02:09.819> I<00:02:10.149> mean

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
tech screws but that stands out I mean

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.180 
tech screws but that stands out I mean
look<00:02:10.599> at<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.840> detail<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.260> this<00:02:11.560> on<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.010> glass

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
look at the detail on this on the glass

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.880 
look at the detail on this on the glass
breaker<00:02:12.519> there<00:02:12.849> got<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.780> great<00:02:13.989> pocket<00:02:14.470> clip

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.270 

run<00:02:17.890> out<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.190> front<00:02:19.470> that's<00:02:20.470> minimal<00:02:21.010> play

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
run out the front that's minimal play
