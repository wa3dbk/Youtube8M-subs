stock<00:00:53.030> now<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.180> type<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> design<00:00:54.809> creates<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
stock now this type of design creates a

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.500 
stock now this type of design creates a
high<00:00:55.469> coefficient<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.219> restitution<00:00:56.510> which

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
high coefficient of restitution which

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.060 
high coefficient of restitution which
means<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.899> more<00:00:58.050> energy<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.590> transferred

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
means that more energy is transferred

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.900 
means that more energy is transferred
from<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.399> ball<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> pins<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.480> impact

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.310 

now<00:01:05.910> let's<00:01:06.120> compare<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.600> high<00:01:06.780> roads<00:01:07.050> wait

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
now let's compare the high roads wait

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.050 
now let's compare the high roads wait
