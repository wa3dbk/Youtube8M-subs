you ride you write them a little bit
longer<00:00:57.590> it<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:58.829> depends<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.280> horse<00:00:59.550> but

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320

the red the red hearts but at this point

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.639 
the red the red hearts but at this point
it<00:02:02.899> is<00:02:03.159> tame<00:02:04.420> although<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:06.140> have<00:02:06.289> no<00:02:06.470> control

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
it is tame although you have no control

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.490 
it is tame although you have no control
over<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:08.179> basically<00:02:08.509> if<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:08.810> just<00:02:09.019> SAT<00:02:09.200> here

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
over it so basically if I just SAT here

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.759 
over it so basically if I just SAT here
on<00:02:09.649> top<00:02:09.920> of<00:02:09.950> this<00:02:10.220> force<00:02:10.519> it<00:02:10.789> would<00:02:11.590> still<00:02:12.590> just

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
on top of this force it would still just

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.710 
on top of this force it would still just
roam<00:02:13.069> wherever<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.670> wanted<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.000> go<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.630> I'm

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
roam wherever it wanted to go and I'm

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.120 
roam wherever it wanted to go and I'm
