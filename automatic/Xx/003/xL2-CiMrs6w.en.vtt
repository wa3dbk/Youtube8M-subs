00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
requesting you know and tried to figure

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.560 
requesting you know and tried to figure

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
out how I do it

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.380 
out how I do it
it's<00:00:24.560> when<00:00:24.770> I'm<00:00:24.860> heavy<00:00:25.070> ammo<00:00:25.280> glitching<00:00:25.790> you

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
guys a probably see that I don't regen

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.180 
guys a probably see that I don't regen
mo<00:00:28.340> and<00:00:28.520> you<00:00:28.610> guys<00:00:28.790> probably<00:00:29.120> do<00:00:29.890> some<00:00:30.890> people

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 
mo and you guys probably do some people

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.799 
mo and you guys probably do some people
probably<00:00:31.400> don't<00:00:31.820> because<00:00:32.059> they're<00:00:32.360> doing<00:00:32.689> it

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
probably don't because they're doing it

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.720 
probably don't because they're doing it
correctly<00:00:33.260> without<00:00:33.680> even<00:00:33.950> knowing<00:00:34.280> sometimes

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
correctly without even knowing sometimes

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.860 
correctly without even knowing sometimes
but<00:00:35.829> um<00:00:36.829> it<00:00:37.670> took<00:00:38.090> me<00:00:38.240> a<00:00:38.270> while<00:00:38.390> to<00:00:38.450> figure<00:00:38.660> it

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
but um it took me a while to figure it

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.180 
but um it took me a while to figure it
out<00:00:38.990> when<00:00:39.140> I<00:00:39.170> finally<00:00:39.410> figured<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:39.740> out<00:00:39.860> it

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
out when I finally figured it out it

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.540 
out when I finally figured it out it
never<00:00:40.400> I<00:00:40.760> never<00:00:41.000> regain<00:00:41.510> ammo<00:00:41.900> again<00:00:42.250> but<00:00:45.550> it's

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
never I never regain ammo again but it's

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.770 
never I never regain ammo again but it's
something<00:00:46.850> with<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:47.120> ice<00:00:47.239> burger<00:00:47.600> that's

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
something with the ice burger that's

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.750 
something with the ice burger that's
weird

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
weird

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.400 
weird

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.300 

don't<00:01:12.290> you<00:01:12.410> guys<00:01:12.530> have<00:01:12.710> pace<00:01:12.860> headed<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.220> my

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
don't you guys have pace headed to my

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.390 
don't you guys have pace headed to my
icebreaker<00:01:13.640> okay<00:01:14.090> when<00:01:14.240> I<00:01:14.270> pull<00:01:14.480> it<00:01:14.570> out<00:01:15.400> boom

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
icebreaker okay when I pull it out boom

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.270 
icebreaker okay when I pull it out boom
three<00:01:16.910> bullets<00:01:17.240> in<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.420> clip<00:01:18.100> okay

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
three bullets in the clip okay

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.130 
three bullets in the clip okay
so<00:01:19.430> if<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:19.670> have<00:01:19.760> full<00:01:20.000> special<00:01:20.540> ammo<00:01:20.900> and<00:01:21.050> you

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
so if you have full special ammo and you

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.690 
so if you have full special ammo and you
do<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.440> heavy<00:01:21.620> ammo<00:01:21.860> but<00:01:22.160> you<00:01:22.340> will<00:01:22.490> not

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
do the heavy ammo but you will not

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.970 
do the heavy ammo but you will not
regain<00:01:23.030> ammo<00:01:23.420> because<00:01:23.870> you<00:01:24.530> will<00:01:24.680> not<00:01:24.830> be

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
regain ammo because you will not be

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.280 
regain ammo because you will not be
going<00:01:25.220> under<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:25.760> ammo<00:01:26.240> amount<00:01:26.570> of<00:01:26.720> two<00:01:26.990> if

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
going under the ammo amount of two if

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.290 
going under the ammo amount of two if
you<00:01:27.950> go<00:01:28.100> under<00:01:28.370> that<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:28.670> will<00:01:28.790> regain<00:01:28.970> ammo

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
you go under that you will regain ammo

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.880 
you go under that you will regain ammo
when<00:01:29.720> you<00:01:29.870> pull<00:01:30.050> it<00:01:30.170> out<00:01:30.260> so<00:01:30.500> if<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:30.710> don't

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
when you pull it out so if you don't

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.070 
when you pull it out so if you don't
have<00:01:31.130> exactly<00:01:31.850> full<00:01:32.030> heavy<00:01:32.270> ammo<00:01:32.510> you<00:01:32.750> pull<00:01:33.020> up

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
have exactly full heavy ammo you pull up

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.630 
have exactly full heavy ammo you pull up
the<00:01:33.170> Icebreaker<00:01:33.470> with<00:01:33.770> zero<00:01:34.040> therefore

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
the Icebreaker with zero therefore

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.980 
the Icebreaker with zero therefore
you're<00:01:34.910> completely<00:01:35.300> out<00:01:35.360> of<00:01:35.510> ammo<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:35.750> you're

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
you're completely out of ammo and you're

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.490 
you're completely out of ammo and you're
reach-in<00:01:36.190> so<00:01:37.190> you<00:01:38.150> can<00:01:38.330> either<00:01:38.480> do<00:01:38.780> one<00:01:39.350> or<00:01:39.470> two

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
reach-in so you can either do one or two

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.520 
reach-in so you can either do one or two
things<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:40.250> it<00:01:40.730> is<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.870> either<00:01:42.020> have<00:01:42.290> full

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
things and it is to either have full

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.990 
things and it is to either have full
specially<00:01:43.040> on<00:01:43.100> before<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.580> pull<00:01:43.790> out<00:01:43.820> the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
specially on before you pull out the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.310 
specially on before you pull out the
icebreaker<00:01:44.480> or<00:01:45.940> you<00:01:46.940> can<00:01:47.210> pull<00:01:48.140> your

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
icebreaker or you can pull your

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.610 
icebreaker or you can pull your
icebreaker<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.130> just<00:01:50.050> waste<00:01:51.050> your<00:01:51.140> ammo<00:01:51.440> with

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
icebreaker and just waste your ammo with

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.890 
icebreaker and just waste your ammo with
like<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.830> primary<00:01:52.370> like<00:01:53.000> let<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.390> reach<00:01:53.540> in<00:01:53.720> like

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
like a primary like let it reach in like

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.390 
like a primary like let it reach in like
up<00:01:54.080> past<00:01:54.350> two<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.800> then<00:01:54.890> shoot<00:01:55.100> out<00:01:55.190> all<00:01:55.310> your

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
up past two and then shoot out all your

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.130 
up past two and then shoot out all your
primary<00:01:55.760> amyl<00:01:55.970> with<00:01:56.060> your<00:01:56.150> pistol<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:57.020> then

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
primary amyl with your pistol and then

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.100 
primary amyl with your pistol and then
you<00:01:57.230> won't<00:01:57.380> regen<00:01:58.150> but<00:01:59.150> yeah<00:01:59.360> this<00:01:59.720> is<00:01:59.900> like

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
you won't regen but yeah this is like

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.380 
you won't regen but yeah this is like
the<00:02:00.680> most<00:02:00.950> effective<00:02:01.340> way<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.490> just<00:02:01.970> have<00:02:02.030> full

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
the most effective way to just have full

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.590 
the most effective way to just have full
special<00:02:02.840> ammo<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:04.490> then<00:02:05.300> pull<00:02:05.480> your

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
special ammo and then pull your

special ammo and then pull your
icebreaker<00:02:05.930> and<00:02:06.110> you'll<00:02:06.200> pull<00:02:06.410> out<00:02:06.530> three<00:02:06.860> I

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
icebreaker and you'll pull out three I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.460
