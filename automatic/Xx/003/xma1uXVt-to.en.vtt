00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.340 
that but that is an outlier most
guidance<00:01:55.350> has<00:01:55.500> no<00:01:55.860> snow<00:01:56.450> or<00:01:57.450> no<00:01:57.509> accumulating

guidance has no snow or no accumulating

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.639 
guidance has no snow or no accumulating
snow<00:01:59.180> I'll<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.329> have<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.780> little<00:02:01.110> bit<00:02:01.320> so

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
snow I'll just have just a little bit so

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.080 
snow I'll just have just a little bit so
we're<00:02:01.890> going<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.070> explore<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.670> as<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:02.939> go

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
we're going to explore that as we go

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.959 
we're going to explore that as we go
along<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:03.390> let's<00:02:03.750> take<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> look<00:02:04.079> at<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.969> gfs

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
along here let's take a look at the gfs

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.850 
along here let's take a look at the gfs
this<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> 12-0<00:02:07.020> run<00:02:07.079> valid<00:02:07.469> at<00:02:07.590> noon

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
this is the 12-0 run valid at noon

this is the 12-0 run valid at noon
tomorrow<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.509> can<00:02:09.660> see<00:02:09.810> how<00:02:09.929> ridging<00:02:10.379> is

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
tomorrow and you can see how ridging is

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.930 
tomorrow and you can see how ridging is
beginning<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.920> build<00:02:11.069> over<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> west<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
and there could be some scattered light

and there could be some scattered light
rain<00:02:21.540> about<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.260> think<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:22.709> need<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.920> mention

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
rain about I think we need to mention

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
but some runs especially the namm have

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.740 
but some runs especially the namm have
been<00:02:28.560> more<00:02:28.800> aggressive<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.610> suggesting<00:02:30.330> maybe

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
been more aggressive in suggesting maybe

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.570 
been more aggressive in suggesting maybe
some<00:02:31.170> light<00:02:31.410> rain<00:02:31.650> during<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.160> day<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:32.400> just

some light rain during the day so just
keep<00:02:32.849> in<00:02:33.000> mind<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.810> possibility<00:02:35.150> now

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
keep in mind that is a possibility now

things are winding down and obviously
it's<00:03:05.250> noticeably<00:03:05.819> colder<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.330> Wednesday<00:03:06.780> as

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
it's noticeably colder on Wednesday as

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
temperatures will struggle to reach the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.770 
temperatures will struggle to reach the
40<00:03:10.440> degree<00:03:10.530> mark<00:03:10.739> around<00:03:11.250> here<00:03:11.599> all<00:03:12.599> right

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
40 degree mark around here all right

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.910 
40 degree mark around here all right
this<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.980> snow<00:03:14.640> projection<00:03:15.510> from<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:16.019> GFS

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
this is the snow projection from the GFS

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.199 
this is the snow projection from the GFS
and<00:03:17.600> it's<00:03:18.600> got<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.260> potential<00:03:19.739> for<00:03:20.220> maybe<00:03:20.970> an

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
and it's got the potential for maybe an

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.229 
and it's got the potential for maybe an
inch<00:03:21.480> or<00:03:21.600> so<00:03:22.049> from<00:03:22.290> Birmingham<00:03:22.799> north<00:03:23.239> again

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
inch or so from Birmingham north again

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.630 
inch or so from Birmingham north again
it<00:03:24.630> seems<00:03:24.870> like<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.350> line<00:03:26.190> there<00:03:26.430> would<00:03:26.609> be

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
it seems like the line there would be

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.699 
it seems like the line there would be
about<00:03:26.880> Vernon<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.959> maybe<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.320> northern

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
about Vernon so maybe the northern

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.390 
about Vernon so maybe the northern
suburbs<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.370> Birmingham<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:30.060> anniston<00:03:31.100> so<00:03:32.100> the

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
suburbs of Birmingham to anniston so the

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.370 
suburbs of Birmingham to anniston so the
GFS<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.299> kind<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.569> getting<00:03:33.690> aggressive<00:03:34.019> with<00:03:34.350> a

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
GFS is kind of getting aggressive with a

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.289 
GFS is kind of getting aggressive with a
chance<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.859> maybe<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.130> light<00:03:35.459> accumulation

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
chance of maybe a light accumulation

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.449 
chance of maybe a light accumulation
here<00:03:36.480> Wednesday<00:03:36.870> morning<00:03:37.230> well<00:03:38.160> look<00:03:38.280> at<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
here Wednesday morning well look at the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.809 
here Wednesday morning well look at the
European<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:40.140> is<00:03:40.290> suggesting<00:03:41.010> light

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
European and it is suggesting light

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.569 
European and it is suggesting light
amounts<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.870> under<00:03:43.319> one-half<00:03:43.829> inch<00:03:44.280> that's

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
amounts of under one-half inch that's

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.039 
amounts of under one-half inch that's
just<00:03:44.850> maybe<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.299> getting<00:03:45.569> a<00:03:45.630> little<00:03:45.750> bit<00:03:45.930> on

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
just maybe of getting a little bit on

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.910 
just maybe of getting a little bit on
the<00:03:46.139> grass<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:48.600> RPM<00:03:49.230> for<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.560> fun<00:03:49.739> of<00:03:49.769> it

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
the grass the RPM for the fun of it

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.509 
the grass the RPM for the fun of it
shows<00:03:50.190> absolutely<00:03:51.019> nothing<00:03:52.250> no<00:03:53.250> snow

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519

the south of that so it's that's going
to<00:04:13.650> be<00:04:13.709> a<00:04:13.739> really<00:04:14.069> hard<00:04:14.310> call<00:04:14.579> I<00:04:14.790> think<00:04:15.150> no

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
to be a really hard call I think no

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.569 
to be a really hard call I think no
doubt<00:04:15.480> we<00:04:15.630> have<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.900> mention<00:04:16.139> some<00:04:16.979> chance<00:04:17.340> of

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
doubt we have to mention some chance of

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.430 
doubt we have to mention some chance of
rain<00:04:17.820> changing<00:04:18.389> to<00:04:18.419> snow<00:04:18.510> early<00:04:19.109> Wednesday

morning<00:04:19.470> before<00:04:19.889> ending<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.519> I<00:04:20.549> do<00:04:20.609> think

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
morning before ending and I do think

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.260 
morning before ending and I do think
we'll<00:04:21.060> need<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.269> mention<00:04:21.450> maybe<00:04:21.750> some<00:04:22.049> light

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
we'll need to mention maybe some light

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.360 
we'll need to mention maybe some light
accumulation<00:04:24.979> especially<00:04:25.979> north<00:04:26.190> of

but<00:04:27.680> surface<00:04:28.160> temperatures<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:29.450> can<00:04:29.570> see

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
but surface temperatures you can see

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.560 
but surface temperatures you can see
there<00:04:29.990> you<00:04:30.320> know<00:04:30.440> we<00:04:30.620> should<00:04:30.830> be<00:04:31.240> 34-35<00:04:32.240> down

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
there you know we should be 34-35 down

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.440 
there you know we should be 34-35 down
here<00:04:33.340> obviously<00:04:34.340> it's<00:04:34.460> not<00:04:34.610> going<00:04:34.730> to<00:04:34.820> be<00:04:34.910> 19

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
here obviously it's not going to be 19

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.920 
here obviously it's not going to be 19
degrees<00:04:35.660> like<00:04:36.080> january<00:04:36.620> twenty<00:04:36.920> eighth<00:04:37.930> I'd

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
degrees like january twenty eighth I'd

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.410 
degrees like january twenty eighth I'd
say<00:04:39.200> the<00:04:39.350> prospects<00:04:39.890> of<00:04:40.040> major<00:04:40.460> problems<00:04:41.210> look

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
say the prospects of major problems look

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.410 
say the prospects of major problems look
low<00:04:41.720> but<00:04:41.750> this<00:04:42.350> is<00:04:42.530> obviously<00:04:42.740> a<00:04:43.390> situation<00:04:44.390> to

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
low but this is obviously a situation to

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.390 
low but this is obviously a situation to
watch<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.140> will<00:04:45.260> fine-tune<00:04:45.530> this<00:04:45.890> carefully

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
watch and will fine-tune this carefully

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.780 
watch and will fine-tune this carefully
tomorrow<00:04:47.090> as<00:04:47.450> we<00:04:47.540> get<00:04:47.690> closer<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.230> this<00:04:48.380> so<00:04:48.790> yes

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
tomorrow as we get closer to this so yes

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.580 
tomorrow as we get closer to this so yes
maybe<00:04:50.180> some<00:04:50.480> light<00:04:50.690> snow<00:04:50.960> before<00:04:51.170> this<00:04:51.380> all

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
maybe some light snow before this all

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.920 
maybe some light snow before this all
ends<00:04:51.890> Wednesday<00:04:52.250> morning<00:04:52.610> maybe<00:04:53.420> some<00:04:53.720> light

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
ends Wednesday morning maybe some light

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.500 
ends Wednesday morning maybe some light
accumulation<00:04:54.620> in<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.740> grass<00:04:55.010> but<00:04:55.280> for<00:04:55.460> now<00:04:55.580> we

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
accumulation in the grass but for now we

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.110 
accumulation in the grass but for now we
will<00:04:57.110> kind<00:04:57.590> of<00:04:57.740> leave<00:04:57.890> it<00:04:58.010> at<00:04:58.100> that<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:58.910> again

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
will kind of leave it at that and again

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.720 
will kind of leave it at that and again
during<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.450> day<00:04:59.600> Wednesday<00:04:59.810> much<00:05:00.230> colder

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
during the day Wednesday much colder

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.890 
during the day Wednesday much colder
actually<00:05:01.730> the<00:05:01.850> models<00:05:02.180> have<00:05:02.330> come<00:05:02.480> in<00:05:02.600> a<00:05:02.660> tad

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
actually the models have come in a tad

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.990 
actually the models have come in a tad
warmer<00:05:03.200> which<00:05:03.530> is<00:05:03.680> good<00:05:03.920> both<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.580> models<00:05:04.910> are

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
warmer which is good both the models are

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.240 
warmer which is good both the models are
printing<00:05:05.270> 45<00:05:05.810> for<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.590> high<00:05:06.740> and<00:05:06.860> there's<00:05:06.980> the

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
printing 45 for the high and there's the

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.800 
printing 45 for the high and there's the
snow<00:05:07.460> cover<00:05:07.700> north<00:05:07.970> of<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.150> state<00:05:08.360> is<00:05:08.480> not<00:05:08.630> as

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
snow cover north of the state is not as

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.810 
snow cover north of the state is not as
extensive<00:05:09.380> as<00:05:09.470> it<00:05:09.590> was<00:05:09.770> you<00:05:10.310> know<00:05:10.430> a<00:05:10.460> few<00:05:10.640> weeks

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
extensive as it was you know a few weeks

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.360 
extensive as it was you know a few weeks
ago<00:05:11.060> so<00:05:11.810> maybe<00:05:11.930> we<00:05:12.170> can<00:05:12.440> reach<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.830> low<00:05:12.950> 40s

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
ago so maybe we can reach the low 40s

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.970 
ago so maybe we can reach the low 40s
and<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:13.520> sky<00:05:13.760> will<00:05:13.910> gradually<00:05:14.300> clear<00:05:14.980> this

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
and the sky will gradually clear this

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.530 
and the sky will gradually clear this
Thursday<00:05:16.520> and<00:05:16.640> Thursday<00:05:16.700> mornings<00:05:17.360> going<00:05:17.480> to

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
Thursday and Thursday mornings going to

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.880 
Thursday and Thursday mornings going to
be<00:05:17.600> our<00:05:17.690> coldest<00:05:18.080> morning<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:18.500> low<00:05:18.590> should<00:05:18.800> be

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
be our coldest morning the low should be

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.940 
be our coldest morning the low should be
around<00:05:19.160> 20<00:05:20.290> here's<00:05:21.290> a<00:05:21.350> look<00:05:21.440> at<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.620> buff<00:05:21.770> kit

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
around 20 here's a look at the buff kit

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.890 
around 20 here's a look at the buff kit
analysis<00:05:22.490> you<00:05:22.880> can<00:05:22.910> see<00:05:23.120> Thursday<00:05:23.540> morning<00:05:23.810> we

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
analysis you can see Thursday morning we

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.380 
analysis you can see Thursday morning we
bottomed<00:05:24.260> out<00:05:24.380> between<00:05:24.980> 20<00:05:25.520> and<00:05:25.550> 25<00:05:25.760> I<00:05:26.090> still

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
bottomed out between 20 and 25 I still

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.820 
bottomed out between 20 and 25 I still
think<00:05:26.540> the<00:05:26.600> colder<00:05:26.930> valleys<00:05:27.230> easily<00:05:27.650> see

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
think the colder valleys easily see

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.160 
think the colder valleys easily see
teens<00:05:28.160> if<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:29.120> wind<00:05:29.330> can<00:05:29.480> go<00:05:29.660> calm<00:05:29.900> and<00:05:30.110> it

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
teens if the wind can go calm and it

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.530 
teens if the wind can go calm and it
should<00:05:30.410> and<00:05:31.310> after<00:05:31.610> that<00:05:31.730> we<00:05:31.940> warm<00:05:32.180> right<00:05:32.390> up

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
should and after that we warm right up

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.480 
should and after that we warm right up
nicely<00:05:32.780> and<00:05:33.230> that's<00:05:33.890> the<00:05:34.040> good<00:05:34.160> thing<00:05:34.220> you

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
nicely and that's the good thing you

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.850 
nicely and that's the good thing you
know<00:05:34.610> temperatures<00:05:35.260> they<00:05:36.260> turn<00:05:36.500> sharply

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
know temperatures they turn sharply

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.500 
know temperatures they turn sharply
colder<00:05:37.100> late<00:05:37.580> in<00:05:37.670> the<00:05:37.760> season<00:05:37.940> but<00:05:38.120> they<00:05:38.330> tend

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
colder late in the season but they tend
