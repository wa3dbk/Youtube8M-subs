00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
the whole high street is probably not

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.840 
the whole high street is probably not
rosy<00:00:19.380> at<00:00:19.470> all<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:19.950> think<00:00:19.980> historically<00:00:20.640> the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
rosy at all and I think historically the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.580 
rosy at all and I think historically the
high<00:00:21.000> street<00:00:21.330> was<00:00:21.450> both<00:00:21.660> for<00:00:22.020> destination

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
high street was both for destination

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.170 
high street was both for destination
shopping<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.100> also<00:00:23.340> for<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> distribution<00:00:24.060> of

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
shopping and also for a distribution of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.880 
shopping and also for a distribution of
goods<00:00:24.360> and<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.050> think<00:00:25.200> the<00:00:25.260> distribution<00:00:25.830> of

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
goods and I think the distribution of

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.740 
goods and I think the distribution of
goods<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.250> moving<00:00:26.550> online<00:00:26.700> and<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.540> think

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
goods is moving online and I think

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.179 
goods is moving online and I think
you'll<00:00:27.840> still<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.230> locations<00:00:28.800> like<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.100> know
