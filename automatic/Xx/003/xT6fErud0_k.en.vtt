00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
I really don't use watches so I wanted

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.920 
I really don't use watches so I wanted
to<00:00:26.460> see<00:00:26.609> if<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.820> liked<00:00:27.090> even<00:00:27.240> having<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.720> watch

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930

to see if I liked even having a watch
which<00:00:28.740> actually<00:00:28.980> surprisingly<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.910> did<00:00:30.179> for<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
which actually surprisingly I did for a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.569 
which actually surprisingly I did for a
while<00:00:30.539> or<00:00:30.900> still<00:00:31.650> do<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.009> I'm<00:00:32.130> still<00:00:32.399> putting

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
while or still do and I'm still putting

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.549 
while or still do and I'm still putting
it<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:32.910> every<00:00:33.180> day<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.420> that's<00:00:33.809> that's<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.350> good

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
it on every day so that's that's a good

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.110 
it on every day so that's that's a good
sign<00:00:34.800> but<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.489> wanted<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:35.910> if<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.090> actually

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
sign but I wanted to see if it actually

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.940 
sign but I wanted to see if it actually
added<00:00:36.809> value<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.410> could<00:00:37.620> give<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.890> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
a nice heft to it isn't too heavy but

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.969 
a nice heft to it isn't too heavy but
maybe<00:01:35.310> too<00:01:35.610> large<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:35.970> some<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.200> sides<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
maybe too large for some on the sides it

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.980 
maybe too large for some on the sides it
looks<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> normal<00:01:38.759> watch<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.509> one<00:01:39.750> side

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.370 
I've had to actually reset it hard reset
it<00:05:09.430> once<00:05:09.700> which<00:05:10.060> is<00:05:10.210> weird<00:05:10.510> with<00:05:10.780> a<00:05:10.810> watch<00:05:11.080> and

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
it once which is weird with a watch and

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.830 
it once which is weird with a watch and
sometimes<00:05:12.010> it's<00:05:12.460> slow<00:05:12.730> to<00:05:12.940> respond<00:05:13.510> when<00:05:13.750> you

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
sometimes it's slow to respond when you

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.510 
sometimes it's slow to respond when you
wristlet<00:05:14.380> raise<00:05:14.590> it<00:05:14.740> from<00:05:14.830> your<00:05:15.010> wrist<00:05:15.220> so<00:05:15.460> you

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
wristlet raise it from your wrist so you

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.970 
wristlet raise it from your wrist so you
raise<00:05:15.820> it<00:05:15.850> up<00:05:16.120> it<00:05:16.720> doesn't<00:05:17.140> turn<00:05:17.290> on<00:05:17.350> that's

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
raise it up it doesn't turn on that's

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.250 
raise it up it doesn't turn on that's
pretty<00:05:18.340> frustrating<00:05:19.210> and<00:05:19.480> definitely

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
pretty frustrating and definitely

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.290 
pretty frustrating and definitely
something<00:05:20.860> that<00:05:20.890> needs<00:05:21.520> to<00:05:21.670> be<00:05:21.790> fixed<00:05:22.030> in<00:05:22.210> the

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
something that needs to be fixed in the

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.540 
something that needs to be fixed in the
future<00:05:22.660> Android<00:05:23.380> wear<00:05:23.650> is<00:05:23.680> going<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.430> get

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
future Android wear is going to get

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.000 
future Android wear is going to get
better<00:05:24.790> and<00:05:25.150> better<00:05:25.390> as<00:05:25.690> Google<00:05:26.350> updates<00:05:26.560> it

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
better and better as Google updates it

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.950 
better and better as Google updates it
over<00:05:27.310> time<00:05:27.580> it's<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.270> pretty<00:05:28.450> standard

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
over time it's a pretty standard

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.650 
over time it's a pretty standard
platform<00:05:29.310> but<00:05:30.310> they<00:05:30.430> do<00:05:30.490> keep<00:05:30.820> updating<00:05:31.420> it<00:05:31.540> on

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
platform but they do keep updating it on

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.600 
platform but they do keep updating it on
all<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:31.930> different<00:05:32.170> devices<00:05:32.680> and<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.460> Moto

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
all the different devices and the Moto

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.120 
all the different devices and the Moto

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
360 is just the first of the really good

devices in my opinion I really wanted a

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.720 
devices in my opinion I really wanted a
good<00:05:38.110> base<00:05:38.350> mark<00:05:38.650> to<00:05:38.800> compare<00:05:39.160> it<00:05:39.250> with<00:05:39.310> apples

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
good base mark to compare it with apples

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.730 
good base mark to compare it with apples
watch<00:05:40.180> and<00:05:40.450> whatever<00:05:40.720> might<00:05:41.020> come<00:05:41.050> out<00:05:41.410> in<00:05:41.620> the
