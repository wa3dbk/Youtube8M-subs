finger we kept it so very flexible but

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.520 
finger we kept it so very flexible but
still<00:01:15.530> having<00:01:15.890> some<00:01:16.509> non<00:01:17.509> slip<00:01:17.810> existence<00:01:18.409> on

still having some non slip existence on

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.940 
still having some non slip existence on
it<00:01:18.679> you<00:01:19.670> don't<00:01:19.819> even<00:01:19.850> feel<00:01:20.469> the<00:01:21.469> glove<00:01:21.710> comes

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
it you don't even feel the glove comes

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.830 
it you don't even feel the glove comes
in<00:01:22.100> three<00:01:22.549> colorways<00:01:22.850> it<00:01:23.179> comes<00:01:23.359> in<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:23.569> tan

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
in three colorways it comes in the tan

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.709 
in three colorways it comes in the tan
also<00:01:24.679> a<00:01:24.920> black<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.850> then<00:01:25.969> we<00:01:26.060> have<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.240> foliage

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
also a black and then we have a foliage

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.120 
also a black and then we have a foliage
that<00:01:26.750> we're<00:01:27.200> in<00:01:27.319> development<00:01:27.439> on<00:01:27.829> right<00:01:27.979> now

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
that we're in development on right now

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.910 
that we're in development on right now
and<00:01:28.429> so<00:01:28.850> this<00:01:29.079> essentially<00:01:30.079> is<00:01:30.289> also<00:01:30.500> an<00:01:30.590> ideal

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
and so this essentially is also an ideal

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.350 
and so this essentially is also an ideal
tactical<00:01:31.459> shooting<00:01:31.640> glove<00:01:31.819> without<00:01:32.060> having

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
to remove a part of the index finger or

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.399 
to remove a part of the index finger or
whatever<00:01:34.579> yeah<00:01:35.149> this<00:01:35.329> fits<00:01:35.569> like<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.899> fits

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
whatever yeah this fits like it fits

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.289 
whatever yeah this fits like it fits
