00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.910 
lot of shops overlook and that is
vacuuming<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.060> system<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:10.259> see<00:02:10.470> when<00:02:10.739> you're

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
vacuuming the system you see when you're

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.650 
vacuuming the system you see when you're
working<00:02:11.370> on

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
working on

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.320 
working on
system<00:02:12.110> air<00:02:12.350> gets<00:02:12.860> into<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.400> we<00:02:13.820> have<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.150> get

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
system air gets into it we have to get

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.540 
system air gets into it we have to get
that<00:02:14.540> air<00:02:14.870> out<00:02:14.900> but<00:02:15.410> more<00:02:15.650> importantly<00:02:16.340> the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
that air out but more importantly the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.110 
that air out but more importantly the
air<00:02:16.730> has<00:02:17.140> moisture<00:02:18.140> in<00:02:18.320> it<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:19.190> we<00:02:19.670> do<00:02:19.850> two

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
air has moisture in it so we do two

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.950 
air has moisture in it so we do two
things<00:02:20.350> with<00:02:21.350> this<00:02:22.100> vacuum<00:02:22.970> pump<00:02:23.270> number<00:02:23.750> one

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
things with this vacuum pump number one

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.410 
things with this vacuum pump number one
we<00:02:24.590> pull<00:02:24.860> all<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.310> air<00:02:25.490> out<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.030> but<00:02:26.240> number

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
we pull all the air out of it but number

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.010 
we pull all the air out of it but number
two<00:02:26.810> we<00:02:27.320> drop<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.070> pressure<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:29.180> as<00:02:29.540> we<00:02:29.720> drop

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
two we drop the pressure and as we drop

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.830 
two we drop the pressure and as we drop
the<00:02:30.290> pressure<00:02:30.530> inside<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.460> system<00:02:31.880> any<00:02:32.180> water

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
the pressure inside the system any water

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.900 
the pressure inside the system any water
that's<00:02:33.230> in<00:02:33.440> there<00:02:33.680> boils<00:02:34.370> at<00:02:34.640> room

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
that's in there boils at room

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.620 
that's in there boils at room
temperature<00:02:35.570> turns<00:02:36.230> into<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.710> vapor<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.880> the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
temperature turns into a vapor and the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.950 
temperature turns into a vapor and the
vacuum<00:02:39.110> pump<00:02:39.320> pulls<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:40.340> out<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:41.690> will

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
vacuum pump pulls it out this will

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.170 
vacuum pump pulls it out this will
protect<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.530> new<00:02:42.800> parts<00:02:43.250> in<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.760> system

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
protect the new parts in the system

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.530 
protect the new parts in the system
often<00:02:44.750> on<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.290> humid<00:02:46.010> day<00:02:46.040> you'll<00:02:46.910> have<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.180> pull

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
often on a humid day you'll have to pull

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.370 
often on a humid day you'll have to pull
a<00:02:47.570> vacuum<00:02:47.870> on<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.470> system<00:02:48.920> for<00:02:49.370> three<00:02:49.730> or<00:02:50.000> four

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
a vacuum on the system for three or four

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.710 
a vacuum on the system for three or four
hours<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:52.250> make<00:02:52.520> sure<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:53.030> shop<00:02:53.270> that<00:02:53.300> you

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
hours so make sure the shop that you

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.890 
hours so make sure the shop that you
select<00:02:54.230> does<00:02:55.010> all<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.490> these<00:02:56.120> things<00:02:56.180> and

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
select does all of these things and

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.920 
select does all of these things and
you'll<00:02:57.320> have<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> good<00:02:57.950> cold<00:02:58.700> air<00:02:59.090> conditioning

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
you'll have a good cold air conditioning

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.190 
you'll have a good cold air conditioning
system<00:03:00.440> that<00:03:00.800> will<00:03:00.980> last<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.580> long<00:03:01.880> time<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.780> if

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
system that will last a long time and if

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.470 
system that will last a long time and if
