 tasty thing we need 200 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.289
 milliliters of hot water exactly hot 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:21.260
 and about half a teaspoon of salt 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:29.720
 add all this or lower 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:33.510
 and pour it into the pot so on now 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:38.750
 we will add flour we will add flour and 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.790
 knead the dough and everything is simple 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.899
 gave you how to knead the dough and show 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.950
 what I did and we will bake 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.530
 u mishon and now we give this dough 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.980
 he will insist on an hour and we will roll our 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.980
 cakes so well that will eat it infused 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.850
 I understood I gave him little flour 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:27.830
 nothing goes go go now we are with 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.830
 you will make such small pieces 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.530
 now we will experience them altogether 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.570
 if you want to make small pita 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.860
 twisted they need to be initially divided into 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:57.350
 pieces of large dough in the shape of a valid 1 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.149
 stages for example for the sake of one egg and 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.190
 principle can be removed for help and 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.680
 take place will not need to roll out 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.680
 although no though no dough turned out 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.680
 not bad 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:26.900
 roll out well our dough so i 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.900
 of course it did everything unprofessional 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.530
 if you learn to juggle 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:45.329
 these babies will of course be super 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:51.180
 it would make very thin pita bread 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:53.660
 thin pita og so well that's all pita 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.579
 ready turned on envy maturity 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:02.180
 about one and a half two millimeters thickness 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.180
 somewhere and need 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.340
 so we all understand he decided to do something like this 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.250
 all here we have turned out old 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.780
 pita so that I will weigh us 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:28.070

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.560
 roll like on a ride yet here such 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.830
 we will bake three pieces 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.780
 so we all oven we warmed up with you 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.720

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.020

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.220
 bubbling so principle it will be possible 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:07.670

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.060
 15-20 is enough 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.729
 all I just took out immediately take 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:24.050

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:30.979
