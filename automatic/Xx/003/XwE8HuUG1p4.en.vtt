I decide you have your horns high beam
low<00:03:42.750> beam<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.319> turning<00:03:44.250> signal<00:03:45.379> sounds

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.250 

so<00:03:58.880> right<00:03:59.120> off<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.270> bat<00:03:59.510> I'm<00:03:59.690> looking<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.080> get

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
so right off the bat I'm looking to get

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.090 
so right off the bat I'm looking to get
a<00:04:00.500> new<00:04:02.560> wind<00:04:03.560> deflector<00:04:04.010> here<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:06.100> hopefully

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
a new wind deflector here and hopefully

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.390 
a new wind deflector here and hopefully
in<00:04:07.640> a<00:04:07.730> couple<00:04:07.760> of<00:04:08.060> months<00:04:08.360> a<00:04:08.860> slip-on<00:04:09.860> pipe<00:04:10.160> to

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
in a couple of months a slip-on pipe to

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.180 
in a couple of months a slip-on pipe to
make<00:04:10.520> a<00:04:10.580> little<00:04:10.700> more<00:04:10.910> noise<00:04:11.800> so<00:04:12.800> that<00:04:12.950> is<00:04:13.069> all

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
make a little more noise so that is all

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.780 
make a little more noise so that is all
