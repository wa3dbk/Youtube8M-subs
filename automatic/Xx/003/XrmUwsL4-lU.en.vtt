one of those games where you need a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.270 
one of those games where you need a
little<00:00:50.820> bit<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.030> look<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.379> for<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.800> know

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280

little bit of look to go for you know
it's<00:00:53.399> not<00:00:53.520> about<00:00:53.789> lock<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.539> about<00:00:54.890> creativity

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
it's not about lock is about creativity

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.930 
it's not about lock is about creativity
about<00:00:56.610> both<00:00:57.210> movement<00:00:58.399> at<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.460> moment<00:00:59.820> is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
about both movement at the moment is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.849 
about both movement at the moment is
there<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> little<00:01:01.109> bit<00:01:01.230> difficult<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
there is a little bit difficult and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
there is a little bit difficult and
that's<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.670> are<00:01:02.760> lacking<00:01:03.080> but<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
that's what we are lacking but the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.700 
that's what we are lacking but the
second<00:01:04.739> half<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.369> general<00:01:06.110> was<00:01:07.110> much<00:01:07.500> better

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
second half in general was much better

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.320 
second half in general was much better
than<00:01:07.979> what<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.369> did<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> first<00:01:08.939> half<00:01:09.119> in

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
than what we did in the first half in

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.810 
than what we did in the first half in
first<00:01:09.750> half<00:01:09.869> we<00:01:10.020> were<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.560> there<00:01:10.830> second

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
first half we were just not there second

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.880 
first half we were just not there second
half<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.119> try<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> push<00:01:12.689> which<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.530> had<00:01:13.650> some

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
half we try to push which I we had some

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.780 
half we try to push which I we had some
chances<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.790> think<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:16.020> should<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.790> penalty

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
chances I think we should have a penalty

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.749 
chances I think we should have a penalty
at<00:01:17.880> least<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:19.229> was<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.710> was<00:01:20.130> better<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.430> lot<00:01:20.610> of

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
at least so was it was better a lot of

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.609 
at least so was it was better a lot of
improvement<00:01:21.360> which<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.689> should<00:01:22.020> play<00:01:22.200> forward

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
improvement which I should play forward

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.380 
improvement which I should play forward
the<00:01:23.580> way<00:01:23.759> we<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.420> used<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.750> play<00:01:25.369> it's<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.640> it's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the way we we used to play it's a it's

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.870 
the way we we used to play it's a it's
better<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:27.900> not<00:01:27.960> enough<00:01:28.259> yet<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.700> said

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880
