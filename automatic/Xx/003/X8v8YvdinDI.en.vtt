more<00:06:14.070> than<00:06:14.220> 200<00:06:14.729> cows<00:06:14.940> up<00:06:15.690> here

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
more than 200 cows up here

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.000 
more than 200 cows up here
and<00:06:17.720> this<00:06:18.720> is<00:06:18.870> for<00:06:19.050> the<00:06:19.169> drinking<00:06:19.530> of<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:19.680> cows

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
and this is for the drinking of the cows

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.719 
and this is for the drinking of the cows
and<00:06:20.370> this<00:06:21.210> really<00:06:21.690> helps<00:06:22.310> the<00:06:23.310> increase<00:06:23.699> of

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
and this really helps the increase of

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.350 
and this really helps the increase of
local<00:06:24.419> meat<00:06:24.840> production

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360
