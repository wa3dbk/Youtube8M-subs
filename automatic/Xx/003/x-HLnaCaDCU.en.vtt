00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.070
 palette and if you can really make people happy 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:40.440

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.359
 for young talent 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.819
 I have been in this school for three years now 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.100
 I like it very much I want to 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:59.559
 become a dancer because it seems fun to me 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.449
 to inspire other people to it 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.760
 apparently you also like to go 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.570
 to a country other than other 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.340
 dancing can't sit still and like me then 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.560
 for example see on stage on it 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.780
 participate immediately 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.310
 why I know that now 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.980
 well you can show how you feel 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.750
 foot on stage you can do all kinds of 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.060
 emotions palace 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.740
 Re really put in so people do too 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.470
 6 angry or or is happy 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.430
 when I was 4 years old, my mind was over me 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.170
 girl each was at this school and yes then 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.000
 I have been there a core lesson from it 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.229
 dutch dance theater and that gave the 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.030
 breakthrough 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.770
 I think I still need one 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.170
 real ballerina tour the many lessons 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.240
 from my technique that it gets better and better 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.030
 that you get other passes 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.580
 and also if you want to go to another company 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.820
 that you can also do that bunch like we do 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.209
 there would be no limits then I would 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.789
 as much as possible and travel as much as possible 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:04.789
 company and schools to visit there 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.039
 to dance and do ambitions how they do 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.229
 learn how that discipline is there 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.850
 see if that differs 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.239
 and the different ones everywhere 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.239
 dance styles and learn to feel and all 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.430
 expression and yes learn a lot from that 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.310
 and then much better I come back 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.709
 actually and then see what which then 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.459
 imagine and experts feel the most 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.459
 has spoken to 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.209
 i am sam meijer i am 13 years old 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.130
 this is my fourth year at the 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.450
 dance training and I am very sorry 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.549
 to my liking 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.829
 I was at an old ballet school I did 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.900
 just lessons and then my teacher said 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.579
 He had heard that there were auditions 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.630
 for the nutcracker of the dutch don't 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.160
 dance division 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.829
 then I was through and then I was allowed to come 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.780
 dance in production and well during 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.850
 the rehearsals are my mother of one 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.769
 other mom that is here on it 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.530
 royal conservatory and boys 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.579
 dance day was well there i have to do 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.680
 for specified 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.230
 and actually when I building 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.530
 then I already knew that this would be it 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.800
 be that i will be home here 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.870
 well if i get applause then that gives 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.680
 a kick and also get the feeling that i am 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.780
 did it well 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.880
 what people respect what I have done 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.980
 that they understand that I am just quite there 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.750
 worked hard for it and so did it 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.790
 took a lot of effort but that 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.680
 I just put it down 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.050
 I think my specialty is that 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.690
 I from a lot of teacher tower 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.780
 my dance feeling that i am a very good one 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.220
 appearance on the stage and that 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.220
 the teacher is also very appealing 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.630
 I am a different scent and in 15 years 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.430
 your since the first actually wanted 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.290
 I, as a 4-year-old, really wanted to get up 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.890
 a sport i wanted to move i wanted something 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.959
 and then I am my mother 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.209
 taken to gymnastics and a palette 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.280
 lesson and yes then I had a trial lesson 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.510
 khaled done and then I actually knew 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.239
 immediately that I wanted to do that 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.709
 I liked it so much and then I am 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.750
 actually the older I got , I am 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.120
 more and more dance that eventually 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.639
 four days a week and went very often 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.959
 to performances and yes as a result 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.350
 I just love it 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.210
 it became if you got it and loved it 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.700
 of course, have many departments and 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.290
 aline and tension in your body because you 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.210
 wants to do it well anyway and 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.330
 show people and if you do 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.090
 once the stage stands and it goes 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.740
 good and you're all in the dance so 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.180
 something special with you that is too 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.180
 really just can't explain 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:51.739
 if I get the chance during my 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:53.539
 study and internships 

00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:56.589
 I love that at the world of tennis 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.589
 want to do in denmark 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:03.649
 they have a lot more classic there 

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:06.110
 palette and they also have whole 

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:09.080
 a lot of work balance and finds that to be 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.330
 both two styles actually affect me 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.089
 very appealing 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.929
 well i would also go to the grandfather of paris 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:20.419

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:23.360
 also a very good coincidence and it is acidic 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.309
 walet in ever had switzerland 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.080
 everywhere but its classically and classic 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:29.080
 modern we go on places 

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:34.789

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:38.300

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.919
 seat belt 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.129
 i'm dancing half way from my fourth but i 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:49.939
 was very busy and then I finished 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:53.089
 jazz ballet and when I was seven 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:54.319
 take started dancing ballet i know 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:55.390
 very good to my parents too 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:59.530
 are from 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:02.310
 I want to hear dancing and I want to go to that 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.199
 special school where possible 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.759
 dancing is for me 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.800
 I prefer to describe it as kind of 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.850
 pure love or something quick to be whole 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:16.419
 floaty but it feels yes it feels 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:18.340
 just it should be and it is good that 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.340
 I own is always very trying 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:25.120
 sharpness and look to take the right 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:27.130
 of Paris soprano and prorail gray 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.250
 but also that lyrical and the real 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.180
 tell the story of the russian 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.009
 ballet 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.320
 hey i hear that i say so 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:37.990
 stands out on the as I stand on a stage 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.949
 that my appearance 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.949
 is very evident 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.880
 I think I would still be a private lesson 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.160
 want from someone you really experience 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.790
 has in this world 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.490
 everything is there too 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.740
 yes not normal actually she is so good 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.710
 in all classic pieces it is 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.720
 incredibly limber and she dances all that way 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.720
 nice so if you go in there naturally 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.970
 could get lathur would be great 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.120
 you can take lessons from very good ones 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:17.730
 teachers and with all who know that 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.190
 I think I have experiences there too 

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.020
 can go very far and that yes too 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.930
 just very much cooperates and that dream 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.780
 trailer blessing to species then you become 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:30.230
 not really have to really love it otherwise 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.230
 then it will not work
