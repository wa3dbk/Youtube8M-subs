00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
potatoes almost start breaking down we

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.170 
potatoes almost start breaking down we
really<00:03:56.980> wanted<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:57.370> create<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.670> Indian

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
really wanted to create that Indian

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.150 
really wanted to create that Indian
texture<00:03:58.630> which<00:03:58.780> is<00:03:58.810> sort<00:03:59.140> of<00:03:59.200> more<00:03:59.470> mushy<00:03:59.770> and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
texture which is sort of more mushy and

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.190 
texture which is sort of more mushy and
less<00:04:00.940> firm<00:04:02.910> so<00:04:03.910> we're<00:04:04.540> gonna<00:04:04.630> add<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.990> green

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
less firm so we're gonna add the green

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.770 
less firm so we're gonna add the green
beans<00:04:05.230> in<00:04:05.709> since<00:04:06.520> everything<00:04:06.940> else<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.480> so

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
beans in since everything else is so

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.290 
beans in since everything else is so
texturally<00:04:08.680> similar<00:04:09.160> I'm<00:04:09.700> actually<00:04:09.880> just

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300
