I'm trying to say instead of like
wasting<00:01:28.520> money<00:01:28.670> on<00:01:28.790> stuff<00:01:29.060> like<00:01:29.270> that<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:29.540> can

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
wasting money on stuff like that you can

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.750 
wasting money on stuff like that you can
just<00:01:29.810> make<00:01:29.930> up<00:01:29.960> with<00:01:30.350> two<00:01:30.650> things<00:01:30.680> that<00:01:31.310> you

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
just make up with two things that you

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.540 
just make up with two things that you
most<00:01:31.940> likely<00:01:32.180> already<00:01:32.480> have<00:01:32.690> at<00:01:33.140> home<00:01:33.550> you'll

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
most likely already have at home you'll

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.390 
most likely already have at home you'll
find<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:34.910> with<00:01:35.180> this<00:01:35.390> formula<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:36.560> just<00:01:37.190> used

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
find that with this formula I just used

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.100 
find that with this formula I just used
two<00:01:37.610> ingredients<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.630> now<00:01:38.720> I<00:01:38.780> just<00:01:38.960> don't

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
two ingredients and now I just don't

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
lino that these are not the end-all

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.000 
lino that these are not the end-all
be-all<00:01:40.930> ingredients<00:01:41.930> there<00:01:42.410> are<00:01:42.470> people<00:01:42.860> who

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
be-all ingredients there are people who

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.030 
the crown directly into the pot is
because<00:04:12.849> the<00:04:13.359> crown<00:04:13.599> burns<00:04:13.959> very<00:04:14.170> easily<00:04:14.319> so

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
because the crown burns very easily so

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.120 
because the crown burns very easily so
this<00:04:15.250> kind<00:04:15.459> of<00:04:15.489> helps<00:04:15.849> to<00:04:16.500> warm<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.620> up<00:04:17.709> slowly

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
this kind of helps to warm it up slowly

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.660 
this kind of helps to warm it up slowly
and<00:04:19.320> less<00:04:20.320> severely

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.360 

takes<00:04:25.670> about<00:04:25.820> 30<00:04:26.540> seconds<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.710> minute<00:04:27.740> for

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
takes about 30 seconds to a minute for

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.950 
takes about 30 seconds to a minute for
the<00:04:28.550> crown<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:29.030> melt<00:04:29.240> so<00:04:29.420> it<00:04:29.480> really<00:04:29.690> doesn't

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
the crown to melt so it really doesn't

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:42.340 
the crown to melt so it really doesn't
take<00:04:29.990> very<00:04:30.260> long<00:04:30.440> at<00:04:30.620> all

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.159
