00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
I've noticed is people with athletic

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.310 
I've noticed is people with athletic
backgrounds<00:00:41.239> usually<00:00:42.239> kick<00:00:42.600> butt<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
backgrounds usually kick butt in the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.279 
backgrounds usually kick butt in the
real<00:00:43.500> world<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:45.300> when<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> think<00:00:45.660> about<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
real world and when I think about the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
reason why I think it's obvious I think

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.189

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
college they get to experience things

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.189

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
regionals to go to state and it's down

regionals to go to state and it's down
to<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.790> last<00:02:06.030> minute<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:06.780> time

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
to the last minute and it's time

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.950 
to the last minute and it's time
everyone<00:02:08.040> is<00:02:08.070> feels<00:02:08.430> like<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.790> is<00:02:08.940> as<00:02:09.240> much

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
anyone else we've put in the work let's

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.540 
anyone else we've put in the work let's
enjoy<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:27.410> we<00:02:28.410> might<00:02:28.680> lose<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.250> we<00:02:29.340> might

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
enjoy this we might lose and we might

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.820 
enjoy this we might lose and we might
win<00:02:29.790> but<00:02:30.150> let's<00:02:30.510> go<00:02:30.720> for<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.350> let<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.530> rip

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
win but let's go for it and let it rip

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.700 
win but let's go for it and let it rip
right<00:02:32.100> now<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:33.420> what<00:02:33.570> if<00:02:33.690> she<00:02:33.810> smiled<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.410> even

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
right now and what if she smiled I even

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.340 
right now and what if she smiled I even
said<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.450> now<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.630> makes<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.930> feel<00:02:37.110> pretty

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
said that now it makes you feel pretty

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.670 
said that now it makes you feel pretty
good

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
good

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.850 
good
and<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.640> think<00:02:38.700> if<00:02:39.210> someone<00:02:39.960> said<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.590> you

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
and I think if someone said that to you

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.040 
and I think if someone said that to you
you<00:02:41.460> would<00:02:41.610> be<00:02:41.760> more<00:02:42.030> likely<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.480> rise<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.960> the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
you would be more likely to rise to the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.990 
you would be more likely to rise to the
occasion<00:02:43.350> then<00:02:44.010> if<00:02:44.160> someone<00:02:44.430> got<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:44.940> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
occasion then if someone got you in the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.120 
occasion then if someone got you in the
middle<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.540> they're<00:02:45.780> going<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.110> just<00:02:46.800> throw

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
middle and they're going to just throw

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.120 
middle and they're going to just throw
it<00:02:47.460> throw<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.150> our<00:02:48.330> tune<00:02:48.570> just<00:02:49.080> like<00:02:49.800> people

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
it throw it to our tune just like people

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.870 
it throw it to our tune just like people
just<00:02:50.459> get<00:02:50.670> there<00:02:50.910> right<00:02:51.290> people<00:02:52.290> get<00:02:52.530> there

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
just get there right people get there

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.550 
just get there right people get there
but<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.030> can<00:02:54.209> override<00:02:54.600> those<00:02:54.959> thoughts<00:02:55.320> by
