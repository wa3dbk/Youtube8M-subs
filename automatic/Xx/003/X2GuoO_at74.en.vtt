00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 hello everyone i'm advertising and now we 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.719
 make a little cooler cooler reviewer 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.809
 master 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:15.960
 t4 pretty good cooler which 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:22.939
 I recently received a sale took it 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:31.790
 for amd fx 8350 processor here 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:38.809
 Supported , 120 millimeters to 4 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:47.840
 so the box looks like it is written behind 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:53.449
 sizes are all here here you can see up to 150 2 and 3 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:59.070
 here the flight to the radiator is 37 millimeters 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.550
 that's 35 millimeters wide 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.969
 not bad 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.760
 and tea for tea on of course so well 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.180
 let's do so small 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:21.450
 I will try to do all the same 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:26.369
 hand and take out so that's left 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:31.310
 slightly deploy that's actually and 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:35.460
 us schouler now we get it 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.939
 so here nakleechka bad of course 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.430
 keeps this nakleechka strictly speaking 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:45.270
 somehow not very well could like 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.380
 to wrap it so that it is not selected so 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:53.720
 but that's standard plug 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.920
 up to 120 millimeters cooler master 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.329
 I want to say the quality pretty 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.680
 good radiator pretty good 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.520
 i.e 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.620
 normal dimensions for 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.420
 standard gaming case of course 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.250
 because 152 millimeters 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:17.390
 this is a maximum height of 152 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.020
 you need of course you need to come and 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.240
 you need of course before you buy 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.140
 check if opportunity 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.420
 here in the case to put such a cooler cpu 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.760
 before the radiator so here's the forest because 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.310
 you can buy and have to take 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.530
 because he does not look and everything is here 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.380
 of course my extreme case is extreme 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.209
 case can be a little file but it 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.570
 already sort of hack-work would be perfect 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.530
 right and immediately review 10 times to 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:53.130
 know again I will show you the sizes 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.160
 so you just know for yourself here 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.790
 everything is written that is height is all up 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.510
 every little points 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.150
 width is 72 and 5 millimeter here is the way out 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.630
 37 millimeters width 35 millimeters and 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.260
 height of course again 152 and 3 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:18.959
 millimeter good cooler good cooler 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:25.370
 This is more than with newer models I remember 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:26.970
 t 3-5 by ut3 kind of like but this one came out for 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.070
 n 3 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.239
 the juices that is for the latter already 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:36.060
 processors and I thought for 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.489
 processor amd fx 8350 this cooler will 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.500
 what he needs here so thanks 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.500
 guys for watching new meetings
