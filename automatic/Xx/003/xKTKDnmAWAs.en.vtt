00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
all the way down to my knees and I'll

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.120 
all the way down to my knees and I'll
zoom<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.570> camera<00:01:35.600> out<00:01:36.110> in<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.470> minute

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
zoom the camera out in a minute

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.900 
zoom the camera out in a minute
and<00:01:37.510> I<00:01:38.510> wrap<00:01:39.050> with<00:01:39.560> saran<00:01:40.220> wrap

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
and I wrap with saran wrap

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.750 
and I wrap with saran wrap
so<00:01:41.210> I<00:01:41.480> buy<00:01:41.780> my<00:01:42.080> saran<00:01:42.470> wrap<00:01:42.770> from<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.190> dollar

so I buy my saran wrap from the dollar

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.430 
so I buy my saran wrap from the dollar
store<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:45.040> it's<00:01:46.040> only<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.910> hundred<00:01:47.510> yards<00:01:48.140> at

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.590 
store and it's only a hundred yards at
the<00:01:48.650> dollar<00:01:48.890> store<00:01:49.070> so<00:01:49.730> it's<00:01:49.970> not<00:01:50.150> you<00:01:50.390> can

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600
