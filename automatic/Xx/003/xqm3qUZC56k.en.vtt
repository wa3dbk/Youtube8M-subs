00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.230
 morace park welcome your new team and we are 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.649
 today we are going to see how we have to chance our 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:13.339
 keyboard 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:15.599
 bluetooth 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.230
 our to the ducks remember that the pallet 2 0 allows to use the keyboard 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.920
 with everything 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.289
 why are we going kate are we going to have to use 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.659
 keyboard 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.060
 plutus 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.499
 the agreement 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:31.470
 to 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.640
 use a physical keyboard I continued stroh 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.450
 The first thing we do is place the rows on our keyboard 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.690
 understand it 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.530
 we go 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.600
 now settings 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.100
 generate 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.900
 we activate the bluetooth option 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.240
 We hope that in our country part of the different devices 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.240
 available 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.270
 we observe k it seems the unbounded keyboard option 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.700
 observe 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.350
 so 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.730
 we will proceed 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.190
 random 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.970
 our keyboard by clicking 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.970
 it does not link 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.030
 a message appears 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.260
 that shows us the pin 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.070
 needed to link our keyboard 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.450
 with our haifa we can observe 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.280
 let's enter the pin 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.280
 we introduce it on the keyboard 4 1 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.970
 0 and we ended up clicking 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.380
 immediately 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.700
 the keyboard will be linked appears as connected well we can already use 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.700
 our keyboard we are going to perform a test 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.540
 we come back 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.000
 Example write a note 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.590
 we make a new note 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.609
 we catch showed keyboard 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.429
 in agreement 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.999
 to write we will observe that it appears already in screen 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:28.119
 if we use the bluetooth keyboard we will be able to 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.249
 shout the keys 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.779
 of advance playback playback volume 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:38.289
 we will be able to use the brightness control keys 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.409
 for yes also control 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.129
 our to her 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.629
 so we can 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.109
 control the volume as you can observe 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.009
 we can 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:53.789
 handle the million from our keyboard 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:55.759
 brutus 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.619
 and we can also control 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:01.259
 reproduction 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.259
 move along 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.889
 back 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.139
 and pause 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.300
 as you can see 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.050
 offer a sufficient point of advantage for bluetooth in the case of using the 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.720
 apple bluetooth keyboard we are going to have many more since those accesses 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.410
 fast will be able to be fulfilled too 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.969
 with our and 11 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:30.969
 well this is all we see in a next pita
