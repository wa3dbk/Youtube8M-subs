00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
Pistons while buttons technically kind

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.940 
Pistons while buttons technically kind
of<00:00:20.640> included<00:00:21.000> redstone<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:22.110> know<00:00:22.230> like

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
of included redstone but you know like

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.729 
of included redstone but you know like
you<00:00:23.279> know<00:00:23.310> complicated<00:00:23.700> stuff<00:00:24.390> very<00:00:25.290> very

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:25.739 
you know complicated stuff very very

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.780 
you know complicated stuff very very
simple<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.489> easy<00:00:26.669> to<00:00:26.880> build<00:00:27.200> so<00:00:28.200> there<00:00:28.380> is

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
simple and easy to build so there is

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.859 
simple and easy to build so there is
very<00:00:29.790> small<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.419> probably<00:00:30.630> already

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
very small you can probably already

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.479 
very small you can probably already
figure<00:00:31.230> out<00:00:31.349> how<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.590> works<00:00:31.860> if<00:00:32.189> you've<00:00:32.340> got<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
figure out how it works if you've got a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.090 
figure out how it works if you've got a
good<00:00:32.640> eye<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:34.079> way<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.320> works<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.800> if<00:00:34.980> we

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
good eye so the way this works is if we

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.729 
good eye so the way this works is if we
stand<00:00:35.370> right<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:35.720> crouch<00:00:36.720> look<00:00:37.290> up<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.620> run

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
stand right here crouch look up to run

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.160 
stand right here crouch look up to run
ender<00:00:37.950> pearl<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.430> boom<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.629> are<00:00:39.750> teleported

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
ender pearl and boom we are teleported

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.349 
ender pearl and boom we are teleported
up<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> top<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.519> then<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.239> had

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:42.359 
up to the top and then if you had

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:43.729 
up to the top and then if you had
another<00:00:42.570> one<00:00:42.719> above<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.680> so

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
another one above this and so on and so

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.990 
another one above this and so on and so
forth<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.219> could<00:00:44.340> keep<00:00:44.460> going<00:00:44.760> up<00:00:44.820> through

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
forth you could keep going up through

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.410 
forth you could keep going up through
your<00:00:45.090> levels<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.280> that's<00:00:47.280> pretty<00:00:47.460> cool<00:00:47.730> so

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
your levels and that's pretty cool so

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.060 
your levels and that's pretty cool so
for<00:00:48.780> example<00:00:48.809> say<00:00:49.410> if<00:00:49.500> you're<00:00:49.679> at<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.829> top

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
for example say if you're at the top

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.189 
for example say if you're at the top
here<00:00:50.429> and<00:00:50.609> you<00:00:50.670> want<00:00:51.089> to<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.359> down<00:00:51.570> all<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.019> do

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
here and you want to get down all you do

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.470 
here and you want to get down all you do
is<00:00:52.469> fall<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.309> crouch<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.329> know

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
is fall and crouch and you know

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.209 
is fall and crouch and you know
sometimes<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.140> doesn't<00:00:55.350> work<00:00:55.379> because<00:00:55.769> then

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
sometimes it doesn't work because then

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.340 
sometimes it doesn't work because then
we'll<00:00:56.850> play<00:00:57.059> an<00:00:57.120> xbox<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.140> sometimes

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
we'll play an xbox here and it sometimes

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.040 
we'll play an xbox here and it sometimes
things<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.460> don't<00:00:59.640> go<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.969> plan<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.899> you

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
know most of the time it will work and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.610 
know most of the time it will work and
it<00:01:02.429> will<00:01:02.640> reset<00:01:03.120> your<00:01:03.239> fall<00:01:03.480> damage<00:01:03.839> so<00:01:04.559> you

tutorial alright so it amends by baby
what<00:01:48.660> you<00:01:48.750> want<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.620> first<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.160> all

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
what you want to do is first of all

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.700 
what you want to do is first of all
build<00:01:50.580> up<00:01:50.820> 30<00:01:51.240> blocks<00:01:51.660> from<00:01:52.170> your<00:01:52.410> ground

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
build up 30 blocks from your ground

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.710 
build up 30 blocks from your ground
level<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.490> your<00:01:53.610> grandmother's<00:01:54.090> me<00:01:54.300> where<00:01:54.510> you

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
level so your grandmother's me where you

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.480 
level so your grandmother's me where you
are<00:01:54.900> standing<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.710> throw<00:01:55.890> your<00:01:56.070> under<00:01:56.310> pearl

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
are standing to throw your under pearl

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.740 
are standing to throw your under pearl
so<00:01:57.150> you<00:01:57.210> want<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> build<00:01:57.570> up<00:01:57.780> 30<00:01:58.110> from<00:01:58.680> there

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.930 

so<00:02:04.320> once<00:02:04.560> you've<00:02:04.740> done<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.280> bad<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.730> see

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
so once you've done that it's bad to see

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.999 
so once you've done that it's bad to see
I<00:02:05.970> know<00:02:06.180> because<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.480> the<00:02:06.600> quartz<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.620> now

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
I know because of the quartz but now

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.680 
I know because of the quartz but now
this<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.460> level<00:02:08.910> where<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.179> want<00:02:09.539> to

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
this is the level where you want to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.660 
this is the level where you want to
place<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:10.200> string<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.250> I'm<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.460> place

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
place your string so I'm going to place

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.960 
place your string so I'm going to place
to<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.270> two<00:02:12.780> there<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.260> two<00:02:13.320> there<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.790> now

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
to that two there and two there so now

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.270 
to that two there and two there so now
we<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.330> take<00:02:15.570> away<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.230> layer<00:02:16.470> at<00:02:16.710> level<00:02:17.010> 30

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
we can take away the layer at level 30

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.310 
we can take away the layer at level 30
and<00:02:17.670> then<00:02:18.120> we<00:02:18.210> can<00:02:18.240> build<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.780> little<00:02:19.020> frame

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
and then we can build a little frame

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.000 
and then we can build a little frame
around<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:20.070> so<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:21.690> frame<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.290> going<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.860> be

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
around it so this frame is going to be

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.010 
around it so this frame is going to be
at<00:02:23.310> level<00:02:23.550> 29<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.720> trip<00:02:27.720> wire<00:02:27.870> is

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
at level 29 and the and the trip wire is

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.070 
at level 29 and the and the trip wire is
going<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.380> be<00:02:28.530> at<00:02:28.800> level<00:02:29.430> 30<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.690> now<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.840> need<00:02:31.050> to

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
going to be at level 30 so now I need to

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.880 
going to be at level 30 so now I need to
go<00:02:31.320> down<00:02:31.560> another<00:02:31.920> one<00:02:32.640> like<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:33.890> build

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
go down another one like this build

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.970 
go down another one like this build
little<00:02:35.100> frame<00:02:35.490> around<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.959> across<00:02:37.650> there

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
little frame around and across there

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.770 
little frame around and across there
come<00:02:38.670> under<00:02:38.940> here<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.420> want<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.600> place

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
come under here and you want to place

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.530 
come under here and you want to place
buttons<00:02:40.350> across<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.190> bottom<00:02:41.489> layer<00:02:41.880> on<00:02:42.209> both

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
buttons across the bottom layer on both

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.810 
buttons across the bottom layer on both
sides<00:02:42.930> by<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.800> way<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.310> be<00:02:44.459> expanded

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
sides by the way this can be expanded

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.660 
sides by the way this can be expanded
however<00:02:45.750> one<00:02:45.989> longview<00:02:46.470> one<00:02:46.680> as<00:02:47.220> long<00:02:47.459> as<00:02:47.580> it

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
however one longview one as long as it

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.390 
however one longview one as long as it
is<00:02:47.760> too<00:02:48.000> wide<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:48.739> now<00:02:49.739> what<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.070> need<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.250> do

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
is too wide so now what you need to do

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.600 
is too wide so now what you need to do
is<00:02:50.489> chuck<00:02:50.880> in<00:02:51.000> some<00:02:51.180> vines<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.610> and

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
is chuck in some vines like this and

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.880 
is chuck in some vines like this and
some<00:02:53.850> vines<00:02:54.090> there<00:02:54.390> if<00:02:54.989> you're<00:02:55.200> wondering<00:02:55.410> why

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
some vines there if you're wondering why

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.800 
some vines there if you're wondering why
we're<00:02:56.100> not<00:02:56.250> using<00:02:56.459> ladders<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:57.420> make<00:02:57.570> it

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
we're not using ladders to make it

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.770 
we're not using ladders to make it
easier<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.530> because<00:02:59.360> ladders<00:03:00.360> of<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> hitbox

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
easier is because ladders of a hitbox

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.350 
easier is because ladders of a hitbox
that<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.350> can<00:03:01.530> hit<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:01.950> actually<00:03:02.400> die<00:03:02.640> or<00:03:03.000> you

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
that you can hit and actually die or you

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.949 
that you can hit and actually die or you
know<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.570> kind<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.870> area<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:05.130> yeah<00:03:06.030> I'm<00:03:06.270> vines

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
know I kind of area so yeah I'm vines

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.270 
know I kind of area so yeah I'm vines
actually<00:03:07.320> don't<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.799> can<00:03:07.950> just<00:03:08.130> basically

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
actually don't you can just basically

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.490 
actually don't you can just basically
walk<00:03:08.640> through<00:03:09.030> them<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:09.959> is<00:03:10.200> why<00:03:10.350> we're

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
walk through them so that is why we're

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.740 
walk through them so that is why we're
using<00:03:10.650> them<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.640> now<00:03:11.850> if<00:03:12.060> we<00:03:12.209> go<00:03:12.239> down<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
using them so now if we go down to the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.150 
using them so now if we go down to the
bottom<00:03:12.930> we<00:03:13.260> grab<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.530> under<00:03:13.739> pillow<00:03:13.950> pretty

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
bottom we grab it under pillow pretty

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.670 
bottom we grab it under pillow pretty
quick<00:03:14.430> we<00:03:15.060> can<00:03:15.239> stand<00:03:15.510> right<00:03:15.780> here<00:03:15.810> stung<00:03:16.650> in

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
quick we can stand right here stung in

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.500 
quick we can stand right here stung in
the<00:03:16.799> center<00:03:17.340> make<00:03:17.640> sure<00:03:17.670> you're<00:03:17.940> crouched

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
the center make sure you're crouched

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.650 
the center make sure you're crouched
throw<00:03:19.110> an<00:03:19.200> ender<00:03:19.380> pearl<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.890> boom<00:03:20.820> you<00:03:21.299> are<00:03:21.330> at

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
throw an ender pearl and boom you are at

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.870 
throw an ender pearl and boom you are at
the<00:03:21.810> top<00:03:22.019> hovering<00:03:22.890> all<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.549> have<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.730> do<00:03:23.820> is

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
the top hovering all you have to do is

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.300 
the top hovering all you have to do is
walk<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.299> edge<00:03:24.420> on<00:03:24.750> crouch<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.650> there<00:03:26.190> you

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
walk to the edge on crouch and there you

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.729 
walk to the edge on crouch and there you
have<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.519> so<00:03:27.269> from<00:03:27.540> there<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:28.140> can<00:03:28.170> just<00:03:28.350> build

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
have it so from there you can just build

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.350 
have it so from there you can just build
as<00:03:28.890> many<00:03:29.010> as<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.370> want<00:03:29.640> if<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:29.880> want<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.239> get

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
as many as you want if you want to get

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.720 
as many as you want if you want to get
back<00:03:30.510> in<00:03:30.690> just<00:03:30.870> jump<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.320> crouch<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:32.519> then<00:03:32.640> you

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
back in just jump and crouch so then you

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.949 
back in just jump and crouch so then you
could<00:03:32.850> have<00:03:32.940> another<00:03:33.120> one<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:33.720> on<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.870> so

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959
