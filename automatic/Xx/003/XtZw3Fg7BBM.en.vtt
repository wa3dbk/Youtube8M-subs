00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello everyone today we will have a review 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:10.920
 two lenses canon 24 70 aperture 2 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.320
 And 8 and 12 405 I'm talking about q4 thank you very much 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.350
 guys if the photo in the hands that gave me 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.340
 These lenses for our review they have 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.500
 can be rented 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.300
 Let's start with 2 405 that way 20 405 in the previous one 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.580
 video review come out here I already said that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.980
 my camera is not full frame 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.770
 accordingly, I have this distance of 24 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.790
 105 cropping it will be a distance of 43 189 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.430
 I will explain further what will be here 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.930
 advantage in than minus and also from 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.950
 review will be convenient 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.140
 will be useful to those who, in principle 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.360
 a question about lenses with approximate 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.370
 focal lengths because 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.170
 Of course this region is better than the rest 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.699
 which are strings 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.379
 but nevertheless by this city and 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.480
 you can understand the difference between these 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.280
 distances and understand that such 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.430
 universal of this lens 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.810
 universal these two lenses on the very 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.730
 actually most beloved 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.560
 wedding lenses because they 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.340
 fully versatile and suitable for 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.530
 most situations so look 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.200
 so today we will say thank you my 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.680
 expensive 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.660
 girls who will 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.170
 patiently sit on a chair beautifully 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:24.250
 help us our video where we 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.560
 let's start now to show you 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.020
 what is the distance of our lenses like 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.080
 it affects our picture we will do 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.910
 three steps from a model of such averages three 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.390
 steps and at this distance check all 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.390
 distance 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.990
 three steps and so the first we check which 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.780
 we will have the smallest picture 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.310
 aperture here aperture then 4 and on 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.310
 distance 24 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.090
 and so this we have turned out 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.490
 picture you see what's on it 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.500
 the distance we have a very clear background 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.910
 turned on the background of the model now we 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.020
 move the distance to the farthest 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.020
 raider scene 105 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.410
 Agrafiya on the same three steps from models 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.960
 here you see how beautiful the difference is 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.940
 background and so you see there is in it 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.650
 universality of this lens on 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.120
 the farthest he can take 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.460
 the picture as a whole is you saw 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.380
 as far as my mace just fit in 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.630
 frame at the same distance at which 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.030
 I now stand at a distance of 100 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.580
 we can shoot an awesome portrait then 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.260
 there are 105 at 4 aperture perfectly 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.690
 beautifully walking around the background and 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.270
 let's do it we'll see how in 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.290
 aperture 4, we can shoot it in the floor rus 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.290
 for this we go far 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.780
 so you see I brought at a distance of 105 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.340
 moving away from the model far enough it 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.640
 so that I got it in full 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.430
 growth 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.200
 the background to pour out is not super soap but we are the faces 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.840
 more than he doesn't 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.000
 suffered from step 3 at a distance of 24 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.950
 personal conclusion about this lens I 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.860
 were both of these lenses my everyday life 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.720
 both i sold and actually from these 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.740
 two here it was a fight more favorite 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:13.850
 aperture 4 is adequate for me 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.610
 price quality but I want to say that 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.190
 the lens in the room aperture 4 to remove 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.120
 almost impossible aperture such 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.459
 much you can 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.190
 the room with him is thin with a flash but 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.860
 no one bothers you to take a launch for 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.989
 those who have crop that you will have on these 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.849
 monkeys 1 time they will be 43 that is 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.069
 so extensively it google does not take 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.560
 of course 43 dosage and wide angle too 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.980
 in which most of what is needed 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.750
 will enter and you will have one hundred eight nine 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.569
 This is generally an awesome distance for 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.120
 portraits right super therefore on the trail 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.340
 and not croppy full frame rgb those 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.180
 will work fine and for very yes 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.200
 one cost 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.769
 now take 2475 so our second will 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.849
 24 70 aperture 2 and 8 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.849
 let's start with the macro frame 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.860
 that's how beautiful it looks macro to on 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.160
 very often people make the wrong choice 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.590
 lens looking here are such a review and 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.480
 lenses for such a macro frame they 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.850
 see how awesome to roam behind without 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.350
 full of leaves of obscurity they take and 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.750
 hope that it will be awesome 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.970
 ruins Smokey to maybe we again 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.350
 moved away three steps from the model and the first 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.630
 frame we do at the very minimum 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.129
 distance and the most minimal aperture 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.929
 2 and 8 at a distance of 24 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:37.909
 so we see the photo we see 

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:39.739
 a photo that also forgot nothing 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.779
 blurred me because i was talking to 

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:43.759
 previous video mind pictures 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:45.619
 It depends on me aperture from 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.019
 focal length on the focal point 

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:50.119
 distance i fragma too probably 1 and 2 

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:52.429
 that was crying something smashed your 8 

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:54.769
 it helps me looking superficially 

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:56.449
 on the photo the difference between the pictures 

00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:58.969
 aperture four days we are equal 2 and 8 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.069
 almost not observed well again us 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:02.269
 In the frame and climbed most of all that 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.789
 what was around our module 

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:06.289
 now we take the second frame and but by the 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.719
 maximum distance namely on 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:12.999
 distance 70 again the diaphragm and your 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.999
 beads and again three steps away from the model 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.070
 so we see the photo and here 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.200
 very interesting situation turns out this 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.750
 the photo is almost exactly 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.150
 same on such a surface asians 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.330
 photos were taken at a distance of 105 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.790
 aperture 4 that is it seemed the aperture 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.700
 several steps more 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.920
 blur was our cat practically 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.680
 the same thing here 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:43.180
 feature 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:45.250
 aperture 4 we had a distance of 105 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.710
 the distance is also much more than 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.979
 a distance of 70 so we go 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.070
 compensation we have there 70 there 105 there 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.139
 aperture 28 there 4 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.030
 but is it worth to pay many times 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.810
 more if we are the end result 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.550
 we get the same only difference 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.639
 personally for me with these lenses 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.520
 is that indoor work 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.139
 with lens whose diaphragm is 2 and 8 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.539
 it is easier because it is more 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.639
 bright but personally I once 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.490
 quietly sold this your 8 bought myself 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:21.310
 4 tea with surcharge 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.660
 just really true no but for quite 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.160
 comparisons I made you a comparison 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:28.300
 events 70200 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:31.740
 and so 70200 aperture carries you 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.740
 made again decided on the model 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.479
 and this is the picture we got 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:41.539
 all good all, I hope the review was 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.539
 is useful 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.310
 sure that
