and crying stuff and yeah and then
that's<00:07:17.020> pretty<00:07:17.290> much<00:07:17.380> just<00:07:17.530> the<00:07:17.650> n<00:07:17.860> har<00:07:18.190> was

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:18.340 
that's pretty much just the n har was

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.760 
that's pretty much just the n har was
like<00:07:18.580> and<00:07:18.940> then<00:07:19.120> a<00:07:19.180> bird<00:07:19.540> flew<00:07:19.900> away<00:07:20.080> and<00:07:20.590> we're

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:20.770 
like and then a bird flew away and we're

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.840 
like and then a bird flew away and we're
all<00:07:20.980> going<00:07:21.250> to<00:07:21.310> be<00:07:21.670> happily<00:07:22.210> ever<00:07:22.360> after<00:07:22.780> um<00:07:23.850> so

all going to be happily ever after um so
yeah<00:07:25.120> I<00:07:26.100> guess<00:07:27.100> that's<00:07:27.430> it<00:07:27.610> that<00:07:28.060> sums<00:07:28.630> up<00:07:28.810> the

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:28.990 
yeah I guess that's it that sums up the

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.090 
yeah I guess that's it that sums up the
episode<00:07:29.410> kind<00:07:30.340> of<00:07:30.490> sad<00:07:31.090> that<00:07:31.390> like<00:07:31.680> not<00:07:32.680> going
