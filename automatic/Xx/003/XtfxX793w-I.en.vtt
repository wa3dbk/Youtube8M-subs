27%<00:03:09.730> Dex<00:03:10.330> on<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.410> first<00:03:11.650> cube<00:03:11.920> ah<00:03:12.160> I<00:03:13.500> didn't

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
27% Dex on the first cube ah I didn't

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.680 
27% Dex on the first cube ah I didn't
know<00:03:14.590> anyone<00:03:15.010> looking<00:03:15.370> for<00:03:15.580> Dex<00:03:15.910> right<00:03:16.540> now

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
know anyone looking for Dex right now

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.600 
know anyone looking for Dex right now
that<00:03:17.110> has<00:03:17.350> an<00:03:17.500> independent<00:03:17.860> so<00:03:18.310> I'll<00:03:18.430> probably

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
that has an independent so I'll probably

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.000 
that has an independent so I'll probably
Riku<00:03:19.240> but<00:03:19.390> over<00:03:19.600> that<00:03:19.980> I'll<00:03:20.980> be<00:03:21.160> back<00:03:21.340> guys

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
with my my friends and they advised me

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.940 
with my my friends and they advised me
to<00:03:32.590> keep<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.610> 27%<00:03:34.510> Dex<00:03:34.720> pendant<00:03:35.110> try<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.680> trade

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
to keep the 27% Dex pendant try to trade

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.630 
to keep the 27% Dex pendant try to trade
it<00:03:36.630> it's<00:03:37.630> gonna<00:03:37.720> be<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:37.959> pain<00:03:38.200> but<00:03:38.470> then<00:03:39.130> again<00:03:39.280> I

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
it it's gonna be a pain but then again I

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.900 
it it's gonna be a pain but then again I
do<00:03:39.970> have<00:03:40.270> until<00:03:41.080> whenever<00:03:41.980> Kinesis<00:03:42.730> is

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
do have until whenever Kinesis is

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.220 
do have until whenever Kinesis is
released<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:44.110> trade<00:03:44.380> it<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:45.370> that's<00:03:46.209> that's<00:03:47.020> a

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
released to trade it so that's that's a

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.250 
released to trade it so that's that's a
thing<00:03:47.470> I'll<00:03:48.070> probably<00:03:48.250> keep<00:03:48.459> this<00:03:49.080> instead<00:03:50.080> I

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
thing I'll probably keep this instead I

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.750 
thing I'll probably keep this instead I
will<00:03:50.530> probably<00:03:51.190> cube<00:03:51.880> my<00:03:52.360> boot<00:03:53.200> and/or<00:03:53.820> top

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
will probably cube my boot and/or top

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.590 
will probably cube my boot and/or top
bigger<00:03:58.470> yeah<00:03:59.470> because<00:03:59.680> they<00:03:59.980> are<00:04:00.160> both<00:04:00.600> 12%

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
bigger yeah because they are both 12%

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.620 
bigger yeah because they are both 12%
int<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:03.120> try<00:04:04.120> go<00:04:04.239> for<00:04:04.420> 2<00:04:04.540> lines<00:04:04.780> on<00:04:05.080> them<00:04:06.630> but

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
int so try go for 2 lines on them but

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.400 
int so try go for 2 lines on them but
yeah<00:04:07.860> two<00:04:08.860> cubes<00:04:09.630> 24<00:04:10.630> percent<00:04:11.019> luck

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
yeah two cubes 24 percent luck

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.770 
yeah two cubes 24 percent luck
27%<00:04:12.220> Dex<00:04:12.670> um<00:04:13.590> yeah

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
27% Dex um yeah

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.849 
27% Dex um yeah
power<00:04:16.780> of<00:04:17.080> by<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.380> cubes<00:04:18.030> it's<00:04:19.030> pretty<00:04:19.269> crazy

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
power of by the cubes it's pretty crazy

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.969 
power of by the cubes it's pretty crazy
um<00:04:20.859> I<00:04:21.180> did<00:04:22.180> use<00:04:22.419> quite<00:04:22.840> a<00:04:22.870> few<00:04:23.080> yesterday<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:23.740> I

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
um I did use quite a few yesterday and I

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.090 
um I did use quite a few yesterday and I
didn't<00:04:24.250> get<00:04:24.370> this<00:04:24.820> good<00:04:25.360> luck<00:04:25.950> so<00:04:26.950> I've<00:04:27.070> used

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
didn't get this good luck so I've used

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.600 
didn't get this good luck so I've used
two<00:04:27.460> out<00:04:27.580> of<00:04:27.610> eight<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:28.030> got<00:04:28.510> three<00:04:28.810> lines<00:04:29.050> on

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
two out of eight I got three lines on

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.120 
two out of eight I got three lines on
two<00:04:30.610> equips<00:04:31.000> already<00:04:31.419> so<00:04:32.410> that's<00:04:32.919> pretty

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
two equips already so that's pretty

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.650 
two equips already so that's pretty
crazy<00:04:34.320> I'll<00:04:35.320> think<00:04:35.620> I<00:04:35.680> go<00:04:35.830> with<00:04:35.979> a<00:04:36.010> boot<00:04:36.280> first

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
crazy I'll think I go with a boot first

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
crazy I'll think I go with a boot first
ah<00:04:38.760> cuz<00:04:39.760> yeah<00:04:40.060> 12%<00:04:40.680> just<00:04:41.680> isn't<00:04:42.040> gonna<00:04:42.190> cut<00:04:42.490> it

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
ah cuz yeah 12% just isn't gonna cut it

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.270 
ah cuz yeah 12% just isn't gonna cut it
um<00:04:44.820> we<00:04:45.820> got<00:04:47.280> nine<00:04:48.280> cent<00:04:48.610> int<00:04:48.850> haste<00:04:49.780> and<00:04:50.280> the

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
um we got nine cent int haste and the

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.060 
um we got nine cent int haste and the
whole<00:04:51.400> bunch<00:04:51.580> of<00:04:51.730> junk

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
whole bunch of junk

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.520 
whole bunch of junk
alright<00:04:54.070> let's<00:04:54.580> go<00:04:54.700> again<00:04:54.990> we're<00:04:55.990> going<00:04:56.260> for

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
alright let's go again we're going for

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.330 
alright let's go again we're going for
at<00:04:56.860> least<00:04:57.220> two<00:04:57.730> lines<00:04:58.710> of<00:05:01.440> it

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
at least two lines of it

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.400 
at least two lines of it
which<00:05:03.670> I<00:05:03.820> did<00:05:04.000> not<00:05:04.030> get<00:05:04.330> any<00:05:04.570> of<00:05:06.570> all<00:05:07.570> right<00:05:07.750> so

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
which I did not get any of all right so

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.130 
which I did not get any of all right so
we<00:05:08.590> have<00:05:10.410> four<00:05:11.410> cubes<00:05:11.680> left<00:05:11.890> yep<00:05:12.840> four<00:05:13.840> cubes

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
we have four cubes left yep four cubes

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:21.090 
we have four cubes left yep four cubes
left<00:05:15.210> haste<00:05:16.210> haste<00:05:16.840> and<00:05:18.870> like<00:05:19.870> zero<00:05:20.470> lines<00:05:20.800> of

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
left haste haste and like zero lines of

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.220 
left haste haste and like zero lines of
actual<00:05:21.520> stats<00:05:22.890> damn<00:05:23.890> I<00:05:24.600> guess<00:05:25.600> this<00:05:25.810> is<00:05:25.990> my

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
actual stats damn I guess this is my

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.830 
actual stats damn I guess this is my
yeah<00:05:27.220> I<00:05:27.370> used<00:05:27.610> all<00:05:27.820> of<00:05:27.970> my<00:05:28.090> luck<00:05:28.300> on<00:05:28.540> the<00:05:28.690> two

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
yeah I used all of my luck on the two

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.590 
yeah I used all of my luck on the two
pendants<00:05:30.630> we<00:05:31.630> got<00:05:31.810> 15%<00:05:32.710> it<00:05:33.090> that's<00:05:34.090> not<00:05:34.240> bad

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
pendants we got 15% it that's not bad

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:41.790 
pendants we got 15% it that's not bad
I'll<00:05:34.660> keep<00:05:34.870> that<00:05:35.080> for<00:05:35.260> now<00:05:35.380> uh<00:05:37.050> Dex<00:05:38.050> MP<00:05:40.620> I'll<00:05:41.620> go

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
I'll keep that for now uh Dex MP I'll go

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.280 
I'll keep that for now uh Dex MP I'll go
with<00:05:41.980> the<00:05:42.330> MP<00:05:43.330> why<00:05:43.750> not<00:05:44.760> all<00:05:45.760> right

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
with the MP why not all right

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.470 
with the MP why not all right
so<00:05:47.290> that'll<00:05:48.160> do<00:05:48.310> for<00:05:48.550> the<00:05:48.610> boot<00:05:48.820> we<00:05:49.090> got<00:05:49.300> two

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
so that'll do for the boot we got two

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.770 
so that'll do for the boot we got two
lines<00:05:49.660> that's<00:05:50.380> an<00:05:50.500> upgrade<00:05:51.540> it's<00:05:52.540> like<00:05:52.750> a

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
lines that's an upgrade it's like a

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.100 
lines that's an upgrade it's like a
three<00:05:53.350> percent<00:05:53.590> upgrade<00:05:53.920> yeah<00:05:54.810> two<00:05:55.810> cubes
