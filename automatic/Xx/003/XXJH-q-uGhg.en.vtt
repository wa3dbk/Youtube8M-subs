00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.220
 hello very good everyone today he won 25 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.660
 welcome to this new video in this 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.760
 occasion we will be with a play of 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.890
 funds of call of duty black ops' 2 in 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.660
 first the first piece of example that 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.630
 you will see it will be a rachita one of a 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.759
 kayak game is from domain killed to 35 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.960
 and 12 times basically because they were 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.820
 going all the games so 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.590
 no table with the streak are thrown and such 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.060
 and well it's not bad playing with 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.800
 jose lets us see his face the description 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.270
 that is I think that already four subscribers 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.340
 get to 100 so if you pass and 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.530
 6-1 by hand I would thank you enough 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.180
 and second time if I'm still missing 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.160
 time for the comment that if you 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.320
 extend a little bit of bottom you will see a 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.280
 rachita shotgun a shotgun caught the 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.899
 ground 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.280
 although he took me out in very little 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.480
 what is the logo star time 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.550
 and well then the end of the 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.960
 split so those two pieces in case 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.670
 to extend the comment a little 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.109
 which is quite likely because of the comment 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.940
 for the comment I'm going to make today 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.440
 for the subject that I bring and already enough that 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.760
 he did not comment and grace deserved 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.920
 pretty lately almost everything 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.150
 up are lines and things like that if you win 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.829
 also remind you that it is still 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.090
 open the draw of the account of 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.649
 whites 2 of the account 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.299
 with all the unlocked camouflages of 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.799
 all cards as 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.049
 Interested in participating and having very 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.549
 account that those who participate and who 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.289
 are not active in the channel they will have 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.119
 Quite less likely to win 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.310
 the draw to keep the account that 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.259
 the people who are active I leave it there the 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.579
 true is that we say that I feel a 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.280
 little in debt to the people who follow me 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.679
 and then they are going to have more opportunity 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.630
 truth and nothing 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.149
 basically half of those marketing 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.439
 it is surely let me say it on twitter 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.719
 and if you put me in contact with the winner 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.679
 and nothing about the subject of today how 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.020
 grow on youtube 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.849
 Many good people often add me 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.560
 there are people that there are more and more 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:51.939
 you ask, hey, I 'm starting 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.950
 canada a channel on youtube I have 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.380
 300 subscribers as my psuv arrives 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.789
 yes, as you've been growing and the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.709
 truth is that many times that answer 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.179
 It's hard for me to answer them I do not know 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.189
 very well what to say as cojones say 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.770
 how to grow and right now I am going to give you 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.849
 I'm going to give my way to some the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.470
 way that I am using from 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:09.819
 September of vacation wrapping 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.489
 How true is that I'm doing a lot 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.650
 well and now I will tell you basically more 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.000
 that to grow fast is a way of 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.440
 growth is not overly 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.880
 fast though yes it's going 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.660
 pretty good but what you will get is 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.520
 to have 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.800
 in active and in many times I see channels 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.210
 thousand subscribers that cost them a lot 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.680
 get to 100 visits without stories to 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.970
 Sometimes it's hard for me to reach 20 likes and 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.500
 the truth that sometimes I feel bad 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.210
 because I think they are channels that 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.650
 they could perfectly be seen 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.960
 maybe they are quite similar to mine 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.180
 and that I the best then I have 60 likes and 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.770
 they have 10 or 20 and then can not 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.040
 it was needed twice is a little more 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.290
 but good because grow many times 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.280
 some say you're going up with the iut and 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.140
 climbing mints you're not going to get 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.790
 grow on youtube I think that really 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.860
 it's a lie because the most watched channels 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.480
 on youtube most of them go up 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.440
 these two games so really with 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.300
 they can grow 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.040
 nowadays it costs a lot and in day without 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.420
 help on big youtube costs a 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.680
 atrocity but good little by little it 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.240
 can go grow you can earn a 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.640
 public little by little go meet people 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.470
 I can tell me right now my way 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.450
 to grow and the question is that 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.190
 When I arrived on vacation I thought 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.870
 month and a half without uploading videos is going to 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.760
 cost quite recover the activity 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.530
 of the channel even maybe later I 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.850
 It costs that with reaching the 40 likes 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.370
 reached 200 visits as was 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.220
 arriving before and I thought something I thought about 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.720
 make collaborations by saying mean by 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.830
 so to say, contact others 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.620
 youtubers with youtube is that both 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.230
 they contain between 300 and 1,500 subscribers 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.550
 added them skype I talk to them some 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.320
 that you see this video or you will know that I have 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.959
 done that with you and I send you a 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.020
 message basically saying hello I've 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.720
 seen your youtube channel and upload taltal 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.550
 and hey, if you like, I subscribe to your 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.440
 channel I am active in your channel I give you 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.030
 I leave a like I leave a comment on 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.880
 each video and you do the same in my 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.920
 channel and so you want it not he won 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.750
 subscribed active and I win will be a whole 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.250
 active subscriber in your channel and if 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.080
 you do what I know with several people if 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.540
 you do it like that with 15 to 20 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.670
 people from 15 to 20 people order like 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.930
 is going to make other youtubers or that 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.730
 other people who do not even have a channel 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.230
 I ended up coming to your channel and little to 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.520
 little you are going to grow now that to me 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.750
 this is going pretty well what 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.700
 I can say it 's something I had not put 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.080
 in practice that normally follows no 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.640
 YouTube went through my channel has been 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.720
 best thing to go through the mine and 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.840
 I passed that I did not have any 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.489
 contact with him and in fact because of this 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.260
 way you keep in touch you 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.480
 pass your videos this past yours 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.980
 let's say you have some activity there 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.870
 people that you probably do not 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.000
 this kind of thing will seem good 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.130
 if you have added to appointments for 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.860
 certain people the majority except two 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.510
 or three all told me that while the 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.500
 most of them are fulfilling like this 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.660
 that the truth is that I'm pretty 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.040
 happy and it's a good way to win 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.270
 active subscribers really do what 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.430
 I say because it's working for me 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.930
 Many of l'ebre or you ask me and I 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.580
 you pass this video to upload now 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.830
 all the people who ask me why 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.479
 it's a part of a pretty good way 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.160
 you will not get 500 subscribers 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.050
 day doing this not much less 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.210
 little by little you will be able to grow and 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.770
 at least you'll have an active canada me 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.139
 that I know having 300 subscribers would be 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.669
 well have interest in video taking 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.650
 my subscriber would be fine to have 50 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.180
 likes to have 22 thousand subscribers or 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.460
 better also have 80 álex per video 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.750
 or more I do not know is what I expect 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.550
 I want my channel to be part of winning 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.800
 subscribers right now I'm more 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.850
 interested nobody reaches the thousand then 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.160
 I'm more interested in earning more 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.660
 reproductions and likes that in fact 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.130
 of earning subscribers in fact now I 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.229
 is focusing more on that in that my 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.300
 channel have more activity 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.160
 I've gone from the best I had 30 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.020
 comments for lived in before the 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.449
 summer now I'm usually getting over 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.740
 many times 50 so I'm 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.260
 quite quite happy with the 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.910
 Chinese performance I would like 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.590
 opinion in the channel and if 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.510
 six new this is the first video that 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.550
 you see from my channel and if you have a channel 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.830
 youtube well you can add me to 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.900

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.010
 problem I in fact most of the 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.200
 uploads people ask me 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.580
 chatting among all integers unless 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.260
 that is a video that is that I do not 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.760
 interest nothing what is a tutorial of 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.440
 anything that does not interest me or that 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.030
 be a video a game that has better 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.680
 uploaded 30 minutes of video then 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.330
 Well, I can not see the whole thing 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.950
 because if I do not theory I'm three 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.450
 hours watching videos on youtube but 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.250
 good as I do not know how to most of the 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.500
 people upload things that went up because they go up 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.670
 with justice a bat fil up I do not know 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.470
 game that are quite interesting 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.660
 Well, I usually see and nothing 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.880
 it is simply this this is my way a 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.830
 way game secure pretty pretty 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.840
 useful to go starting on youtube is going to 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.000
 go gaining activity in your videos and 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.190
 nothing can that in the end also what 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.630
 you do is meet a lot more people and not 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.250
 I know it's a pretty pretty way 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.680
 pretty good you also want trick no 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.630
 I know if they have the will put it on 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.220
 practice or not and nothing this is my 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.310
 experience lately is something that 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.170
 until now I had never done but 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.130
 Thinking about it this summer, you get to 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.960
 the conclusion that it could be 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.390
 quite useful and the 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.460
 results so nothing tell me what you 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:50.250
 it seems if you think it's an idea if it's something 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.960
 that you already did did nothing this 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.260
 it's all we see next and the 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.260
 next
