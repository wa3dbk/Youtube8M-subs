00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.990
 of Yeti Blue is a microphone that has everything 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.600
 simply as a role to perfect 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.210
 the sound quality of my videos for this 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.340
 who follows i cciab alex ipod touch the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.539
 pros he was buying the same mic actually 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.000
 a whim in the same day 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.820
 we decided him and I to buy the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.390
 same micro price quality there is nothing to 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.710
 say 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.559
 so this little gem this new toy 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.200
 is delivered first with a cable 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.800
 usb that allows you to connect the microphone 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.079
 with the computer whether it's on mac or 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.390
 on windows and you have a small 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.010
 road here which explains us congo 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.930
 how does this device work? 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.300
 the unpacking we will finally be able to get out 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.320
 this microphone from this box is the first 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.270
 thing we notice is that it's a 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.579
 microphone that's pretty heavy is enough 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.530
 big in general the head pilots that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.890
 give something like this you have 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.549
 underneath the device pads 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.740
 slip would make you all 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.229
 simply to prevent this micro slides 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.360
 on the desk after what we have 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.810
 as a button as a feature on this 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.540
 microphone 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.310
 firstly we have the same button that 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.320
 Allows you to simply cut the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.659
 word to avoid simply not to 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.490
 not record what we say we can 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.490
 also adjust the volume is set the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.430
 positioning our microphone easily 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.579
 and quickly below the device 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.350
 what do we have on the left? 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.049
 part where we will be able to simply 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.850
 connect the usb cable to the master 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.979
 after on the pc in the middle we have 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.619
 call it a headphone output without any 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.750
 latency with amplifier and control 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.560
 of volume and to the right we have a hold 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.210
 mini jack 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.040
 behind what can we do 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.060
 as you can see we have 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.549
 four positioning for the sa part 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.810
 own turn to the patterns I do not know 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.299
 no I'm not very good at English where 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.220
 precisely each position 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.569
 it's a type of videos I'll do a 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.039
 video test to show you roughly what 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.290
 that it gives and after all on top 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.409
 can 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.040
 set the earnings then how's that 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:21.260
 walk on plug the cable on the microphone 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.379
 then after when we finished we will look 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.870
 this usb cable on our computer 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.219
 there is nothing easier in general 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.709
 the price of the Bourg ticket is proposed 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.510
 between 140 and 150 euros in store by 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.640
 against advice that I advise you 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.310
 it is to buy it at amazon price 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.420
 from 97 euros it is nine so does a 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.519
 savings of 50 euros 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.469
 it's always won anyway 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.810
 regarding sound quality 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.389
 it is more than correct and you have to 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.609
 know that I'm just recording this 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.049
 video from the beginning thanks to this microphone 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.030
 so that gives you an idea of ​​the 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.769
 thing to have more information on 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.230
 this microphone I advise you to watch 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.790
 my video test that will be available in 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.250
 the next few days as a case 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.129
 notation on the video but also in the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.230
