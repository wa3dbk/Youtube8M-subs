00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
it actually happens fairly quickly um

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.550 
it actually happens fairly quickly um
with<00:01:12.240> about<00:01:12.420> 1<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.810> 2<00:01:12.840> minutes<00:01:12.990> left<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.470> the

with about 1 to 2 minutes left in the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.810 
with about 1 to 2 minutes left in the
round<00:01:13.680> you'll<00:01:13.920> probably<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.250> end<00:01:14.460> up<00:01:14.549> having

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
to punch zombies which makes it a lot

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.580 
to punch zombies which makes it a lot
more<00:01:16.770> intense<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.250> lot<00:01:17.369> more<00:01:17.520> fun<00:01:17.700> now<00:01:18.530> on<00:01:19.530> the

can<00:01:31.140> modify<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:31.799> you'd<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.880> uh

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
can modify that if you'd like but uh

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.700 
can modify that if you'd like but uh
that's<00:01:33.479> what<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.720> found<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> best<00:01:34.470> type

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that's what I found to be the best type

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.880 
that's what I found to be the best type
of<00:01:34.740> limit<00:01:35.570> humans<00:01:36.570> do<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.810> sprint<00:01:37.140> shotgun

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
of limit humans do have a sprint shotgun

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.560 
of limit humans do have a sprint shotgun
last<00:01:38.369> man<00:01:38.610> as<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:38.970> see<00:01:39.030> has<00:01:39.119> over<00:01:39.360> shield

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
last man as you can see has over shield

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.230 
last man as you can see has over shield
so<00:01:39.810> he<00:01:39.990> has<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.259> take<00:01:40.409> two<00:01:40.619> hits<00:01:41.000> this<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
so he has to take two hits this is a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.969 
so he has to take two hits this is a
variant<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.960> alpha<00:01:43.229> zombies<00:01:43.560> game<00:01:43.740> type

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
variant of the alpha zombies game type

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.609 
variant of the alpha zombies game type
so<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.299> always<00:01:45.450> keeps<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.869> fair<00:01:46.079> if<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
so it always keeps it fair if one of the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.800 
so it always keeps it fair if one of the
beginning<00:01:47.250> zombies<00:01:47.610> decides<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.119> quit<00:01:48.270> it'll

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
beginning zombies decides to quit it'll

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.530 
beginning zombies decides to quit it'll
just<00:01:48.840> replace<00:01:49.530> them<00:01:49.740> really<00:01:49.979> quickly<00:01:50.540> instead

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
just replace them really quickly instead

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.090 
just replace them really quickly instead
of<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:51.869> having<00:01:51.960> two<00:01:52.320> zombies<00:01:52.500> left<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.950> try

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
of just having two zombies left to try

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.719 
of just having two zombies left to try
to<00:01:53.159> kill<00:01:53.579> humans<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.189> guys<00:01:56.340> saw<00:01:56.520> it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
to kill humans and as you guys saw it

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.480 
to kill humans and as you guys saw it

the map as you can see we got steps into

the map as you can see we got steps into
the<00:02:16.650> houses<00:02:17.070> all<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.730> houses<00:02:17.880> are<00:02:18.210> pretty

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
the houses all the houses are pretty

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.690 
the houses all the houses are pretty
much<00:02:18.660> identical<00:02:18.810> on<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.530> inside<00:02:19.860> we<00:02:20.160> have<00:02:20.310> two

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
much identical on the inside we have two

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.140 
much identical on the inside we have two
pillars<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:22.200> we<00:02:22.350> have<00:02:22.440> crates<00:02:22.740> um<00:02:23.150> these

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
pillars and we have crates um these

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.940 
pillars and we have crates um these
actually<00:02:24.480> take<00:02:24.600> quite<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.110> bit<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.260> time<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.590> get

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
actually take quite a bit of time to get

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.880 
actually take quite a bit of time to get
into<00:02:26.070> place<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.730> after<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:28.050> 30<00:02:28.290> seconds<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.860> up

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
into place so after the 30 seconds is up

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.290 
into place so after the 30 seconds is up
and<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.250> zombie<00:02:29.490> start<00:02:29.640> spawning<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.120> you'll

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
and the zombie start spawning in you'll

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.550 
and the zombie start spawning in you'll
probably<00:02:30.510> only<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:30.960> these<00:02:31.140> barricades

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
probably only have these barricades

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.860 
probably only have these barricades
about<00:02:31.800> halfway<00:02:32.040> set<00:02:32.430> up<00:02:32.610> which<00:02:33.510> means<00:02:33.690> you

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
about halfway set up which means you

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.690 
about halfway set up which means you
have<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.020> quickly<00:02:34.530> hurry<00:02:34.860> or<00:02:35.130> else<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.400> zombie

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
have to quickly hurry or else a zombie

have to quickly hurry or else a zombie
can't<00:02:35.940> seize<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.180> opportunity<00:02:36.300> I've<00:02:37.050> seen

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
can't seize that opportunity I've seen

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.780 
can't seize that opportunity I've seen
matches<00:02:37.590> where<00:02:37.800> they<00:02:38.400> didn't<00:02:38.580> get<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
matches where they didn't get the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.550 
matches where they didn't get the
barricade<00:02:39.180> up<00:02:39.300> in<00:02:39.390> time<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.810> one<00:02:40.020> zombie<00:02:40.350> slip

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
barricade up in time and one zombie slip

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.970 
barricade up in time and one zombie slip
through<00:02:40.800> killed<00:02:41.100> like<00:02:41.280> three<00:02:41.520> people<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.980> you

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
through killed like three people and you

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.410 
through killed like three people and you
don't<00:02:44.130> want<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.460> happen<00:02:44.520> so<00:02:44.820> make<00:02:45.390> sure

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
don't want that to happen so make sure

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.880 
don't want that to happen so make sure
you<00:02:45.630> have<00:02:45.720> someone<00:02:45.990> guarding<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.620> while

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
you have someone guarding you while

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.540 
you have someone guarding you while
you're<00:02:47.040> trying<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.280> block<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.730> barricade<00:02:48.180> and

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
you're trying to block the barricade and

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.580 
you're trying to block the barricade and
it's<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.640> very<00:02:50.850> simple<00:02:51.090> map<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:52.140> has<00:02:52.320> four

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
it's a very simple map it has four

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.040 
it's a very simple map it has four
houses<00:02:52.890> this<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:53.970> technique<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.600> was<00:02:54.750> trying

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
houses this is a technique I was trying

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.160 
houses this is a technique I was trying
to<00:02:55.140> make<00:02:55.260> simple<00:02:56.160> houses<00:02:57.000> but<00:02:57.300> multiple

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
to make simple houses but multiple

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.050 
to make simple houses but multiple
versions<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.680> them<00:02:58.830> because<00:02:59.010> normally<00:02:59.400> when<00:03:00.000> I

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
versions of them because normally when I

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.020 
versions of them because normally when I
make<00:03:00.150> house<00:03:00.720> maps<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.590> only<00:03:01.800> make<00:03:02.040> one<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.610> it

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
make house maps I only make one and it

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.760 
make house maps I only make one and it
uses<00:03:03.180> up<00:03:03.360> most<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.720> budget<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:04.320> I<00:03:04.350> decided

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
uses up most of the budget so I decided

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.380 
uses up most of the budget so I decided
to<00:03:04.920> try<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.100> make<00:03:05.280> for<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:06.030> don't<00:03:06.180> use<00:03:06.360> that

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
to try to make for that don't use that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.990 
to try to make for that don't use that
much<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.960> budget<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:08.190> budget<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.550> almost

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
much of the budget the budget is almost

the street there and they're pretty much
the<00:03:49.380> same<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.830> doesn't<00:03:50.010> really<00:03:50.070> matter

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.619 
a correct spot try to hold out I did see
one<00:04:54.889> attempt<00:04:55.280> at<00:04:55.400> on<00:04:55.849> people<00:04:56.210> trying<00:04:56.449> to<00:04:56.539> do

one attempt at on people trying to do

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.390 
one attempt at on people trying to do
this<00:04:56.870> where<00:04:57.680> they<00:04:57.770> parked<00:04:58.039> it<00:04:58.099> at<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.250> end<00:04:58.370> of

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
this where they parked it at the end of

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.520 
this where they parked it at the end of
the<00:04:58.490> street<00:04:58.610> behind<00:04:58.819> these<00:04:59.060> sandbags<00:04:59.530> hopped

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
the street behind these sandbags hopped

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.080 
the street behind these sandbags hopped
on<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.740> gun<00:05:00.979> and<00:05:01.250> started<00:05:01.729> mowing<00:05:01.879> down

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
on the gun and started mowing down

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.580 
on the gun and started mowing down
zombies<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.719> problem<00:05:03.020> was<00:05:03.199> that<00:05:03.229> their

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
zombies the problem was that their

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.140 
zombies the problem was that their
teammates<00:05:03.979> were<00:05:04.159> not<00:05:04.310> covering<00:05:04.669> them<00:05:04.849> as<00:05:04.969> well

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
teammates were not covering them as well

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.909 
teammates were not covering them as well
from<00:05:05.449> the<00:05:05.599> sides<00:05:05.810> they<00:05:06.110> were<00:05:06.169> too<00:05:06.469> focused<00:05:06.650> on

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
from the sides they were too focused on

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.680 
from the sides they were too focused on
the<00:05:07.039> street<00:05:07.310> and<00:05:07.490> they<00:05:08.030> got<00:05:08.180> ambushed<00:05:08.569> from

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
the street and they got ambushed from

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.649 
the street and they got ambushed from
the<00:05:08.900> sides<00:05:09.139> um<00:05:09.430> so<00:05:10.430> if<00:05:10.699> you're<00:05:10.879> on<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.150> warthog

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659 
the sides um so if you're on the warthog

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:13.180 
the sides um so if you're on the warthog
and<00:05:11.690> you<00:05:11.960> try<00:05:12.139> to<00:05:12.169> pull<00:05:12.469> off<00:05:12.590> that<00:05:12.620> tactic<00:05:13.009> make

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
and you try to pull off that tactic make

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.499 
and you try to pull off that tactic make
sure<00:05:13.280> you<00:05:13.340> got<00:05:13.430> teammates<00:05:13.759> covering<00:05:14.180> you<00:05:14.330> um

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
sure you got teammates covering you um

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.600 
sure you got teammates covering you um
but<00:05:15.349> for<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.590> most<00:05:15.740> part<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:16.069> Warthog<00:05:16.310> also

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
but for the most part the Warthog also

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.499 
but for the most part the Warthog also
does<00:05:16.819> get<00:05:17.030> screwed<00:05:17.629> up<00:05:17.750> but<00:05:18.080> uh<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:19.430> is<00:05:19.849> kind<00:05:20.419> of

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
does get screwed up but uh it is kind of

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:21.969 
does get screwed up but uh it is kind of
awesome<00:05:20.870> to<00:05:21.020> see<00:05:21.139> the<00:05:21.229> Warthog<00:05:21.530> gets<00:05:21.740> swarmed

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
awesome to see the Warthog gets swarmed

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.559 
awesome to see the Warthog gets swarmed
by<00:05:22.129> group<00:05:22.430> of<00:05:22.550> zombies<00:05:22.669> and<00:05:23.000> explode<00:05:23.360> while

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569 
by group of zombies and explode while

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:24.459 
by group of zombies and explode while
you're<00:05:23.719> sitting<00:05:24.050> in<00:05:24.080> when<00:05:24.199> the<00:05:24.289> house<00:05:24.440> is

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469 
you're sitting in when the house is

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:28.659 
you're sitting in when the house is
going<00:05:24.770> oh<00:05:24.949> my<00:05:25.129> god<00:05:26.590> but<00:05:27.590> yeah<00:05:27.680> that's<00:05:27.949> pretty

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
going oh my god but yeah that's pretty

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.230 
going oh my god but yeah that's pretty
much<00:05:28.849> it<00:05:29.569> I<00:05:29.960> guess<00:05:30.259> there<00:05:31.099> are<00:05:31.250> guns<00:05:31.669> on<00:05:32.029> this

much it I guess there are guns on this
