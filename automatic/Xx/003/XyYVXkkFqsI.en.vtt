00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.340
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.590
 I would like to have a very short video today 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.380
 but i just do it in the network 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.160
 seen that I asked a lot 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.220
 How to get the climbers with exact 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.920
 because it is just possible 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.829
 achieved well in fifa 10 and really 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.170
 many many comments to ask four 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.570
 seen videos that many do not know 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.390
 how that works as the overcomers go 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.670
 but they would still like to perform 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.440
 and that hangs show that now today 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.770
 of course you can of course first 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.930
 We'll walk here and then in the direction 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.239
 in here you have to run yours 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.629
 right stick move a move around 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.879
 up the right stick then left 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.390
 right then you make times over 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.450
 and given everything else here i see 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.700
 the transgressors who judged the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.760
 go out forest just had the left 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.320
 move the stick 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.330
 Just press the left stick in Jesus 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.700
 its just a lot easier 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.240
 trick and it was pretty effective one 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.549
 Takes a lot of pace with and 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.549
 Everything 's always going to be right 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.549
 over and so this year's tackles 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.780
 if you do not quite get it right 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.030
 exactly right one gives the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.189
 exaggerated because sometimes they do not 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.530
 properly executed there must be 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.040
 pay attention where else that's quite a pretty 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.890
 easy trick that is very very effective 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.770
 especially in it 14 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.090
 well I hope you like it 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.100
 and now you know how to do that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.770
 carry out if not possible 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.390
 also ask questions and ask 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.110
 that was it until the next one 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.110
 bye bye
