00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.400
 very good to all welcome auto skin 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.930
 this time he covers the woodcutter chair and 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.299
 let's start with the war cries in 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.400
 three versions Spanish Latin and English 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:16.209
 precisely in the order mentioned 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.869
 the first only joke is your pathetic 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.869
 body 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.349
 to finish 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.060
 to 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.149
 you are by my side 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.040
 ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.620
 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.710
 recited is what I most grace 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.619
 to 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.640
 what amuses the crying of your 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.640
 orphan children 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.970
 ah 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.510
 only to die 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.510
 ah 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.230
 the crunching of your bones is music for 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.230
 my ears 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.280
 God 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.280
 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.380
 to 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.820
 with my aunt 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.810
 like me 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.810
 ah 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.720
 Sofia 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.799
 and the dance 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.960
 let's go to the units 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.680
 we started with the q 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.739
 the w 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.350
 Light 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.030
 and the r 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.440
 i 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.040
 the passive and the death 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.350
 the critical hits since it's a 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.890
 character dependent on autotaxi 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.890
 good 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.890
 the record of recovery 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.290
 I want to make it clear that the latter 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.060
 section is a purely opinion 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.980
 personal and does not have to be relevant 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.420
 towards your opinion or your future 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.550
 purchase 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.950
 if you are simply looking for a change for the 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.530
 character is to say an aesthetic change not 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.450
 it's a bad skin but logically it does not 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.910
 is going to change a lot of the character so 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.980
 well just if you like the look 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.260
 what gives you this skin maybe is not a 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.299
 bad buy I hope you liked it 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.100
 If so do not want to give me love 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.730
 share comment and see you in the 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.730
