00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.870
I went to the casting because I saw an advert on the Internet. 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.840
I came here, to Tarragona, did the casting, which was just talking to the camera,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.820
and a month and a half later they called me 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.500
saying  I had a second audition 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.160
consisting of performing excerpts from the script

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.510
with different actresses.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.730
We started early in the morning and ended around 7 pm. 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.730
Then they called me back in September, saying that shooting would begin in a month's time.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.420
The role I already knew about, because they explained it to me before sending the script.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.760
What was very strange was that for the casting I was sent offprints 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.530
from the most complicated scenes and if one hasn't read the whole script 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.750
the thing makes no sense at all, because it talks about rabbits, giraffes and dogs, right?

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.750
But in truth I more or less knew about the character. It is a surprising character, right? 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.930
There were two scenes that we shot first,

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.200
which is the end, 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.480
where all the turn of the film occurs.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.400
 We had quite rehearsed a lot with Jesús Monllaó and Mercè Rovira,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.600
because Jesús wanted to make sure it was a flawless scene 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.560
and that we knew it by heart.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.570
And the truth is that bringing it well prepared really helped 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.439
because with the cold, the rain and the location the performing became very complicated, right?

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.889
It's very hard to work with cold, and even more if you go barefoot. 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:20.389
But I think the result was pretty good, yes.

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:22.219
Nico is a complicated character. 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:27.119
Always, especially in the movies, the difficult,

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.110
 different characters

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.099
are the most appreciated when viewed on screen. 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.999
The preparation was harder regarding 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:38.359
acting techniques that are used, such as the subtext, the moment-to-moment,

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.749
rather than when developing the character itself.
