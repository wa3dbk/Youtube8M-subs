00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
turning it all the way back on just

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.330 
turning it all the way back on just
because<00:02:05.899> in<00:02:06.259> system<00:02:06.649> settings<00:02:07.009> it<00:02:07.100> doesn't

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
because in system settings it doesn't

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.850 
because in system settings it doesn't
say<00:02:07.549> you<00:02:07.579> have<00:02:07.729> jincy<00:02:08.420> firmware<00:02:08.869> they<00:02:09.590> think
