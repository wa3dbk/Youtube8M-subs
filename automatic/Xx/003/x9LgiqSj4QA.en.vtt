sometimes to use other applications that
I've<00:00:56.760> used<00:00:57.060> prior<00:00:58.250> it<00:00:59.250> takes<00:00:59.520> more<00:00:59.730> than<00:00:59.790> one

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
I've used prior it takes more than one

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.479 
I've used prior it takes more than one
application<00:01:00.540> I've<00:01:01.200> never<00:01:01.500> seen<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.220> really

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
application I've never seen it really

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.430 
application I've never seen it really
instantly<00:01:03.120> work<00:01:03.450> and<00:01:05.870> because<00:01:06.870> be<00:01:07.200> as

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
instantly work and because be as

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.370 
instantly work and because be as
effective<00:01:08.340> as<00:01:08.820> I've<00:01:09.030> seen<00:01:09.240> today<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.229> with

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
effective as I've seen today but with

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.770 
effective as I've seen today but with
this<00:01:10.620> you're<00:01:11.220> evenly<00:01:11.700> distributed<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.450> out

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
this you're evenly distributed in out

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.660 
this you're evenly distributed in out
through<00:01:13.290> wet<00:01:13.590> hair<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:15.500> that's<00:01:16.500> very<00:01:16.860> easy<00:01:16.979> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
through wet hair so that's very easy to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:27.530 
through wet hair so that's very easy to
to<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:21.390> apply<00:01:21.690> it<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:27.330> will<00:01:27.450> be

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
to to do this to apply it it will be

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.490 
to to do this to apply it it will be
very<00:01:27.570> easily<00:01:28.310> applied<00:01:29.310> at<00:01:29.670> home<00:01:29.960> or<00:01:30.960> routinely

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
very easily applied at home or routinely

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.540 
very easily applied at home or routinely
done<00:01:31.860> at<00:01:32.100> your<00:01:32.250> salon<00:01:32.490> by<00:01:33.000> your<00:01:33.229> stylist<00:01:34.550> but

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
done at your salon by your stylist but

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.380 
done at your salon by your stylist but
it<00:01:35.759> would<00:01:35.910> be<00:01:36.800> very<00:01:37.800> easily<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.759> distribute<00:01:39.240> on

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
it would be very easily to distribute on

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.420 
it would be very easily to distribute on
to<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> wind<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> takes<00:01:41.009> very

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
to the wind here because it takes very

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.400 
to the wind here because it takes very
little<00:01:41.720> application<00:01:44.300> it<00:01:45.300> off<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> be

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
little application it off just to be

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.999 
little application it off just to be
more<00:01:46.590> manageable<00:01:47.190> but<00:01:47.569> for<00:01:48.569> each<00:01:48.630> section

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
more manageable but for each section

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.169 
more manageable but for each section
it's<00:01:50.009> very<00:01:50.280> easy<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:51.110> apply<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.610> as<00:01:53.610> my<00:01:53.819> client

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
it's very easy to apply it as my client

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.469 
it's very easy to apply it as my client
asks<00:01:54.479> cuz<00:01:54.660> she<00:01:54.780> perfectly<00:01:55.429> do<00:01:56.429> this<00:01:56.610> at<00:01:56.789> home

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
asks cuz she perfectly do this at home

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.830 
asks cuz she perfectly do this at home
she<00:01:58.350> could<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.679> what<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.039> suggest<00:01:59.610> is<00:02:00.000> until

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
she could have what I suggest is until

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.620 
she could have what I suggest is until
they<00:02:00.929> hear<00:02:01.110> get<00:02:01.940> strengthen<00:02:02.940> back<00:02:03.390> up

they hear get strengthen back up
perfectly<00:02:04.470> healthy<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.520> then<00:02:05.640> she<00:02:05.789> can

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
perfectly healthy and then she can

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.040 
perfectly healthy and then she can
maintain<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.569> as<00:02:06.720> often<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:07.259> she<00:02:07.289> is<00:02:07.740> necessary

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050
