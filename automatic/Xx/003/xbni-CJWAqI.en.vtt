you're wielding works so let's jump into

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.590 
you're wielding works so let's jump into
it<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.450> take<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.870> look<00:00:46.140> at<00:00:46.289> these<00:00:46.469> top<00:00:46.649> 5<00:00:46.920> tips

it and take a look at these top 5 tips

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.389 
it and take a look at these top 5 tips
my<00:00:48.600> first<00:00:48.870> tip<00:00:49.140> for<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.280> are

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
my first tip for you is one that you are

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.819 
my first tip for you is one that you are
never<00:00:50.579> going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.000> forget<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.690> use<00:00:51.930> every<00:00:52.680> now

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
never going to forget to use every now

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.410 
never going to forget to use every now
and<00:00:52.980> then<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.280> Minecraft<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.850> need<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.329> up

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
and then in Minecraft you need to get up

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.240 
and then in Minecraft you need to get up
high<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.660> your<00:00:54.989> best<00:00:55.260> option<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.920> pillar

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
high and your best option is to pillar

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.760 
high and your best option is to pillar
up<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.670> place<00:00:56.940> ladders<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:58.050> often<00:00:58.469> involves

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
up and place ladders this often involves

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.799 
up and place ladders this often involves
placing<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.430> few<00:00:59.609> blocks<00:00:59.850> dropping<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.510> down

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
placing a few blocks dropping that down

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.529 
placing a few blocks dropping that down
again<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.289> placing<00:01:02.100> ladders<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.940> slow<00:01:03.300> and

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
again and placing ladders it's slow and

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.590 
again and placing ladders it's slow and
tedious<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.500> sometimes<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.309> ends<00:01:05.580> badly<00:01:05.760> but

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
tedious and sometimes it ends badly but

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
tedious and sometimes it ends badly but
with<00:01:06.720> dual<00:01:06.960> wielding<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.680> hold<00:01:07.920> blocks

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
with dual wielding you can hold blocks

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.580 
with dual wielding you can hold blocks
in<00:01:08.520> your<00:01:08.729> offhand<00:01:08.900> ladders<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> default

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
in your offhand ladders on the default

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.859 
in your offhand ladders on the default
and<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.210> walk<00:01:12.450> forward

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
and then we have to do is walk forward

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.660 
and then we have to do is walk forward
and<00:01:13.020> hold<00:01:13.170> right<00:01:13.409> click<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.979> would<00:01:14.520> you

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and hold right click and would you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.340 
and hold right click and would you
believe<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.180> start<00:01:15.479> pulling<00:01:15.750> up<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
believe it you start pulling up like a

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.800 
believe it you start pulling up like a
pro<00:01:16.799> now<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.490> works<00:01:17.759> because<00:01:18.060> aiming<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
pro now this works because aiming at the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.140 
pro now this works because aiming at the
top<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.259> block<00:01:19.439> places<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.100> block<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.520> aiming

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
top of a block places a block and aiming

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.880 
top of a block places a block and aiming
at<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> side<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.810> one<00:01:21.990> places<00:01:22.259> ladders

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
at the side of one places ladders

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.649 
at the side of one places ladders
because<00:01:23.670> you're<00:01:23.790> holding<00:01:24.060> forward<00:01:24.360> you're

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
because you're holding forward you're

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.990 
because you're holding forward you're
going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.049> move<00:01:25.350> upwards<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.979> ever<00:01:26.520> alternate

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
going to move upwards and ever alternate

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.819 
going to move upwards and ever alternate
between<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.360> two<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.900> an<00:01:28.140> amazing<00:01:28.590> use<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
between the two it's an amazing use of

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.999 
between the two it's an amazing use of
dual<00:01:29.310> wielding<00:01:30.079> this<00:01:31.079> next<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.560> probably

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
dual wielding this next one is probably

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.469 
dual wielding this next one is probably
quite<00:01:32.189> obvious<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.060> worth<00:01:33.240> mentioning

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
quite obvious but it's worth mentioning

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.270 
quite obvious but it's worth mentioning
just<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.229> case<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.619> didn't<00:01:34.829> think<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.159> it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
just in case you didn't think of it

PvP but the thing is when you

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.849 
PvP but the thing is when you
right-click<00:02:40.420> with<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.930> sword<00:02:41.260> you're<00:02:41.530> going<00:02:41.739> to

offhand so what I'm suggesting is that

offhand so what I'm suggesting is that
the<00:02:46.359> diamond<00:02:46.750> axe<00:02:46.959> could<00:02:47.290> be<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.500> valid<00:02:47.859> weapon

the diamond axe could be a valid weapon
it<00:02:48.790> does<00:02:49.060> six<00:02:49.480> base<00:02:49.750> damage<00:02:50.169> as<00:02:50.349> opposed<00:02:50.709> to

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
it does six base damage as opposed to

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.009 
it does six base damage as opposed to

the sharpness enchantment can be applied

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.479 
the sharpness enchantment can be applied
to<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.359> axe<00:02:55.569> making<00:02:56.349> it<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.530> solid<00:02:56.950> weapon<00:02:57.159> as

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
to the axe making it a solid weapon as
