00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
dealing with natural curly hair like

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.380 
dealing with natural curly hair like
edoras<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.610> actually<00:01:14.760> use<00:01:15.060> your<00:01:15.210> flat

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
edoras you can actually use your flat

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.210 
edoras you can actually use your flat
iron<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.659> help<00:01:15.900> smooth<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.259> even<00:01:16.530> further<00:01:16.680> it

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
iron to help smooth it even further it

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.859 
iron to help smooth it even further it
has<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> little<00:01:17.790> bit<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.030> heat<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.450> outside

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
has a little bit of heat on the outside

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.830 
has a little bit of heat on the outside
so<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.860> rub<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.509> along<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> top

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
so you can just rub that along the top

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.330 
so you can just rub that along the top
of<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.080> hair<00:01:22.259> which<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:22.740> helps<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.040> smooth

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
of the hair which really helps to smooth

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.580 
of the hair which really helps to smooth
out<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.640> root<00:01:23.790> area<00:01:23.970> before<00:01:24.960> flat<00:01:25.200> ironing

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.499 
out the root area before flat ironing
I'm<00:01:26.250> basically<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.850> follow<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.210> step

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
I'm basically going to follow this step

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.790 
I'm basically going to follow this step
all<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.720> way<00:01:27.900> through
