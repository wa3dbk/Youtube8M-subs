00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
for the Seahawks had a little bit of a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.709 
for the Seahawks had a little bit of a
down<00:00:38.070> year<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.460> guess<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.149> mean<00:00:39.270> he<00:00:39.360> still<00:00:39.570> had<00:00:39.690> a

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
down year I guess I mean he still had a

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.780 
down year I guess I mean he still had a
very<00:00:40.020> good<00:00:40.079> year<00:00:40.230> don't<00:00:40.530> get<00:00:40.649> me<00:00:40.739> wrong<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.100> had

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
very good year don't get me wrong I had

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.639 
very good year don't get me wrong I had
97<00:00:42.270> combined<00:00:42.719> tackles<00:00:42.960> five<00:00:43.379> pass

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
97 combined tackles five pass

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.040 
97 combined tackles five pass
deflections<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.250> an<00:00:44.550> interception<00:00:44.870> but<00:00:45.870> many

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
deflections and an interception but many

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.630 
deflections and an interception but many
of<00:00:46.170> those<00:00:46.289> numbers<00:00:46.469> were<00:00:46.860> actually<00:00:47.309> career

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
of those numbers were actually career

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.940 
of those numbers were actually career
lows<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.930> say<00:00:49.140> Earl<00:00:49.379> Thomas<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.860> going

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
lows so I will say Earl Thomas is going

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.430 
lows so I will say Earl Thomas is going
to<00:00:50.039> drop<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.550> overall<00:00:50.879> from<00:00:51.360> his<00:00:51.809> mutt<00:00:52.079> 15

running<00:02:49.380> back<00:02:49.590> by<00:02:49.770> my<00:02:49.950> standards<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.580> mud<00:02:50.760> 16<00:02:51.150> a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
running back by my standards in mud 16 a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.180 
running back by my standards in mud 16 a
number<00:02:52.230> one<00:02:52.350> it's<00:02:52.500> got<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.740> be<00:02:52.800> Richard

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
number one it's got to be Richard

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.010 
number one it's got to be Richard
Sherman<00:02:53.640> one<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.060> best<00:02:54.270> corners<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:54.870> the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
Sherman one of the best corners in the

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.240 
Sherman one of the best corners in the
entire<00:02:55.320> league<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.710> think<00:02:55.920> he's<00:02:56.010> going<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.190> be

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
entire league I think he's going to be

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.910 
entire league I think he's going to be
the<00:02:56.430> second<00:02:56.910> best<00:02:57.090> corner<00:02:57.570> in<00:02:57.720> mud<00:02:58.200> 16<00:02:58.590> behind

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
the second best corner in mud 16 behind

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.470 
the second best corner in mud 16 behind
only<00:02:59.100> Darrelle<00:02:59.550> Revis<00:02:59.730> that<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.090> had<00:03:00.270> announced

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
only Darrelle Revis that I had announced

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.750 
only Darrelle Revis that I had announced
during<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.020> Jets<00:03:01.320> video<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.890> i<00:03:02.340> also<00:03:02.520> had

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
during the Jets video and i also had

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.100 
during the Jets video and i also had
Reba<00:03:03.000> side<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.270> 90<00:03:03.510> overall<00:03:03.810> but<00:03:03.930> I'm<00:03:03.990> gonna

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
Reba side of 90 overall but I'm gonna

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.900 
Reba side of 90 overall but I'm gonna
say<00:03:04.260> Sherman<00:03:04.620> gets<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.830> 90<00:03:05.100> overall<00:03:05.400> as<00:03:05.520> well<00:03:05.670> I

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
say Sherman gets a 90 overall as well I

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.760 
say Sherman gets a 90 overall as well I
do<00:03:06.180> think<00:03:06.690> revisit<00:03:07.140> stats<00:03:07.350> will<00:03:07.500> be<00:03:07.590> better

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
do think revisit stats will be better

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.220 
do think revisit stats will be better
but<00:03:08.640> Sherman<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.210> going<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.570> be<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.690> freak<00:03:10.050> as

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
but Sherman is going to be a freak as

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.200 
but Sherman is going to be a freak as
well<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.800> game<00:03:10.860> he<00:03:11.400> had<00:03:11.820> eight<00:03:12.000> pass

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
well in that game he had eight pass

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.210 
well in that game he had eight pass
deflections<00:03:12.750> four<00:03:13.050> interceptions<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.890> forced

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
deflections four interceptions of forced

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.450 
deflections four interceptions of forced
fumble<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.780> 57<00:03:15.780> tackles<00:03:16.020> he<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.590> just<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:16.920> great

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
fumble and 57 tackles he is just a great

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.760 
fumble and 57 tackles he is just a great
cornerback<00:03:18.240> exactly<00:03:19.140> what<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.380> want<00:03:19.590> on<00:03:19.710> a

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
cornerback exactly what you want on a

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.250 
cornerback exactly what you want on a
defense<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.430> he<00:03:20.700> rounds<00:03:21.120> out<00:03:21.240> the<00:03:21.810> Seahawks

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
defense and he rounds out the Seahawks

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.750 
defense and he rounds out the Seahawks
top<00:03:22.500> five<00:03:22.740> which<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.070> like<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.310> said<00:03:23.520> was<00:03:23.730> very

also<00:03:59.550> going<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.730> be<00:03:59.820> a<00:03:59.850> tough<00:04:00.060> episode<00:04:00.450> have

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
also going to be a tough episode have

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.360 
also going to be a tough episode have
some<00:04:00.780> very<00:04:01.050> very<00:04:01.200> good<00:04:01.410> players<00:04:01.680> on<00:04:01.920> offense

and<00:04:02.760> defense<00:04:03.240> so<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:03.630> should<00:04:03.780> be<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.900> good<00:04:04.080> one

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140

and defense so that should be a good one
as<00:04:04.350> well<00:04:04.470> think<00:04:05.190> that's<00:04:05.340> for<00:04:05.460> watching<00:04:05.790> and

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940
