00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
the thing is that you turn me on I

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.550 
the thing is that you turn me on I
always<00:02:21.570> thought<00:02:21.720> well<00:02:21.870> let's<00:02:22.020> make<00:02:22.140> some<00:02:22.380> tea

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
always thought well let's make some tea

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.750 
always thought well let's make some tea
out<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.860> fresh<00:02:23.100> leaves<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:23.580> you

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
out of the fresh leaves but you

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.210 
out of the fresh leaves but you
mentioned<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.900> actually<00:02:25.200> when<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.709> use<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
mentioned and actually when you use the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.580 
mentioned and actually when you use the
dry<00:02:26.550> leaves<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.300> you're<00:02:27.600> capturing<00:02:28.140> more<00:02:28.410> of

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
dry leaves that you're capturing more of

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.620 
dry leaves that you're capturing more of
the<00:02:28.800> vitamin<00:02:29.250> content<00:02:29.459> which<00:02:29.970> can<00:02:30.270> be<00:02:30.420> lost

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
the vitamin content which can be lost

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.230 
the vitamin content which can be lost
when<00:02:30.930> it's<00:02:31.080> fresh<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.440> also<00:02:32.250> we're<00:02:33.090> actually

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
when it's fresh and also we're actually

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.000 
when it's fresh and also we're actually
going<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.570> make<00:02:33.690> an<00:02:33.810> infusion<00:02:34.320> which<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:34.980> a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
going to make an infusion which is a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.000 
going to make an infusion which is a
stronger<00:02:35.490> version<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:36.300> tea<00:02:36.630> it's<00:02:37.440> more

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
stronger version of tea it's more

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.980 
stronger version of tea it's more
quantity<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.700> herbs<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.090> it's<00:02:39.330> deep<00:02:39.540> longer

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
quantity of herbs and it's deep longer

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.230 
quantity of herbs and it's deep longer
so<00:02:40.709> we're<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.250> go<00:02:41.370> ahead<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.670> show<00:02:42.150> you

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240

how Daniels come up with your head of

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.090 
how Daniels come up with your head of
making<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.390> in<00:02:45.510> future<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:46.140> know<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.620> truth<00:02:46.830> is

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
making it in future I know the truth is

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.979 
making it in future I know the truth is
I<00:02:47.370> really<00:02:47.820> don't<00:02:48.150> know<00:02:48.209> much<00:02:48.450> about<00:02:48.510> this

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
stuff but it's just like it seems like a

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.750 
stuff but it's just like it seems like a
reasonable<00:02:51.810> way<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.230> go<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.500> just<00:02:52.680> strip<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
reasonable way to go I just strip the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.580 
reasonable way to go I just strip the
leaves<00:02:53.880> office<00:02:54.180> yeah<00:02:54.570> strip<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.230> leaves<00:02:55.380> off

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
the stems it seems pretty quickly the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.960 
the stems it seems pretty quickly the
stinging<00:02:57.390> actually<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.380> no<00:02:59.340> big<00:02:59.550> deal<00:02:59.580> it's

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
stinging actually is no big deal it's

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.250 
stinging actually is no big deal it's
like<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.269> freaked<00:03:00.480> out<00:03:00.630> at<00:03:00.780> first<00:03:00.810> but<00:03:01.200> then

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
like you freaked out at first but then

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.590 
like you freaked out at first but then
you're<00:03:01.500> like<00:03:01.530> wait<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.920> second<00:03:02.310> here<00:03:02.370> that's

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
you're like wait a second here that's

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.699 
you're like wait a second here that's
that's<00:03:03.600> just<00:03:03.840> like<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.019> little<00:03:04.320> tingling

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
that's just like a little tingling

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.440 
that's just like a little tingling
sensation<00:03:05.370> that's<00:03:05.430> no<00:03:05.700> joke<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.269> actually

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
sensation that's no joke and actually

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.020 
sensation that's no joke and actually
some<00:03:06.810> people<00:03:07.110> equate<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.560> sting<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:08.160> be

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
some people equate the sting to be

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.240 
some people equate the sting to be
similar<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.510> apiary<00:03:10.019> therapy<00:03:10.560> which<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.920> using

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
similar to apiary therapy which is using

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.220 
similar to apiary therapy which is using
these<00:03:11.519> stings<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:13.230> induce<00:03:14.070> killing<00:03:14.750> yeah<00:03:15.750> all

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
these stings to induce killing yeah all

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.320 
these stings to induce killing yeah all
right<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:16.860> good<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.400> think<00:03:17.700> money<00:03:18.120> yeah

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
right so is that good I think money yeah

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330 
right so is that good I think money yeah
it<00:03:18.390> was<00:03:18.510> probably<00:03:18.810> more<00:03:19.110> we<00:03:19.590> overdid<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.070> for

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
it was probably more we overdid it for

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.040 
it was probably more we overdid it for
the<00:03:20.400> camera<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:21.150> if<00:03:21.209> we<00:03:21.269> squish<00:03:21.660> this<00:03:21.810> together

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
the camera so if we squish this together

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
the camera so if we squish this together
would<00:03:22.470> be<00:03:22.500> about<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:23.100> cup<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.489> dried<00:03:23.910> herbs<00:03:25.070> okay

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
would be about a cup of dried herbs okay

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.240 
would be about a cup of dried herbs okay
then<00:03:26.850> we're<00:03:26.940> going<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.150> pour<00:03:27.390> about<00:03:27.630> like

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250
