00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.430
 I agree the sander and in this 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.639
 eye opener we are going to talk about sony's 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.350
 newest flagship the xperia z 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.240
 the screen of the sony xperia z is only 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.030
 preferably 5 inches tall and support 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.830
 1080 p resolution that is 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.170
 similar to the hd tv show 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.910
 now makes the device than 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.040
 immediately a lot bigger 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.320
 that is actually not too bad although the 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.210
 sony xperia z failure of a piece of a larger 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.430
 he is a bit thin and just one 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.219
 fraction heavy that beautiful screen 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.079
 supported by a 1080 p hd camera 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.170
 So that your photos and videos 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.640
 Full HD quality can be a thanks 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.319

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.620
 no more worries or the environment 

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:50.539
 too light or too dark is what their 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.890
 technology known from sony 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.170

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.079
 sound quality to your movies and music 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.960

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.960
 a point 5 gigahertz quadcore processor 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.549
 enormously smooth running after all that 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.510
 specifications of course very nice 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.670
 and one of the more interesting ones 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.280
 things of the xperia z is that he 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.470
 half an hour is waterproof long 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.470

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.090
