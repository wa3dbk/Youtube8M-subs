 where they want and they publish it clearly 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.590
 because the question I'm going to make a video 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.060
 or I'm going to group several questions if 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.380
 they have a lot to do with each other what 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.149
 they have made them and answering in 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.619
 based on my opinions my experiences the 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.820
 information that I have trying 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.530
 always quote the sources in the 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.869

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.119
 vegan hashtag flash tamo responds by 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.710
 Of course I do not say of course 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.880
 if you do not know come flash I invite you to 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.880
 that you see it clicking here 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.270
 come on, it's not going to replace vean 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.920
 flash even when you touch the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.479
 same or similar issues what happens that 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.610
 how each video accrue flash mission 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.229
 a lot of time for research the 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.459
 script production and so on 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.569
 it happened that instead of answering for 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:54.890
 written the questions that are me 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.959
 leaving social networks in the channel 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.090
 answer them through videos is going to be 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.830
 much faster informal much less 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.709
 production does not go until saw nothing or neither 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.909
 nothing like that you do not drop a crap but it goes 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.799
 to serve to dispel your doubts 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.970
 quickly and to be able to share it 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.500
 in response every time they see that 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.880
 They are the same topic at any side 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.770
