00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
should I say iPhones when these come out

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.410 
should I say iPhones when these come out
this<00:00:19.439> could<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:20.130> one<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.640> most<00:00:20.820> exciting

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
this could be one of the most exciting

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.560 
this could be one of the most exciting
iPhone<00:00:22.109> launches<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.460> long<00:00:23.880> time<00:00:24.240> because

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
iPhone launches in a long time because

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.929 
iPhone launches in a long time because
these<00:00:25.320> speculations<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.760> don't

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
these speculations that we have we don't

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:27.920 
these speculations that we have we don't
have<00:00:27.060> too<00:00:27.449> much

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
have too much

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.900 
have too much
I'm<00:00:28.170> noting<00:00:28.619> about<00:00:28.740> like<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.160> specs<00:00:29.640> or

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
I'm noting about like the specs or

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.550 
I'm noting about like the specs or
anything<00:00:30.150> like<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.320> can<00:00:31.470> assume

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
anything like that but we can assume

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.160 
anything like that but we can assume
it's<00:00:32.009> gonna<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.610> new<00:00:32.790> Apple<00:00:33.239> a8<00:00:33.690> chip

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
it's gonna have the new Apple a8 chip

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.380 
it's gonna have the new Apple a8 chip
because<00:00:34.680> they<00:00:34.950> always<00:00:35.130> move<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.460> by<00:00:35.610> one<00:00:35.640> it's

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
because they always move up by one it's

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.030 
because they always move up by one it's
probably<00:00:36.630> gonna<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.110> know<00:00:37.200> twice<00:00:37.530> as<00:00:37.739> fast

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
probably gonna be you know twice as fast

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.330 
probably gonna be you know twice as fast
and<00:00:38.460> Apple<00:00:39.360> always<00:00:39.660> tosses<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.800> something

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
and Apple always tosses in something

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.549 
and Apple always tosses in something
completely<00:00:41.430> new<00:00:42.000> last<00:00:42.360> time<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.930> was<00:00:43.020> touch<00:00:43.260> ID

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
completely new last time it was touch ID

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.590 
completely new last time it was touch ID
so<00:00:44.460> there's<00:00:44.670> always<00:00:44.820> gonna<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.270> something

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
so there's always gonna be something

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.389 
so there's always gonna be something
that's<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:46.110> brand<00:00:46.410> new<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> phone

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that's like brand new on the phone

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.729 
that's like brand new on the phone
but<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.910> biggest<00:00:48.200> speculation<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.469> have

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
but the biggest speculation that we have

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.340 
but the biggest speculation that we have
as<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.309> now<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.180> Apple<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
as of now is that Apple is going to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.880 
as of now is that Apple is going to
release<00:00:52.710> two<00:00:53.190> iPhones<00:00:53.899> when<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> iPhone<00:00:55.230> 5

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
release two iPhones when the iPhone 5

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.170 
release two iPhones when the iPhone 5
when<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> iPhone<00:00:56.640> 6

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
when the iPhone 6

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.540 
when the iPhone 6
excuse<00:00:57.539> me<00:00:57.719> comes<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.070> they<00:00:59.340> did

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
excuse me comes out just like they did

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.939 
excuse me comes out just like they did
this<00:00:59.699> time<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.239> 5s<00:01:00.719> they<00:01:01.170> also<00:01:01.350> came<00:01:01.770> out

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
this time with a 5s they also came out

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.520 
this time with a 5s they also came out
with<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.280> iPhone<00:01:02.399> 5c<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.539> even<00:01:04.019> though<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
with the iPhone 5c and even though the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.640 
with the iPhone 5c and even though the
iPhone<00:01:05.040> 5c<00:01:05.760> was<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> disappointment<00:01:07.049> because

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
iPhone 5c was a disappointment because

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.980 
iPhone 5c was a disappointment because
it<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.280> made<00:01:08.460> out<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.640> plastic<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.810> had

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
it was made out of plastic and it had

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.750 
it was made out of plastic and it had
bad<00:01:10.290> specs<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.040> was<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.310> only<00:01:11.490> thing

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
bad specs that was the only thing

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.450 
bad specs that was the only thing
different<00:01:12.210> about<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.630> 5s<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.320> 5c<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
different about the 5s and the 5c and it

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
different about the 5s and the 5c and it
wasn't<00:01:14.640> even<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.030> cheap<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.200> was<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
wasn't even that cheap so it was a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.160 
wasn't even that cheap so it was a
disappointment<00:01:17.369> at<00:01:17.700> Apple<00:01:18.090> also<00:01:18.540> saw<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.869> in

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
disappointment at Apple also saw that in

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.249 
disappointment at Apple also saw that in
the<00:01:19.259> sales<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.729> shows<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.479> Apple<00:01:22.140> is

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the sales but it shows that Apple is

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.870 
the sales but it shows that Apple is
trying<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.710> do<00:01:22.860> something<00:01:23.220> new<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.460> mean<00:01:23.759> they

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
trying to do something new I mean they

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.090 
trying to do something new I mean they
came<00:01:24.090> out<00:01:24.270> with<00:01:24.330> two<00:01:24.720> new<00:01:25.020> iPhones<00:01:25.200> at<00:01:25.740> once

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
came out with two new iPhones at once

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.039 
came out with two new iPhones at once
I'm<00:01:26.580> gonna<00:01:26.909> think<00:01:27.060> about<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.540> that's<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.780> big

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
I'm gonna think about it that's a big

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.100 
I'm gonna think about it that's a big
step<00:01:28.549> so<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.150> hopes<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> next

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
step so we have hopes that with the next

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
step so we have hopes that with the next
iPhone<00:01:31.590> they're<00:01:32.130> going<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.549> do<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> same

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
iPhone they're going to do the same

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.030 
iPhone they're going to do the same
thing<00:01:33.299> release<00:01:33.720> two<00:01:34.110> iPhones<00:01:34.380> at<00:01:34.799> once

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
thing release two iPhones at once

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.800 
thing release two iPhones at once
because<00:01:35.670> they<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:35.909> make<00:01:36.060> extra<00:01:36.780> money

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
because they do make extra money

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.050 
because they do make extra money
obviously<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> business<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.790> that's<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
obviously in the business so that's a

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.719 
obviously in the business so that's a
motivation<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:40.320> once<00:01:40.860> again<00:01:41.040> they<00:01:41.369> saw<00:01:41.579> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
motivation but once again they saw that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.539 
motivation but once again they saw that
the<00:01:41.850> iPhone<00:01:42.240> 5c<00:01:42.899> was<00:01:43.229> failed<00:01:43.680> because<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.340> was

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the iPhone 5c was failed because it was

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.310 
the iPhone 5c was failed because it was
made<00:01:44.700> out<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.939> plastic<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.780> wasn't<00:01:45.990> too

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
made out of plastic and it wasn't too

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.620 
made out of plastic and it wasn't too
different<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.979> all<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.729> hopefully<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.329> time

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
different at all but hopefully this time

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.240 
different at all but hopefully this time
they're<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.259> change<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:49.950> they

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
they're going to change it because they

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.639 
they're going to change it because they
saw<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.670> was<00:01:50.820> bad<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.960> whole<00:01:52.079> concept

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
saw that was bad but the whole concept

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.490 
saw that was bad but the whole concept
of<00:01:52.920> two<00:01:53.159> iPhones<00:01:53.340> at<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> time<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.360> good<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
of two iPhones at a time is good so the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.280 
of two iPhones at a time is good so the
speculations<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:57.000> now<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.689> Apple<00:01:58.110> is

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290

speculations as of now is that Apple is
going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.770> come<00:01:59.100> out<00:01:59.280> with<00:01:59.880> two<00:02:00.360> iPhones<00:02:00.659> about

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
eight nine months from now at the same

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.450 
eight nine months from now at the same
time<00:02:03.240> they<00:02:03.420> always<00:02:03.600> come<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:03.810> new<00:02:04.110> iPhones<00:02:04.590> so

time they always come out new iPhones so

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.330 
time they always come out new iPhones so

one is going to be a big iPhone and one

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.369 
one is going to be a big iPhone and one
is<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.940> be<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> small<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> small<00:02:10.170> one

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
is going to be the same

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.399 
is going to be the same
is<00:02:12.189> that<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.519> iPhone<00:02:12.909> is<00:02:13.120> now<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:14.049> like<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
is that the iPhone is now so like the

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.280 
is that the iPhone is now so like the
iPhone<00:02:14.799> 5s<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.430> 5c<00:02:15.640> it's<00:02:16.599> going<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.019> be<00:02:17.140> that

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
iPhone 5s and 5c it's going to be that

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.670 
iPhone 5s and 5c it's going to be that
same<00:02:17.560> size<00:02:17.860> display<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:19.030> basic<00:02:19.810> iPhone<00:02:20.260> 6

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
same size display the basic iPhone 6

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.069 
same size display the basic iPhone 6
let's<00:02:20.950> call<00:02:21.189> it<00:02:21.480> but<00:02:22.480> it's<00:02:22.659> going<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.930> have

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
let's call it but it's going to have

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.619 
let's call it but it's going to have
some<00:02:23.379> cosmetic<00:02:24.010> changes<00:02:24.040> obviously<00:02:24.640> but<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
some cosmetic changes obviously but the

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.809 
some cosmetic changes obviously but the
second<00:02:26.170> iPhone<00:02:26.890> is<00:02:27.129> going<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.610> be<00:02:27.700> the

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
second iPhone is going to be the

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.420 
second iPhone is going to be the
fascinating<00:02:28.510> one<00:02:28.690> because<00:02:29.019> this<00:02:29.290> one<00:02:29.590> should

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
fascinating one because this one should

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.100 
fascinating one because this one should
be<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.959> 5-inch<00:02:31.959> display<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:34.209> awesome

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
be a 5-inch display and that is awesome

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.589 
be a 5-inch display and that is awesome
because<00:02:35.560> most<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.220> iPhones<00:02:36.700> competition

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
because most of the iPhones competition

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.890 
because most of the iPhones competition
is<00:02:37.859> also<00:02:38.859> a<00:02:38.890> 5-inch<00:02:39.730> display<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:40.510> all<00:02:40.720> the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
is also a 5-inch display like all the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.490 
is also a 5-inch display like all the
Samsung<00:02:41.439> devices<00:02:41.859> and<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.730> HTC<00:02:43.269> One<00:02:43.540> well

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
Samsung devices and the HTC One well

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.670 
Samsung devices and the HTC One well
technically<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.129> HTC<00:02:45.730> One<00:02:46.000> isn't<00:02:46.870> exactly<00:02:47.349> 5

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
technically the HTC One isn't exactly 5

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.740 
technically the HTC One isn't exactly 5
inches<00:02:48.129> but<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.370> get<00:02:48.579> the<00:02:48.700> idea<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.629> it's

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
inches but you get the idea so it's

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.259 
inches but you get the idea so it's
going<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.079> be<00:02:50.379> able<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.859> easily<00:02:51.220> now<00:02:51.760> compete

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
going to be able to easily now compete

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.270 
going to be able to easily now compete
with<00:02:52.450> those<00:02:52.569> phones<00:02:52.959> because<00:02:53.409> the<00:02:53.560> display<00:02:53.980> on

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
with those phones because the display on

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.599 
with those phones because the display on
the<00:02:54.760> second<00:02:55.180> iPhone<00:02:55.569> should<00:02:55.599> be<00:02:56.019> big<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.709> like

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
the second iPhone should be big and like

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.539 
the second iPhone should be big and like
we<00:02:57.790> saw<00:02:58.030> with<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.329> iPads<00:02:59.109> and<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.220> guys<00:03:00.340> know

ago LT Mini and the full-size and this

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.440 
ago LT Mini and the full-size and this
time<00:03:05.170> Apple<00:03:05.680> did<00:03:05.889> something<00:03:06.370> that's<00:03:06.519> good

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
time Apple did something that's good

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.170 
time Apple did something that's good
they<00:03:08.109> made<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:09.040> mini<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.639> full-size

they made the mini and the full-size

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.839 
they made the mini and the full-size
iPad<00:03:10.480> have<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.290> same<00:03:11.620> exact<00:03:12.190> specs<00:03:12.519> on<00:03:12.730> the

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
iPad have the same exact specs on the

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.059 
iPad have the same exact specs on the
inside<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.359> latest<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:13.930> best<00:03:14.139> specs<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.829> both

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
inside the latest and best specs to both

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.610 
inside the latest and best specs to both
the<00:03:15.310> mini<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.819> full-size<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.410> gives

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
the mini and the full-size so that gives

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.710 
the mini and the full-size so that gives
us<00:03:17.769> hope<00:03:18.099> that<00:03:18.129> with<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.579> iPhones<00:03:19.150> they're

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
us hope that with the iPhones they're

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.110 
us hope that with the iPhones they're
going<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.049> do<00:03:20.169> the<00:03:20.290> same<00:03:20.560> because<00:03:21.489> once<00:03:21.970> again

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
going to do the same because once again

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.729 
going to do the same because once again
with<00:03:22.389> the<00:03:22.480> iPhone<00:03:22.870> 5s<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.680> 5c<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:24.849> 5c<00:03:25.419> had

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
with the iPhone 5s and 5c the 5c had

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.800 
with the iPhone 5s and 5c the 5c had
blast<00:03:26.739> gen<00:03:27.129> specs<00:03:27.609> inside<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.090> bit<00:03:28.389> so<00:03:28.599> it

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
blast gen specs inside a bit so it

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.809 
blast gen specs inside a bit so it
wasn't<00:03:29.139> that<00:03:29.169> good<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.769> showed<00:03:30.459> it<00:03:30.609> in<00:03:30.699> the

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
wasn't that good and showed it in the

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.240 
wasn't that good and showed it in the
sales<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:31.690> that's<00:03:31.870> why<00:03:32.109> with<00:03:32.319> the<00:03:32.440> new<00:03:32.739> iPads

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
sales so that's why with the new iPads

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.520 
sales so that's why with the new iPads
the<00:03:33.489> mini<00:03:33.699> and<00:03:33.849> the<00:03:33.910> full-size<00:03:34.120> they<00:03:35.079> put<00:03:35.440> the

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
the mini and the full-size they put the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.189 
the mini and the full-size they put the
best<00:03:35.799> latest<00:03:36.340> specs<00:03:36.970> on<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.359> inside<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.049> the

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.199 
best latest specs on the inside and the

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.960 
best latest specs on the inside and the
both<00:03:38.440> even<00:03:38.949> when<00:03:39.099> it<00:03:39.190> comes<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.489> specs<00:03:39.819> the

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
both even when it comes to specs the

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.360 
both even when it comes to specs the
only<00:03:40.269> difference<00:03:40.690> is<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.169> size<00:03:41.440> so<00:03:41.889> hopefully

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
only difference is the size so hopefully

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.729 
only difference is the size so hopefully
once<00:03:42.639> again<00:03:42.940> with<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.389> new<00:03:43.540> iPhones<00:03:44.019> they're

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
once again with the new iPhones they're

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.250 
once again with the new iPhones they're
going<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.160> both<00:03:45.430> have<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:46.030> latest<00:03:46.269> best<00:03:46.870> specs

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
going to both have the latest best specs
