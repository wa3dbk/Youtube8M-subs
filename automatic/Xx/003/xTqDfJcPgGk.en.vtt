00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.740 
Akron area I guess the best analogy I
could<00:03:26.590> make<00:03:26.739> Michaels<00:03:27.220> is<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.330> would<00:03:28.450> be<00:03:28.569> like

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
could make Michaels is it would be like

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.710 
could make Michaels is it would be like
moving<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.680> masters<00:03:30.160> from<00:03:30.549> Augusta<00:03:31.299> National
