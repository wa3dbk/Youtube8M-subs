playing<00:01:50.209> with<00:01:50.450> a<00:01:50.479> metronome<00:01:50.950> it's<00:01:51.950> just<00:01:52.130> the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
playing with a metronome it's just the

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.219 
playing with a metronome it's just the
band<00:01:52.670> that<00:01:53.119> you're<00:01:53.299> listening<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.780> is<00:01:53.899> also

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
band that you're listening to is also

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.690 
band that you're listening to is also
playing<00:01:54.770> with<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:54.979> metronome<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.579> you're

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
playing with the metronome and you're

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.330 
playing with the metronome and you're
just<00:01:55.909> listening<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.450> band<00:01:57.280> now<00:01:58.280> the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
just listening to the band now the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.370 
just listening to the band now the
downfall<00:01:58.909> of<00:01:58.939> course<00:01:59.329> is<00:01:59.509> that<00:01:59.659> if<00:01:59.989> you<00:02:00.200> want

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
downfall of course is that if you want

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.569 
downfall of course is that if you want
to<00:02:00.409> practice<00:02:00.649> something<00:02:01.130> in<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.310> specific

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
tempo it's not as easy to do that with a

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.949 
tempo it's not as easy to do that with a
with<00:02:06.259> a<00:02:06.289> song<00:02:06.619> but<00:02:07.610> just<00:02:08.299> to<00:02:08.420> get<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.599> groove
