00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
basically right now that all they're

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.359 
basically right now that all they're
doing<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.810> beefing<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> steam<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.799> that's

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
doing is beefing up the steam and that's

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.649 
doing is beefing up the steam and that's
what<00:01:44.549> apparently<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.149> taking<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.630> long

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
what apparently is taking so long

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.999 
what apparently is taking so long
apparently<00:01:46.439> they<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> issues

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
apparently they have the issues

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.260 
apparently they have the issues
apparently<00:01:47.220> they've<00:01:47.520> countered<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> issues

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
apparently they've countered the issues

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.060 
apparently they've countered the issues
and<00:01:48.420> now<00:01:48.509> they're<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.869> completely<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.500> guess

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
and now they're just completely I guess

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.580 
and now they're just completely I guess
rebuilding<00:01:50.790> or<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.420> know<00:01:51.540> adding<00:01:52.470> more

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
rebuilding or you know adding more

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.719 
rebuilding or you know adding more
protection<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.340> they<00:01:53.430> had<00:01:53.579> before

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
protection to what they had before

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.100 
protection to what they had before
because<00:01:54.030> apparently<00:01:54.450> something<00:01:54.810> went<00:01:54.840> wrong

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
because apparently something went wrong

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.929 
because apparently something went wrong
so<00:01:55.799> apparently<00:01:56.009> that's<00:01:56.369> what<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:56.670> coming

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
so apparently that's what it's coming

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.370 
so apparently that's what it's coming
down<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.479> that's<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> main<00:01:58.110> issue

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
down to is that's what the main issue

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.959 
down to is that's what the main issue
with<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.770> as<00:01:58.979> towards<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.460> date<00:01:59.670> when<00:01:59.850> this

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
with this as towards a date when this

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.630 
with this as towards a date when this
should<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.270> up<00:02:00.500> one<00:02:01.500> guy<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.979> told<00:02:02.399> me<00:02:02.520> was

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640

should be up one guy I know told me was
supposed<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:02.969> about<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.210> 25th<00:02:03.630> 26th<00:02:04.110> one

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
guy told me this was to be like the 30th

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.240

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
down I mean they can't even give us an

down I mean they can't even give us an
you<00:02:11.489> know<00:02:11.610> guesstimation<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.390> towards<00:02:12.629> when

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
you know guesstimation is towards when

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.820

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
noticed in this game play half the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.340 
noticed in this game play half the
people<00:03:12.450> on<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.660> other<00:03:12.750> team<00:03:12.840> were<00:03:13.050> used<00:03:13.230> in

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
people on the other team were used in

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.540 
people on the other team were used in
second<00:03:13.620> chance<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.010> goes<00:03:14.130> back<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.430> my

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
second chance and it goes back to my

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.940 
second chance and it goes back to my
theory<00:03:14.880> about<00:03:14.910> xbox<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.690> ps3<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:16.290> lot<00:03:16.800> more

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
theory about xbox and ps3 a lot more

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.130 
theory about xbox and ps3 a lot more
people<00:03:17.310> on<00:03:17.459> xbox<00:03:17.610> use<00:03:18.120> ghost<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.780> lot<00:03:19.019> more

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
people on xbox use ghost a lot more

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.290 
people on xbox use ghost a lot more
people<00:03:19.500> on<00:03:19.590> ps3<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:20.010> second<00:03:20.400> chance<00:03:20.580> this<00:03:21.150> is

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
people on ps3 you second chance this is

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.210 
people on ps3 you second chance this is
a<00:03:21.330> great<00:03:21.540> example<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:22.170> find<00:03:22.620> second<00:03:22.950> chance<00:03:23.070> is

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
a great example I find second chance is

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.550 
a great example I find second chance is
rarely<00:03:23.430> used<00:03:23.580> on<00:03:23.910> 360<00:03:24.480> compared<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.900> ps3<00:03:25.140> I

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
rarely used on 360 compared to ps3 I

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.960 
rarely used on 360 compared to ps3 I
mean<00:03:25.920> it's<00:03:26.040> not<00:03:26.130> even<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.400> comparison<00:03:26.850> that's

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
mean it's not even in comparison that's

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.490 
mean it's not even in comparison that's
a<00:03:27.060> guaranteed<00:03:27.420> fact<00:03:27.690> more<00:03:27.900> people<00:03:28.200> use<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.350> on

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
a guaranteed fact more people use it on

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.800 
a guaranteed fact more people use it on
ps3<00:03:28.650> than<00:03:29.040> they<00:03:29.130> do<00:03:29.190> on<00:03:29.280> 360<00:03:29.820> and<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.510> can<00:03:30.660> say

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
ps3 than they do on 360 and I can say

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.449 
ps3 than they do on 360 and I can say
about<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.110> same<00:03:31.260> thing<00:03:31.470> for<00:03:31.590> ghosts<00:03:31.800> on<00:03:31.950> 360

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
about the same thing for ghosts on 360

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.190 
about the same thing for ghosts on 360
both<00:03:33.239> of<00:03:33.360> them<00:03:33.480> are<00:03:33.540> equally<00:03:33.750> ignoring

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
both of them are equally ignoring

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.870 
both of them are equally ignoring
there's<00:03:34.350> not<00:03:34.500> like<00:03:35.040> one<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.519> I<00:03:35.580> hate<00:03:35.700> more

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
there's not like one that I hate more

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.670 
there's not like one that I hate more
than<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.090> other<00:03:36.209> but<00:03:36.480> it's<00:03:37.170> kind<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.560> it's

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
than the other but it's kind of a it's

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.900 
than the other but it's kind of a it's
kind<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:38.010> shit<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.340> face<00:03:38.519> when<00:03:38.760> you're

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
kind of a shit in the face when you're

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.400 
kind of a shit in the face when you're
actually<00:03:39.030> like<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.300> sniper<00:03:39.570> so<00:03:40.019> ps3<00:03:40.350> is

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
actually like a sniper so ps3 is

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.690 
actually like a sniper so ps3 is
probably<00:03:40.620> not<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.769> best<00:03:40.860> system<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.340> snipe<00:03:41.519> on

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
probably not the best system to snipe on

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.040 
probably not the best system to snipe on
because<00:03:41.940> when<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.180> snipe<00:03:42.420> somebody<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:42.989> get

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
because when you snipe somebody and get

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.930 
because when you snipe somebody and get
a<00:03:43.110> second<00:03:43.470> chance<00:03:43.500> or<00:03:43.860> something<00:03:44.190> just<00:03:44.820> like

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
a second chance or something just like

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.640 
a second chance or something just like
that<00:03:45.120> right<00:03:45.239> there<00:03:45.300> it's<00:03:45.870> kind<00:03:46.050> of<00:03:46.200> shit<00:03:46.470> I

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
that right there it's kind of shit I

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.870 
that right there it's kind of shit I
mean<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:46.920> know<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.160> can<00:03:47.310> end<00:03:47.430> up<00:03:47.519> picking<00:03:47.670> the

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880
