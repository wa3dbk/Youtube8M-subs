00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.009 

so<00:00:08.910> my<00:00:09.090> brother<00:00:09.300> asked<00:00:09.570> me<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.750> make<00:00:09.870> this

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
so my brother asked me to make this

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.080 
so my brother asked me to make this
video<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.679> if<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.830> see<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.280> says<00:00:11.490> searching

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
video and if you see it says searching

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.420 
video and if you see it says searching
and<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.870> shows<00:00:13.170> two<00:00:14.040> bars<00:00:15.500> so<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:16.770> it's<00:00:17.070> kind

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
and it shows two bars so it's it's kind

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.580 
and it shows two bars so it's it's kind
of<00:00:17.580> seeing<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:19.070> signal<00:00:20.070> but<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.520> can't<00:00:20.760> connect

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
of seeing a signal but it can't connect

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.689 
of seeing a signal but it can't connect
and<00:00:22.590> if<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.920> come<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.930> the<00:00:24.930> phone's<00:00:25.699> show

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and if you come in to the phone's show

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.080 
and if you come in to the phone's show
the<00:00:26.849> signal<00:00:27.240> level

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:41.930 

so<00:00:35.340> what<00:00:36.340> I<00:00:36.370> did<00:00:36.490> was<00:00:37.030> I<00:00:37.510> installed<00:00:38.050> an<00:00:38.200> app

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.010 

called<00:00:42.660> open<00:00:43.109> signal

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:57.459 

and<00:00:47.590> what<00:00:47.740> it<00:00:47.860> does<00:00:48.040> is<00:00:48.460> it

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.849 

so<00:00:58.160> what<00:00:58.340> it<00:00:58.460> does<00:00:58.489> is<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:58.940> gives<00:00:59.149> you<00:00:59.300> this

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
so what it does is it gives you this

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
so what it does is it gives you this
compass

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.820 

so<00:01:05.379> you<00:01:05.440> go<00:01:05.710> outside<00:01:05.890> and<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.960> walk<00:01:08.230> around<00:01:08.590> so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
so you go outside and you walk around so

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.760 
so you go outside and you walk around so
I<00:01:08.860> can<00:01:09.100> get<00:01:09.220> a<00:01:09.840> bearing<00:01:10.840> on<00:01:11.140> where<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.560> cell

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
I can get a bearing on where the cell

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.440 
I can get a bearing on where the cell
tower<00:01:12.010> is<00:01:12.280> and<00:01:12.490> it<00:01:12.550> will<00:01:12.640> point<00:01:12.850> right<00:01:13.060> at<00:01:13.270> it

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
tower is and it will point right at it

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.740 
tower is and it will point right at it
and<00:01:15.660> so<00:01:16.660> basically<00:01:17.229> for<00:01:17.770> me<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:19.210> cell<00:01:19.479> tower

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
and so basically for me the cell tower

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.859 
and so basically for me the cell tower
is<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:23.500> out<00:01:23.770> that<00:01:24.010> way<00:01:24.300> from<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.450> corner<00:01:25.720> of<00:01:25.750> my

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
is is out that way from the corner of my

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.710 
is is out that way from the corner of my
house<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.490> what<00:01:27.880> I<00:01:27.910> did<00:01:28.119> was<00:01:28.270> I<00:01:28.360> bought<00:01:28.540> this

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
house so what I did was I bought this

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.880 
house so what I did was I bought this
kit<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:31.000> I<00:01:31.540> went<00:01:31.750> up<00:01:31.840> on<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:31.990> roof<00:01:32.320> to<00:01:32.590> see

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
kit and I went up on the roof to see

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.650 
kit and I went up on the roof to see
where<00:01:33.130> I<00:01:33.369> was<00:01:33.580> getting<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:34.000> strongest<00:01:34.450> signal

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
where I was getting the strongest signal

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.570 
where I was getting the strongest signal
I<00:01:35.050> thought<00:01:35.590> it<00:01:35.680> would<00:01:35.770> be<00:01:35.979> going<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.369> be<00:01:36.460> this

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
I thought it would be going to be this

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.790 
I thought it would be going to be this
corner<00:01:36.970> but<00:01:37.149> it<00:01:37.270> actually<00:01:37.420> ends<00:01:37.780> up<00:01:37.899> being<00:01:38.590> the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
corner but it actually ends up being the

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.180 
corner but it actually ends up being the
peak<00:01:39.660> so<00:01:40.660> I<00:01:40.720> installed<00:01:41.050> an<00:01:41.229> antenna<00:01:41.560> at<00:01:41.950> the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
peak so I installed an antenna at the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.999 
peak so I installed an antenna at the
top<00:01:42.399> and<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.990> cables<00:01:44.350> running<00:01:44.590> down<00:01:44.770> I'll

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
top and the cables running down I'll

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.420 
top and the cables running down I'll
clean<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:45.610> up<00:01:45.790> later

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
clean it up later

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.730 
clean it up later
so<00:01:48.430> cable<00:01:49.090> comes<00:01:49.270> in<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:50.080> plugs<00:01:50.290> into<00:01:50.530> this

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
so cable comes in and it plugs into this

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.950 
so cable comes in and it plugs into this
box

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
box

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.719 
box
that's<00:01:52.960> not<00:01:53.170> plugged<00:01:53.410> in<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.950> power<00:01:54.160> right<00:01:54.430> now

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
that's not plugged in to power right now

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.520 
that's not plugged in to power right now
and<00:01:54.820> then<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.240> output<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:55.660> that<00:01:56.490> comes<00:01:57.490> over

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
and then the output of that comes over

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.770 
and then the output of that comes over
an<00:01:59.530> internal<00:02:00.310> antenna<00:02:00.700> that<00:02:01.119> is<00:02:01.330> currently

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
an internal antenna that is currently

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.020 
an internal antenna that is currently
just<00:02:02.560> sitting<00:02:02.920> on<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.100> counter<00:02:03.340> eventually

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
just sitting on the counter eventually

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.880 
just sitting on the counter eventually
it's<00:02:04.210> going<00:02:04.300> to<00:02:04.360> get<00:02:04.539> mounted<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:05.200> think<00:02:05.770> they

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
it's going to get mounted I think they

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.960 
it's going to get mounted I think they
want<00:02:06.070> you<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.220> mount<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.520> on<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.729> ceiling

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
want you to mount it on the ceiling

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.139 
want you to mount it on the ceiling
pointing<00:02:07.810> down<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:09.670> they're<00:02:09.820> eating<00:02:10.000> right

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
pointing down but they're eating right

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.940 
pointing down but they're eating right
now<00:02:10.179> it's<00:02:10.540> playing<00:02:10.810> towards<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.530> other<00:02:11.650> rooms

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
now it's playing towards the other rooms

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.699 
now it's playing towards the other rooms
and<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.250> actually<00:02:12.519> works<00:02:12.670> really<00:02:12.790> well<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.709> let

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
and it actually works really well so let

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:35.500 
and it actually works really well so let
me<00:02:14.890> go<00:02:15.400> plug<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.790> in

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.960 

and<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.900> come<00:02:37.080> back<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.500> bathroom<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.820> can

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
and I come back in the bathroom you can

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.450 
and I come back in the bathroom you can
see<00:02:39.120> online<00:02:39.300> simple<00:02:39.780> mobile<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:41.220> full

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
see online simple mobile and a full

00:02:41.460 --> 00:03:00.770 
see online simple mobile and a full
signal

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.610 

and<00:03:02.120> even<00:03:03.120> if<00:03:03.210> I<00:03:03.300> take<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.750> into<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
and even if I take this into the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:14.300 
and even if I take this into the
bedrooms<00:03:05.130> which<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.300> farthest<00:03:06.510> corner<00:03:13.310> no

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
bedrooms which is the farthest corner no

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.360 
bedrooms which is the farthest corner no
line<00:03:14.550> goes<00:03:14.760> up<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:15.000> 83<00:03:16.790> which<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:17.970> really<00:03:18.720> good

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
line goes up to 83 which is really good

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.590 
line goes up to 83 which is really good
since<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.550> usually<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.090> don't<00:03:21.240> even<00:03:21.330> get<00:03:21.540> a

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
since I usually I don't even get a

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.290 
since I usually I don't even get a
signal<00:03:21.840> in<00:03:22.110> here<00:03:22.640> even<00:03:23.640> if<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.820> go<00:03:23.970> into<00:03:24.150> the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
signal in here even if I go into the

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:33.199 
signal in here even if I go into the
kids<00:03:24.510> bedroom<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:31.610> I've<00:03:32.610> been<00:03:32.790> able<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.060> walk

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
kids bedroom and I've been able to walk

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.479 
kids bedroom and I've been able to walk
around<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.570> entire<00:03:33.630> house<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.380> not<00:03:35.130> drop<00:03:35.459> a

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
around the entire house and not drop a

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.320 
around the entire house and not drop a
call<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.030> be<00:03:36.390> crystal<00:03:37.110> clear
