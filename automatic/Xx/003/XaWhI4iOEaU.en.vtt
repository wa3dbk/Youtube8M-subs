potential<00:05:16.230> for<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.410> Undertaker<00:05:16.590> is<00:05:16.800> still

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
potential for the Undertaker is still

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.370 
potential for the Undertaker is still
not<00:05:17.160> really<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.550> be<00:05:17.640> available<00:05:18.120> there<00:05:18.380> it

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
not really to be available there it

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.510 
not really to be available there it
still<00:05:19.650> seems<00:05:19.860> like<00:05:20.100> there's<00:05:20.280> a<00:05:20.340> lot<00:05:20.460> of

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
still seems like there's a lot of

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.610 
still seems like there's a lot of
options<00:05:21.000> open<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.300> be<00:05:21.750> and<00:05:21.960> it<00:05:22.110> doesn't<00:05:22.410> seem

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
options open to be and it doesn't seem

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.350 
options open to be and it doesn't seem
like<00:05:22.680> they<00:05:23.220> are<00:05:23.520> cutting<00:05:23.910> any<00:05:24.120> of<00:05:24.240> those

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
like they are cutting any of those

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.540 
like they are cutting any of those
options<00:05:24.780> off<00:05:24.930> right<00:05:25.140> now<00:05:25.290> it<00:05:25.740> seems<00:05:26.040> like<00:05:26.190> that

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
options off right now it seems like that

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.740 
options off right now it seems like that
they're<00:05:26.700> going<00:05:26.850> to<00:05:26.910> keep<00:05:27.120> as<00:05:27.300> many<00:05:27.480> of<00:05:27.660> them

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
they're going to keep as many of them

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.800 
they're going to keep as many of them
open<00:05:28.050> for<00:05:28.200> as<00:05:28.560> long<00:05:28.860> as<00:05:28.920> they<00:05:29.310> possibly<00:05:29.580> can<00:05:30.150> so

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
open for as long as they possibly can so

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.450 
open for as long as they possibly can so
if<00:05:31.050> they<00:05:31.200> really<00:05:31.470> want<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:31.950> change<00:05:32.160> their

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
if they really want to change their

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.640 
if they really want to change their

WrestleMania<00:05:34.980> this<00:05:35.310> year<00:05:35.550> they<00:05:36.540> can<00:05:36.780> do<00:05:36.990> so<00:05:37.440> at

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
WrestleMania this year they can do so at

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.620 
WrestleMania this year they can do so at
the<00:05:37.650> moment<00:05:37.800> though<00:05:38.640> I<00:05:38.670> would<00:05:39.090> suggest<00:05:39.240> that

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
the moment though I would suggest that

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.450 
the moment though I would suggest that
it's<00:05:39.840> likely<00:05:40.080> we're<00:05:40.380> going<00:05:40.590> to<00:05:40.710> see<00:05:40.890> Roman
