00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.200
 no for using modifiers standby by creating pseudo forms 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.240
 fractal 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.269
 so we will import five Cubans 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.419
 Then we will spend in matters of doing with us. 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.900
 I would have been selected we even import fabric just think of them 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.800
 to coordinate 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.140
 a point that will serve as a reference 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.170
 then right now selects the cubs are hungry in the blog the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.460
 modifiers 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.460
 we add a colored indicator 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.029
 relative count of certain 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.480
 as to tick the objectors this union will define a small one we have 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.400
 created 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.400
 so we will put for example 30 duplication 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.640
 now we can move another a little 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.540
 to have all the applications 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.820
 so I'm moving with gx and genesis called why move control 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.820
 by fifteen hours 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.250
 So here we have all the duplication 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.630
 we can of course that the esport florence k and proportional so that's going to come 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.370
 step by step 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.750
 natali cube 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.000
 then we can silence and z 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 proulx and the same cultures 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.370
 from there we re selecting Cuba and we go pickets this 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.690
 modifiers 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.690
 so we click on copy 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.310
 then we will make a new tool 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.580
 so who's called a little 0 0% 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.660
 emre selects our tube and we define it is a small 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.110
 as a point of reference 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.110
 then we will move him 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.660
 we will do our rotations with the mayor and the deputies 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.660
 we will do a scan 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.400
 then the crisis 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:14.449
 then in europe gold has still selected our tube and we want 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:15.569
 duplicate 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.569
 again the secular modifier 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.539
 then we will import another one a little 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:27.919
 so is called a small 0 02 euro selects the cube 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:32.159
 and we will define this man who as reference for the third for the 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.899
 third try 14 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.899
 so this time we will put that four duplication 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.189
 so if we ever talk again the donkeys title is good commissions to 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.299
 inside the cube 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.499
 the best is to use tonight 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.129
 the sight take my daughter to do so also besides it is there the best 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.129
 solution 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:03:00.149
 then we will move in this third title 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.119
 we said m dance 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:11.659
 here we have a very good form clinically is increased tenfold
