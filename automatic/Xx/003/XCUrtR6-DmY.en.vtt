 21 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.840
 he knew as before low 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:48.750
 that's tough 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:34.019
 instruments is sorted thomas otto 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:34.019
 Paprika is an upgrade of a fierce 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:49.329
 30 percent less fat and 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:54.150
 Accordingly, none are 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:56.709
 So that's the taste gone 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.629
 there is almost only potatoes left 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:11.379
 stayed or so but the property is 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:15.780
 I had to eat salty paprika powder in front 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.780
 a normal one further communicated 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.039
 I think with throttle ten copies 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.290
 I now I want to think about it 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.270
 not really sorry if I am myself 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:41.340
 simply recommend from the chronic 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:43.410
 free so you want the problems with 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:53.820
 weight or so then you should 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:56.729
 rather less chips do not eat too 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.350
 grab a light product because of it 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.840
 ruined one to bring the taste 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.190
 that does not make fun he understands what 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.190
 me up what i mean 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.229
 rather little and intense than so to speak 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.700
 suffering and to generate the 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.880
 the summary opinion of me too 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.870
 the topic and yes somehow they have 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.030
 to lose some funny ingredients 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:28.260
 funny things like smoke 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:35.669
 flavors or potassium chloride or that very 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:38.700
 Good the sodium 5 rego look or something 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.389
 You have to have good butter milk powder 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:55.460
 First of all, it was not good or good 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:55.460
 Salt for salt is usually 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:08.960
 total purists so that's real 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:08.960
 I do not enjoy anything 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.550
 So how do you see that you buy sorry 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:17.529
 products or do you also find that it 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:22.849
 without contradiction in itself is loud chips 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:30.050
 It would be rather as well as soft-drink liquor 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:34.870
 or so that continues to sit yes and until 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.870
 to the next episode and so on
