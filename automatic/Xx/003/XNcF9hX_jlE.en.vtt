00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
terrible i could not I didn't actually

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.150 
terrible i could not I didn't actually
understand<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.110> meant<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.739> dance<00:00:34.950> on

beats<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.880> took<00:00:35.969> me<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.149> good<00:00:36.239> long<00:00:36.719> year<00:00:36.750> to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
beats so it took me a good long year to

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.170 
beats so it took me a good long year to
actually<00:00:37.829> figure<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.370> out<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:39.149> was

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
actually figure that out and it was

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.500 
actually figure that out and it was
actually<00:00:39.690> when<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.260> was<00:00:40.620> part<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.040> team

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
actually when I was part of a team

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.850 
actually when I was part of a team
figuring<00:00:42.510> uh<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.200> had<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> certain

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
figuring uh and I had to be a certain

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.160 
figuring uh and I had to be a certain
place<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.940> floor<00:00:45.179> at<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.390> certain<00:00:45.539> time<00:00:45.839> in

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
place on the floor at a certain time in

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.869 
place on the floor at a certain time in
the<00:00:46.530> music<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.219> actually<00:00:47.399> was<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:47.670> I

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the music and I actually was like I

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.639 
the music and I actually was like I
really<00:00:48.359> need<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> figure<00:00:48.690> out<00:00:48.839> how<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.469> that

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
really need to figure out how to do that

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.319 
really need to figure out how to do that
so<00:00:49.949> I<00:00:50.010> had<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.159> learn<00:00:50.309> how<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.519> count<00:00:50.699> music<00:00:51.089> and

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
so I had to learn how to count music and

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.060 
so I had to learn how to count music and
started<00:00:51.839> collecting<00:00:52.050> stuff<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.739> listening

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
started collecting stuff and listening

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.590 
started collecting stuff and listening
for<00:00:53.190> things<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.579> they<00:00:53.699> eventually<00:00:54.089> I<00:00:54.480> got

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
for things and they eventually I got

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.020 
for things and they eventually I got
reasonably<00:00:55.499> ok<00:00:55.800> now<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.219> think<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.670> pretty<00:00:56.850> good

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
reasonably ok now I think it pretty good

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.259 
reasonably ok now I think it pretty good
excellent<00:01:00.030> question<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.079> two<00:01:01.670> what<00:01:02.670> made<00:01:03.089> you

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
excellent question or two what made you

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.520 
excellent question or two what made you
fall<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.510> love<00:01:03.629> with<00:01:03.719> swing<00:01:03.960> dancing<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.440> you
