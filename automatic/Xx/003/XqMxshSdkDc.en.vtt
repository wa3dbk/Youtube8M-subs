00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.500
 Hello, let's be with you today 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.450
 try to make a recovery 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.880
 the apparatus will packard specifically this 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.429
 model photosmart 5510 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.520
 This applies to all devices on 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.480
 178 them like that this device is not 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.189
 prints colored kind of like typing and 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.210
 black does not work ie open this 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.349
 we have one nickname, he leaves the replacement position 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.590
 head replacement here we see here 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.360
 178 cartridges take out their cartridges 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.010
 this is ordinary plastic with foam rubber 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.579
 so they dry up almost not 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.350
 can but if only it dries completely 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.520
 remove here we have a chip and bottom on 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.410
 cartridges all here we see 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.180
 fine filter ink that is 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.710
 red blue yellow and black 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.559
 through them we will now try to file 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.280
 washing fluid that ink can 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.799
 dry out under these fine filters 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.200
 cleaning can dry out in the nozzles which 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.939
 are below but below without disassembling we 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.850
 no way so why try to get 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.409
 restore in this way if 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.220
 It will not help then it is necessary 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:25.220
 disassemble the device so neatly I take 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:32.189
 doing a bit of washing on black 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:34.500
 yellow to blue and red and look 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:41.310
 leave if the washing liquid that is 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:43.470
 Here we see that the colors turned red 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.530
 yellow and blue is black too 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.470
 appeared and here we see that 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.140
 our colored liquid is gone that is 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.689
 it means the nozzles are not completely dried 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.790
 the liquid went down trying in black 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.920
 see that the liquid is standing still 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.920
 not absorbed anywhere it says 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.549
 withered so leave u muscles 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.920
 about a day in this position 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.229
 somewhere in two in three I will add 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.420
 to the advantage that it dries and see 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.640
 growth solvents this is dried ink 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.660
 in our head everything is our apparatus night 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.500
 stood doing the cleaning here he gave out 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.069
 such a test 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:28.080
 that is, there is some code here 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:30.720
 color one prints with gaps black 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.090
 there are no colors at all 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.410
 this machine is such an easy cleaning for him 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.150
 will not help through the fine filter 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.040
 on black still nothing passes 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.500
 so we will disassemble and 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.500
 rebuild already separate head
