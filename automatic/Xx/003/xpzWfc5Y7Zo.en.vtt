 th 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.640
 Today is so expensive insurance Taro 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.029
 Last time 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:26.610
 It is something feeling the jazz beat 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:31.439
 Various ways of sorry by Well store also say eh is talked Well 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:35.610
 Was seems I will vary the position of the back-beat or rather gold condition but basically Naco 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.660
 Zun Zun 9 Zun Zun Cum It's just a triple point or a shuffle 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.600
 To feel say 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:45.280
 For now if grasped I feel that there is no problem, but it is also doing well only this 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.780
 Oh dear 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:54.489
 If it is too simple it is 2 simple 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.980
 Well how do what was put to go and really this jazz drama-ish feel to this 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.930
 It can be said that the atmosphere can be put out 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:04.850
 Not try to share the know-how 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.780
 First of all, of course Matsushiro Nakano 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.990
 When going on the left foot of my brother-in-law's ride 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.850
 Well first Hamou this 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.740
 It is a fixed heart 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.439
 First of all, it is important whether you can keep doing, but at the same time these two should be 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.500
 Please practice hard 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.500
 The 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:45.760
 This is the whole Meiko , so to this 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:47.020
 Well, I'm going to want to decorate in various ways, so I'll use it on the left or right foot 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.060
 I do not use it 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:56.500
 Now I'm a thing of how do you say If you go to, but the general story that is basically well 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:00.250
 First of all, when you say decoration, it's tired left first 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.250
 It's wo of tact 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.270
 this 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.910
 Is 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.229
 By all means and I You're jazz good in the large tightly tied poem is the phrase two years is that somehow 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.610
 It is sensuous 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.349
 Well so without thinking too much or it is that like a wonder if not it this way do I put here 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.750
 First I finesse is difficult not say is 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:23.260
 Well- variously try to put in your left hand freely and try to start with 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.819
 Let's play par 4 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.819

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.560
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.680

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.010
 th 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.010
 Bach 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:17.870
 Boo s s But I repeat that many things in a while and say 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:22.670
 to do 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.910
 If you do such a thing, it feels like you want to look in the corner or a bit nowadays 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.990
 It was 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.370
 In in another this is an extension of this extension 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.450
 a 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:37.740
 So right foot also this path looks goods 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:43.470
 I 'm telling you to put it in place 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:48.460
 I think it's difficult to say it properly, but just burn with a good start of the beat 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:54.130
 The soul of Haku and Haku can be put into novels etc. and 7 schools 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.300
 Early liquor down guy and head and or say triple Toikko complain now or rather eight minutes chestnut or main annihilation send it 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.930
 I say it hurts 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.019
 If you do , I will put in something that looks like it 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.120
 Right foot and mark number 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.810
 I will do the ad lib delivered 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.810

 Bach 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:51.430
 It feels like you can do it by bringing it out 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.970
 And it is many things freely in the feeling that Moe E'and I Serve go Without this Well then sphere 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.360
 Or 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.639
 I wonder if the right hand moves a little differently 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:04.520
 What happens if you make a living? 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:05.539
