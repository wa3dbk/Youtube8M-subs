00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
and I was really surprised at how well a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.730 
and I was really surprised at how well a
piece<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.759> cardboard<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.869> provide<00:01:19.170> such<00:01:19.560> an

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
piece of cardboard can provide such an

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.219 
piece of cardboard can provide such an
immersive<00:01:20.100> virtual<00:01:21.030> reality<00:01:21.229> experience

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
immersive virtual reality experience

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.840 
immersive virtual reality experience
essentially<00:01:22.830> what's<00:01:23.009> happening<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.729> you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
essentially what's happening here is you

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.300 
essentially what's happening here is you
have<00:01:23.880> two<00:01:24.240> slightly<00:01:24.630> shifted<00:01:25.290> images<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:26.070> on

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
have two slightly shifted images one on

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.890 
have two slightly shifted images one on
the<00:01:26.520> left<00:01:26.759> side<00:01:26.909> for<00:01:27.119> your<00:01:27.210> left<00:01:27.360> eye<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> one

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the left side for your left eye and one

on the right side for your right eye and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.310 
on the right side for your right eye and
just<00:01:29.909> looking<00:01:30.360> at<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.110> looks

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
just looking at it like this it looks

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.289 
just looking at it like this it looks
pretty<00:01:31.590> plain<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.159> boring<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.909> actually

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
pretty plain and boring it actually

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.300 
pretty plain and boring it actually
doesn't<00:01:33.479> look<00:01:33.630> cool<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:34.920> you

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
doesn't look cool at all but if you

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.640 
doesn't look cool at all but if you
combine<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.850> with<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.570> capabilities<00:01:37.500> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
combine that with the capabilities of

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.920 
combine that with the capabilities of
Google<00:01:37.680> cardboard<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.790> actually<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.750> I

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
Google cardboard you actually get like I

as<00:03:18.050> well<00:03:18.380> in<00:03:18.650> my<00:03:18.709> experience<00:03:19.370> it<00:03:19.550> was<00:03:19.670> best<00:03:19.910> to

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
as well in my experience it was best to

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.120 
as well in my experience it was best to
put<00:03:20.300> a<00:03:20.420> case<00:03:20.780> on<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.320> iPhone<00:03:21.350> before

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
put a case on the iPhone before

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.040 
put a case on the iPhone before
inserting<00:03:22.520> it<00:03:22.700> into<00:03:22.910> cardboard<00:03:23.390> just<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.870> keep

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
inserting it into cardboard just to keep

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.560 
inserting it into cardboard just to keep
a<00:03:24.260> nice<00:03:24.500> snug<00:03:25.040> fit<00:03:25.100> because<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:26.030> device<00:03:26.240> is<00:03:26.510> a

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
a nice snug fit because the device is a

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.650 
a nice snug fit because the device is a
bit<00:03:26.900> smaller<00:03:27.530> than<00:03:27.680> most<00:03:28.040> Android<00:03:28.700> devices<00:03:29.000> so

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
bit smaller than most Android devices so

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.820 
bit smaller than most Android devices so
you<00:03:29.750> can<00:03:29.870> go<00:03:29.959> ahead<00:03:30.020> and<00:03:30.200> fold<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.530> up<00:03:30.650> and

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
you can go ahead and fold it up and

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.470 
you can go ahead and fold it up and
you'll<00:03:31.220> be<00:03:31.250> all<00:03:31.490> set<00:03:31.520> up<00:03:31.970> now<00:03:32.000> keep<00:03:32.330> in<00:03:32.450> mind

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
you'll be all set up now keep in mind

iPhone at this point in time but overall
I<00:03:37.100> found<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.760> VR<00:03:38.450> experience<00:03:39.140> was

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
I found that the VR experience was

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.220 
I found that the VR experience was
pretty<00:03:40.100> comparable<00:03:40.910> to<00:03:41.150> using<00:03:41.660> an<00:03:41.780> Android

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
pretty comparable to using an Android

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.290 
pretty comparable to using an Android
device<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:42.530> there's<00:03:42.980> really<00:03:43.489> not<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.060> lot<00:03:44.270> of

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
device so there's really not a lot of

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.750 
device so there's really not a lot of
sacrifices<00:03:45.050> here<00:03:45.230> besides<00:03:45.620> content<00:03:46.310> which

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
sacrifices here besides content which

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.360 
sacrifices here besides content which
can<00:03:47.120> be<00:03:47.480> fixed<00:03:47.810> one<00:03:48.200> more<00:03:48.470> developers<00:03:48.980> jump<00:03:49.220> on

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
can be fixed one more developers jump on
