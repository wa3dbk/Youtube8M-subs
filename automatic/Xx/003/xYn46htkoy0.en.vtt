00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.070
 2 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.090
 th 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.090
 me 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:20.200
 The application reflects what you thought 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:24.450
 Believing what you think affects the reality as it is 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.450
 The protagonist of your life is you 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:39.500
 It has a great deal of subconscious power to realize your thoughts 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:39.500
 Once the subconscious receives the message it starts to move towards realization 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:52.640
 The subconscious is called a powerhouse 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:52.640
 Subconsciousness keeps working 24 hours a day to make your thoughts and spirits a reality 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.989
 Subconscious does not choose 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.989
 I will realize the sent message as it is 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:19.370
 From now on I speak the exact same message as the subconscious glue subliminal message 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.370
 As a result you can be in deficit the same message as those that give to the subconscious 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.820
 After the message is read, my voice fades out 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.930
 Enter subliminal mode 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:36.170
 I can not hear my voice, but the cause is changed 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:39.860
 Messages are repeated in a range where only subconsciousness can be heard 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.230
 This makes the message directly your subconscious 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:48.220
 Start delivering 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.220
 And the message will begin to penetrate the subconscious 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.099
 I know that forgiveness eases me 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.700
 I release myself by giving forgiveness 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.159
 I am relaxing now 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.220
 I know that a relaxed state produces the best learning 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.650
 I'm open New love is not accepted with real 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.830
 Many things are different by saying openly 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.830
 I know that I visit 2 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.410
 I guess I'll have bought a particular joy believe in yourself 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.240
 I end is in Japan will be shipped every day 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.240
 Hmm 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.299
 Ghibli in my Selfie is what I can decide 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.010
 I know that all of the experience is in addition
