00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:03.869
 yesterday bernard schmeltz 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.130
 to buy 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.089
 68th 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:12.089
 the study 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:16.179
 placed by hole of mutilated bodies since 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:17.400
 a third of a century 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.400
 the corbusier did it 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.550
 if the experience 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.499
 the look 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.499
 if the pedagogical experience 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.980
 through experiences 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.750
 architecturally 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.960
 realization 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.040
 construction site and this grand design 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.040
 a few dozen years later to restore 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.150
 hard to say 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.500
 seeking 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.840
 still 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.840
 more people 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.700
 the principle 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.700
 the first principle 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.360
 irritated israel 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.360
 beziers and sÃ¨te 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.130
 all circumstances 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.770
 you like 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.690
 they try species of 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.700
 distillation furnaces 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.300
 and all brothers 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.300
 at the same time as unexpected for the inter 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.900
 during the religious life 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.900
 she tries to be 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.550
 the religious considered as an institution 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.160
 attacking cars resumed on Tuesday 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.230
 during the tournament 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.960
 but we wanted to know 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.340
 we had a lot of things 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.430
 many indispensable things are useless 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.570
 it's not really civil engineering its doors 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.310
 the construction of the iss 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.910
 and it's between them 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.910
 is complex because 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.460
 civil engineering with scales and self-control quite 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.660
 he's attics a game 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.480
 the sallois 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.910
 I was not dead man 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.910
 I do not think more 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:11.829
 high school this formulation 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:12.959
 technical control 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.959
 she clings to the facades morning when we do that 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.579
 why it was 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.760
 to this kind of problem the plasticity the technicality are all 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:29.229
 the difficulty 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.549
 after she is still there 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.549
 transmitted and takes this goal the players 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.719
 the phenomenon 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.249
 the corvaisier and the mourillon these recommend to see 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:47.259
 an elevator 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:49.449
 pictorial 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.879
 where things give us 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.750
 the modules at all in the respect of meditation of things by the tarmac 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.319
 and that I think to meet them it makes them very close 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.139
 here also the quality of historical monuments the parents make sense 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.499
 form led by year 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:10.950
 the strength with which 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.979
 he works there 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.179
 the historical thread is vitality 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:16.699
 excess weight
