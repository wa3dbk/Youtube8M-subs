00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.730
 Today we want to deal with the question of all questions 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.560
 why many investors lose so much money it's wrong timing this 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.230
 just a wrong gut feeling what you have and what the whole thing with the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.750
 Football Bundesliga has to do all the formatting with Wolfgang Juds 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.119
 Managing Director of Credo VermÃ¶gens 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.520
 Manon Schmandt more about us first of all the question where they have such a 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.419
 Main mistake made by investors or it is a sum of many smaller ones 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:28.579
 error 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.520
 think it involves two major complex 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.120
 one has something to do with investor characteristics 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.530
 be it that they follow a certain Mr. Trichet 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.820
 be it on the other side that the 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.950
 Armani overestimate that they are afraid of them 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.300
 in order to achieve as little income as possible in the direction of here 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.060
 and the second complex is external influences, that is little theirs 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.540
 Percent are magazines newspapers that report on the stock market 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.290
 since the internet 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.440
 and all of these ears, taken together, are leading the way 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.899
 that many investors are always uncertain of the crucial phases 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:03.629
 and then 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.850
 to 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.370
 short-term Hanlong decide not necessarily in retrospect 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.400
 right goods that are often synonymous exaggerated by the media advised 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.729
 Spam gold price goes up significantly or significantly down or even at 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.469
 the shares 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.540
 Over the past few weeks, the DAX was once 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.520
 even a few times below the mark of 5000 points today on Monday no one 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.120
 grow accordingly and win sugar 4 percent 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.360
 In order to timing issue is the deciding how can the investor in fact oppose 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.650
 wrong timing and what would be if from their point of view now the right one 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.150
 Decision in view of the market situation 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.950
 So to the percentage so keyword Eining is Denise gets together that many investors 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.579
 always 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.549
 look in the rearview mirror and track course progression from the last two three 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.240
 Years and then to their decision 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.230
 build up 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.460
 to do an anticyclical, that is buy in during periods of weakness 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.000
 or one percent back one gets to be means that one does not 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.890
 from the current or expected future P / E from but 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.260
 maybe guided by average P / E from the last ten years 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.060
 that would contribute to aspects like percent from my point of view very much 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.439
 to bring the whole thing in a somewhat calmer waters towards one percent 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.939
 and he will come to the subject of football Bundesliga 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.810
 We see that again and again that percent the clubs 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.690
 which also drive in a slightly calmer waters with a kind 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.860
 Concept football to start that they are often more successful that they more 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.280
 Rest in the crew have that from another point of view Landeck and 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.169
 play out that they are stable in midfield 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:36.239
 and that's not saying one single single game at Basel 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.929
 dominate especially the closed team performance is the 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.819
 then over percent for an entire season 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.909
 The corresponding success brings but really times in the picture of the closed 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.010
 team effort 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.540
 Of course you can stand low in the back and try to avoid goals you can 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.820
 but also try to storm aggressively and score goals 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.860
 it's the right time to play aggressively and make goal now 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.559
 Say shares to buy 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.499
 I want to have a balanced framework 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:09.089
 Attitude that just one third in equities Middle invested a third in 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:10.770
 Pest interest-bearing securities 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.879
 and a third man who is so in the crowd 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:18.269
 by 2/32 after "neutral" strategies preferred or just now so to them 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.590
 the small discs goes into the market and these opportunities we 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.249
 now see percent as buying opportunities because if we look 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.359
 Looking back on such phases one will always say in retrospect, yes, why 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:30.510
 I do not have at that time 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.889
 bought why I did not admit then 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.529
 if seat is the absolute low point now that you always know only after the fact 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:40.669
 at the study first customer rounds is when you turn St 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.000
 this is garbage anyway, nobody can escape that it probably was like that 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.030
 in the closing stages in Helios percent 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.630
 such a rule of thumb for the investor we are properly positioned in difficult 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.990
 Markets if we can find the right timing around the percent 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.440
 still seems to me one of the hardest choices not just for 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.220
 the private investor but here and there certainly for the big one 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.809
 Earn 17 an investor 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.769
 definitely the drifting is a very difficult phase 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.519
 but I think if you graduate in single percent write the 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.710
 Build or break stock quota 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.220
 and that depends so much on forecasts 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.000
 but just focus on the review looks then you are on 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.150
 in any case, really warm with them that he is with most AK 10 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.310
 Per cent after one else to produce Hans Wehr then I am the percent 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.130
 Opinion that we are in the beans somewhere around 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.230
 Nolle see and that is not wrong is the stock quota always in 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.620
 Inner cities of five to ten percent 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.890
 to increase so that one is then at the desired percent quota and there 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.900
 offers liquidity as an asset class a good opportunity of controlling 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.380
 not everything at a time to create and not to hope that you 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.590
 the percent right time caught 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.180
 But that does not mean that you are wrong if you are now successively 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.300
 So we buy Rausse slight optimism if I may say so 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.250
 here and there are couscous and if then the cost desired 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.010
 Effect so he speaks at regular intervals shares again 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.250
 to buy to have the lowest date of entry not to have 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.870
 We want to thank you very much for the interview
