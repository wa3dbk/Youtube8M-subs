this or in this case a double click on
the<00:00:27.519> mouse<00:00:27.640> allows<00:00:28.569> the<00:00:28.720> software<00:00:28.839> to

the mouse allows the software to

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.980 
the mouse allows the software to
separate<00:00:29.529> the<00:00:29.619> chromosomes<00:00:29.949> for<00:00:30.399> you

with a double click here these two are

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.130 
with a double click here these two are
separated<00:00:39.220> or<00:00:39.580> this<00:00:40.300> one<00:00:40.480> will<00:00:40.630> use<00:00:40.780> a<00:00:40.810> manual

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
separated or this one will use a manual

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.280 
separated or this one will use a manual
tool<00:00:41.470> to<00:00:42.280> paint<00:00:42.490> across<00:00:43.270> the<00:00:43.450> chromosomes<00:00:43.960> and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
tool to paint across the chromosomes and

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.830 
tool to paint across the chromosomes and
the<00:00:44.800> software<00:00:45.190> will<00:00:45.390> separate<00:00:46.390> these<00:00:46.570> and

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
the software will separate these and

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:56.819 
the software will separate these and
resolve<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.320> overlap<00:00:49.470> is<00:00:50.470> another<00:00:50.740> overlap

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.189 

okay<00:00:57.489> now<00:00:58.089> we<00:00:58.149> have<00:00:58.390> 45<00:00:59.019> chromosomes<00:01:01.019> it's<00:01:02.019> one

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
okay now we have 45 chromosomes it's one

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:09.600 
okay now we have 45 chromosomes it's one
more<00:01:02.379> cup<00:01:02.589> to<00:01:02.739> make<00:01:04.740> yeah<00:01:08.159> now<00:01:09.159> if<00:01:09.250> you<00:01:09.310> notice

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
more cup to make yeah now if you notice

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.749 
more cup to make yeah now if you notice
some<00:01:09.790> of<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.380> telomeres<00:01:11.380> are<00:01:11.759> light-colored

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
some of the telomeres are light-colored

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.880 
some of the telomeres are light-colored
and<00:01:12.970> have<00:01:13.509> been<00:01:13.659> left<00:01:13.869> out<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:14.409> what<00:01:14.740> we're

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
and have been left out and what we're

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.389 
and have been left out and what we're
doing<00:01:15.100> here<00:01:15.310> is<00:01:15.460> we're<00:01:15.610> using<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:16.600> join<00:01:16.869> tool

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
doing here is we're using the join tool

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.469 
doing here is we're using the join tool
just<00:01:18.399> to<00:01:18.549> touch<00:01:18.700> up<00:01:18.939> the<00:01:19.030> ends<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.390> the

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
just to touch up the ends of the

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.850 
just to touch up the ends of the
chromosomes<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.110> make<00:01:20.289> sure<00:01:20.470> we<00:01:20.590> don't<00:01:20.680> miss

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
chromosomes to make sure we don't miss

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:37.080 
chromosomes to make sure we don't miss
out<00:01:21.009> any<00:01:21.220> of<00:01:21.310> those<00:01:21.460> telomeres

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.399 

any<00:01:38.090> bits<00:01:38.329> missed<00:01:38.539> by<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.780> aggressive<00:01:39.049> Thresh

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
any bits missed by the aggressive Thresh

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.350 
any bits missed by the aggressive Thresh
holding<00:01:39.799> we<00:01:39.890> can<00:01:40.039> just<00:01:40.250> easily<00:01:41.090> add<00:01:41.420> on<00:01:43.360> and

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
holding we can just easily add on and

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.060 
holding we can just easily add on and
now<00:01:44.539> we're<00:01:44.719> about<00:01:44.810> done<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.679> completes

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
now we're about done and that completes

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.660 
now we're about done and that completes
the<00:01:46.159> first<00:01:46.310> stage<00:01:48.159> next<00:01:49.159> we<00:01:49.340> bring<00:01:49.490> up<00:01:49.579> the

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
the first stage next we bring up the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.789 
the first stage next we bring up the

karyotype view smart type has already

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.710

classified<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.579> chromosomes<00:01:53.090> using<00:01:53.539> some

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
classified the chromosomes using some

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.109 
classified the chromosomes using some
automatic<00:01:53.990> classifier<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:55.490> two<00:01:55.670> views<00:01:55.970> are

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
automatic classifier the two views are

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.309 
automatic classifier the two views are
synchronized<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:56.840> that<00:01:56.960> selecting

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
synchronized so that selecting

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.719 
synchronized so that selecting
chromosomes<00:01:57.710> in<00:01:57.860> one<00:01:57.979> view<00:01:58.189> will<00:01:58.429> have<00:01:58.579> them

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
chromosomes in one view will have them
