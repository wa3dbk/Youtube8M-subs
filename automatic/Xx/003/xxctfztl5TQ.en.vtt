00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
money however there are some free

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630 
money however there are some free
alternatives<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:32.009> won't<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> lot

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
alternatives you just won't have a lot

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.969 
alternatives you just won't have a lot
of<00:01:32.670> space<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.689> your<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.350> your<00:01:34.380> website<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
of space so if your if your website is a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.590 
of space so if your if your website is a
small<00:01:35.220> website<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.700> could<00:01:35.909> host<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.299> free

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
small website you could host it for free

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.390 
small website you could host it for free
however<00:01:37.320> i<00:01:37.380> would<00:01:37.590> recommend<00:01:38.009> getting<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
however i would recommend getting like a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.249 
however i would recommend getting like a
set<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.970> nowhere<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> month<00:01:39.509> plan<00:01:39.780> or<00:01:39.960> something

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.230 
set of nowhere a month plan or something
I<00:01:40.439> mean<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:40.890> pretty<00:01:41.070> cheap<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.850> host<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240

basically<00:04:29.210> wamp<00:04:29.780> server<00:04:29.930> com<00:04:30.590> it's<00:04:31.130> basically

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
basically wamp server com it's basically

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.670 
basically wamp server com it's basically
the<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:33.710> domain<00:04:34.040> actual<00:04:34.580> domain<00:04:34.730> name<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.680> if

you've ever worked on a linux server
should<00:04:39.230> be<00:04:39.410> something<00:04:39.770> else<00:04:39.950> it<00:04:40.250> probably

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
should be something else it probably

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.360 
should be something else it probably
won't<00:04:40.730> be<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:40.970> domain<00:04:41.150> name<00:04:41.510> it'll<00:04:42.110> probably

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
won't be the domain name it'll probably

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.880 
won't be the domain name it'll probably
httpdocs<00:04:43.370> or<00:04:43.730> something<00:04:44.090> but<00:04:45.080> you<00:04:45.710> get<00:04:45.830> the

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
httpdocs or something but you get the

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.740 
httpdocs or something but you get the
idea<00:04:45.980> since<00:04:46.400> we're<00:04:46.580> using<00:04:46.610> wamp<00:04:47.000> server<00:04:47.120> by

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
idea since we're using wamp server by

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.050 
idea since we're using wamp server by
the<00:04:47.810> way<00:04:47.990> wamp<00:04:48.260> means<00:04:48.650> windows<00:04:49.310> apache<00:04:49.760> mysql

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
the way wamp means windows apache mysql

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.780 
the way wamp means windows apache mysql
and<00:04:50.510> PHP<00:04:51.020> if<00:04:51.680> you're<00:04:51.860> using<00:04:52.040> Linux<00:04:52.490> you<00:04:52.610> want

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
and PHP if you're using Linux you want

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.140 
and PHP if you're using Linux you want
to<00:04:52.850> get<00:04:52.940> lamp<00:04:53.260> linux<00:04:54.260> apache<00:04:54.500> mysql<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:55.730> PHP

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
to get lamp linux apache mysql and PHP

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.030 
to get lamp linux apache mysql and PHP
although<00:04:57.110> i<00:04:57.140> don't<00:04:57.230> recommend<00:04:57.620> that<00:04:57.830> because

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
although i don't recommend that because

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110 
file call it functions dot PHP this is

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.330 
file call it functions dot PHP this is
where<00:07:21.260> our<00:07:21.380> functions<00:07:21.740> are<00:07:21.860> going<00:07:21.980> to<00:07:22.040> be<00:07:22.130> held

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:22.340 
where our functions are going to be held

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.380 
where our functions are going to be held
and<00:07:23.650> create<00:07:24.650> a<00:07:24.710> new<00:07:24.860> file<00:07:25.100> called<00:07:27.040> connection

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:28.390 
and create a new file called connection

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.300 
and create a new file called connection
dot<00:07:29.390> PHP<00:07:29.600> you<00:07:30.260> could<00:07:30.410> also<00:07:30.560> call<00:07:30.710> it<00:07:30.860> connect

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:31.310 
dot PHP you could also call it connect

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.250 
dot PHP you could also call it connect
if<00:07:31.550> you<00:07:31.730> want<00:07:32.800> however<00:07:33.800> a<00:07:33.890> connection<00:07:35.260> I'm

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:36.260 
if you want however a connection I'm

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.590 
if you want however a connection I'm
just<00:07:36.350> going<00:07:36.530> to<00:07:36.590> keep<00:07:36.680> it<00:07:36.800> at<00:07:36.920> that<00:07:36.950> for<00:07:37.070> now

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:39.600 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.290 

and<00:07:39.810> basically<00:07:40.440> now<00:07:41.430> that<00:07:41.610> we<00:07:41.730> have<00:07:41.760> our<00:07:41.940> main

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.300 
and basically now that we have our main

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.870 
and basically now that we have our main
files<00:07:42.720> added<00:07:43.080> I<00:07:43.740> will<00:07:44.340> see<00:07:44.520> you<00:07:44.550> in<00:07:44.670> my<00:07:44.820> next

of<00:07:47.700> the<00:07:47.790> first<00:07:48.560> site<00:07:49.560> code<00:07:49.830> will<00:07:50.280> be<00:07:50.390> scripting

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:51.390 
of the first site code will be scripting

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.630 
of the first site code will be scripting
the<00:07:51.540> connection<00:07:52.110> and<00:07:52.260> all<00:07:52.350> that<00:07:52.500> jazz<00:07:52.710> and<00:07:53.040> I'm

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:53.640 
the connection and all that jazz and I'm

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.050 
the connection and all that jazz and I'm
going<00:07:53.820> to<00:07:53.910> also<00:07:54.180> set<00:07:54.840> up<00:07:54.990> the<00:07:55.260> database<00:07:55.950> of<00:07:56.700> oh
