00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.990
 am here today his christmas job well 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.790
 today too, that's why we're going a bit 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.790
 do tutorial in the christmas theme 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.410
 and if cherry is and we antique if 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.049
 of course a little perk up is also 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.270
 nice if your profile picture can brighten up 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.210
 therefore today a tutorial how it is about 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.820
 I turned myself into Santa Claus so I had 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.830
 put on twitter of the he wobbles 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.689
 be transformed into Santa Claus none that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.150
 send a good photo now 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.309
 sit that way how is the video so 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.710
 vita driver photo and that is 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.390
 so we will use that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.850
 first we must have the shelves 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.850
 look up shadow from his population 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.170
 images and your archive take some 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.000
 bit square because what in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.440
 profiles easy to become passion 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.149
 actually perfect 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.180
 so let's get this we go 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.910
 copy and paste to photoshop 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.969
 I use myself young frÃ© cs6 I 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.699
 do is i create a new document for you 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.799
 I also say one has the degree automatically 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.020
 of the image because I am coming on 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.960
 copied to my clip board and press 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.549
 on ctrl v and it is there now 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.600
 so we have to take that picture of vito de 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.430
 throwing and doing is copying again and again 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.710
 go another photo shop with then we go 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.470
 paste because the first thing to do is 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.330
 just turning it off is the eyes of 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.770
 Sinterklaas remove piece 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.869
 well how you could actually do that very simply 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.850
 so that the very simple easy 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.259
 way and that is just cut you can 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.450
 it's a little group promoting going there 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.189
 even more access a bit the horse 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.960
 take away, because of course first the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.000
 learn how to copy with a check 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.130
 certainly really so that you always have your original 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.100
 and kept going on that we go top 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.829
 work 107 put what we are going 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.890
 tackle the injuries become common 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:59.159
 a bit coarse so along the face but 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.869
 all Allah whole nose in such a 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.439
 Adina week super ugly but wait 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.270
 but 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.969
 then we do not click on learning here 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.110
 mas we first turn that around on selection 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.500
 you can do here 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.660
 when i have to and then here i do the right thing 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.640
 kind of idol here in fresh control 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.640
 ie and now such in whole body we 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.280
 let 's take this lesson away 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.560
 so in verse you see that he is the 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.140
 outside and then we say here 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.700
 very layer mast and then you see that he is high 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.920
 taken away we are that ugly 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.290
 hundreds of course up 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.780
 and then what we are going to do is we go on 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.950
 this lame Westzaan and therefore take black 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.180
 office chair that is a bit soft 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.190
 a little bit we just go 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.450
 slowly in circles 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.450
 just draw a little bit like that 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.269
 make it smaller for a bit new 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.640
 varne edges to remove it's okay 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.450
 a bit gross overall I see there 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.780
 nothing of it anymore 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.970
 so when we take away from we put those 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.720
 photo of vito then later the middle one 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.209
 young ones 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.720
 we put the back on him 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.610
 that layer come and a head of state window 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.739
 throw to the doctor we go we 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.280
 do a check and you can 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.379
 increase and keep alt and shift 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.080
 pressed so that it stays in proportion 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:22.159
 and then go vegetables and ripples and one 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.080
 shift a little and enlarge again 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:31.800
 and then you shift 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:35.180
 great little bit on la 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.650
 against shifting and tea 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.120
 now look every it looks already with 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.070
 so funny about it only you see anyway 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.590
 a little to hard edges in 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.850
 buy colors than all of them 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.950
 first we will run out of color 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.710
 a little bit to adjust your face and that 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.270
 we can do by above here 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:57.720
 create a layer in those levels 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.180
 his name is therefore a bit drunk and 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.060
 you can see a picture of Sinterklaas or sit down 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.740
 klaas black is what the fuck got one 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.110
 customer a bit bit we are going a bit 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.400
 add white that you can do here 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.580
 I get a little possible I do it 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.840
 very little bit up like that 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.420
 then we also want a little cream 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.330
 here they make we go to the red and 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.090
 green bit that in 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.980
 just a simple one 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.380
 scroll with that angry 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:30.090
 maybe green is still a little think 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.070
 so 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.140
 I did n't see it yet and you can too 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.940
 even those in the rope can also reach 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.010
 his nose can still be a bit one 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.690
 little spectral look it can do you 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.700
 all a little bit a bit 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.490
 tidier but it is so to speak 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.220
 horse principle you can just be whole 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.870
 you will get it easily 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.540
 do something like that there 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.250
 then open photoshopping and yes you have 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.900
 just need a super cool profile picture 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.280
