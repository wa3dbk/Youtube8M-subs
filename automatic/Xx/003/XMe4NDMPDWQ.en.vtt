 new facecam here on my channel 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.070
 raskin as seen on the cliff cape 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.480
 body lay call of duty 4 play and me 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.560
 must be a free for okay we are going to win with 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.850
 a random weapon 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.529
 so now I'm just going to go for a random weapon 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.090
 I choose there biofoam jobs stand suit 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.380
 just the top crash the press that 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.029
 just remains the same country 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.640
 I always have percy on 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.990
 I just need to by three I need this 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.279
 science and butterflies' especially 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.899
 so now I just go random 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.370
 take my weapon and close my eyes 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.960
 will automatically see if my so 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.550
 doubt search engine light machine shop 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.260
 can sneak over and there will 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.579
 naturally all see when we get to that category 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.719
 and which weapon we have in that 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.770
 get a category 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.719
 close scrum eyes and then we go 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.469

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.480
 suddenly recover somewhere and sounds now 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.039

 everything in that fire takes course 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.860

 if you have any tips for this series 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.460
 I for example, echo perth 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.990
 running should start running to choose one 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.549
 secondary and then start walking then choose 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.290
 then let everyone know in the comments 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.700

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.979
 make series 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.540
 not just on call or duty 4 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.860
 but also on men hot or two 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.200
 also a place or is also a mill yard 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.670
 3 maybe even and just as well 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.250
 on lack of two so guys I see 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.360
 you would soon sit like game win 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.310
 guys there i'm reappearing so 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.020
 see in the vu especially jar killed it is 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.710
 the malloc and I find the mold book myself 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.270
 west son 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.290
 men were allowed to play and probably 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.850
 you all think as you read 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.980
 facebook sees what the fuck is with the cap 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.660
 but she follows me live streams and you are 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.070
 been present at the livestreams 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.390
 Do you know exactly why I put this cap on 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.340
 my husband go this class for a while 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.350
 tackle p90 to none the esme seemed 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.520
 camel and and perky remain the same 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.290
 and bandelier it is just kind of 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.820
 Of course you need a screen I stop 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.990
 well that really is just a must have 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.520
 calorie that four because there you are 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.600
 bullets stronger from 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.220
 and if you don't have it then you have it 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.020
 just instead of 5 bullets 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.310
 every 19 needed so on your power says 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.050
 just a must have in call of duty 4 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.750
 and just jets lines so that x 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.910
 of course not on the 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.320
 sound from them is ok ok i have 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.580
 I would turn up my sound a bit louder 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.990
 my first game of the day and I'm going 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.400
 just upload the first jar immediately 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.660
 so i have to go bad we go i go 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.820
 worse should I go well I go 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.230
 well and it really just plays ramos 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.580
 sin fm is this weapon 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.690
 two I always actually sneak one 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.400
 insist on science it is me completely 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.840
 got used to those scenes there only now 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.040
 I suddenly she is not the asthma it and 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.930
 it really just played really weird 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.670
 just like there is some kind of rapid fire or something 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.300
 is built-in and stay here as particles 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.070
 kempen 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.210
 until then you wvf because then you can 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.280
 start running around again without you 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.390
 in free especially calorie that you can fourth 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.620
 nothing at all because look at this 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.450
 I mean so that 's just it 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.800
 National front of you in your back pack 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.150
 tensioners suddenly on the other side again 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.560
 let you go to beautiful there is again 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.790
 caught so it doesn't all work that way 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.560
 good on call of duty 4 if you really 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.500
 just running around without miss 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.830
 florence i always try to be kind 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.780
 kempi 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.490
 get me jevi and then i see 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.960
 continue or you can head with it 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.610
 the channel or I then also form 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.080
 other killstreaks channel of the trusses 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.910
 of it again next person she is my 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.320
 just the disadvantage of call or duty 4 that 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.280
 so many people just get used to it all at once 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.900
 after tense 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.670
 that guy that grab why it put 5 bullets in it 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.470
 our planet now is a right 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.610
 the runner effect from through the container 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.960
 a scyther did not tick so nicely 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.280
 of your boy that's here like 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.150
 plastic somewhere has a look here 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.140
 all the way at the back 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.670
 are you what he thinks he is doing 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.230
 may well be nice moment effies 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.060
 medic in call i also had one there 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.530
 fight killstreak just because i like them 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.390
 I can now no longer have to go about rags 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.370
 fight in it call him dots call of duty 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.600
 4 it is made so if you have a kills and 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.310
 I've had another killstreak 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.720
 another killstreak goes away that you 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.980
 of course, had again before it 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.540
 is all a bit on call or 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.770
 duty 4 but we are going to enjoy it 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.050
 moment i still it only one that 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.850
 and we are working on almost 15 kills 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.420
 in language is the 15 kills thank you 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.400
 game 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.320
 just stay here this folder 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.150
 dominate because they just swarmed now 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.280
 the kind of side of this folder and 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.300
 I just keep dominating and then I have to 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.650
 it probably goes well it 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.210
 game is not leaking you for the first time 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.650
 most like colordiv 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.150
 game leaks when I am a little too around 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.710
 then you just don't get those fans 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.490
 kill until everyone watches the game cunt 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.479

 fucking trash sit and you 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.500

 shit is going to shoot a like walk 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.780
 before I had my spot I always played 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.889
 the more economical 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.570
 and I thought well I'm just going to shoot now 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.340
 see if that still delivers like that after 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.870
 and I had my final story came 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.370
 another camper back at me randy 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.470
 come leaders of easy it was him 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.849
 stood to your wi-fi is because they so 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.449
 this was a handy call of duty 4 it 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.340
 make your weapon 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.039
 well not really that much red like that 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.720
 chance unifi i have a case on ak-47 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.490
 color figure always send with the 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.870
 sauce on the ps book already with the science on 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.460
 that wagons determined with the aryan and 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.960
 it just works really really well 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.340
 to play with him together on kanji die 4 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.840
 so if you can now i can see you again 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.340
 have lie i have now follow me 20 times 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.810
 collins that the 4 consecutive step then 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.610
 you must already come from the verbal body 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.050
 definitely plays again because she 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.520
 truly one of the best call of duty ever 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.530
 and I also just looked around 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.090
 these calorie players are up to four 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.919
