00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:08.029
 hi friends from youtube I will present 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:12.260
 what is the mendoza weapon what is 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:14.190
 the ranger model is house 62 3 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.680
 this weapon 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.240
 it's hard plastic plastic 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:25.610
 that protects everything that is the body 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.860
 exactly the metal body of the weapon 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.130
 this weapon is the smallest model of 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.020
 mendoza why is rangers this weapon 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.210
 is 4.5 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.810
 this weapon is mono shot means that 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.510
 it's just shot to shot shooting a shot 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.130
 then recharge this weapon traction 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.010
 simple means that I need to 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.579
 hammer to be able to trigger the shot 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.540
 this weapon has rear sights 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.750
 adjustable up 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.620
 has a fixed front 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.620
 this weapon 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.640
 as you can see it at a glance it's 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.930
 pretty 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.060
 the truth that has a finish 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.180
 we can say that acceptable for what 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.460
 it's mendoza 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.460
 this weapon uses salvage capsules 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.409
 which are inserted 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:40.280
 being able first what is 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:43.280
 and then it's safe and this weapon has 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.429
 the hammer insurance his first time 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.000
 that activates the insurance does not trigger in 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:52.939
 second time of the list to install 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.720
 this weapon detonates only appropriating 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.460
 the shore of the salvage as you can see 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.320
 if not detonate Jiren saves the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.290
 to give it in another part of the capsule 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.760
 The advantages of this weapon is that for its 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.520
 Compact design can be transported 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.830
 anywhere 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.830
 in a pocket of the shirt of the pants 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.620
 more oiled inside what is your 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.510
 internal mechanism does not need 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.310
 what are the seals like the rifles 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.890
 of diabolos 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.680
 and one of its disadvantages is that you have to 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.170
 clean the barrel every five days pull 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.540
 if you want accuracy because of your cannon 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.450
 short because precision is also something 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.489
 Limited depending how one engages 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.120
 the weapon may have greater 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.239
 results in terms of accuracy is 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.900
 weapon 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:57.290
 could be is that its power is always 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:02.720
 or it could almost always be the same already 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:05.120
 that does not use co2 does not need to be pumped 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.270
 as the ace crossman mostly who are 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.420
 pumping does not need to be filling 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.380
 tanks like those of pcp then 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.600
 gradually he would not run out of 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.570
 power of the detonate detonate from it 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.490
 power then with your strength will be 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.490
 always practically in the same 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.760
 now we talk a couple of shots 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.120
 so we can see the power of the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.120
 gun 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.940
 We speak 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.360
 sure and the same sign that they are here 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.490
 are safe the salvo was hit in 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.380
 the shore as you can see 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:53.070
 this weapon does not detonate 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:56.840
 in the center and that's why it's caliber 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.840
 4.5 so that they can not be used 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.640
 like 22 caliber missions
