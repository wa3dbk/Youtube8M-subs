00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.590
 Although it's about her jacket in this 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.820
 Video 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:28.500

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.590
 a comic shop so it's stuff out 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.589
 a comic shop in bamberg and jo no 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.210
 I do not know how much has cost 1520 euro 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:15.240
 is expensive but I have already chosen 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.689
 yes then it continues with this poster 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:28.430
 here 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:36.329
 That's the first question and I think so 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:45.520
 That's one of a water movie dare 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:49.780
 provides is like it on the trail 22 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:02:09.700
 the two are the first of them 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:02:13.330
 first dvd then even something like 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.799
 In the movie occurs com read what they 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.780
 For example, sometimes it is like that 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.810
 Japanese and Japanese names 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.150
 speaks more penetrated with midtown from 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:37.090
 or his or her and then become 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:43.629
 just here are the terms on individual 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:50.739
 episodes of the series is the 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:52.870
 first film is the two illustrated 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.750
 Well, because I have to buy part in 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.850
 this film turns into la sunday in 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.109
 Brussels 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:04.230
 that's why I bought with and 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:08.370
 it will be the same here 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.760
 attentive deduction did you play with it 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.760
 quite well 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.319
 I think only one what costs 39 40 euro 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.380
 it is quite expensive 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.340
 Although how much are cheaper now 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:28.870
 definitely give 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:32.470

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:38.410
 keychains by elias a series of 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:41.230
 poker and on the helper side is or 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:46.510
 other side extinguishers and parallel 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:50.519
 then I found in the comic 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.519
 load a notebook from acer 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:04.780

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:10.870

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:13.959

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.550
 really hard to get is then I have 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:32.800
