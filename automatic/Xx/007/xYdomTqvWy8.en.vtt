00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
magnet is super strong and um it's that

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.820 
magnet is super strong and um it's that
deep<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:16.209> they<00:03:17.209> have<00:03:17.420> like<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.959> Styrofoam

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
deep and they have like a Styrofoam

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.310 
deep and they have like a Styrofoam
right<00:03:19.100> here<00:03:19.670> which<00:03:20.660> will<00:03:20.810> protect<00:03:21.019> the

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
right here which will protect the

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.979 
right here which will protect the
shadows<00:03:21.800> but<00:03:22.700> at<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.209> same<00:03:23.450> time<00:03:23.690> when<00:03:23.930> you

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
shadows but at the same time when you

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.920 
shadows but at the same time when you
close<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.440> lid<00:03:24.709> it's<00:03:25.160> not<00:03:25.880> going<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.630> touch

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
close the lid it's not going to touch

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.880 
close the lid it's not going to touch
and<00:03:27.320> it's<00:03:27.440> also<00:03:28.150> um<00:03:29.769> obviously<00:03:30.769> it's<00:03:31.840> magnetic

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
and it's also um obviously it's magnetic

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.009 
and it's also um obviously it's magnetic
so<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:35.030> can<00:03:35.209> see<00:03:35.510> there<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:37.330> it<00:03:38.330> fits<00:03:38.570> right

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
so you can see there and it fits right

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:45.430 
so you can see there and it fits right

stuff like that here's and then this is

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.929 
stuff like that here's and then this is
what<00:04:14.019> it<00:04:14.170> looks<00:04:14.379> like<00:04:14.620> without<00:04:14.920> anything<00:04:15.519> in

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
what it looks like without anything in

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.569 
what it looks like without anything in
it<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.389> it<00:04:16.840> has<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:16.989> very<00:04:17.470> strong<00:04:17.829> magnet<00:04:18.370> and

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579
