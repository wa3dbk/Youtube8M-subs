00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
version the strap is a little bit

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.060 
version the strap is a little bit
different<00:00:29.999> which<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.989> pretty<00:00:31.199> obvious<00:00:31.769> once

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
different which it's pretty obvious once

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.220 
different which it's pretty obvious once
I<00:00:32.250> review<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.640> as<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.270> see<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.690> tooling<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
I review it as you see the tooling is a

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.070 
I review it as you see the tooling is a
little<00:00:34.380> different<00:00:34.680> as<00:00:34.800> well<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:36.050> yeah<00:00:37.050> I

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
little different as well but yeah I

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.740 
little different as well but yeah I
think<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.980> lot<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.000> people<00:00:39.090> probably<00:00:39.420> won't

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
think a lot of people probably won't

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.170 
think a lot of people probably won't
like<00:00:39.900> this<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:40.340> yeah<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.240> is<00:00:43.340> as<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:45.120> can

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
like this but yeah here it is as you can

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.690 
like this but yeah here it is as you can
see<00:00:45.360> I've<00:00:45.540> chosen<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.110> put<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.380> on<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.860> bright

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
see I've chosen to put it on a bright

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.610 
see I've chosen to put it on a bright
orange<00:00:48.290> strap<00:00:50.150> mmm<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:52.110> reason<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.380> this<00:00:52.560> is

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
orange strap mmm the reason for this is

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.100 
orange strap mmm the reason for this is
I<00:00:53.070> want<00:00:53.579> my<00:00:54.210> bouts<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.690> look<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.930> bit<00:00:55.079> different

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
I want my bouts to look a bit different

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.350 
I want my bouts to look a bit different
I<00:00:55.680> don't<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.980> having<00:00:56.220> plain<00:00:56.550> black<00:00:56.850> straps

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
I don't like having plain black straps

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.870 
I don't like having plain black straps
for<00:00:58.079> all<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.470> them<00:00:58.650> so<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> few<00:00:59.490> of<00:00:59.550> them<00:00:59.760> I'm

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
for all of them so a few of them I'm

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.760 
for all of them so a few of them I'm
going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> change<00:01:00.420> up<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.410> them<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.620> little

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
going to change up and do them a little

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.740 
going to change up and do them a little
differently<00:01:02.579> seeing<00:01:03.150> as<00:01:03.270> they're<00:01:03.450> both<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
differently seeing as they're both the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.819 
differently seeing as they're both the
same<00:01:03.780> bout<00:01:04.140> except<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.530> one's<00:01:04.739> just

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 
same bout except this one's just

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:06.559 
same bout except this one's just
repainted<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.640> thought<00:01:06.030> give<00:01:06.329> them<00:01:06.509> a

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:06.569 
repainted I thought give them a

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:08.599 
repainted I thought give them a
different<00:01:06.719> strap<00:01:07.200> give<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:07.859> a<00:01:07.950> bit<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:08.609 
different strap give them a bit of a

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:10.849 
different strap give them a bit of a
different<00:01:09.090> identity<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859 
different identity as you can see the

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:12.410 
different identity as you can see the
tooling<00:01:11.249> is<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.369> little<00:01:11.640> differently<00:01:11.909> curved

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
tooling is a little differently curved

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.599 
tooling is a little differently curved

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
between half two and three just being

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.550 
between half two and three just being
setting<00:02:14.430> sort<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.390> end<00:02:16.020> is<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.350> lot

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
setting sort of it the end is a lot

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.080 
setting sort of it the end is a lot
different<00:02:16.680> now<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.010> more<00:02:17.220> curved<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.790> woman

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
different now is more curved this woman

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.870 
different now is more curved this woman
I<00:02:18.180> get<00:02:18.360> more<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.720> square<00:02:19.020> lot<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:20.220> think<00:02:20.760> I'll

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
I get more of a square lot I think I'll

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.150 
I get more of a square lot I think I'll
just<00:02:20.970> turn<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.390> over<00:02:21.510> sure<00:02:24.740> here's<00:02:25.740> still

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
just turn it over sure here's still

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.020 
just turn it over sure here's still
black<00:02:27.150> back<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.530> part's<00:02:29.460> still<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.820> same

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
black back so that part's still the same

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.690 
black back so that part's still the same
I<00:02:30.530> think<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.590> looks<00:02:31.620> good<00:02:31.920> builder<00:02:32.250> contrast

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
I think it looks good builder contrast

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.480 
I think it looks good builder contrast
between<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.150> black<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.510> orange<00:02:34.130> looks<00:02:35.130> very

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
between the black and orange looks very

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.080 
between the black and orange looks very
nice<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.240> can<00:02:36.360> see<00:02:37.040> it's<00:02:38.040> not<00:02:38.190> fully<00:02:38.640> flexible

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
nice you can see it's not fully flexible

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.790 
nice you can see it's not fully flexible
yet<00:02:39.330> because<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.750> still<00:02:39.960> needs<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.230> break<00:02:40.500> in

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
yet because it still needs to break in

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.670 
yet because it still needs to break in
obviously<00:02:41.370> like<00:02:41.550> all<00:02:41.730> real<00:02:41.940> other<00:02:42.180> straps<00:02:42.680> has

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
obviously like all real other straps has

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.650 
obviously like all real other straps has
this<00:02:43.800> break-in<00:02:44.070> period<00:02:44.460> this<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:44.970> suede<00:02:45.390> so

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
this break-in period this is suede so

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.840 
this break-in period this is suede so
you<00:02:45.750> can<00:02:45.900> see<00:02:46.080> like<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:47.040> looks<00:02:47.250> all<00:02:47.460> marked

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
you can see like it looks all marked

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.300 
you can see like it looks all marked
with<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.330> looks<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:48.810> bad<00:02:49.020> on<00:02:49.230> Caroline<00:02:49.800> Oh<00:02:50.010> mark
