00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
around also regarding loading times

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.200

people<00:01:52.799> were<00:01:53.009> kind<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.310> wondering<00:01:53.490> are<00:01:54.000> they

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
people were kind of wondering are they

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.639 
people were kind of wondering are they
gonna<00:01:54.329> be<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.509> lot<00:01:54.689> better<00:01:54.930> because<00:01:55.290> its

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
gonna be a lot better because its

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.830 
gonna be a lot better because its
next-gen<00:01:56.250> new<00:01:56.399> consoles<00:01:56.969> they're<00:01:57.329> not<00:01:57.509> night

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
next-gen new consoles they're not night

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.100 
next-gen new consoles they're not night
and<00:01:58.049> day<00:01:58.290> better<00:01:58.770> from<00:01:59.340> various<00:02:00.000> sources<00:02:00.210> but

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
and day better from various sources but

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.139 
and day better from various sources but
it<00:02:01.409> obviously<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:02.130> an<00:02:02.280> improvement<00:02:02.579> when

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
it obviously is an improvement when

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.209 
it obviously is an improvement when
you're<00:02:03.299> switching<00:02:03.509> characters<00:02:04.259> obviously

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
you're switching characters obviously

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.280 
you're switching characters obviously
when<00:02:05.369> you're<00:02:05.460> loading<00:02:05.759> up<00:02:05.880> online<00:02:06.119> it's<00:02:07.049> not

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
when you're loading up online it's not

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.809 
when you're loading up online it's not
going<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> ten-minute<00:02:08.550> wait<00:02:08.640> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
going to be like the ten-minute wait it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.490 
going to be like the ten-minute wait it
was<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.239> last<00:02:09.450> gem<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.110> definitely<00:02:10.259> not

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
was on last gem but it's definitely not

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.680 
was on last gem but it's definitely not
going<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.739> be<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.009> two-minute

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
going to be like a two-minute
