I<00:01:38.480> had<00:01:39.480> an<00:01:39.630> inner<00:01:39.960> calling<00:01:40.500> when<00:01:40.830> Beslan

something

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.950 

the<00:01:56.159> whole<00:01:56.340> idea<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.510> play<00:01:57.720> box<00:01:57.990> came<00:01:58.409> down

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.010 

I<00:02:05.020> was<00:02:05.770> thinking<00:02:06.190> what<00:02:07.090> would<00:02:07.299> this<00:02:07.450> children

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
I was thinking what would this children

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.870 
I was thinking what would this children
who<00:02:08.229> survived<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.740> tragedy<00:02:09.280> need<00:02:09.550> on<00:02:09.819> a

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
who survived the tragedy need on a

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.690 
who survived the tragedy need on a
permanent<00:02:10.330> basis<00:02:10.990> that<00:02:11.950> could<00:02:12.130> almost<00:02:12.400> be

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
permanent basis that could almost be

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.500 
permanent basis that could almost be
like<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.910> therapy<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.480> them<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:16.209> greatest

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
like a therapy to them the greatest

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.559 
like a therapy to them the greatest
killer<00:02:17.170> for<00:02:17.650> children<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.940> play<00:02:19.209> that

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
killer for children is is to play that

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:36.630 
killer for children is is to play that
just<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.959> forget<00:02:20.680> themselves

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.949 

really<00:02:37.640> we<00:02:37.760> should<00:02:38.000> be<00:02:38.030> doing<00:02:38.450> all<00:02:38.689> this

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
really we should be doing all this

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.410 
really we should be doing all this
without<00:02:39.379> any<00:02:39.860> tragedies<00:02:40.459> we<00:02:40.760> should<00:02:40.970> be<00:02:41.090> doing

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
without any tragedies we should be doing

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.630 
without any tragedies we should be doing
it<00:02:41.599> because<00:02:42.319> children<00:02:42.799> deserve<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.430> not

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
it because children deserve it not

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.509 
it because children deserve it not
because<00:02:44.110> certainly<00:02:45.189> something<00:02:46.189> like<00:02:46.340> this

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
because certainly something like this

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.610 
because certainly something like this
terrible<00:02:46.939> happen<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.540> that's<00:02:47.629> why<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.470> much

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
terrible happen and that's why so much

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:56.440 
terrible happen and that's why so much
