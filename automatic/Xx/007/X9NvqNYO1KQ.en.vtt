00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello people welcome to one 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:09.660
 new video today I show you the wwe 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.900
 tag team championship from smackdown 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.470
 because before there was this branch title 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.710
 it in smackdown a title and 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.199
 energy title 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.390
 and this is the one of smackdown 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.420
 known as wwe tag team championship 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.170
 and I show you today so that 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.199
 here is the good piece here so the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.510
 wwe tag team championship again 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.940
 Let's start at the side and 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.950
 there are a few more here 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.500
 designs as on the phone the uk 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.300
 championship here so badly cleared 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.700
 area at the buttons 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.899
 in general , the title is very very short 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.539
 here the buttons have exactly the same 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.829
 right distance as with most 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:55.199
 wwe titeln quietly without hesitation to the 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.539
 normal wall hangers are attacking here 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.180
 are a few more 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.680
 designs on the belt of course that wwe 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.090
 logo everywhere on the title as we do 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.909
 would like to have 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.000
 these are the sideblades for now 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.280
 a slightly larger time plate here 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.310
 is still such a small effect above 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.280
 inside that it is so oval with the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.590
 wwe raw blue background the whole 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.509
 here are two more wrestlers on it 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.090
 each other here a bit 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.770
 get the content of the website distributors 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.049
 looks very cool I think it anyway 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.420
 not so wrong if on one 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.799
 wrestling championchip too small 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.470
 Wrestlers on it are something 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.420
 Doing each other then is still here 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.490
 he will when the form of sun stand 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.790
 that looks really cool and here 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.119
 still so fluted designs on the plate 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.979
 very nice here it continues with world 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.070
 wrestling entertainment very big logo 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.200
 and blue background on the other 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.310
 page looks almost the same as 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.259
 the ressorts a bit 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.799
 different here, one room the other 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.750
 very nice 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.439
 otherwise there are still the buttons and 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.500
 switch the mainframe you 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.209
 like this from here with a lot 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.300
 strange design because this is everywhere 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.550
 a little bit around 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.080
 relationships is I like it very very good 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.780
 i have the tag team title 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.310
 I've always thought that was very good 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.100
 and that was not because ellie 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.750
 goulding and then we start at lake 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.410
 There is here, of course, I have, of course 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.390
 the template as you know it from me 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.660
 yes, there are two more here 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.300
 crowns on it and how we can of wwe 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.220
 Give it back to the big eagle 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.660
 not on earth this time but on 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.850

 bama is sitting here 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.720
 I think that's always cool eagle anyway 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.530
 on titles always looks good but says 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.630
 do not do anything wrong 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.510
 up here then with the mature 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.270
 above it and the wwe logo on blue 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.860
 background looks very cool here 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.290
 the earth again so a bit 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.930
 but squeezed but you recognize what 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.080
