00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.450
 very well 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.780
 no no I'm making love to the 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.660
 I'm massaging the muscle with the 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.449
 roll a fairly novel technique that 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.460
 in English it's called sounds rowling yes 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.980
 you want to see my whole mobility routine 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.720
 for the lower train you can find 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.910
 the link now on the screen and in the 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.910
 description come start 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.790
 all right 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.790
 ah 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.780
 and good as you see, I'm back in my 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.150
 new nirvana gym and it's already my 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.670
 second training here and very 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.560
 happy with the facilities sometimes 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.270
 It's hard to adapt to the new ones 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.059
 gyms because of the customs that 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.950
 drags one the new people the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.250
 feelings with the different machines and 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.229
 material feeling comfortable but not good 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.690
 in my case with two workouts I already 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.790
 I feel at home very friendly and 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.680
 kind people here well in the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.170
 trainings I always like to start 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.570
 with compound movements here 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.970
 You see me heating up with two 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.040
 dishes and now I'm going to show you how much 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.200
 that I have improved compared to about 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.119
 three months to your right 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.360
 You will see what my work series was 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.350
 with 70 kilos and on the left you will see 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.509
 now warming up with 80 10 kilos more and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.580
 the difference in speed is abysmal 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.770
 that's why I love the spaces 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.439
 strength I think they are very 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.869
 efficient after the two series of 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.860
 warm up I started with 5 for 5 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.990
 what with 130 kilos almost double or 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.450
 practically twice as many as three 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.759
 months and the truth is that a 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.829
 little slower than expected but 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.530
 good thing is that I do not just get used to 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.689
 to the grip straps and I also hope 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.090
 my body in a few weeks longer 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.129
 get used to this frequency of touching the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.129
 same muscle almost twice a week 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.590
 since I'm using a good volume 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.360
 not here you see me checking the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.849
 depth of my squat for 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.160
 place the bars of the cage that already 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.660
 I really wanted to use here 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.060
 my daughter is the only one I've seen 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.790
 now and it's a station that for me 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.560
 It should be missing in any gym 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.900
 can perform countless exercises 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.269
 with total security and normally 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.980
 they are even a little higher and even 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.040
 can perform exercises such as pressure 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.530
 military et cetera so very happy and 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.950
 I use it for just 5 for 5 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.080
 bench press 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.209
 with the squat some you have 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.269
 asked about the type of grip or 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.239
 placement of the bar as mine is the 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.430
 low bar that I find more secure and 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.680
 comfortable that the high bar also 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.769
 Generally, most people 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.989
 they can usually lift more weight with this 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.239
 type of placement now you will see from 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.980
 this angle as I had not calculated well 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.720
 the depth of my squats 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.410
 placing the security bars 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.349
 too high and what happened to 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.660
 I touched one of them specifically the one 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:20.140
 my right and it destabilized me a little 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.849
 now with this weight nothing happened and I could 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.160
 finish the series but if it came up 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.900
 doing my strength series with 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.569
 quite more intensity and weight 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.760
 I probably would have gone to a 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.130
 side but well I can always throw the 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.250
 back bar for that is the cage there 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.500
 what a good failure of mine and nothing like 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.470
 always what I tell you to encourage you to 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.420
 record them in the gym to see failures 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.190
 like this one 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.680
 for in general to be able to perfect 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.040
 your form in some other 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.410
 exercise then came the leg press 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.349
 of pulley that I 'm still not sure 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.440
 which I prefer if the whole life 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.209
 western dishes with pulley we'll see with 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.610
 which I stay and I will tell you saying 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.680
 feelings that I have with each one what 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.560
 what I did specifically in this exercise 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.510
 was to lower and narrow the 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.880
 positioning of the feet for 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.130
 try then good to focus on the 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.900
 part of outside the cadres is like 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.950
 you will see below in the image that 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.400
 it is signaled 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.340
 and the most painful exercise of the day 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.530
 quadriceps extension here I like 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.930
 focus the contraction and 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.530
 truly feel and with manage 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.750
 that area, I tell you , it worked because that 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.300
 same day I arrived even late at 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.720
 I work because I got several pulls 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.580
 and cramping after overexertion 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.160
 so I'll have to lower the 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.440
 intensity in this exercise since if 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.420
 I'm not going to stay in the street 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.630
 quiet is that I had not forgotten about 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.180
 train twins I did an exercise of 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.810
 standing for the gourmet and another sitting 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.310
 for the soleus more of the same 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.760
 high repetitions holding the 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.700
 shrinkage and little weight because this was 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.760
 another new machine that I used for 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.880
 the first time and I loved it 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.830
 like how you can adjust that support 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.590
 that is up to the knees that is 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.200
 can adjust apart from the height the 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.110
 depth back and forth 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.140
 without having to move the feet 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.390
 even this machine has a lever 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.790
 as you see on the screen that helps you 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.970
 take out the weight do not use it but good 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:39.300
 is there in case you need it very very 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.790
 happy with this machine also the same 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.280
 you can see something of the twin there at 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.780
 through the jean shark trousers but 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.000
 good something there but very little 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.639
 now so if the last two 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.470
 that leg day's exercises 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.960
 concretely they are going to be exercises of 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.000
 abdominals the first you see now in 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.910
 screen is that of the captain's chair 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.550
 I call him and then you go see the 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.310
 Abdominal plate in two of the best 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.260
 exercises that I recommend to get that 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.320
 six pack those abs those 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.660
 squares and well the same also I put 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.930
 the link for the iron tutorial 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.259
 abdominal if it is interesting 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.789
 last thing quickly remind you that 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.340
 I will upload videos soon 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.889
 posing next to measurements of the parts 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.590
 of the body so you can see the progression 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.870
 and difference of two years from now 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:35.289
 compete also as you asked me 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.570
 I will explain in detail my routine and my 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.789
 workouts but please give me a 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.070
 little time because before I would like 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:46.210
 upload more videos on basic topics 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:48.130
 basic notions more recipes give a little 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.520
 preferably to what can help you 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:54.789
 no longer avoid putting the car before 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.729
 that the horse start from below until 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:07:00.310
 up doing things right by 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:03.220
 last again it has been said once 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.870
