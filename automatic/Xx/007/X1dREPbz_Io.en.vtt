this side quest to get the mirror is
really<00:06:35.730> really<00:06:36.030> just<00:06:37.430> it's<00:06:38.430> annoying<00:06:38.790> to<00:06:39.060> say

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
really really just it's annoying to say

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.900 
really really just it's annoying to say
the<00:06:39.330> least<00:06:39.450> it's<00:06:39.870> up<00:06:40.250> it's<00:06:41.250> not<00:06:41.490> my<00:06:41.610> favorite

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
the least it's up it's not my favorite

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.390 
the least it's up it's not my favorite
part<00:06:42.270> of<00:06:42.330> the<00:06:42.420> game<00:06:42.600> it<00:06:42.900> drags<00:06:43.560> on<00:06:43.950> for<00:06:44.370> a

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
part of the game it drags on for a

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.610 
part of the game it drags on for a
little<00:06:44.550> bit<00:06:44.760> and<00:06:45.030> quite<00:06:45.840> frankly<00:06:45.870> I<00:06:46.350> think<00:06:46.440> it

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
little bit and quite frankly I think it

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.890 
little bit and quite frankly I think it
insists<00:06:47.040> upon<00:06:47.070> itself<00:06:47.280> too<00:06:47.790> much<00:06:48.000> I'm<00:06:48.690> not

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
insists upon itself too much I'm not

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.860 
insists upon itself too much I'm not
