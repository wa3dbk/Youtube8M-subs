00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hey lie I have just come from the university 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.750
 and I was a little bit so in 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.760
 I'm thinking of this rhythm 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.700
 I 'm going to the subject of grabmann video 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.809
 and of course I have it now 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.320
 have now my video study 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.299
 started 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.980
 quite a lot of things you bought that way 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.529
 in the beginning just exhausted and I thought 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.480
 I'll just show you this because I 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.119
 would it interesting I find the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.250
 would see a lot of fun so number 1 it 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.960
 Of course, first of all, go now and 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.590
 Although the first thing I bought myself 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.300
 I have to see you now 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.600
 probably in the terminal as well 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.250
 I'm happy together and sees 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:50.660
 this whole story and that 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:53.699
 is prepared cutlery so it looks 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.219
 in there are so that is now extreme 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.660
 reduced to say so there are now completely 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.120
 many things are not in there not so many 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.770
 Tweezers in any case and it still 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.869
 no scalpels in there but the hole 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.750
 I soon chapel are approaching 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:16.850
 So what in it, so to speak 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.850
 a blunt pair of scissors is in there then 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.460
 pin and good though my name is 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.600
 People realize that what that is for 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.840
 a creature 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.869
 You have to decorate the skin somewhere 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.710
 they are stuck in it 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.090
 then a very sharp scissors now 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.350
 come fruits but now they come 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.970
 So tweezers here is a tip 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:52.190
 For example, I had a prince I need 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.530
 Today I have stopped immediately 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.530
 yes the industry for example today then 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:02.060
 is such a very fine tweezers 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.580
 So you can do that with it as well 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.730
 pick up small fragile things 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.900
 so you do not break this 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:18.730
 even then count such a big one 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:21.470
 blunt tweezers in it and something else 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.950
 and an even smaller prince would have as 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.840
 So you see here in front 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.730
 the one in front is the one to record one 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.350
 now looks a bit bad was 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.110
 I also so interesting that now 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.940
 not so that's the first one that needs 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.680
 if you for example, to prepare 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.800
 created for botany or for 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.360
 theology and yes, if you do that 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.650
 want 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.240
 who wants to do that then you need 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.870
 Of course, I already have scalpels 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:55.580
 said and, alternatively, I hope so 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.020
 Alternatively, you just woman for the botany 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.340
 I just kind of 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.880
 splatter razor blades and because 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.530
 so keppeler are just way too wide 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.790
 full and worthy preparations then 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.310
 crush and have to completely me 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.520
 make a thin point and therefore needs 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.900
 you razor that at home that 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.030
 is now from Welsh island 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.920
 Here are the sounds in it all 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.590
 so normal razor blade has the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.019
 are as 2schneidig as the stop by 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.580
 earlier, so to speak, knows in it 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.739
 ten pieces on the rest 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.690
 Cutlery cost 20 euros as well 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.540
 it is now so strangely was 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.670
 just gone my battery so still 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.820
 always a new battery here so that 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.800
 fictitious put 20 euro from thalia this 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.630
 razor blade I think three euros 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.090
 I have tasted fifty of the dm 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.400
 that was the only normal one 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.090
 razor quotes so 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.890
 this old-fashioned one so needs one 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.840
 I have a very urgent need today 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.780
 example then uses the next one 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.519
 thing you need for microscopy 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.080
 and that's only recently 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:06.370
 Bought 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:09.069
 here are the slides here in the 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.530
 Such glass plates are in such a 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.879
 Pack 50 pieces in it and that one 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.459
 Pack of 50 pieces costs two euros 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.650
 So fifty are the thicker ones 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.620
 glass plates who ever in the school 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.050
 mikros has copied knows what that is 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.330
 and these are now coverlets and 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.979
 Although if you do something preparatory so what 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.470
 very thin does that on the 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.560
 slide on it with water and then 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.330
 Put a glass on top as well 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.860
 then the preparation is what you stop 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.350
 wants to look under the microscope 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.850
 clamped in between and, so to speak, 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.000
 then nothing can slip because nothing 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.330
 happen that 100 100 pieces completely 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:54.580
 thin glass slides and have 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:56.229
 I believe a euro 70 2 euro 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.789
 something like that so it was not to be as 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.110
 expensive but I will have you there 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:04.270
 Of course also murder wear on the 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:06.010
 Then the next one will be fine 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.300
 I'll show you some banal ones now 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.099
 I found the things now 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.889
 somehow it quite interesting 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:15.700
 banal you have to study a lot 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.349
 to draw 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:27.240
 and because I no longer print paper 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:27.240
 had cost five euros 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.590
 500 sheets 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:44.229
 500,000 in his 100's sense too 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.340
 punctures and I can mean mine 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:49.150
 show newspaper that I made today 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.710
 have looked after such a beautiful 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.030
 So today I do not have that much 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.400
 effort given if we were already will 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.389
 in time pressure 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.560
 which means today I was not so 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:03.570
 much like me I did not hope so 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.570
 one recognizes oneself thus show oneself 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:14.400
 this here looks quite okay from I 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.400
 do not know what that was 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:26.830
 in the leaf elodea carla because it's up 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:28.090
 Of course, every case needs a syringe 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:39.760
 I immediately thought that I have not now 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:41.650
 I bought it in the end 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.540
 Three more things to say or you 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.830
 I said three products to the mobile phone myself 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:50.350
 In any case, still need to buy for 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:51.880
 studies and only one is so high 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.380
 has a kind of reference book and that 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.560
 is there is recommended to us the 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.150
 campell campell biology the newest 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.340
 issue costs 100 euros 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:03.220
 and I'm just looking up 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.020
 amazon or so and on ebay if i am 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.500
 any older issues stop 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.060
 If I want cheap cheaper 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.040
 any older issues 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.230
 can get a bit cheaper 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.000
 then I definitely need one more 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.710
 I do not need smocks now 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.230
 that will look very stylish too me 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:23.980
 I've already looked at it costs 25 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:25.780
 euro are smocks then I still need 

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:30.400
 Clock was still a thing I 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:34.620
 I already have need of scalpels 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.940
 said yes that was it 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.020
 that 's about it and my video 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.300
 I hope you have a little bit 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.950
 a bit interested so please 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.480
 I was not very interested 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.150
 totally euphoric when I as these 

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.680
 Everyone bought the prepared plug 

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.180
 more than half a year video 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.170
 I'm probably studying for a wife now 

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.470
 make up the computer 

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:55.150
 yes, in any case, I'm just one 

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.580
 little stress softer now 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:59.110
 started and come that way 

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:02.800
 not too many videos but I give 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:06.630
 I'm struggling and that's why it's here 

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.630
 sign of the grinder okay
