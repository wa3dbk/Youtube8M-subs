00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.379
 distraction with the mate but the 20 installments 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.940

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.940
 when we talk about computers 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.210
 how it feels to share a mate 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:25.000
 It is a tribute to a kitchen of 1812 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:27.580

 is a mate with working memory at 14h and 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.910
 It happens to me if I tell you it's a mate that 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.770
 is an Argentine invention this mates that 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.229
 it is an invention to vote ourselves 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.880
 like so many others exact but that is 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.619
 different to all the evils of the world 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.619
 pain area per turn 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.110
 if you become a chick 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.530
 material 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.840
 normal 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.310
 at the time of cleaning it good my father 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.080
 my father won the olympics of throwing the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.190
 grass outside based on the time it empties 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.480

 my friend's band from the producers 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.090
 but he told me I want you to see that 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.160
 I spent several years innovating making a 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.670
 Maketo shit with laughter until what 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.530

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.500
 look for the easiest to clean mate 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.790

 Holy Tuesday basically what he does is 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.549
 like this in a cylindrical shape 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:33.400
 perfect when you finish taking 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.109

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.879
