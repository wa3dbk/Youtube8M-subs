00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello youtube people are welcome 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.670
 ventura to pfc channel my name is 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.290
 cleiton I'll pass another tutorial is 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.210
 interesting for you 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.880
 the study is for today I'll show you 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.519
 how to find out what takes up so much space 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.890
 on your HD because suddenly you can 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.109
 downloading or installing a program 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.000
 and it may happen that 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.279
 message saying there is no more space 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.430
 in your hd 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.019
 so you decide to look in hd what 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.760
 is taking up space by erasing a lot 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.399
 file and you do not put too much 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.680
 difference to play and still full 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.480
 suddenly solve the problem i go 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.070
 showing you is a very 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.940
 simple because then there is the tutorial 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.739
 can personally know what is 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.960
 taking our hd space 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.489
 We'll have to come here on this site. 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.059
 We are going to download a program called 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.629
 space level and we will download this 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.219
 version here once you downloaded it 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.570
 programs usually go to the folder 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.870
 download then you come here in 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.699
 downloads and will be here at the level feet 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.640
 is compacted there will step on that 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.020
 I was wrong to err there, so just download 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.619
 here on this site you want 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.270
 and then you downloaded it unzipped and it goes 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.060
 appears here in another briefcase to 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.340
 people will open and this program here 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.470
 you do not have to be there simply 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.780
 click on it and it opens it starts 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.470
 then we can create a 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.970
 send shortcut to work us 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.930
 access this program there from the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.610
 workspace 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.310
 then once you create a shortcut sent 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.409
 there for work it will appear here 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.659
 we will click on it and execute and it 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.590
 will open so it will show you 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.780
 One window 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.540
 in this window it will show all the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.920
 options you have on disk for you 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.299
 do the scanning to know that 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.729
 occupy the entire space 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.450
 so you can win records and cookie 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.000
 would the cd be the disk jeou the cover of a 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.740
 pen drive or car drive 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.320
 in case you will have other letters 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.820
 in case our lyrics here and also 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.890
 you want to check a folder for 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.640
 know what is taking up space in a 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.439
 folder 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.240
 you can click here and look for this 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.760
 folder 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.510
 okay so we will do a scan 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.760
 here an analysis not disks and 2.0 dci 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.710
 which is always very full and the 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.810
 People do not know why we 're going 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.480
 do an analysis here on this disk here 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.880
 the two- point speech 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.340
 it will start analyzing and verifying the 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.340
 that you have on your disk is here you will see 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.520
 the progress of program analysis then 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.070
 already at 71 per cent and 80 per cent 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.110
 he analyzes it and here you can 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.420
 notice that he is writing everything 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.180
 that you have in your hd files 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.370
 larger will be framed larger 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.230
 then this file here would be in the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.890
 if a folder to backup 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.300
 She has 67 gigs and she is in a 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.460
 very large because the paste that is 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.980
 taking up more space on HD 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.920
 It's already over and it's you. 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.070
 seeing the boxes all the folders and 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.230
 subfolders that are inside your hd c 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.940
 two points here can also be a 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.520
 other letter to another hd 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.310
 so I found out here that the folder 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.870
 peccato taking up a lot of space on hd 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.880
 so if I want to go there in this folder 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.250
 backup simply publish with the button 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.770
 right mouse and I came here to open 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.080
 and the program will take me there for that 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.240
 folder and here inside that backup folder 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.010
 have all the files that are here 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.780
 backups of games that I did 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.570
 then these games backups occupying a 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.550
 space on hd so I just 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.930
 find out what was taking up so much 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.490
 space in hd 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.070
 in case you're going to be the same thing 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.320
 they will open the program, they will put it to 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.180
 scan and you will repair 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.340
 What is a big picture, how was it? 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.530
 showing here in this very great care 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.960
 will be a file that will be more 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.930
 full then we found out that it is the 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.510
 which takes up a lot of space on hd 1 62 point 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.270
 This is where you backup your sins in the 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.700
 games then you can delete those 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.580
 files to reduce such or 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.520
 save and another hd and I do not know the dvd 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.980
 case and what emotion all the folders that 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.600
 I have if you want to know the ceiling of the 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.150
 space you have can be seen here in 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.250
 little star 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.130
 so here you will know where space 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.630
 you have in my car felt 1.5 ghz 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.729
 Okay, you do not want to know if it tightens anymore. 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.979
 here in this line he says that the option of 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.349
 Do you know how many gigas you have got 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.720
 another option that we have here is 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.000
 just these two squares here if you 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.220
 press and square here you will see the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.289
 main folders 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.389
 if you press that other square you 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.560
 will see the folders that are inside the 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.930
 main parts 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.490
 and those other square are files that 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.380
 do you have on disk c? 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.720
 are steps you have disks and then 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.190
 you can click up or else 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.050
 simply place the mouse on top and 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.819
 will describe how much space and 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.210
 worrying in the case here that norton 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:02.280
 is occupying 614 points 9 mb 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.500
 So I'll show you the body of 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.569
 spaces installed in the pam and 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.400
 will also show how much space 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.530
 the files you save on your HD 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.030
 they are also occupying as was 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.680
 just paralyze people will know 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.539
 that is taking up too much space by 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.220
 number cnec will be saying here the 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.860
 both of people who are occupying and 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.479
 also by the larger square which is a 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.000
 graph that it will show with both 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.680
 space to occupy in our case was 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.590
 found that the backup folder 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.240
 worrying about the largest space in HD and 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.960
 other files not occupying much less 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.300
 space 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.979
 Okay now now that you already know how 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.030
 discovered that he is stealing space in the 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.650
 your hd 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.020
 I hope you put this procedure in 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.030
 practice if you need it and 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.820
 find out what steals so much space on hd 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.440
 and I do not have this personal problem any more 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.659
 Thank you very much for watching, please
