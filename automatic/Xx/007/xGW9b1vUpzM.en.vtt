you doing good well let's talk about
these<00:00:26.390> exciting<00:00:27.080> right<00:00:27.590> on<00:00:27.710> well<00:00:28.369> made<00:00:28.850> in

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
these exciting right on well made in

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.400 
these exciting right on well made in
America<00:00:29.360> that's<00:00:29.510> the<00:00:29.690> main<00:00:29.840> thing<00:00:30.080> we're

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
America that's the main thing we're

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.770 
America that's the main thing we're
making<00:00:30.680> them<00:00:30.800> New<00:00:31.160> York<00:00:31.430> at<00:00:31.699> our<00:00:31.880> factory<00:00:32.360> and

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
making them New York at our factory and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.290 
making them New York at our factory and
we've<00:00:33.199> done<00:00:33.350> a<00:00:33.379> few<00:00:33.620> things<00:00:33.680> differently<00:00:34.300> we

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
we've done a few things differently we

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.939 
we've done a few things differently we
redesigned<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:35.960> tip<00:00:36.170> it's<00:00:36.440> called<00:00:36.650> the<00:00:36.739> Geo

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
redesigned the tip it's called the Geo

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.079 
redesigned the tip it's called the Geo
tip<00:00:37.220> most<00:00:38.180> tips<00:00:39.110> you<00:00:39.500> know<00:00:39.620> with<00:00:40.040> when<00:00:40.820> Jax

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:41.089 
tip most tips you know with when Jax

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.500 
tip most tips you know with when Jax
come<00:00:41.390> out<00:00:41.540> of<00:00:41.629> spec<00:00:41.930> out<00:00:42.199> of<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.440> factories

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
come out of spec out of the factories

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.119 
come out of spec out of the factories
the<00:00:44.510> they<00:00:44.839> don't<00:00:44.960> fit<00:00:45.290> correctly<00:00:45.559> they<00:00:45.920> might

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
the they don't fit correctly they might

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.320 
the they don't fit correctly they might
give<00:00:46.400> you<00:00:46.489> a<00:00:46.519> connection<00:00:46.790> that<00:00:47.180> looks

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
give you a connection that looks

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.130 
give you a connection that looks
something<00:00:47.570> like<00:00:47.720> that

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
something like that

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.070 
something like that
and<00:00:48.699> it's<00:00:49.699> a<00:00:49.820> connection<00:00:50.300> but<00:00:50.570> it<00:00:50.750> could<00:00:50.930> go

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
and it's a connection but it could go

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.259 
and it's a connection but it could go
out<00:00:51.229> at<00:00:51.379> any<00:00:51.530> time<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.190> we<00:00:52.400> change<00:00:53.180> the

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
out at any time so we change the

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.299 
out at any time so we change the
geometry<00:00:53.930> of<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.140> tip<00:00:54.350> so<00:00:54.559> that<00:00:54.860> the

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
geometry of the tip so that the

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.880 
geometry of the tip so that the
connection<00:00:55.760> is<00:00:55.909> always<00:00:56.239> secure<00:00:56.890> another

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
connection is always secure another

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.920 
connection is always secure another
thing<00:00:58.070> we<00:00:58.159> did<00:00:58.339> differently<00:00:58.670> as<00:00:59.570> we<00:00:59.750> have<00:00:59.900> a

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
thing we did differently as we have a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.689 
thing we did differently as we have a
hundred<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:00.409> eighty<00:01:00.559> degree<00:01:00.920> solder<00:01:01.220> joint

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
hundred and eighty degree solder joint

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.259 
hundred and eighty degree solder joint
it's<00:01:02.360> a<00:01:02.510> 4,000<00:01:03.440> degree<00:01:03.519> micro<00:01:04.519> flame<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.150> our

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
it's a 4,000 degree micro flame and our

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.390 
it's a 4,000 degree micro flame and our
that<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:05.900> actually<00:01:06.200> does<00:01:06.350> a<00:01:06.380> soldering<00:01:06.830> and

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
that that actually does a soldering and

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.120 
that that actually does a soldering and
what<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:08.030> get<00:01:08.299> is<00:01:08.510> a<00:01:08.540> very<00:01:08.960> strong<00:01:09.409> solder

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
what you get is a very strong solder

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.530 
what you get is a very strong solder
joint<00:01:10.490> 180<00:01:11.479> degrees<00:01:11.900> around<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.160> braid<00:01:13.540> that

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
joint 180 degrees around the braid that

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.300 
joint 180 degrees around the braid that
solder<00:01:15.140> joint<00:01:15.410> is<00:01:15.560> actually<00:01:15.830> stronger<00:01:16.280> than

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
solder joint is actually stronger than

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.860 
solder joint is actually stronger than
the<00:01:16.490> cable<00:01:16.820> itself<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.210> cable<00:01:17.510> will<00:01:17.630> break

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
the cable itself the cable will break

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.290 
the cable itself the cable will break
before<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.230> solder<00:01:18.530> joint<00:01:18.800> does<00:01:19.010> and<00:01:19.730> lastly

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
before the solder joint does and lastly

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.180 
before the solder joint does and lastly
we<00:01:20.510> spent<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.840> lot<00:01:20.990> of<00:01:21.050> time<00:01:21.350> actually<00:01:21.920> working

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
we spent a lot of time actually working

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.310 
we spent a lot of time actually working
on<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.490> tone<00:01:22.670> of<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:22.880> cable<00:01:23.270> we<00:01:24.020> didn't<00:01:24.200> want

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
on the tone of the cable we didn't want

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.780 
on the tone of the cable we didn't want
it<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.410> be<00:01:24.560> too<00:01:24.740> dark<00:01:24.980> we<00:01:25.250> didn't<00:01:25.460> want<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:25.640> be

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
it to be too dark we didn't want to be

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.460 
it to be too dark we didn't want to be
too<00:01:25.940> bright<00:01:26.120> we<00:01:26.420> wanted<00:01:26.690> to<00:01:26.780> be<00:01:26.900> just<00:01:27.140> sort<00:01:27.350> of

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
too bright we wanted to be just sort of

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.280 
too bright we wanted to be just sort of
have<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:27.680> nice<00:01:27.980> big<00:01:28.490> natural<00:01:29.150> footprint<00:01:29.690> so

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
have a nice big natural footprint so

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.500 
have a nice big natural footprint so
that<00:01:30.440> when<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.620> guitar<00:01:30.920> player<00:01:31.100> plugs<00:01:31.490> in<00:01:31.700> he

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
that when a guitar player plugs in he

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.540 
that when a guitar player plugs in he
hits<00:01:32.720> a<00:01:32.840> chord<00:01:33.110> he's<00:01:33.380> like<00:01:33.590> that's<00:01:34.010> it<00:01:34.220> that's

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
hits a chord he's like that's it that's

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.920 
hits a chord he's like that's it that's
my<00:01:34.700> tone<00:01:36.190> and<00:01:37.190> lengths<00:01:37.850> we<00:01:38.000> got<00:01:38.150> tens<00:01:38.450> we<00:01:38.780> got

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
my tone and lengths we got tens we got

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.470 
my tone and lengths we got tens we got
twenty<00:01:39.320> we've<00:01:39.590> got<00:01:39.770> ten<00:01:40.040> fifteen<00:01:40.670> twenty<00:01:41.000> and

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
twenty we've got ten fifteen twenty and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.820 
twenty we've got ten fifteen twenty and
thirty<00:01:41.540> in<00:01:42.200> straight<00:01:42.680> -<00:01:42.800> straight
