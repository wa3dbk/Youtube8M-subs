I<00:02:13.070> think<00:02:13.370> it's<00:02:13.490> funny<00:02:13.730> it's<00:02:14.330> always<00:02:14.630> the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
I think it's funny it's always the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.450 
I think it's funny it's always the
people<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.110> have<00:02:15.230> absolutely<00:02:15.470> no<00:02:16.070> videos

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
people that have absolutely no videos

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.890 
people that have absolutely no videos
that<00:02:16.700> sit<00:02:16.850> there<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.060> talk<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.660> most

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
that sit there and talk the most

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.260 
that sit there and talk the most
and<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:18.830> think<00:02:18.920> that's<00:02:19.220> ironic<00:02:19.730> because<00:02:19.760> it's

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
and I think that's ironic because it's

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.640 
and I think that's ironic because it's
like<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.660> know<00:02:20.780> here<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.110> are<00:02:21.230> talking<00:02:21.560> about

like you know here you are talking about
my<00:02:21.980> video<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.490> yet<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:22.970> don't<00:02:23.120> even<00:02:23.180> have<00:02:23.330> the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
my video and yet you don't even have the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.630 
my video and yet you don't even have the
balls<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.780> do<00:02:23.900> your<00:02:24.080> own<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.220> just<00:02:25.490> think

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
balls to do your own that I just think

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.670 
balls to do your own that I just think
that's<00:02:25.730> retarded<00:02:26.090> but<00:02:26.630> that's<00:02:27.110> just<00:02:27.290> my

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
that's retarded but that's just my

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.220 
that's retarded but that's just my
opinion<00:02:27.820> if<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:29.090> don't<00:02:29.270> like<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:29.690> change<00:02:30.020> the
