00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.220
 Hello friends with you market and after 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.700
 past videos quite a lot of people in 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.730
 lichku 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:17.300
 and also on the wall they asked me to pass 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:21.859
 hello to them, I give you all my friends 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:27.019
 hi i love you all 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:34.460
 but we have something interesting 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:39.120
 my subscriber coroner by the way is 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:42.140
 master of the highest level in and m 400 g n d 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.420
 warface like he's so very very 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.110
 bends though i didn't play with him in my 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.690
 Well, it is not about us right now. 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:57.649
 talked again about sensitivity he 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.649
 like i love this topic and suddenly here 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:06.479
 I came up with an interesting idea we 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:10.020
 like everyone was talking talked about the most 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.570
 simple and effective the easiest 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.729
 sensitivity selection techniques to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.210
 buy a rug if you are very tall 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.490
 sensitivity and let's do 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.979
 video for those who have already bought this rug 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.439
 I played it and learned how to play it. 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.960
 to think how he could still improve his 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.380
 sensitivity there raise lower and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.479
 so on there is one way which i 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.700
 recently applied a little lower yet 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:47.850
 my sensitivity why am i 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.470
 did and what is the method itself just here 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.060
 she is the best selection method 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.399
 sensitivity to yourself 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:01.530
 I'll show you a video by example 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:02.560
 Warface polygon so friends here we are 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.320
 polygon them 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.580
 need to take some weapons from which 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.020
 high accuracy from the thigh I'll take and sea 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.910
 are secure 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.610
 and let's see now two 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:24.400
 targets I shoot preferably in the head 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.530
 it will be the most accurate check then 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.690
 there is like nothing without warming up more 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:36.370
 less already get better let's get more 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.799
 once try now not played today 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.850
 because to play late enough but 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:46.209
 already it turns out yes that is it is enough 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.519
 fast straight from one little point to 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.709
 another little point everything flies a 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.170
 now see what I had 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.209
 sensitivity earlier now I have 14 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.540
 3 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.260
 459 used to be 17 was fine with me 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.380
 shotgun 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.690
 all arranged with a sniper rifle 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.070
 but playing for the attack aircraft or engineer 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.750
 understand when i started aiming at 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.910
 head had such an inner feeling 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.299
 that you will not succeed now this 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.299
 the feeling is just the best 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.590
 indicator that your body is like 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:25.600
 feels that something is not enough and 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.989
 I did something like this 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.640
 who is the same but i feel like 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.470
 the dacha sight flies in if the sight is slightly 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.350
 nearly flies but more often all the same 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.980
 gets it pretty good worse if he leaves 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.590
 further you understand it is really bad 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.989
 I did about drainage then 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.209
 there is kind of like and gets but how are you 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.389
 it is not enough and my hand is very hard for me 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.650
 it's very hard to move 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:54.239
 this should not be a voltage should 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:59.030
 be average quite normal i 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:01.220
 originally reduced to 11 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.930
 when selected sensitivity because 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.350
 that with this sensitivity in general was 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.980
 easy shooting yes very easy to hit 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.560
 heads 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.110
 on the landfill these are the mixes that is 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.600
 very easy 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:19.340
 I have trained like the media museum itself 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.989
 like everything about anything will reduce undershoot 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.550
 but the truth was more well, nothing 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.320
 scary for your hit more I 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.450
 felt the tension go no 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.440
 Only here in this part of the hand and not only 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.110
 here is the brush 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.880
 and here it goes, that is, I thought maybe 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.530
 to be okay with children 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.870
 there must be nothing here 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.850
 should delta should not hurt 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.430
 In general, you should not so much throughout 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:47.780
 hand moving I went to the game won back 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.169
 matches for 5 and I have here already front 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.110
 bundle 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.650
 started to numb this means that 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.870
 sensitivity is too low for you 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.460
 anyway, at this stage, well 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.550
 most likely at all for your body 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.500
 it's too low sensitivity 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.030
 so I started working playing 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.580
 sensitivity again acting out 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.010
 several matches and I realized that 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:14.289
 sensitivity 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:17.300
 14 is optimal why 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.910
 if i put a lower 13 already 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.310
 a little tension appears here it is 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.340
 on the one hand and on the other hand if 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.710
 I put say 15 something already spoils 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.080
 accuracy and here accuracy is absolute 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.580
 ok i get the same 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.080
 Of course I checked a little more in 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.260
 Sight want no longer has such 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.260
 relations 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:43.639
 But I understood that sensitivity is 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.750
 golden mean sensitivity may 14 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.919
 why because 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.750
 and the hand does not hurt in this part 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.370
 Only this part is tensed if 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.960
 you here ballet or somewhere here it 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.190
 ok absolutely it's just you 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.349
 hand is not used to such 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.490
 sensitivity here if this is all 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:04.400
 need to do higher in any case and I 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.560
 got it all right here again everything 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.479
 I'm good at it more or less 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.789
 nothing is normal when everything warms up 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:13.460
 almost no slip turns out well 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:18.710
 ok but then I also stand 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:20.840
 supply sharply in sight 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.660
 everything is great everything is great for you 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.759
 this sensitivity suits friends 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.190
 your sensitivity as for 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:30.949
 sharp turns and so on again 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:34.840
 you will certainly be uncomfortable if you are her 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:38.900
 lowered enough say then 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.360
 but here's what time again if 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.090
 This part does not hurt you and ruin 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.949
 fast enough and no problems 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.780
 you will have turns see that is 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:50.419
 more will actively work with a brush 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.370
 the brush will get used the mouse muscles will get stronger and 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:55.550
 accordingly, everything will be very 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:59.570
 well we of course on the heads quickly 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:03.080
 give dusti much better like this 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.380
 friends to my subscriber comrade crown 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.800
 ru 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:09.820
 Thank you for throwing me such 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:13.060
 great idea to make 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:16.310
 let's say guide on the field 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:19.140
 fine tuning 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:22.080
 although I did not offer it myself, but here it is 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:24.180
 so spent with me let's say a dialogue that u 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.630
 I had such an idea therefore 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:30.210
 friends remember to leave comments 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:32.610
 always well informative interesting 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.670
 with reflections because it can 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:39.600
 push me on some new ideas 

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:43.160
 for video and accordingly our channel 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.930
 will be even more interesting and useful for all 

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:49.080
 so friends if the video turned 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:53.550
 helpful and helped you get better in 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:57.470
 head join our army bend down 

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.470
 all of you see you
