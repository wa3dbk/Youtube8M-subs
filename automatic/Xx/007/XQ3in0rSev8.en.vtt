 be consistent 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.330
 in him in our bosom 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.690
 it is a principle all this I wish these people we want to position ourselves 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.050
 with a certain determined key phrase 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.589
 if you are that key phrase 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.490
 that visitors when going to the pub ulp 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.730

 dad descended results and our goal is to appear in those guides the 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.010
 results that our page 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.560
 It will be difficult to accept for visitors 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.270
 and that way start getting 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.180
 visits and more visits 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.600
 then the practice and good practice in it is offered is yes 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.010
 Saul Podo Mino not register what you have to do is that phrase 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.870
 key 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.090
 you have to include it in your domain when you register your domain 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.840
 include that key phrase because that will help 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.100
 yes it is not decisive 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.390
 does not mean that if you 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.710
 does not include soto you already have a say that just like from the beginning 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.150
 be included in the key phrase because I did not have AIDS with what key phrase 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.930
 You wanted to position yourself 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.630
 what it is that he is not going to position himself with that key phrase 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.000
 but it is not a principle 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 humphries new your site just two to register 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.850
 in practice it is to include it is because that will help 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.030
 and it will help you a lot 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.030
 so to achieve our goal 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.809
 and for example you will see occasions when ee 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.019
 what will you know 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.289
 the key phrase with which you want to position yourself 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:15.909
 is already busy 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:21.010
 the him the el the dotcom minibus unemployed and maybe an improvement this 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.659
 yes it is a very popular phrase to the best to the point it also composes 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.079
 but here the idea is what 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.099
 it does not matter if it contains some other words that simply include your 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.370
 clear phrases for example mm 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.370
 My domain 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.119
 in my opinion improve self-esteem 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.509
 dotcom was not available 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:45.450
 whereby 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.769
 Well, not the most obvious thing is that it entices to see that other than others 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.279
 that two other children are available and not to the point 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:58.319
 well this point the report point net the point jorge 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.319
 and if as I say it is that there is very popular the key phrase 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.779
 and none of your domains are found 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.609
 it can be 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.120
 you can try with someone else for example 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.149
 There is one that I like very much in the particular that is 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.959
 percent that is your key phrase 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.029
 and the word followed is included 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.089
 from the cell in the word 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:26.609
 that for example what was not got an opinion had good position 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.309
 improve self-esteem blog a little 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.829
 is a very good group there is another one was also for example is to include the word 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:33.939
 week 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.430
 the words there 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.779
 they are very words 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:37.839
 very 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.299
 gm already very popular too 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.909
 and for example here you can see what godaddy 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:44.670
 helps you with this one 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.819
 with that problem 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.429
 because he already gives you suggestions for example that he is giving me the suggestion of 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.129
 improve shahid self-esteem 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:52.309
 dot com 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:53.519
 being the 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:54.969
 the suggestion 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:58.529
 improve self-esteem blog point the one mentioned above 

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:02.929
 is giving me and many others that maybe some like are English words 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.539
 has the best and not because of so much 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:06.969
 but 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:09.969
 here in silver the situation this 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.679
 you look for tuk-tuk key phase 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:16.559
 remember that he 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:21.259
 the extension the domain does not not yet carry a lot I care that it was pointed 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.300
 with an amount that was scored hours 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.340
 point I point info 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.650
 point is made pointed point that should that not no 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.400
 does not affect the positioning much 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.070
 what is going to affect is that 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.150
 I was going to help 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.419
 is that your domain includes your clear phrase then 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.559
 it can be include the in it 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:45.939
 the top race fits all min 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:49.720
 with an additional word to get that point com 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.439
 if I did 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:55.150
 if in your case it is that you want to necessarily have a point as there are people who 

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:57.979
 he did not like to have another one of minimums that dotcom 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.250
 well that is already every person truth that is not discussed 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.960
 and you can massmutual a bit and with the words but always 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.870
 including 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.699
 your phrase 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.020
 that is going to be a very important point in maine in what has been 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.789
 Website optimization website 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.550
 if you start with your key phrase to position 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.550
 from your domain you are starting with the right foot 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.230
 remember if you already have a website that does not include your key phrase 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.309
 worry 

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:34.309
 however, you will be able to possess 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.889
 if you do not have it yet 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.249
 Include your key phrase s is good practice 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.610
 wish 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.610
 what refers to the gil optimization 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.539
 so 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.059
 you already have percent and you already know this very important point 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.460
 forlÃ¡n paktika 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.760
