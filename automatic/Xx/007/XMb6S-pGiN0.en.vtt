then<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.360> copy<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.950> address<00:01:59.219> and

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
then you can just copy that address and

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.719 
then you can just copy that address and
punch<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:01.950> whatever<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.460> want<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> do

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
punch it in or whatever you want to do

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.209 
punch it in or whatever you want to do
but<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.329> right<00:02:03.420> there<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:05.100> it's

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
but I have it right there so it's

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.700 
but I have it right there so it's
processing<00:02:05.700> firmware<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:07.350> let<00:02:07.500> me<00:02:07.560> just

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
processing firmware and let me just

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.199 
processing firmware and let me just
quickly<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.129> say<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.580> when<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.000> jailbreak

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
quickly I say this when you jailbreak

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.320 
quickly I say this when you jailbreak
your<00:02:09.569> ipod<00:02:09.989> touch<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.440> don't<00:02:10.590> lose<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.069> your

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
apps it's not like when you restore it

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.740 
apps it's not like when you restore it
where<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:13.700> lose<00:02:13.880> everything<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.570> have<00:02:14.660> to

where you lose everything you have to

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.020 
where you lose everything you have to
redo<00:02:15.050> everything<00:02:15.290> again<00:02:15.740> everything<00:02:16.700> stays

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
redo everything again everything stays

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.000 
redo everything again everything stays
the<00:02:17.060> same<00:02:17.360> which<00:02:17.510> just<00:02:17.720> adds<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:18.470> kind<00:02:18.770> of<00:02:18.800> adds

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
the same which just adds it kind of adds

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.220 
the same which just adds it kind of adds
the<00:02:19.370> jailbreak<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.210> you<00:02:20.420> don't<00:02:20.660> lose<00:02:20.960> all
