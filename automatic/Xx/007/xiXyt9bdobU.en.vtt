our<00:00:47.250> shoulder<00:00:48.030> rig<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.510> built<00:00:48.539> recently

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
our shoulder rig that we built recently

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.270 
our shoulder rig that we built recently
you<00:00:49.890> know<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.280> last<00:00:50.460> go-round<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.559> in<00:00:52.559> our

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
you know the last go-round in in our

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.220 
you know the last go-round in in our
last<00:00:53.550> broadcast<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.510> was<00:00:54.750> number<00:00:54.930> eight<00:00:55.170> I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
last broadcast I was number eight I

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.670 
last broadcast I was number eight I
think<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:56.489> move<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.940> weight<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:58.110> the<00:00:58.230> back<00:00:58.379> end

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
think we move the weight to the back end

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.150 
think we move the weight to the back end
and<00:00:59.090> a<00:01:00.090> good<00:01:00.719> friend<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.050> mine<00:01:01.109> pointed<00:01:02.039> out

and a good friend of mine pointed out
that<00:01:02.640> he<00:01:03.210> thought<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> foam<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.860> I'm

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
that he thought that the foam that I'm

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:07.070 
that he thought that the foam that I'm
using<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.700> little<00:01:06.180> stiff<00:01:06.539> and<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.840> little

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
using is a little stiff and a little

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.650 
using is a little stiff and a little
noisy<00:01:07.619> he's<00:01:07.800> absolutely<00:01:08.160> right<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.630> a

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
noisy he's absolutely right so as a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
operation spare scissors now we just

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.520 
operation spare scissors now we just
take<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.689> phone<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> phone<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.259> already

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
take the phone the phone is already

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.420 
take the phone the phone is already
split<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.810> you<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.110> lay<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.470> over<00:01:49.590> your

PVC<00:01:51.420> pipe<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.750> didn't<00:01:54.750> think<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.649> was<00:01:55.770> going

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
PVC pipe and I didn't think it was going

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.639 
PVC pipe and I didn't think it was going
to<00:01:56.070> reach<00:01:56.990> probably<00:01:57.990> could<00:01:58.170> have<00:01:58.200> gotten<00:01:58.469> a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
to reach probably could have gotten a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.649 
to reach probably could have gotten a
larger<00:01:59.280> size<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.259> know<00:02:02.180> I'm<00:02:03.180> not<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.630> sure

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
larger size but you know I'm not so sure

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.609 
larger size but you know I'm not so sure
let's<00:02:04.200> take<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> plastic<00:02:04.799> strips<00:02:05.490> off<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:06.619> said
