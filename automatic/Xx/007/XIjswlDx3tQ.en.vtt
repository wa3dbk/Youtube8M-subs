00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.710
 way to be a root user in the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.199
 Samsung Galaxy S3 and 747 m device 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.669

 interest continues with the video 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.500
 The first thing we will do is make sure 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.660
 have usb debug enabled for 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.239

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.949
 in the box of more we press on 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.409
 developer options and we activate 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.000

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.370
 We will do the following 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.620
 we go about the device and 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.480

 the next thing is to turn off the device 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.310
 now we will open the folder with the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.590
 necessary files these will be in the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.329
 description of the video once we are 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.270

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.020

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.020
