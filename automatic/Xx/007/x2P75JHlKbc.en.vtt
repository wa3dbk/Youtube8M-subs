in<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.959> game<00:02:16.140> it's<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.830> we<00:02:17.580> have<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.790> think

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
in the game it's like we have to think

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.010 
in the game it's like we have to think
about<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.330> see<00:02:18.450> if<00:02:18.540> we<00:02:18.600> can<00:02:18.720> do<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.900> and

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
about that and see if we can do it and

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.559 
about that and see if we can do it and
then<00:02:19.140> turns<00:02:19.500> out<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:19.860> could<00:02:20.100> do<00:02:20.280> it

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
then turns out that we could do it

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.030 
then turns out that we could do it
technologically<00:02:21.569> um<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.740> gives<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
technologically um so it gives the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.470 
technologically um so it gives the
opportunity<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.490> actually<00:02:23.610> track<00:02:24.030> all<00:02:24.300> those

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
I think we just work on it you know 25

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.160 
I think we just work on it you know 25
hours<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:45.940> day<00:03:46.120> if<00:03:46.270> we<00:03:46.390> could<00:03:46.570> because<00:03:46.870> we<00:03:46.900> want
