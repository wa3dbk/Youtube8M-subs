00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
but I'm just saying it's something I

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.779 
but I'm just saying it's something I
heard<00:00:24.960> Peter's<00:00:25.890> got<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.070> point<00:00:26.310> though<00:00:26.580> let's

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
heard Peter's got a point though let's

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.429 
heard Peter's got a point though let's
think<00:00:26.970> about<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.180> blue<00:00:27.390> draytek<00:00:27.750> right<00:00:28.050> now<00:00:28.199> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
think about a blue draytek right now it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.200 
think about a blue draytek right now it
may<00:00:28.740> actually<00:00:28.890> cost<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.490> thousand<00:00:29.880> bucks<00:00:30.000> he's

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
may actually cost a thousand bucks he's

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.540 
may actually cost a thousand bucks he's
right<00:00:30.420> which<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.439> probably<00:00:31.830> why<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.399> good

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
right which is probably why it's a good

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.490 
right which is probably why it's a good
thing<00:00:32.730> Sony's<00:00:33.180> waiting<00:00:33.420> until<00:00:33.660> next<00:00:33.809> year<00:00:34.350> to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
thing Sony's waiting until next year to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.770 
thing Sony's waiting until next year to
launch<00:00:35.160> their<00:00:35.399> next-gen<00:00:35.940> console<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.570> tell

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
launch their next-gen console you tell

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.780 
launch their next-gen console you tell
us<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.020> they<00:00:37.110> can<00:00:37.290> actually<00:00:37.739> include<00:00:38.340> some

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
us so they can actually include some

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.540 
us so they can actually include some
real<00:00:39.420> next<00:00:39.930> gen<00:00:40.110> technology<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.250> silly

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
real next gen technology it's a silly

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.940 
real next gen technology it's a silly
idea<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.059> know<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.690> may<00:00:43.079> work<00:00:43.260> don't

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
idea I know but it just may work don't

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.869 
idea I know but it just may work don't

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
you're talking a little bit about saw me

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.690 
you're talking a little bit about saw me
talking<00:00:49.140> some<00:00:49.469> smack<00:00:49.590> about<00:00:49.920> Sony<00:00:50.340> about<00:00:50.579> how

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
talking some smack about Sony about how

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.880

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and I think that they certainly other

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.510 
and I think that they certainly other
companies<00:00:55.410> at<00:00:55.590> different<00:00:55.860> safer<00:00:56.129> us<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.489> a

companies at different safer us have a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.639 
companies at different safer us have a

little bit more license to show video

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.549 
little bit more license to show video
