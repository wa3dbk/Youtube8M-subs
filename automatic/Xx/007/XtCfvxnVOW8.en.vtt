just show you guys that's still gonna
duplicate<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.489> adder<00:02:43.900> so<00:02:44.900> right<00:02:45.049> there<00:02:45.230> you

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
duplicate the adder so right there you

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.539 
duplicate the adder so right there you
know<00:02:45.530> I<00:02:45.560> had<00:02:45.709> pretty<00:02:45.890> much<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.070> whole<00:02:46.280> garage
