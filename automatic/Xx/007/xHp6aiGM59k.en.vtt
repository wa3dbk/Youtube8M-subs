00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:12.099
 Hello and welcome to today's video tutorial 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.270
 I would like to share with you a few pitfalls of the so-called Conference Food System 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.890
 show 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.279
 Percent when unleashed outside percent plate stands out that yes 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.900
 to that effect 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.900
 that disturbs 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.660
 but somewhere 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.170
 Oberschmidt Weise is mounted on the Homestake 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.730
 and then through a light on Schuermann in the 5 40 degree angle to the hotel 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.990
 the whole thing will have stopped there as well 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.690
 and if we look at it 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.300
 you can see it too 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.190
 in slight shadow course here suggesting that the main direction 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.710
 source 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.670
 come from up here about 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.320
 Dr interested viewer team will fall as well 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.890
 that we have 2 reflexes in our eyes 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.229
 that speak in favor of that a second light source 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.970
 came into play 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.000
 that was a flash on my case 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.790
 Dr was actually meant for that he only trigger the unleashed clips 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.520
 So I should have a Nicole SP 900 on the camera 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.790
 In order to set the standard, the world is chosen 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.180
 Operated in the manual mode and the power is completely regulated to zero 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.060
 so that the forecourts should actually trigger only unleashed clips what 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.370
 but that happens 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.370
 if you look at the spots here in the eyes the scale has to be 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.790
 Pletz but enough as in the picture still played a role 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.960
 Crowds are annoying because I have exactly the reflections in the eyes at all 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.550
 Not 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.580
 wanted to have 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.749
 m the kilo - with often noticed 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:02.290
 a novelty only if I have started with a series of experiments 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.930
 when this problem or on anyway or what the cause for 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.849
 this problem is 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.909
 bottom line 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:13.499
 Therefore, one can say that it is ultimately exclusively with the 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:17.260
 so-called member of the improvisational theater 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.469
 I have therefore made my little experimental setup 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.479
 and around which he can easily recognize 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:25.260
 we have Odense here 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.789
 our Masterplaces sits on the camera on it 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:30.399
 and around 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:35.339
 The master flashes as I said manual functions list light output 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:38.119
 Flash power soffen bull ways 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:42.429
 and he's just there to trigger uncontrolled lightning 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.329
 you start the whole unit 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.389
 at a shortcut combination two of 160 STA 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.729
 but one notes that the Master Pletz in spite of everything 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:56.969
 can still be seen 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:01.189
 why that is so I can actually not exactly explain to you 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.020
 around 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.020
 and the flash output is very low 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.439
 and also out of proportion to the performance of the actual unleashed 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.759
 Lightning to see 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:16.779
 nevertheless, he is actually still visible on the finished picture 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:21.769
 or shows its effect because it escapes that it is a reflection 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.439
 on the object to be photographed that is super annoying 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.630
 Katemann avoided the certain eyes mentioned in the previous picture darn 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.639
 would like to 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:33.849
 and around 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.230
 there are only two 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.229
 Possibilities how to avoid it all 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:42.649
 on the one hand it is so that one should pay attention to that when photographing 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:43.799
 the 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.589
 Scale clips are always warned by the object you have the here 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:49.629
 possibility 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.139
 to swing the whole unit here 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.459
 and around 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.819
 then as possible 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.789
 turned in one direction, the BoE is suddenly no longer on the object 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:59.320
 field 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.079
 but exclusively 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.629
 the unleashed Knopp etc Aachen to Plöbst so that this over the 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.759
 Incidents can illuminate 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:10.959
 about other possibility 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.899
 which is not always given or where the phenomenon no longer occurs 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:16.489
 that's when you are 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.829
 into the so-called short-term rent improvisation goes 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.719
 at the next picture 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:24.719
 I had chosen a driving 20 standing 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:30.029
 That means we are here but the normal PC principle over 250 percent 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.659
 in 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:36.069
 For a short time we are looking for a rescue fee of 320 GB and we notice 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:41.619
 even though here I control the master seats also the unleashed flash 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.210
 he actually does not matter anymore 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.949
 yes you can look at it again at a 400 percent 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.439
 That is hardly noticeable 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.460
 so you can hold on as a result 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.610
 when we are in the area of ​​short-time synchronization, the am 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.539
 Master squares it's what the flash output 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.020
 As for 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.210
 that does not matter at all, that means there is no such thing 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.240
 Interference reflections on our model or on the Court IV 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.860
 Percent that you photograph 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.750
 that annoying even if you have already photographed something like this or end game 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.949
 Surfaces photographed purely 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.180
 one does not have the possibility in the area of ​​the protest action basic law 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.470
 To pay then it is very important 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.089
 that urges go 

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:30.919
 Maas paperwork 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.889
 always swivels to the side accordingly 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.240
 that he no longer has any influence on the objects to be photographed 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.139
 I did not want to deprive you of what the results were 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.860
 and 4 just think when working with such a combination 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.409
 Chips and up to 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:50.069
 next time
