00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
harvest a field that provides more yield

you<00:03:07.920> know<00:03:08.040> covering<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.910> area<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.480> baling

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
you know covering that area and baling

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.500 
you know covering that area and baling
up<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.349> hay<00:03:10.609> obviously<00:03:11.609> you<00:03:12.180> know<00:03:12.269> there's

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
up the hay obviously you know there's

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.210 
up the hay obviously you know there's
there's<00:03:12.780> going<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.079> be<00:03:13.200> more<00:03:13.470> profit<00:03:13.980> there

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
there's going to be more profit there

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.390 
there's going to be more profit there
and<00:03:14.400> that's<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:14.700> significant<00:03:15.329> benefit<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.780> you

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
and that's a significant benefit to you

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.460 
and that's a significant benefit to you
so<00:03:17.400> rather<00:03:18.120> than<00:03:18.450> continuing<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:19.349> apply

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
so rather than continuing to apply

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.520 
so rather than continuing to apply
herbicides<00:03:20.250> every<00:03:20.819> single<00:03:21.239> year<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:22.079> control

herbicides every single year to control

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.979 
herbicides every single year to control
those<00:03:22.709> weeds<00:03:22.880> why<00:03:23.880> not<00:03:24.120> use<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.750> more

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
those weeds why not use a more

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.589 
those weeds why not use a more
longer-term<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.829> more<00:03:26.250> effective<00:03:26.970> long<00:03:27.569> term

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
longer-term and more effective long term

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.110 
longer-term and more effective long term
approach<00:03:28.349> which<00:03:28.950> would<00:03:29.099> be<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.459> simply<00:03:29.790> over

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
approach which would be to simply over

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.670 
approach which would be to simply over
seed<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.510> field<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:30.989> get<00:03:31.079> it<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.290> fill<00:03:31.500> in

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
seed the field and get it to fill in

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.289 
seed the field and get it to fill in
better<00:03:31.919> now<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.579> course<00:03:32.730> there<00:03:33.000> are<00:03:33.030> other

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
better now of course there are other

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.270 
better now of course there are other

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
ways to get that plot to fill in better

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.670 
ways to get that plot to fill in better
over<00:03:36.000> seeding<00:03:36.239> isn't<00:03:36.599> the<00:03:36.690> only<00:03:36.870> one<00:03:37.319> and

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
over seeding isn't the only one and

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.949 
over seeding isn't the only one and
these<00:03:37.829> other<00:03:38.069> you<00:03:38.940> know<00:03:39.060> issues<00:03:39.510> can<00:03:39.810> be

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
these other you know issues can be

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.349 
these other you know issues can be
helpful<00:03:40.290> in<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:40.769> regard<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:41.430> some<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.269> those

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
helpful in that regard and some of those

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.349 
helpful in that regard and some of those

are discussed in the blog article at the
link<00:03:45.690> below<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.290> hope<00:03:46.500> you'll<00:03:46.650> take<00:03:46.859> a<00:03:46.919> look

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
link below so I hope you'll take a look

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.940 
link below so I hope you'll take a look
at<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.609> to<00:03:48.239> not<00:03:48.780> only<00:03:48.930> increase<00:03:49.380> your

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
at that to not only increase your

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.949 
at that to not only increase your
overall<00:03:50.160> yield<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.269> thickness<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.900> your

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
overall yield and the thickness of your

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.159 
overall yield and the thickness of your
pasture<00:03:52.709> but<00:03:53.549> also<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:54.000> control<00:03:54.720> your<00:03:54.900> weeds

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
pasture but also to control your weeds

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.339 
pasture but also to control your weeds
and<00:03:55.500> obviously<00:03:56.459> ultimately<00:03:56.930> increase<00:03:57.930> your

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
and obviously ultimately increase your

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.400 
and obviously ultimately increase your
profits<00:03:58.919> so<00:03:59.489> thank<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.329> very<00:04:00.359> much<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.139> hope

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
profits so thank you very much I hope
