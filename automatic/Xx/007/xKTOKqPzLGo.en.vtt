next<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.950> now<00:01:37.950> here's<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.579> question<00:01:38.759> where

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
next to a now here's the question where

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.800 
next to a now here's the question where
is<00:01:39.720> C<00:01:39.930> sharp<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.439> D<00:01:40.560> sharp

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
is C sharp and D sharp

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.480 
is C sharp and D sharp
let's<00:01:42.810> go<00:01:42.990> back<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> definition<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:44.220> shop

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
let's go back to the definition of shop

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.910 
let's go back to the definition of shop
if<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:45.210> put<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> sharp<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.020> nerd<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.500> makes<00:01:46.799> me

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
if we put a sharp on a nerd it makes me

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.800 
if we put a sharp on a nerd it makes me
want<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.220> raise<00:01:47.460> its<00:01:47.700> pitch<00:01:47.909> by<00:01:48.090> half<00:01:48.299> right

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
want to raise its pitch by half right

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.460 
want to raise its pitch by half right
so<00:01:49.680> with<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.700> sharp<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> piano<00:01:51.720> when

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
on the black key here now have you guys

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.880 
on the black key here now have you guys
noticed<00:03:25.440> anything<00:03:26.160> on<00:03:26.520> all<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.910> Black<00:03:27.120> Keys

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
noticed anything on all the Black Keys

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.410 
noticed anything on all the Black Keys
well<00:03:28.890> they've<00:03:29.400> got<00:03:29.610> two<00:03:29.850> different<00:03:30.270> names

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
well they've got two different names

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.530 
well they've got two different names
right<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.620> therefore<00:03:31.920> this<00:03:32.850> is<00:03:32.910> called<00:03:33.180> and

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
right so therefore this is called and

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.790 
right so therefore this is called and
harmonics<00:03:34.940> now<00:03:35.940> you're<00:03:36.240> probably<00:03:36.420> wondering

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
harmonics now you're probably wondering

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.030 
harmonics now you're probably wondering
where<00:03:37.800> is<00:03:37.890> f<00:03:38.040> flat<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.640> C<00:03:38.910> flat<00:03:39.620> let's<00:03:40.620> go<00:03:40.860> back

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
where is f flat and C flat let's go back

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.310 
where is f flat and C flat let's go back
to<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.250> definition<00:03:41.430> of<00:03:42.030> flat<00:03:42.270> if<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:43.110> put<00:03:43.290> a

to the definition of flat if you put a

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.260 
to the definition of flat if you put a
flood<00:03:43.650> on<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.830> note<00:03:44.070> it<00:03:44.610> means<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.150> want

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
flood on a note it means that you want

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.590 
flood on a note it means that you want
to<00:03:45.480> lower<00:03:45.660> its<00:03:45.960> pitch<00:03:46.200> by<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.440> half<00:03:46.710> right<00:03:47.600> now

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
to lower its pitch by a half right now

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.540 
to lower its pitch by a half right now
can<00:03:49.020> any<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.320> your<00:03:49.620> work<00:03:49.770> out<00:03:50.010> where<00:03:50.190> AB<00:03:50.370> flat

on<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:50.970> piano<00:03:51.270> is<00:03:52.010> since<00:03:53.010> there<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.370> no<00:03:53.550> black

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
key on the left side of F therefore E is

piano once again this is an example of
an<00:04:30.120> harmonic<00:04:30.479> because<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.770> note<00:04:31.949> B<00:04:32.250> has<00:04:32.639> the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
an harmonic because the note B has the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.820 
an harmonic because the note B has the
same<00:04:33.120> page<00:04:33.419> as<00:04:33.660> a<00:04:33.720> note<00:04:33.990> C<00:04:34.260> flat

same page as a note C flat

however they are both written

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.920 
however they are both written
differently<00:04:37.520> last<00:04:38.520> but<00:04:38.850> not<00:04:38.970> least<00:04:39.240> we've<00:04:39.690> got

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
differently last but not least we've got

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.140 
differently last but not least we've got
the<00:04:40.050> natural<00:04:40.229> sign<00:04:40.710> and<00:04:41.039> natural<00:04:41.940> sign

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
the natural sign and natural sign

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.150 
the natural sign and natural sign
cancels<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.780> sharp<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.229> flat<00:04:43.410> previously

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
cancels the sharp and flat previously

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.060 
cancels the sharp and flat previously
used<00:04:44.400> on<00:04:44.610> inert<00:04:44.970> so<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.660> natural<00:04:45.990> sign<00:04:46.440> returns

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
used on inert so a natural sign returns

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.000 
used on inert so a natural sign returns
inert<00:04:47.370> to<00:04:47.550> its<00:04:47.820> original<00:04:47.940> pitch<00:04:49.010> therefore

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
inert to its original pitch therefore

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.540 
inert to its original pitch therefore
all<00:04:50.280> white<00:04:50.580> keys<00:04:50.850> on<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.210> piano<00:04:51.389> and<00:04:51.840> natural
