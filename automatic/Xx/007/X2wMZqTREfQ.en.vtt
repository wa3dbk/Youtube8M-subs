00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.309
 hey people what's up we're back 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.049
 here at world of germany and today 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.570
 we have the right class for you 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.240
 you have learned here the new series 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.400
 outside the nervous liter of nervous and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.990
 if we thought so 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:29.880
 on the internet, there are things we want 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:33.540
 We can do a whole book and how to do it 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.880
 Therefore, also up to the very top and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.260
 Let's fuck a ristic 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.820
 even almost a meter to old 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:52.110
 if you have any of this babys first 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:53.100
 Everybody is having fun on both sides 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:03.290
 Also because I know a per se 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:07.369
 be sure you are not feeling well 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.850
 you compare packaging 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.320
 I'm still tied 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.049
 the beinkraft but make it great 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.280
 sure now I have to look here like 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.280
 that in two layers 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.180
 do you like to get back in the boat? 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.410
 because we put so much only in 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.710
 city ​​nothing, I do not think so 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.880
 but of course about money maybe 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.070
 another remembers 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.040
 the last huge package to your head where 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.050
 a long write in was where a word 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.990
 extremely mario co 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.490
 people people first time the knife too 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.060
 of course, they have to be very important 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.479
 comes a little bit closer begun 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:02:02.090
 100% eleven times in the direction of the kaaba otherwise 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:05.970
 where the cartels okay here we have the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.810
 nefertiti really crass sauces remakes 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.370
 to pledge to the african course 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.440
 here again in the elite design that 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.230
 means blue orange 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:24.290
 The dominant color looks great 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:27.260
 and then the second 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.410
 a barricaid so to speak 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.049
 and yes again battery powered 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.019
 looks pretty hard from time to time 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:40.890
 what you can make out of things so big and so 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:43.049
 then the third is the brad pitt too 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.620
 Again a blatant thing looks like 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.120
 raider shone his changes 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.230
 it seems to be about the fire department 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.440
 and magazine capacity one sees 25 this 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.950
 maximum and the thing and of course 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.830
 once again really tasty and then to 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:07.290
 biggest part 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:10.170
 stops here that is the new danger sees 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.760
 that a blend of magazine and 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.010
 fall 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.790
 No, when , of course, to refill 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.359
 from this 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:24.750
 Here is really the complete why 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:26.189
 You did not celebrate and fun in the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.489
 name of the us army probably 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:33.959
 protected therefore the councils times 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:36.209
 So the thing in the face of these 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.370
 sacrifice is already recognized by 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.930
 the camera you have to be explained that 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.489
 the eu that has ever been the office 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.739
 Kerner again here all things short 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.549
 next to each other put a smaller one 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.919
 stain huge package still sleeping and 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.290
 then maybe with the reviews 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:58.049
 or the call left between 1 10 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.620
 start weeks so here you see now 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.090
 the previously opened series opened 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.359
 with everyone can and also one 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:10.349
 Serve in any case pretty cool 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:13.230

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:16.259
 say it is the hammer from such a 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.229
 ingenious package for me has never mio
