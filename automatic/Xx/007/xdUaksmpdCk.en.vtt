00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.799
 it was against horst you were very satisfied 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.980
 how is now after today to the 6 0 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.040
 well even more satisfied because is 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.509
 top class hardenberg 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.240
 well they didn't care for one 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.220
 fun match they have 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.149
 already tried one to score so low 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.099
 as possible 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:25.980
 well misplay in a very small space 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.630
 the field was not sprayed 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.599
 and all that take the week very much 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 satisfied because chaz make goals then and on 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.649
 four five chance miss that voice wants 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.329
 that satisfaction 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.250
 after half an hour you saw something against the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.510
 coach their say dude do well 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.800
 a nice game of it irritated 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.149
 a little every cover 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.309
 yes i can never understand that 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.949
 propose 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.500
 There are four five thousand people 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.269
 expansion you would lose anyway and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.860
 then one more made a game of ga 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.649
 not with eleven men before he is potted 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.930
 I understand that not so happy 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.519
 other trainers also have a different one 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.860
 vision and 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.930
 but I once again is sorry for the 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.159
 people who are there clubs that say in 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.830
 the preparation we want for one 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.180
 field player which is cut 4 centimeters 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.350
 you can also say in the preparations 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.000
 only want to play against teams that 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.630
 also really want football is that in advance 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.729
 urge 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.520
 well so maybe enforce 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.610
 but okay we consciously chose to 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.470
 already play against the top class and 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.660
 the you expect them to be a bit more 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.460
 forward play, and then it falls over 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.899
 on the other hand it is 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 another training because we will be more often 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.420
 in competition in a small space 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.539
 have to play 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.819
 and if that happens then you still play there 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.840
 certainly so and certainly such a second 11 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.640
 weather 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.640
 well then that is very positive about it 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.659
 which things are you less positive 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.189
 Well 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.229
 of course there are always moments in one 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.469
 match what could be better especially the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.119
 game from the sides when should this 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.039
 keep the field wide when you are allowed 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.399
 an interplay with the pax inside 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:59.100
 ah i found mitchell to peace very well 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.579
 now we play what he did 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.649
 whole 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.270
 approachable he was strong and and he 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.149
 makes some fantastic goals 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.990
 yes that makes me sit that up 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.119
 satisfaction 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.649
 how is it actually that the one now in 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.440
 two and two halfs against 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.269
 but amateurs seems to come out 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.730
 because that we still even team 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.250
 get better and that we have the ball here 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.810
 understand what we want as 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.989
 technical staff in this type of competition 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.489
 is it a training and then you go 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.099
 gives you more than without percent and that 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.870
 is good for your condition as well as good weather 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.120
 to catch your rhythm of competitions 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.730
 but they have planned that very well 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.420
 would be worthy of a tv in europe premier league 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.549
 and a real standin for it 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.459
 we have cover band with shell 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.880
 met with the idea that he is young 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.130
 and that he develops and where that 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.459
 eventually you end that you know 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.380
 never 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.420
 but when I see how it plays tonight 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.190
 the steps it has taken 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.450
 compared to last season 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.340
 well then that will definitely be a closer 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.799
 keep coming so you do one more 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.330
 want to get extra support in telling 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.430
 well i said that and 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.380
 I once said that and that has 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.750
 little sense to repeat that constantly 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.860
 what was actually about calling in the hate 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.750
 preparation on 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.210
 he would just play one hour only gave 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.770
 on in a warm in that what they what 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.100
 thigh what felt well 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.330
 do not want to take any risks with with 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.160
 no one 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.540
 and certainly no more calling we also see 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.680
 they don't want to be the keeper very often 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.890
 that is a barrel during preparation 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.270
 one reason we want everyone to be late 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.490
 The keeper is a shame that Ronald Graafland 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.160
 currently you can not topple where you 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.040
 it's just kicking his head 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.630
 mulders have the matches as soon as possible 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.340
 against stronger opponents 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.130
 in principle he is going to be who 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.709
 types and in particular the two 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.120
 games against the Italian 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.070
 hellas verona and 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.330
 And also advertisers who get them 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.920
 call games 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.200
 stuff on the other side of the Netherlands 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.550
 you do need another case about feyenoord 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.010
 responded to the news surrounding it 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.500
 new stadium where is the same i have 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.000
 in all those previous days I have my 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.750
 given an opinion 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.100
 well that turned out to be one 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.580
 disappointment that seems to me that 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.180
 enough what i have to be then anyway 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.120
 a disappointment 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:17.019
 well if you are feyenoord and 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.669
 management and you want that then 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.320
 it feels like a disappointment too 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.820
 for yourself 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.650
 yes I would not like the new stadium 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.639
 but I realize it's for 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.620
 the club 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.620
 would be very important and unfortunately
