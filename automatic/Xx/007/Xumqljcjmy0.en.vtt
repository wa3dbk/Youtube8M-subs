welded the seat as far forward as I

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.340 
welded the seat as far forward as I
could<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.880> could<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.600> mounted<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.020> little<00:00:37.260> bit

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
could I could have mounted a little bit

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.060 
could I could have mounted a little bit
more<00:00:37.620> forward<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.219> look<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.000> bit<00:00:39.120> silly<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:40.070> have

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
more forward but look a bit silly I have

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.920 
more forward but look a bit silly I have
a<00:00:41.100> lot<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.370> room<00:00:41.670> here<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.180> bigger<00:00:42.420> motor<00:00:42.690> I

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
a lot of room here for a bigger motor I

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.810 
a lot of room here for a bigger motor I
can<00:00:43.170> fit<00:00:43.350> almost<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> ten<00:00:44.070> horse<00:00:44.309> or<00:00:44.489> 11

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
can fit almost like a ten horse or 11

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.950 
can fit almost like a ten horse or 11
horsepower<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:45.710> quite<00:00:46.710> easily<00:00:46.920> so

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
horsepower in here quite easily so

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.869 
horsepower in here quite easily so
that's<00:00:48.960> why<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> left<00:00:49.320> such<00:00:49.559> gap<00:00:49.950> there<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.850> I

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
that's why I left such gap there so I

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.479 
that's why I left such gap there so I
can<00:00:50.940> fit<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> bigger<00:00:51.510> motor<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.219> fix<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
can fit a bigger motor in I fix up the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.549 
can fit a bigger motor in I fix up the
clutch<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:54.210> pointed<00:00:54.719> out<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.320> much

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
clutch it pointed out like this much

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.680 
clutch it pointed out like this much
before<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:57.980> then<00:00:59.090> this<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.210> much<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.629> can

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
before and then this is much as I can

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.060 
before and then this is much as I can
put<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.170> can't<00:01:01.410> put<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.739> right<00:01:01.920> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
put it in I can't put it in right to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.470 
put it in I can't put it in right to
there<00:01:02.250> because<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:02.609> dumb<00:01:02.850> three-quarter

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
there because it's dumb three-quarter

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.149 
there because it's dumb three-quarter
inch<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.750> there<00:01:03.840> goes<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.140> 58<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.010> bit

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
inch and there goes to 58 it's a bit

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.410 
inch and there goes to 58 it's a bit
stupid<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:05.780> yeah<00:01:07.760> that's<00:01:08.760> as<00:01:08.970> far<00:01:09.150> as<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.360> can

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
stupid but yeah that's as far as I can

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.660 
stupid but yeah that's as far as I can
put<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> clutch<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.100> before<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> keyway<00:01:11.520> was

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670

150 long or I think it's a bit over 150

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.030 
150 long or I think it's a bit over 150
it's<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.219> 150<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.939> something<00:01:58.040> these

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
it's like 150 for something these

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.209 
it's like 150 for something these

here but underneath but yeah then

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.150 
here but underneath but yeah then
they'll<00:02:06.540> we<00:02:06.630> mounted<00:02:06.960> underneath<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.680> bar

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
they'll we mounted underneath that bar

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.760 
they'll we mounted underneath that bar
there<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:09.860> screwed<00:02:10.860> on

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
there and screwed on

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.560 
there and screwed on
because<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:12.700> can't<00:02:12.910> read<00:02:13.120> this<00:02:13.270> because<00:02:13.360> it's

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
because you can't read this because it's

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.160 
because you can't read this because it's
cost<00:02:13.810> I'm<00:02:16.470> see<00:02:17.470> they'll<00:02:17.710> be<00:02:17.800> screwed<00:02:18.100> on<00:02:19.170> I'll

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
cost I'm see they'll be screwed on I'll

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.860 
cost I'm see they'll be screwed on I'll
see<00:02:20.440> what<00:02:20.560> some<00:02:20.970> nuts<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.210> bolts<00:02:22.360> for<00:02:22.810> the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
see what some nuts and bolts for the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.890 
see what some nuts and bolts for the
motor<00:02:23.170> their<00:02:23.980> mates<00:02:24.400> I'm<00:02:24.820> high-tensile<00:02:25.330> bolts

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
motor their mates I'm high-tensile bolts

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.130 
motor their mates I'm high-tensile bolts
with<00:02:26.050> lock<00:02:26.260> nuts<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:28.090> that's<00:02:28.270> eventually<00:02:28.690> when

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
with lock nuts so that's eventually when

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.640 
with lock nuts so that's eventually when
I<00:02:29.520> make<00:02:30.520> up<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.760> back<00:02:30.910> axle<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:31.510> can<00:02:31.900> figure<00:02:32.560> out

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
I make up the back axle I can figure out

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.880 
I make up the back axle I can figure out
how<00:02:33.270> bomb<00:02:35.640> wed<00:02:36.640> up<00:02:36.760> with<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:36.910> chain<00:02:37.180> in<00:02:37.420> stuffing

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
how bomb wed up with a chain in stuffing

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.800 
how bomb wed up with a chain in stuffing
yeah<00:02:38.890> then<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.430> can<00:02:39.610> mount<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.240> engine<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.600> can't

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
yeah then I can mount the engine I can't

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.420 
yeah then I can mount the engine I can't
mount<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.080> engine<00:02:41.170> yet<00:02:41.530> because<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.280> don't

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
mount the engine yet because I don't

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.370 
mount the engine yet because I don't
actually<00:02:42.580> know<00:02:42.880> where<00:02:43.060> my<00:02:43.270> sprocket<00:02:44.050> is<00:02:44.200> going

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
actually know where my sprocket is going

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.190 
actually know where my sprocket is going
to<00:02:44.440> sit<00:02:44.680> if<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.760> mount<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.150> there<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.750> might<00:02:47.020> be

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
to sit if I mount it there it might be

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.410 
to sit if I mount it there it might be
like<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.590> wheels<00:02:47.770> there<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.130> yeah<00:02:48.550> so<00:02:49.390> I

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
like the wheels there and yeah so I

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.280 
like the wheels there and yeah so I
can't<00:02:49.750> not<00:02:49.930> know<00:02:50.170> yet<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:52.510> bothers<00:02:52.990> I'm

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
going to just world that in soon that's

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.060 
going to just world that in soon that's
where<00:02:55.780> my<00:02:55.930> feet<00:02:56.320> are<00:02:56.350> going<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.590> sit<00:02:56.770> in<00:02:56.890> the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
where my feet are going to sit in the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.130 
where my feet are going to sit in the
pedals<00:02:57.430> sort<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:58.510> not<00:02:58.630> really<00:02:58.660> going<00:02:58.960> to<00:02:59.020> my

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
pedals sort of not really going to my

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.660 
pedals sort of not really going to my
feet<00:02:59.320> gonna<00:02:59.530> set<00:02:59.740> my<00:02:59.860> feet<00:03:00.010> are<00:03:00.280> going<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.490> sit

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
feet gonna set my feet are going to sit

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.730 
feet gonna set my feet are going to sit
on<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:00.820> outside<00:03:01.240> bit<00:03:01.450> but<00:03:02.260> um<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:02.680> just

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
on this outside bit but um it's just

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.650 
on this outside bit but um it's just
more<00:03:03.040> for<00:03:03.220> like<00:03:03.340> make<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.180> frame<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.420> bit

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
more for like make the frame a bit

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.550 
more for like make the frame a bit
stronger<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:06.520> then<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.760> tires<00:03:07.000> will<00:03:07.180> be

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
stronger and then the tires will be

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.070 
stronger and then the tires will be
about<00:03:08.560> here<00:03:09.000> ties<00:03:10.000> will<00:03:10.210> stick<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.450> slightly

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
about here ties will stick a slightly

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.170 
about here ties will stick a slightly
bit<00:03:11.350> forward<00:03:11.590> or<00:03:12.190> maybe<00:03:12.550> they're<00:03:12.910> I'm<00:03:13.060> not

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
bit forward or maybe they're I'm not

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.150 
bit forward or maybe they're I'm not
really<00:03:13.330> sure<00:03:13.450> yet<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.140> thought<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.680> was<00:03:14.830> thinking

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
really sure yet I thought I was thinking

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.570 
really sure yet I thought I was thinking
on<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:16.690> end<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.110> tie<00:03:17.290> would<00:03:17.470> sit<00:03:17.830> here<00:03:18.130> but

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
on the end of the tie would sit here but

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.350 
on the end of the tie would sit here but
then<00:03:18.730> I<00:03:18.880> thinking<00:03:19.870> if<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.050> go<00:03:20.640> over<00:03:21.640> something

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
then I thinking if I go over something

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.300 
then I thinking if I go over something
very<00:03:22.660> high<00:03:22.900> if<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.650> aren't<00:03:23.770> entire<00:03:24.100> bit

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
very high if you aren't entire bit

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.220 
very high if you aren't entire bit
forward<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:24.850> frame<00:03:25.150> doesn't<00:03:25.390> hit<00:03:25.959> the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
forward so the frame doesn't hit the

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.410 
forward so the frame doesn't hit the
tires<00:03:27.070> are<00:03:27.280> more<00:03:27.459> forward<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.030> can<00:03:28.209> go<00:03:28.360> up

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
tires are more forward that I can go up

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.580 
tires are more forward that I can go up
more<00:03:28.630> things<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:31.600> yeah<00:03:31.780> that's<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.200> progress

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
more things so yeah that's the progress

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.830 
more things so yeah that's the progress
for<00:03:32.800> today<00:03:33.180> I'm<00:03:34.180> just<00:03:34.270> going<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.480> weld<00:03:34.720> that
