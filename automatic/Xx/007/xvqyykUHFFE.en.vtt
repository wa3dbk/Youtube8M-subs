00:00:00.413 --> 00:00:04.645
"Whose Line"!
A classic Improvável game.

00:00:04.645 --> 00:00:06.861
Let's play with
Anderson and Elidio.

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:10.685
We'll get some sentences from the box.
Each one will put two sentences in his pocket.

00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:15.584
You will improvise a scene, and at some point,
you will get a sentence from your pocket,

00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:22.044
you will say it, and it will have
to make sense in the scene.

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:24.844
The audience will give us
a suggestion to begin the game.

00:00:24.844 --> 00:00:29.125
I'd like you to tell me something
to visit in a vacation.

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:32.666
- Baroque church.
- Baroque church!

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:38.620
Where I come from there's a lot of them!

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.703
That's what we'll see on "Whose Line".
Baroque church. Starting now!

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.731
Are you delivering the music sheets?

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:08.913
No, sir.
I'm waiting for my mom!

00:01:08.913 --> 00:01:11.813
And your mom will
deliver me the music sheets!

00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:16.858
I don't know!
She said she was bringing lunch.

00:01:18.087 --> 00:01:21.298
Young man, I need those music sheets...

00:01:21.298 --> 00:01:27.850
Intense situations can bond people
more than decades of companionship!

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.044
- And that's why...
- Are you a priest?

00:01:32.044 --> 00:01:35.594
No!
That's why I love my piano!

00:01:46.883 --> 00:01:50.415
Bringing the music sheets!

00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:56.646
I love guys in uniform!

00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:03.946
Did you know...

00:02:03.946 --> 00:02:10.417
Intense situations can get pepople
more close than years of companionship?

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.639
What a nice music sheet you brought!

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.171
That's what I think!

00:02:28.872 --> 00:02:35.933
You know... It's the first time
I get inside an... Old church.

00:02:35.933 --> 00:02:39.385
Don't you call this church old!

00:02:39.385 --> 00:02:42.717
I'm in this church for many years

00:02:42.717 --> 00:02:46.968
and I don't like when
people call my church old!

00:02:46.968 --> 00:02:52.191
I tought the church belonged
to Lord Jesus Christ!

00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:58.232
- Come and play... I need a substitute!
- I don't know...

00:02:58.232 --> 00:03:02.261
- I'll teach you!
- Go, my love!

00:03:04.593 --> 00:03:10.023
- Sit here...
- It's giving me goose bumps!

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:18.039
Play us a song!

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.810
What was that?

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.592
Man, he doesn't even know the do-re-mi...

00:03:29.972 --> 00:03:34.473
You will be staying here for a long time!

00:03:34.473 --> 00:03:36.442
I'll close the door!

00:03:38.812 --> 00:03:46.454
- All right! Nobody is leaving!
- You will stay here! I need a substitute!

00:04:06.861 --> 00:04:11.791
Come on, stay here with us!
Besides...

00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:15.174
I know you want to kiss me!

00:04:17.338 --> 00:04:19.678
It's me!

00:04:19.678 --> 00:04:26.052
- No... I really don't want...
- Yes you do!

00:04:27.862 --> 00:04:32.307
That's what you get for
waiting inside a catholic church!

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.662
I swear I saw two old ladies like this:
'That's outrageous'...

00:04:46.163 --> 00:04:49.463
CIA. BARBIXAS DE HUMOR
presented

00:04:50.664 --> 00:04:55.464
IMPROVÁVEL
Probably a good show.
