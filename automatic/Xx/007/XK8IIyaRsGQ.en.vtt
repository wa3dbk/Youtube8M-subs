00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.719 
than the color I think it looks cool I
really<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> look<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> color<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
everything it's nice and shiny it

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.469 
everything it's nice and shiny it
actually<00:01:43.829> looks<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.399> little<00:01:44.759> bit<00:01:45.000> better<00:01:45.180> than

actually looks a little bit better than

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.230 
actually looks a little bit better than
the<00:01:45.540> in-game<00:01:45.990> case<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:47.009> Magnum<00:01:47.700> doesn't<00:01:48.119> look

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
