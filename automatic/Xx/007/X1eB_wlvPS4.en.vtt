00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.740
 well we had said that the middle ear 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.450
 It was formed by three parts one 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.730
 previous that is the eustachian tube 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.110
 an average that is the eardrum box and 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.210
 a subsequent one that is represented by 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.519
 the cells more ideas so far 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.710
 we talk about the eardrum box in this 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.140
 video we chatted a little bit about what they are 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.850
 the cells plus your ideas that many for 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.070
 say there is not but good and of the horn 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.560
 of eustachian tube of you is a 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.420
 canal east or cartilaginous phibro that 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.910
 it extends from the front face of the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.130
 Eardrum box is directed down 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.680
 forward and inward and ends 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.620
 in rhinopharyngitis the ctera ruined him 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.780
 pharynx belongs to the anterior part 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.290
 of the middle ear measures on average 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.790
 between 35 and 45 millimeters is formed 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.129
 for two cones found by 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.320
 his part was truncated a posterior cone 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.160
 bone representing one third of the size 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.230
 of the length and a previous cone that is 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.480
 cartilaginous phibro representing the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.250
 two thirds remaining are joined by their 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.150
 cones truncated by their vertices trunks 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.100
 in what is called isthmus 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.780
 the tube has two holes one 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.340
 hole that contacts the box 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.410
 tympanum of approximately two 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.430
 millimeters in diameter and one that does 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.320
 with the queen or pharynx 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.810
 approximately 5 to 6 millimeters of 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.550
 diameter the hole that is contacted with 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.980
 ruined pharynx is bounded by two 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.770
 folds a posterior one that retreats 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.650
 to the pingo pharynx and an anterior one that 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.960
 folds to the palatal pingo and here we see 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.910
 two millimeters for the hole in the 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.150
 eardrum box and from five to six for 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.530
 the hole in the rino failures the 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.170
 muscles of the eustachian tube are 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.119
 two belong to the veil of the palate and are 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.130
 the muscles but this internal feline 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.010
 and external and what these muscles do 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.020
 is to open and close the pharynx orifice 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.060
 of the tube the external one is going to insert 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.400
 in the pit here is your idea of the pit you 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.260
 I say idea surrounds the horn is inserted 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.680
 in it it passes through the spine of the 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.330
 sebin and finish the palate talking 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.980
 the intern is inserted in the face in 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.500
 triumph of the boulder goes towards 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.240
 down and back behind the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.100
 horn is inserted into it in the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.050
 tubal cartilage and then goes by 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.920
 above the external and inside to the 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.899
 soft palate 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.430
 when the external one was closed 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.720
 the tubular orifice on one side and for 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.300
 another side tense the veil of the palate 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.860
 when the inmate will be found 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.370
 build your neighborhood on the other side 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.319
 elevates the veil of the palate these nerves 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.390
 these muscles forgiveness stainer fords in 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.160
 the case of the pri is fine internal by the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.140
 pharynx process that arises from a 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.630
 anastomosis of the nine of the pairs 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.640
 channels 9 10 and 11 the external one is to have 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.400
 ford by the lower jaw than branch 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.410
 Trigeminal vessels of the tube go 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.180
 to be branches that come from the artery 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.250
 pharynx ascending that branch of the 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.110
 external carotid of the middle meninx 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.670
 which branch of the maximum lantern and the 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.370
 bibiana artery that branch of the maxilla 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.840
 internal and veins form a plexus that 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.880
 surrounds the tube that is called pressure 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.810
 port and that will drain the vein 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.790
 internal jugular 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.140
 cavities more toy days the heads more 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.060
 this day are a set of cells 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.050
 contained within the most 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.410
 towers that all open in a space 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.970
 central that is called mastoidea antrum 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.920
 the most toy club of it receives all 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.780
 the master cells ideas is 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.120
 communicating with the eardrum box a 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.610
 average of a climatic conduit 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.960
 triangular that is called aditus adam 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.480
 dunn 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.470
 They are upholstered by mucosa and contain 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.450
 air that comes from the nasopharyngitis 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.040
 and finally to finish that 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.380
 tell them about irrigation from the box 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.620
 eardrum box type is irrigated 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.780
 by four arteries mainly here 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.200
 we have the main arterial tree the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.310
 primitive wheelbarrow the internal carotid 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.950
 within the temporary and in the dow fell 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.480
 this level the external carotid the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.480
 internal maxilla and temporal 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.550
 superficial we will see that the layer 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.800
 external artery of the ascending pharynx 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.440
 we want it to enter the box of the 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.020
 eardrum from its anterior artery 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.120
 1 ascending pharynx on the other hand we see 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.250
 that the external carotid artery 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.680
 occipital this artery is going to give one that 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.780
 lent by the aqueduct hole of 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.290
 Fallopian and is called artery style 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.290
 mastoidea 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.530
 the carotid artery the internal maxilla 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.110
 is going to give us a branch that is the artery 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.760
 Tympanic enter through the caesura of 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.000
 gases and is distributed by the box of 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.190
 tympanum and finally we have the one branch 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.200
 of the internal maxilla which is the meninge 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.520
 as we grab superiors that 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.240
 enter in the box of time what 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.250
 would be the fourth artery then as 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.110
 this and the eardrum box is 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.640
 irrigated from the front by the artery 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.800
 pharynx 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.340
 from above by the meningeal artery 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.320
 media from behind by the artery style 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.030
 mastoid and from below through the artery 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.710
 tympanic 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.210
 the elevation you have to divide a 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.060
 motor integration of a lift 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.760
 sensitive motor elevation is given by 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.590
 those nerves that go to the 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.970
 muscles of the eardrum box at 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.800
 muscle of the muscle hammer 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.980
 stirrup the muscle of martÃ­n steiner 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.110
 for him 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.540
 trigeminal and the stapes muscle is 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.180
 raised by the facial so I do not 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.830
 I was wrong and I was right denial 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.390
 sensitive was mainly by the 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.640
 jacobson nerve bone branch 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.950
 pharynx that opened below the 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.930
 promoter and it was armed orizaba and by the 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.500
 carotid plexus 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.419
 what Jacobson's nerve does when 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.930
 note that there is no air exchange at level 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.759
 air of the tympanic cavity arises 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.940
 a fact that the particles it contains 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.289
 the air begin to collide with each other and 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.169
 produce a phenomenon that is called 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:38.160
 radev air action then he 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.870
 glossopharyngeal captures this radio 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.750
 air faction this shock of 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.630
 particles and triggers the reflection of 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.419
 yawn in games that then do 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.639
 tc that you have open our mouths and 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.880
 so we open the eustachian tube 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.759
 let's change that air as we define a 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.400
 reflex as an involuntary response 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:02.760
 before a stimulus in this case the 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.400
 stimulus is the radio faction of the air 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.230
 but the cerebral cortex is often 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.400
 impressed by different stimuli 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:14.190
 that recognizes as yourself and react 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.590
 in a way then listen to someone 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.570
 who yawns or sees someone yawn 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.300
 it would act as a reflection stimulus 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.160
 then the yawn would be triggered 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.930
 that would explain why the yawn is 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.660
 contagious I thought piola 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.510
 commenting on them is some curiosity that 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:33.110
 I think we ended up with the box 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:37.000
 of the eardrum 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.000
 see you soon people and see you later
