00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
dice and I would sent these three very

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.480 
dice and I would sent these three very
cool<00:00:24.359> unique<00:00:24.960> dice<00:00:25.320> towers<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.189> want<00:00:26.429> to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
cool unique dice towers that I want to

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.009 
cool unique dice towers that I want to
share<00:00:26.640> with<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.689> them<00:00:27.869> my<00:00:27.960> personal

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019

favorite<00:00:28.679> I'm<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.009> show<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.250> at<00:00:29.339> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
favorite I'm going to show you at the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.999 
favorite I'm going to show you at the
very<00:00:29.609> end<00:00:29.939> but<00:00:30.839> all<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.109> these<00:00:31.259> were<00:00:31.619> designed

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
very end but all of these were designed

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.510 
very end but all of these were designed
by<00:00:32.360> unique<00:00:33.360> dice<00:00:33.750> towers<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> first<00:00:35.280> one

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
by unique dice towers so the first one

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.940 
by unique dice towers so the first one
here<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.910> called<00:00:36.150> cthulhu's<00:00:37.020> chaos<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.890> I

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
here is called cthulhu's chaos and I

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.470 
here is called cthulhu's chaos and I
think<00:00:38.190> you'll<00:00:38.340> see<00:00:38.550> why<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.790> gets<00:00:39.030> its<00:00:39.240> name

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
think you'll see why it gets its name

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.390 
think you'll see why it gets its name
when<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.230> take<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.470> closer<00:00:40.800> look

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
when you take a closer look

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.280 
when you take a closer look
I<00:00:41.430> played<00:00:41.820> el<00:00:42.000> de<00:00:42.120> Toro<00:00:42.450> recently<00:00:42.960> with<00:00:43.140> this

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
I played el de Toro recently with this

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.290 
I played el de Toro recently with this
one<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.890> there's<00:00:44.220> no<00:00:44.370> question<00:00:44.760> about<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.060> it

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
one and there's no question about it it

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.150 
one and there's no question about it it
added<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> thematic<00:00:46.350> feel<00:00:46.590> while<00:00:46.890> playing

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
added to the thematic feel while playing

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.190 
added to the thematic feel while playing
and<00:00:47.460> these<00:00:47.580> take<00:00:47.850> up<00:00:47.880> a<00:00:48.120> very<00:00:48.270> small<00:00:48.720> footprint

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
and these take up a very small footprint

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.870 
and these take up a very small footprint
on<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> table<00:00:49.890> when<00:00:49.980> you're<00:00:50.100> playing<00:00:50.340> which<00:00:50.640> I

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
on the table when you're playing which I

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.730 
on the table when you're playing which I
liked<00:00:51.210> because<00:00:51.510> eldritch<00:00:52.140> horror<00:00:52.410> already

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
liked because eldritch horror already

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.100 
liked because eldritch horror already
took<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.100> my<00:00:53.370> entire<00:00:53.700> table<00:00:54.330> of<00:00:54.690> course<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
took up my entire table of course the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.510 
took up my entire table of course the
dice<00:00:55.260> towers<00:00:55.680> collapse<00:00:56.070> into<00:00:56.370> themselves

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
dice towers collapse into themselves

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.700 
dice towers collapse into themselves
making<00:00:57.180> them<00:00:57.270> even<00:00:57.450> smaller<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:58.140> storage<00:00:58.500> or

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
making them even smaller for storage or

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.410 
making them even smaller for storage or
you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.820> just<00:00:59.910> leave<00:01:00.210> them

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you can do what I do I just leave them

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.240 
you can do what I do I just leave them
out<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.750> display<00:01:01.290> because<00:01:01.500> they<00:01:01.740> look<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.070> nice

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
out on display because they look so nice

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.710 
out on display because they look so nice
I<00:01:02.520> thought<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.000> might<00:01:03.120> appreciate<00:01:03.210> seeing

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
I thought you might appreciate seeing

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.299 
I thought you might appreciate seeing
how<00:01:03.870> these<00:01:04.019> come<00:01:04.199> packaged<00:01:04.679> they<00:01:04.890> come<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.219> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
how these come packaged they come in a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.120 
how these come packaged they come in a
box<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.179> fits<00:01:06.299> them<00:01:06.539> very<00:01:06.990> snugly<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.649> then

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
box that fits them very snugly and then

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.889 
box that fits them very snugly and then
they're<00:01:08.280> also<00:01:08.429> wrapped<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.149> a<00:01:09.210> black<00:01:09.600> tissue

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
they're also wrapped in a black tissue

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.289 
they're also wrapped in a black tissue
just<00:01:10.140> helps<00:01:10.619> prevent<00:01:10.950> any<00:01:11.119> scuffing<00:01:12.119> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
just helps prevent any scuffing and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.990 
just helps prevent any scuffing and
scraping<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.159> this<00:01:14.159> one<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:14.579> is<00:01:14.700> called

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
scraping and this one here is called

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.630 
scraping and this one here is called
gears<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.079> has<00:01:16.229> kind<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.740> steampunk<00:01:17.130> or

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
gears it has kind of a steampunk or

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.099 
gears it has kind of a steampunk or
clockwork<00:01:18.240> aesthetic<00:01:18.749> to<00:01:18.929> it

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:19.109 
clockwork aesthetic to it

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.810 
clockwork aesthetic to it
these<00:01:19.590> are<00:01:19.770> laser-cut<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.490> hand-assembled

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
these are laser-cut and hand-assembled

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.090 
these are laser-cut and hand-assembled
which<00:01:21.450> allows<00:01:21.899> for<00:01:21.929> a<00:01:22.229> lot<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.469> the<00:01:22.619> detail

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
which allows for a lot of the detail

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.469 
which allows for a lot of the detail
that<00:01:23.130> you've<00:01:23.429> been<00:01:23.579> seeing<00:01:23.789> on<00:01:24.060> these<00:01:24.210> dice

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that you've been seeing on these dice

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.139 
that you've been seeing on these dice
towers<00:01:24.990> these<00:01:25.679> will<00:01:25.890> accommodate<00:01:26.520> dice<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
towers these will accommodate dice up to

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.590 
towers these will accommodate dice up to
20<00:01:27.539> millimeters<00:01:27.859> and<00:01:29.090> you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.210> dump<00:01:30.359> several

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
20 millimeters and you can dump several

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.580 
20 millimeters and you can dump several
down<00:01:30.990> at<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.409> time<00:01:31.679> as<00:01:31.920> well<00:01:33.409> now<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.560> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
down at one time as well now if you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.620 
down at one time as well now if you
don't<00:01:34.950> use<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> dice<00:01:35.549> tower<00:01:35.819> or<00:01:36.060> tray<00:01:36.299> at<00:01:36.450> home

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
don't use a dice tower or tray at home

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.669 
don't use a dice tower or tray at home
then<00:01:36.840> you're<00:01:36.899> probably<00:01:37.079> used<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.409> rolling

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
then you're probably used to rolling

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.620 
then you're probably used to rolling
your<00:01:37.799> Dyson<00:01:38.189> watching<00:01:38.909> them<00:01:38.999> scatter<00:01:39.299> across

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
your Dyson watching them scatter across

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.660 
your Dyson watching them scatter across
the<00:01:39.780> table<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.200> sometimes<00:01:40.829> onto<00:01:41.249> the<00:01:41.369> floor

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
the table and sometimes onto the floor

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.080 
the table and sometimes onto the floor
obviously<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.659> dice<00:01:42.869> Tower<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:44.090> solves

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
obviously a dice Tower like this solves

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.999 
obviously a dice Tower like this solves
that<00:01:45.210> problem<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.749> it<00:01:45.840> also<00:01:45.869> groups<00:01:46.530> all<00:01:46.770> of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
that problem but it also groups all of

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.529 
that problem but it also groups all of
the<00:01:47.100> results<00:01:47.549> really<00:01:47.759> close<00:01:47.999> together<00:01:48.179> so

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
the results really close together so

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.389
