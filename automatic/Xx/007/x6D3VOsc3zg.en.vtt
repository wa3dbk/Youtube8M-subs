00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.740
 boys and girls that what you see in 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.719
 screen is that phineas and ferb through 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.430
 of the second dimension is a movie that 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:21.010
 appeared does not do anything I think and of 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.840
 this comic that is very fashionable now 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.849
 same and the truth that brings out very good 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.619
 laughs and right now I'm not letting 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.950
 see because I already find it very repetitive 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.370
 good is my personal opinion and that I'm going to 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.300
 make slots well I tried a little 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.300
 how the game is going 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.310
 an empty slot starts the story not 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.020
 I know if leaving her inside is for a bit 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:48.700
 show you this game that has appeared 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.490
 nothing nothing more than a week I think 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.980
 and good 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.150
 you may like the little ones more and 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.900
 such one are not to the so small 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.290
 also because he did not join to spend a 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.240
 while doing well playing and such and 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.690
 game is not bad is achieved the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.030
 voices since they are the real ones that 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.800
 appears in the good series in the comic 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.340
 that this one 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.340
 yes 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.790
 and for me we are almost 2000 where 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.260
 they have not gone a little from the 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.970
 last change of tension 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.300
 what are we going 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.330
 look for the rest d 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.320
 what are you going to do today 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.300
 is what says you are doing what 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.900
 what you are doing is what always 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.700
 I think that I have time without seeing it and 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.910
 well we are already in the game and a 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.390
 game as it is said in English and here 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.390
 we take 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.290
 we can use it later for other games 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.090
 can be very useful we are going to take 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:23.720
 those that we can completely that is 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:28.330
 know a launcher 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:33.560
 we have to eliminate to know 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:36.080
 ok the coins will be things to have 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.830
 more life or some roll of these typical 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.830
 beautiful 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.850
 catch our 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.900
 it's almost the same, that's our house 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.990
 mountain light to very cool mundane 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.180
 the dessert portion 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.480
 here there is a lack of moderation very 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.180
 It would be because I will have passed all this 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.720
 let's continue researching good let's continue 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.720
 let's continue that it is here it is 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.720
 isabella 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.550
 against 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.810
 voucher voucher voucher voucher voucher no no no no no no 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.740
 do not 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.130
 they do not make a 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:25.450
 to see a sandwich ok I go up here car 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.210
 good controls are basic 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.110
 moving edit of these types of 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.810
 games that are platforms or 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.940
 platforms 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.560
 sure we can use these pieces 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.050
 to build a tip horn 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.599
 fernando look for the pieces he requires 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.910
 our plane I look for the pieces to your 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.380
 around maybe you have to deviate us 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.540
 a little 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.200
 you will have to look for those pieces for yourself 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.599
 one 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.190
 We already have the necessary parts 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.190
 let's finish the plane 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.900
 but do not complete two pieces 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.880
 now what do we do the invention I do not already have 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.880
 the pieces 6 but now the complicated ones 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.880
 good 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.630
 efe 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.190
 the good graphics are simple for 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.440
 make the psp is absolutely nothing 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.660
 nothing bad that since I prefer it is not 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.970
 everything plus the gameplay is what to me 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:43.780
 attracts me more than one game jumped by 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.780
 here and now catapult come now 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:51.969
 but I'm controlling and everything to lower 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:55.229
 to go down 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:55.229
 I feel like flying 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.280
 thanks for the beautiful info that seems 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.510
 ready 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.690
 the land is the Isabela is passed 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:13.520
 like the metal gear solid 'the one 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.520
 always helped snake 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.030
 here 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.620
 recommendable 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.690
 although in many games of this style or 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.110
 be that if you like the series you can 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.610
 play it and you've seen the movie 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.610
 I think it would not be bad 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.930
 is talking 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.900
 when checking the door 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:59.050
 it's being cut I think he's here 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:02.409
 since I do not know what else to tell or yes 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.639
 I think you've seen a lot of shooting 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:06.280
 enough 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:09.069
 many not enough to search for 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.159
 what is this game about how is that 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:15.190
 kind of lesbian roll and I think that I 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:17.830
 I say goodbye I hope you liked the 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.360
 video no no I will not do in a series of this 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.030
 I already have enough series and I think that 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.009
 it would not be many people who are going to 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.770
 possibly like a future or in 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:29.810
 indirect or something rare 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.689
 I just say do not take a leaf that the most 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.629
 important 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:37.769
 take care if you do not go to the second 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:37.769
 dimension that is dangerous
