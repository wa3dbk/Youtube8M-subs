00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
of knit and purl you knit one purl one

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.399 
of knit and purl you knit one purl one
knit<00:00:40.549> one<00:00:40.909> purl<00:00:41.180> one<00:00:41.269> here's<00:00:42.080> a<00:00:44.199> basket<00:00:45.199> weave

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.729 
knit one purl one here's a basket weave
a<00:00:45.940> it's<00:00:46.940> a<00:00:47.030> combination<00:00:47.330> of<00:00:47.690> four<00:00:48.080> knit<00:00:48.559> and

a it's a combination of four knit and
purl<00:00:48.799> and<00:00:49.309> then<00:00:49.790> you<00:00:50.030> reverse<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.659> pattern

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
purl and then you reverse the pattern

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.259 
purl and then you reverse the pattern
and<00:00:51.229> it<00:00:51.320> gives<00:00:51.530> you<00:00:51.650> this<00:00:51.799> really<00:00:52.100> cool<00:00:52.640> basket

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
weave and here's one we I used just two

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.259 
weave and here's one we I used just two
different<00:00:57.500> types<00:00:57.830> of<00:00:59.170> material<00:01:00.170> of<00:01:00.970> yarn<00:01:01.970> and

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
different types of material of yarn and

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.509 
different types of material of yarn and
so<00:01:02.839> you<00:01:02.900> have<00:01:03.140> here<00:01:03.350> two<00:01:03.619> knit<00:01:03.920> two<00:01:03.949> purl<00:01:04.400> two

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
there's a more than one way of doing it

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.210 
there's a more than one way of doing it
you<00:01:36.549> can<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.900> rap<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:40.350> that's<00:01:41.350> one<00:01:41.710> type<00:01:42.189> of

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
you can you rap and that's one type of

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.090 
you can you rap and that's one type of
knit<00:01:42.759> or<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:45.250> could<00:01:45.400> just<00:01:45.450> put<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.509> on<00:01:46.720> top<00:01:47.110> you

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
knit or you could just put it on top you

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.620 
knit or you could just put it on top you
know<00:01:48.220> just<00:01:48.460> take<00:01:48.640> your<00:01:48.790> working<00:01:49.090> on<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.450> put

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
know just take your working on and put

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.080 
know just take your working on and put
it<00:01:49.720> on<00:01:50.140> top<00:01:50.470> of<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.740> peg<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.939> way<00:01:52.060> I

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
it on top of the peg and the way I

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.960 
it on top of the peg and the way I
remember<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.890> difference<00:01:54.250> between<00:01:54.280> knit<00:01:54.790> and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
remember the difference between knit and

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.870 
remember the difference between knit and
purl<00:01:55.030> is<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:55.659> knit<00:01:56.140> ends<00:01:56.560> with<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.770> tee<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.310> so

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
purl is that knit ends with a tee and so

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.840 
purl is that knit ends with a tee and so
I<00:01:57.909> know<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:58.360> I<00:01:58.539> need<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.899> put<00:01:59.140> my<00:01:59.380> yarn<00:02:00.220> on<00:02:00.460> top

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
I know that I need to put my yarn on top

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.620 
I know that I need to put my yarn on top
and<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:02.080> is<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.350> knit<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:02.920> then<00:02:03.190> I<00:02:03.280> can<00:02:03.490> just

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.680 

that's<00:02:07.630> an<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.700> if<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:09.880> get<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.300> be<00:02:10.509> a

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
that's an it and if you get it to be a

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.750 
that's an it and if you get it to be a
loser<00:02:11.230> knit<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:11.769> could<00:02:11.950> do<00:02:12.100> what's<00:02:12.310> called<00:02:12.519> a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
loser knit you could do what's called a

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.259 
loser knit you could do what's called a
unit<00:02:14.069> okay<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.860> was<00:02:18.040> three<00:02:18.250> examples<00:02:19.000> of

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
unit okay so that was three examples of

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.590 
unit okay so that was three examples of
knit<00:02:19.930> now<00:02:20.709> let<00:02:20.950> me<00:02:21.069> show<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.280> purl<00:02:21.730> the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
knit now let me show you purl the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.840 
knit now let me show you purl the
difference<00:02:23.019> between<00:02:23.200> knit<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.860> purl<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.519> that

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
difference between knit and purl is that

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.030 
difference between knit and purl is that
in<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.510> Perl<00:02:25.780> you're<00:02:26.140> going<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.380> put<00:02:26.650> your

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
in the Perl you're going to put your

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.300 
in the Perl you're going to put your
working<00:02:27.400> yarn<00:02:27.790> in<00:02:28.269> front<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.380> peg<00:02:29.650> but

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
working yarn in front of the peg but

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.449 
working yarn in front of the peg but
under<00:02:30.880> your<00:02:31.090> loop<00:02:31.830> okay<00:02:32.830> so<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.040> have<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> loop

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
under your loop okay so you have a loop

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.520 
under your loop okay so you have a loop
of<00:02:33.670> yarn<00:02:33.880> here<00:02:34.330> you're<00:02:34.989> going<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.170> put<00:02:35.380> your

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
of yarn here you're going to put your

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.620 
of yarn here you're going to put your
working<00:02:35.769> yarn<00:02:36.040> under<00:02:36.580> that<00:02:36.700> loop<00:02:37.000> in<00:02:37.239> front<00:02:37.299> of

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
working yarn under that loop in front of

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.259 
working yarn under that loop in front of
the<00:02:37.690> peg<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.260> then<00:02:38.830> just<00:02:39.370> go<00:02:39.580> get<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:40.000> with

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
the peg and then just go get it with

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.990 
the peg and then just go get it with
your<00:02:40.860> pick<00:02:41.910> like<00:02:42.910> this

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000
