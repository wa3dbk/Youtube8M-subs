00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.130 
you can't tell how long it's gonna take
just<00:00:59.579> based<00:00:59.850> off<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.329> number<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.690> levels<00:01:00.870> like

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
like 70 or 75 or something like that but

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.530 
like 70 or 75 or something like that but
it<00:01:05.400> didn't<00:01:05.580> take<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.760> long<00:01:05.939> because<00:01:06.360> they

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
it didn't take that long because they

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.539 
it didn't take that long because they
were<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.810> know<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.200> took<00:01:07.439> fewer<00:01:07.680> XP<00:01:08.130> per<00:01:08.310> level

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.620 
certain gun or something like that you
could<00:02:45.700> go<00:02:45.850> back<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.180> use<00:02:46.270> that<00:02:46.300> first

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
could go back and use that first

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.449 
could go back and use that first
character<00:02:47.050> that<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.230> never<00:02:47.500> really<00:02:47.709> lost<00:02:48.010> any

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
character that you never really lost any

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.610 
character that you never really lost any
of<00:02:48.580> your<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:48.940> know<00:02:49.180> guns<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.989> unlocks<00:02:50.350> and

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
of your you know guns and unlocks and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.440 
of your you know guns and unlocks and
stuff<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.070> had<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:51.520> it<00:02:51.970> was<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.239> pretty

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
stuff that you had so it was a pretty

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.270 
stuff that you had so it was a pretty
unique<00:02:52.630> way<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:52.930> do<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.770> doubt<00:02:54.010> that's

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
unique way to do it and I doubt that's

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.440 
unique way to do it and I doubt that's
gonna<00:02:54.370> come<00:02:54.580> back<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:54.880> year<00:02:54.940> because<00:02:55.300> there

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
gonna come back this year because there

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.940 
gonna come back this year because there
is<00:02:55.540> no<00:02:55.720> squads<00:02:56.080> mode<00:02:56.350> or<00:02:56.470> anything<00:02:56.770> like<00:02:56.800> that

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
is no squads mode or anything like that

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.680 
is no squads mode or anything like that
that's<00:02:57.520> been<00:02:57.790> announced<00:02:58.150> for<00:02:58.209> advanced

that's been announced for advanced
warfare<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.080> I'm<00:02:59.170> assuming<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.709> their

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
warfare and I'm assuming that their

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.220 
warfare and I'm assuming that their
co-op<00:03:00.190> mode<00:03:00.430> it's<00:03:01.060> not<00:03:01.270> gonna<00:03:01.390> be<00:03:01.570> squads<00:03:01.870> so

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
co-op mode it's not gonna be squads so

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.960 
co-op mode it's not gonna be squads so
I'm<00:03:02.770> assuming<00:03:02.980> it's<00:03:03.310> gonna<00:03:03.430> go<00:03:03.580> back<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970
