00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.389
 finally the paul of advantages 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.460
 today it's about how I like this picture 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.230
 I have worked here shortly before 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.930
 but afterwards the machining process 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.970
 is relatively similar to my 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.189
 last video is no longer enough so 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.900
 explain in detail but it gives that 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.199
 you get it right up to the speed up video 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.970
 connection where I just then just 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.500
 comment and just says mine 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.480
 thoughts were brief and I just know 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.800
 I think most of them 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.340
 you will understand that anyway 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.620
 can 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.809
 it gets a bit slower than the last one 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.340
 speed was there because he said a lot 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.440
 who was then too quickly 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.539
 that is, that is just five minutes 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.539
 and have fun with it 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.090
 So let's go somebody else 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.100
 started by in the raw converter 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.360
 the picture was taken in the area 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.840
 not a situation that you can easily see 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.820
 can 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.920
 I wanted to be in the middle of where 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.309
 Focus is one to have more clarity 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.810
 and then there's a bit as well 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.340
 masked and I always do before 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.440
 masked the brightness, for example 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.180
 all around it more precisely, she quietly 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.860
 You can certainly masked as well 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.750
 simply display the mask 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.420
 I always do so comes in the end 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.380
 then itself out as you see I 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.750
 then synonymous have the lens correction 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.240
 applied and then it was already in 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.250
 photoshop los I have only with detectives 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.570
 color correction started because I am now 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.830
 I knew one thing that maybe 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.240
 not so good was the selective 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.280
 color corrections and actually almost 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.190
 At every picture she just offers easy 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.320
 the possibility of every shade and also 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.560
 the white, gray and black tones individually 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.270
 adapt what I find very pleasant 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.770
 us im very easy to use 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.229
 then I just deleted it again 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.550
 I started with it from the beginning 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.760
 again in the selective 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.500
 color correction a small catastrophic 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.150
 from so the color balance offers just 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.939
 just the possibility again 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.850
 adjust the white balance resp 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.240
 next to the picture in color print so to speak 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.250
 to give rough as we do 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.869
 have the same or not 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.400
 simply the regulator makes it all the way 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.959
 always so is always first then right 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.720
 to the left then roughly in which 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.250
 direction i want 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.680
 and yes you can see clearly auction 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.360
 What have I done, I'm just you 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.250
 Compare ever before after 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.989
 then i applied an action 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.380
 you also get provided 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.350
 if we like the 1000 brand I came up 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.560
 facebook there's extra video where 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.329
 I explain that exactly so this action 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.310
 is just used to create nominees 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.170
 the later only very much 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.970
 easily applied, I then rather 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.620
 this friendly style volt and not 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.690
 this extremely focused style rossi 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.970
 Watch the fastest while taking pictures 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.130
 would that be that blurred plant 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.780
 in the foreground no longer before 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.970
 sharp plant is because that sees 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.650
 a bit strange but at the moment 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.910
 There was no time for it because I the 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.320
 biener bush wanted 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.010
 a second later she was already 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.870
 so far away I have so far in the cut 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.460
 I'm experimenting with it now 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.090
 after all that is after the video 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.760
 been made 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.110
 I will get to now again 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.910
 changed again I was the me 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.980
 long uncertain how close it should go 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.720
 where I should position the bee 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.520
 I finally was a little bit in the 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.200
 golden cut gone that the bee 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.000
 in the golden cut then I have 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.090
 he had just been nominated and rebuilt 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.870
 that cut has changed 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:39.540
 and yes , then I have the crocoll 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.830
 and who's on each one again? 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.890
 case the slide lays meanwhile 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.970
 I understand because I has installed 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.050
 do you need to re-link to the 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.520
 description for the download you have 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.150
 then a little something repaired what 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.220
 bothered me was just that was just 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.110
 Trifles in principle and these people 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.520
 dix own system just like that 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.260
 I find a lot against light situations 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.540
 very good because they give the picture 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.970
 Pretty soon, even small ones 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:12.590
 flew at the color there i have 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:15.000
 because we repaired this lens flare 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.380
 the whole a bit adapted and im 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.640
 principle, one could already use the picture 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.270
 so I'll let it in again 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.310
 bit changed and then mine was 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.900
 aim that down there to the left corner 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.890
 that does not look like that anymore 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.860
 That's why I have one again 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:33.990
 blurred plain laid down there the 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.880
 soft drawn because i found it 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:42.330
 simply inharmonious that the objective 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:44.150
 because it's just so out there 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.169
 a picture to say so the picture was 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.160
 openly little recorded 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:52.680
 at 18 the blind and that's why 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.000
 through this extreme blur and then 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.850
 I have with a second action the 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.820
 also gets provided 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.140
 simply sharpened the stage still a 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.870
 So a little more ships to go 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:10.410
 say you have masked it with that 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.940
 Do not rush outside to get stronger 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.300
 no more 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.819
 but again looks now 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.889
 then I went with it 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:19.990
 decided to cut 16 9 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.349
 one of my favorite format i very much 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.830
 like 16 9 format dar 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:29.580
 I like the format just me 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.800
 do not wish to be as boring as that 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.599
 this driver has what it is then 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.370
 I started so small black dots 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.050
 you will look for what you are for 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.240
 I have painted the first one black 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.560
 because they are being proved but 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.060
 I made the first black since 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.580
 so that I can see them easier 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.110
 working on two levels that 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.569
 one with big point of the other with 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.580
 small and these two levels will be 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:55.419
 after inverted, then you get the man 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.800
 now it already looks a bit easy 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.900
 I like that so I could say so 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.009
 I do not like it very much 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.169
 may be a bit 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.610
 unnatural I 'm pretty strong 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:07.300
 soft not so marked 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.879
 Striking but that gives the picture 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.139
 just have a certain praise then 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:12.340
 I always masked and few points 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.770
 made it out again because it's too 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.690
 a lot was 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.430
 and yes, as I said you have to 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.370
 Do not clean it up is very much 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.340
 matter of taste with it then it was 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.409
 Almost then I was first 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.750
 finished so I thought then if 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:30.729
 I still think that in the picture 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.020
 and then have two more things 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.750
 once the creation 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:39.639
 Curve with the adjustment level 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:42.039
 congratulations curve with the with the 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:45.490
 typical curve and then in plau the 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:51.400
 reverse s-curve I like very well 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:53.319
 so a bit of a vintage look at 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.599
 but again the flight until adapted 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:57.699
 a bit more contrasty not quite like that 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.930
 flat there I have to end normal 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:00.250
 just a short photo of fishermen about it 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.310
 put the whole a bit more 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.659
 warmer and the whole thing is still there 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.229
 look a bit summery 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:10.180
 now just the picture 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:11.620
 look at our canal is worth it 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.740
 In any case there will be in the future 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.770
 more come and everything else finds in 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:20.419
 the video description 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.419
 and yes, then
