00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
not the case the buildings feel really

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.190 
not the case the buildings feel really
really<00:02:36.340> fleshed<00:02:36.670> out<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.060> lovingly<00:02:37.900> crafted

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
really fleshed out and lovingly crafted

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.800 
really fleshed out and lovingly crafted
the<00:02:39.040> depth<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.370> an<00:02:39.460> unbelievable<00:02:40.300> job<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.660> that

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
the depth is an unbelievable job of that

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.530 
the depth is an unbelievable job of that
and<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:42.370> more<00:02:42.520> like<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.820> guess<00:02:43.030> its<00:02:43.210> gameplay

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
and so more like I guess its gameplay

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.170 
and so more like I guess its gameplay
more<00:02:43.990> but<00:02:44.350> it's<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.740> level<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:44.980> evil<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:45.280> you

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
more but it's the level of evil is you

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.450 
more but it's the level of evil is you
actually<00:02:46.390> like<00:02:46.720> leave<00:02:47.160> footprints<00:02:48.160> on<00:02:48.430> the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
actually like leave footprints on the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.120 
actually like leave footprints on the
ground<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:50.050> could<00:02:50.230> follow<00:02:50.500> somebody<00:02:50.860> you

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
ground so you could follow somebody you

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.190 
ground so you could follow somebody you
could<00:02:51.220> track<00:02:51.610> somebody<00:02:51.850> in<00:02:52.240> this<00:02:52.420> game<00:02:52.600> which

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
could track somebody in this game which

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.540 
could track somebody in this game which
is<00:02:53.380> something<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.740> haven't<00:02:53.920> really<00:02:54.160> seen<00:02:54.400> in

is something I haven't really seen in

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.970

or<00:04:15.099> three<00:04:15.190> updates<00:04:15.640> I<00:04:15.849> think<00:04:16.449> so<00:04:16.750> yeah<00:04:16.840> that's

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
or three updates I think so yeah that's

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.960 
or three updates I think so yeah that's
going<00:04:17.229> to<00:04:17.290> be<00:04:17.410> working<00:04:18.190> on<00:04:18.400> a<00:04:18.459> system<00:04:18.669> very

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
going to be working on a system very

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.240 
going to be working on a system very
similar<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.359> like<00:04:19.540> rust<00:04:19.840> even<00:04:20.169> after<00:04:20.500> gather

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
similar to like rust even after gather

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.820 
similar to like rust even after gather
resources<00:04:21.660> place<00:04:22.660> a<00:04:22.690> block<00:04:23.020> down<00:04:23.290> and<00:04:23.680> then

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
resources place a block down and then

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.680 
resources place a block down and then
build<00:04:24.100> ups<00:04:24.220> from<00:04:24.550> there<00:04:24.790> like<00:04:25.000> one<00:04:25.360> piece<00:04:25.540> of

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
build ups from there like one piece of

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.670 
build ups from there like one piece of
time<00:04:25.930> type<00:04:26.169> of<00:04:26.320> thing<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.710> know<00:04:26.740> m<00:04:27.120> and

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
time type of thing you know m and

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.140 
time type of thing you know m and
hunting<00:04:29.680> technically<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.729> animals<00:04:31.060> are

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
hunting technically the animals are

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.520 
hunting technically the animals are
already<00:04:31.419> in<00:04:31.540> there<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.840> hunt<00:04:31.990> but<00:04:32.260> you<00:04:32.350> can't

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530

already in there to hunt but you can't
really<00:04:32.680> do<00:04:32.740> anything<00:04:32.949> with<00:04:33.310> them<00:04:33.460> just<00:04:33.880> yet<00:04:34.120> so

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
really do anything with them just yet so

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.969 
really do anything with them just yet so
there's<00:04:34.840> like<00:04:34.930> deer<00:04:35.229> and<00:04:37.020> sneaks<00:04:38.020> you<00:04:38.860> know

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
there's like deer and sneaks you know

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.129 
there's like deer and sneaks you know
shit<00:04:39.220> like<00:04:39.250> that<00:04:39.370> like<00:04:39.729> the<00:04:40.000> scrolls<00:04:40.720> as<00:04:40.990> well

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
shit like that like the scrolls as well

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.950 
shit like that like the scrolls as well
schools<00:04:41.590> confirmed<00:04:42.010> boys<00:04:45.600> they're<00:04:46.600> in<00:04:46.750> there

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
schools confirmed boys they're in there

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.390 
schools confirmed boys they're in there
you're<00:04:47.229> gonna<00:04:47.320> be<00:04:47.470> able<00:04:47.530> hunt<00:04:47.830> which<00:04:48.039> is<00:04:48.190> an

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
you're gonna be able hunt which is an

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.310 
you're gonna be able hunt which is an
important<00:04:49.060> of<00:04:49.150> quite<00:04:49.330> a<00:04:49.360> few<00:04:49.419> people<00:04:49.870> so<00:04:50.289> i

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
important of quite a few people so i

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.010 
important of quite a few people so i
guess<00:04:50.500> like<00:04:50.530> one<00:04:50.860> final<00:04:51.340> thing<00:04:51.520> is<00:04:52.300> that<00:04:52.900> the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
guess like one final thing is that the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.110 
guess like one final thing is that the
game<00:04:53.199> is<00:04:53.440> in<00:04:53.889> early<00:04:54.160> access<00:04:54.220> alpha<00:04:54.820> so<00:04:55.060> you

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
game is in early access alpha so you

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.790 
game is in early access alpha so you
gotta<00:04:55.389> remember<00:04:55.539> the<00:04:55.810> game<00:04:55.930> isn't<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.350> finished

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
gotta remember the game isn't a finished

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.790 
gotta remember the game isn't a finished
a<00:04:57.010> complete<00:04:57.850> thing<00:04:58.150> yet<00:04:58.419> the<00:04:59.080> games<00:04:59.470> going<00:04:59.710> to

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
a complete thing yet the games going to

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.320 
a complete thing yet the games going to
obviously<00:04:59.949> progress<00:05:00.430> hold<00:05:00.699> and<00:05:00.880> stuff<00:05:01.120> and

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
obviously progress hold and stuff and

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.820 
obviously progress hold and stuff and
things<00:05:02.020> are<00:05:02.169> going<00:05:02.229> to<00:05:02.380> get<00:05:02.470> a<00:05:02.500> little<00:05:02.710> bit

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
things are going to get a little bit

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.980 
things are going to get a little bit
more<00:05:03.039> interesting<00:05:03.220> as<00:05:03.639> time<00:05:03.850> goes<00:05:04.060> on<00:05:04.240> this<00:05:04.840> is

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
more interesting as time goes on this is

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.210 
more interesting as time goes on this is
definitely<00:05:05.199> a<00:05:05.440> game<00:05:05.620> you<00:05:05.740> should<00:05:05.800> pick<00:05:06.039> up

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
the time and i think with base feels

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.110 
the time and i think with base feels
like<00:05:11.289> I<00:05:11.380> just<00:05:11.410> said<00:05:11.680> really<00:05:12.250> soon<00:05:12.550> I<00:05:12.820> have

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
like I just said really soon I have

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.300 
like I just said really soon I have
being<00:05:13.750> implemented<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.470> think<00:05:15.070> it's<00:05:15.160> a<00:05:15.220> great

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
being implemented I think it's a great

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.100 
being implemented I think it's a great
time<00:05:15.610> to<00:05:15.700> jump<00:05:15.849> in<00:05:15.970> the<00:05:16.030> game<00:05:16.210> get<00:05:16.870> to<00:05:16.990> learn

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
by and watching the video I hope I've

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.110 
by and watching the video I hope I've
shed<00:05:29.470> a<00:05:29.530> little<00:05:29.710> bit<00:05:29.950> more<00:05:30.070> light<00:05:30.310> on<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.970> game

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
shed a little bit more light on the game

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.940 
shed a little bit more light on the game
itself<00:05:31.479> I<00:05:31.840> know<00:05:31.960> it<00:05:32.139> wasn't<00:05:32.289> too<00:05:32.560> descriptive

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
itself I know it wasn't too descriptive

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.490 
itself I know it wasn't too descriptive
but<00:05:33.130> I<00:05:33.639> know<00:05:33.729> it's<00:05:34.240> probably<00:05:34.780> modern<00:05:35.320> enough

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
but I know it's probably modern enough

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.469 
but I know it's probably modern enough
