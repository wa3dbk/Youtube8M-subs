just want you guys to know that like I

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.519 
just want you guys to know that like I
looked<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.330> normal<00:00:18.750> person<00:00:18.779> before<00:00:19.320> day

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
looked like a normal person before day

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.870 
looked like a normal person before day
of<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> doctor<00:00:19.890> happened<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.609> then<00:00:20.730> there

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
of the doctor happened and then there

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.720 
of the doctor happened and then there
was<00:00:20.970> alcohol<00:00:21.619> involved<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.369> did<00:00:23.580> this

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
was alcohol involved and then I did this

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.330 
was alcohol involved and then I did this
and<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.449> thought<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.779> was<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.320> funny<00:00:25.350> that

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
and I thought it was just so funny that

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.769 
and I thought it was just so funny that
i<00:00:26.789> figured<00:00:27.119> i<00:00:27.210> would<00:00:27.330> keep<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.599> like<00:00:27.750> this

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
i figured i would keep it like this

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.690 
i figured i would keep it like this
because<00:00:28.289> i'm<00:00:28.560> pretty<00:00:28.830> sure<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:30.199> sums<00:00:31.199> up

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
because i'm pretty sure this sums up

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.979 
because i'm pretty sure this sums up
what's<00:00:32.700> going<00:00:32.969> on<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.239> my<00:00:33.329> brain<00:00:33.390> right<00:00:33.690> now

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
what's going on in my brain right now

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.459 
what's going on in my brain right now

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
it's like an accurate extension of my

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.190 
it's like an accurate extension of my
neural<00:00:37.890> pathways<00:00:38.520> because<00:00:39.480> they're<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:39.899> all

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200

that<00:02:33.430> what<00:02:34.030> happened<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.480> Gallifrey<00:02:35.610> always

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
that what happened to Gallifrey always

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.150 
that what happened to Gallifrey always
happen<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.300> Gallifrey<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.350> that<00:02:38.770> there<00:02:38.920> was

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
happen to Gallifrey and that there was

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.270 
happen to Gallifrey and that there was
an<00:02:39.370> unknown<00:02:39.910> in<00:02:40.180> there<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:41.320> he<00:02:41.350> thought<00:02:41.980> that

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
an unknown in there so he thought that

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.310 
an unknown in there so he thought that
maybe<00:02:42.580> he<00:02:42.970> destroyed<00:02:43.450> Gallifrey<00:02:44.020> for<00:02:44.290> a

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
maybe he destroyed Gallifrey for a

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.560 
maybe he destroyed Gallifrey for a
little<00:02:44.530> while<00:02:44.800> but<00:02:45.310> actually<00:02:45.940> all<00:02:45.970> he<00:02:46.360> did<00:02:46.540> was

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
little while but actually all he did was

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.170 
little while but actually all he did was
put<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.080> in<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.290> stasis<00:02:47.560> cube<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.460> actually<00:02:49.000> he

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
put it in a stasis cube and actually he

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.260 
put it in a stasis cube and actually he
only<00:02:49.360> found<00:02:49.750> out<00:02:49.990> as<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:51.610> newest<00:02:52.060> incarnation

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
only found out as the newest incarnation

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.720 
only found out as the newest incarnation
of<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.930> doctor<00:02:53.050> so<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:53.710> makes<00:02:54.100> sense<00:02:54.460> in

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
of the doctor so that makes sense in

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.790 
of the doctor so that makes sense in
terms<00:02:54.760> of<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.240> chronological<00:02:55.720> time<00:02:56.260> period

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
terms of a chronological time period

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.100 
terms of a chronological time period
then<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.250> makes<00:02:57.550> sense<00:02:57.820> what<00:02:58.510> they<00:02:58.750> ended<00:02:58.990> up

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
then it makes sense what they ended up

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.290 
then it makes sense what they ended up
doing<00:02:59.170> with<00:02:59.590> Gallifrey<00:03:00.130> is<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:01.090> one

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
doing with Gallifrey is that one

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.530 
doing with Gallifrey is that one
sentence<00:03:01.770> probably<00:03:02.770> not<00:03:03.060> we're<00:03:04.060> counting<00:03:04.420> it
