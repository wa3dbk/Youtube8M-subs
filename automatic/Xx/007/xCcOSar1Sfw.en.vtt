years<00:03:51.150> now<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:51.960> that's<00:03:52.950> really<00:03:53.310> where<00:03:53.490> I<00:03:53.520> got

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
years now and that's really where I got

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.990 
years now and that's really where I got
my<00:03:53.940> start<00:03:54.210> as<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.540> climber<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.790> really<00:03:56.790> more

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
my start as a climber and really more

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.790 
my start as a climber and really more
than<00:03:57.150> any<00:03:57.390> other<00:03:57.630> area<00:03:57.900> defines<00:03:58.320> me<00:03:58.500> nominally

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
than any other area defines me nominally

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.130 
than any other area defines me nominally
as<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:58.950> climber<00:03:59.190> but<00:03:59.400> as<00:03:59.520> a<00:03:59.550> person<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.180> think

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
as a climber but as a person I think

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.170 
as a climber but as a person I think
it's<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.500> best<00:04:01.740> first<00:04:02.550> free<00:04:02.760> ascent<00:04:03.060> that

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
it's the best first free ascent that

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.630 
it's the best first free ascent that
I've<00:04:03.300> ever<00:04:03.450> done<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:04.080> I<00:04:05.040> think<00:04:05.160> it's<00:04:05.460> going<00:04:05.610> to

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
I've ever done and I think it's going to

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.610 
I've ever done and I think it's going to
go<00:04:05.760> down<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.090> history<00:04:06.120> as<00:04:06.690> one<00:04:06.960> of<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.260> great

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
go down in history as one of the great

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.230 
go down in history as one of the great
free<00:04:07.950> routes<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.310> we<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:08.580> many<00:04:08.760> valley<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.210> I

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
free routes that we so many valley and I

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.240 
free routes that we so many valley and I
like<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.510> think<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.900> Yosemite<00:04:10.410> hard<00:04:10.980> men<00:04:11.130> are

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
like to think that Yosemite hard men are

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.550 
like to think that Yosemite hard men are
going<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.490> go<00:04:11.610> up<00:04:11.730> there<00:04:12.000> for<00:04:12.960> many<00:04:13.200> years<00:04:13.440> to

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
going to go up there for many years to

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.500 
going to go up there for many years to
come<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:14.010> enjoy<00:04:14.280> this<00:04:14.490> incredibly<00:04:15.030> special
