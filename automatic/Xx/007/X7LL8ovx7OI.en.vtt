00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.260 

the<00:00:02.540> system<00:00:03.540> has<00:00:03.629> been<00:00:03.659> mixing<00:00:04.319> now<00:00:05.190> for<00:00:05.670> quite

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
the system has been mixing now for quite

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.450 
the system has been mixing now for quite
a<00:00:06.299> while<00:00:06.569> so<00:00:07.550> what<00:00:08.550> I'll<00:00:08.700> do<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.150> so<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:10.460> just

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
a while so what I'll do is so on just

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.910 
a while so what I'll do is so on just
take<00:00:11.670> us<00:00:11.880> through<00:00:12.290> the<00:00:13.290> tube<00:00:13.559> out<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.519> here<00:00:15.920> fit

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
take us through the tube out of here fit

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.970 
take us through the tube out of here fit
up<00:00:17.010> over<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.460> cup

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.260 

this<00:00:25.520> is<00:00:25.700> the<00:00:25.760> way<00:00:25.910> I<00:00:25.970> actually<00:00:26.380> check<00:00:27.380> the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
this is the way I actually check the

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.180 
this is the way I actually check the
concentration<00:00:29.270> in<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:30.220> pH<00:00:31.220> I<00:00:31.550> guess<00:00:32.300> use<00:00:32.540> a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
concentration in the pH I guess use a

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.729 
concentration in the pH I guess use a
the<00:00:34.190> kitchen<00:00:34.580> mixing<00:00:35.000> Cup<00:00:35.270> take<00:00:36.110> a<00:00:36.140> feeder<00:00:36.500> up

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
the kitchen mixing Cup take a feeder up

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.570 
the kitchen mixing Cup take a feeder up
take<00:00:37.390> feed<00:00:38.390> directly<00:00:39.080> at<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.470> end<00:00:39.710> at<00:00:40.430> the

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
take feed directly at the end at the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.160 
take feed directly at the end at the
plant<00:00:41.770> okay<00:00:42.800> we've<00:00:43.190> taken<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.790> the<00:00:44.720> sample

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
plant okay we've taken the the sample

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.610 
plant okay we've taken the the sample
back<00:00:45.379> over<00:00:45.739> to<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:47.449> workbench<00:00:47.870> I'll<00:00:48.260> just

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
back over to the the workbench I'll just

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.970 
back over to the the workbench I'll just
put<00:00:48.830> the<00:00:48.980> old<00:00:49.100> blue<00:00:49.760> white<00:00:49.970> crunching<00:00:50.390> in

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
put the old blue white crunching in

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.220 
put the old blue white crunching in
we're<00:00:51.980> getting<00:00:52.220> a<00:00:52.280> bit<00:00:52.430> of<00:00:52.519> a<00:00:52.610> flash<00:00:53.050> see<00:00:54.050> if<00:00:54.110> I

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
we're getting a bit of a flash see if I

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.560 
we're getting a bit of a flash see if I
can<00:00:54.350> bring<00:00:54.559> that<00:00:54.739> up<00:00:55.750> okay<00:00:56.750> it's<00:00:57.050> flashing<00:00:57.710> at

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
can bring that up okay it's flashing at

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.649 
can bring that up okay it's flashing at
upside-down<00:00:59.949> that's<00:01:00.949> flashing<00:01:01.460> at<00:01:01.820> an<00:01:01.940> EC<00:01:02.390> of

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
upside-down that's flashing at an EC of

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.450 
upside-down that's flashing at an EC of
one<00:01:03.370> which<00:01:04.370> is<00:01:05.080> 500<00:01:06.080> on<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.409> 500<00:01:06.920> scale<00:01:07.220> and

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
one which is 500 on the 500 scale and

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.039 
one which is 500 on the 500 scale and
700<00:01:08.060> on<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.330> 700<00:01:08.810> scale<00:01:10.510> for<00:01:11.510> those<00:01:11.690> that<00:01:11.930> are

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
700 on the 700 scale for those that are

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.640 
700 on the 700 scale for those that are
familiar<00:01:12.110> with<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:12.799> blue<00:01:12.979> light<00:01:13.190> crunching

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
familiar with the blue light crunching

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.030 
familiar with the blue light crunching
basically<00:01:15.650> it's<00:01:15.830> just<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:16.400> an<00:01:17.299> EC<00:01:17.720> meter<00:01:18.040> it

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
basically it's just a an EC meter it

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.010 
basically it's just a an EC meter it
gives<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:19.610> four<00:01:20.030> scales<00:01:20.740> I<00:01:22.060> could<00:01:23.060> got<00:01:23.840> the

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
gives you four scales I could got the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.120 
gives you four scales I could got the
the<00:01:24.290> CF<00:01:24.680> in<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.549> first<00:01:25.820> scale<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:26.479> AC<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.440> the

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
the CF in the first scale the AC in the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.859 
the CF in the first scale the AC in the
500<00:01:28.700> scale<00:01:29.000> which<00:01:29.210> is<00:01:29.240> apparently<00:01:29.810> the

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
500 scale which is apparently the

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.580 
500 scale which is apparently the
american<00:01:30.770> tds<00:01:31.280> scale<00:01:31.789> and<00:01:32.750> then<00:01:32.930> it's<00:01:33.079> got<00:01:33.200> the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
american tds scale and then it's got the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.709 
american tds scale and then it's got the
700<00:01:34.159> scale<00:01:34.490> which<00:01:35.090> is<00:01:37.030> another<00:01:38.030> easy<00:01:38.390> way<00:01:38.659> to

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
700 scale which is another easy way to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:45.779 
700 scale which is another easy way to
work<00:01:39.380> this<00:01:39.560> out<00:01:39.710> is<00:01:39.890> an<00:01:40.039> EC<00:01:40.640> of<00:01:40.759> 1<00:01:42.219> is<00:01:43.390> 500<00:01:44.390> TDS

alright<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:29.200> was<00:02:30.200> reading<00:02:30.590> 700<00:02:31.220> only<00:02:32.319> there<00:02:33.319> are

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
alright I was reading 700 only there are

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.620 
alright I was reading 700 only there are
this<00:02:33.620> bitch<00:02:33.950> pins<00:02:34.220> calibrated<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.000> 700

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
this bitch pins calibrated to the 700

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.520 
this bitch pins calibrated to the 700
scale<00:02:35.900> I've<00:02:36.140> got<00:02:36.620> some<00:02:37.540> just<00:02:38.540> turn<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:38.840> off

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.030 

okay<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.310> quite<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.610> fluid<00:02:44.060> which<00:02:44.239> is

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
okay this is quite a fluid which is

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.120 
okay this is quite a fluid which is
calibrate<00:02:46.330> 1,800<00:02:47.330> on<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.900> 700<00:02:48.590> scale<00:02:48.890> and

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
calibrate 1,800 on the 700 scale and

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.720 
calibrate 1,800 on the 700 scale and
that<00:02:49.819> in<00:02:50.060> 6<00:02:50.930> within<00:02:51.230> 10<00:02:51.500> on<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:52.010> I've<00:02:52.549> got

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
that in 6 within 10 on it and I've got

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.630 
that in 6 within 10 on it and I've got
some<00:02:52.940> zero<00:02:53.560> buffer<00:02:54.560> which<00:02:54.739> I've<00:02:55.160> used<00:02:55.519> to

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
some zero buffer which I've used to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.160 
some zero buffer which I've used to
calibrate<00:02:55.910> it<00:02:56.060> as<00:02:56.269> well<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:56.660> it's<00:02:56.989> pretty

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
calibrate it as well so it's pretty

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.789 
calibrate it as well so it's pretty
accurate<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:58.040> we've<00:02:58.190> got<00:02:58.370> 700<00:02:59.360> ish<00:02:59.780> on<00:03:00.049> the

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
accurate so we've got 700 ish on the

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.780 
accurate so we've got 700 ish on the
blue<00:03:01.400> line<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.930> we've<00:03:02.930> got<00:03:03.140> 775<00:03:03.620> on<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.370> TDS

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
blue line and we've got 775 on the TDS

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.170 
blue line and we've got 775 on the TDS
pencil<00:03:05.180> oh<00:03:05.209> that's<00:03:05.600> reasonable
