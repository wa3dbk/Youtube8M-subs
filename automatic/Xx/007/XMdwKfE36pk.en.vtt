we're<00:00:10.860> going<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.040> talk<00:00:11.190> about<00:00:11.340> macro<00:00:12.200> Queens

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
we're going to talk about macro Queens

all on one hotkey on the mouse and the
reason<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.690> they're<00:00:15.929> on<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.049> mouse<00:00:16.350> is

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
reason that they're on the mouse is

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.510 
reason that they're on the mouse is
because<00:00:17.130> your<00:00:17.369> next<00:00:17.520> action<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.270> selecting<00:00:18.960> an

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
because your next action is selecting an

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.859 
because your next action is selecting an
action<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.699> keyboard<00:00:21.119> by<00:00:21.420> alternating

action on the keyboard by alternating

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.050 
action on the keyboard by alternating
between<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.380> mouse<00:00:22.650> hand<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.640> keyboard

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
between the mouse hand and the keyboard

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300 
between the mouse hand and the keyboard
hand<00:00:24.359> we<00:00:24.810> can<00:00:24.990> become<00:00:25.320> swifter<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.039> more

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
hand we can become swifter and more

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.960 
hand we can become swifter and more
efficient

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
efficient

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.769 
efficient
unlike<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.050> festers<00:00:28.580> you<00:00:29.580> don't<00:00:30.150> need<00:00:30.390> your

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
unlike in festers you don't need your

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.440 
unlike in festers you don't need your
hand<00:00:31.080> free<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:31.769> precise<00:00:32.430> aiming<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.180> it's

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
hand free for precise aiming so it's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.000 
hand free for precise aiming so it's
good<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.899> put<00:00:34.230> them<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> mouse

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
good to put them on the mouse

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.860 
good to put them on the mouse
same<00:00:35.460> thing<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:35.820> hatcheries<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.570> select

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
same thing with hatcheries you select

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.170 
same thing with hatcheries you select
your<00:00:36.960> hatcheries<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.800> want<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:38.190> worker<00:00:38.430> are

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
your hatcheries you want your worker are

your hatcheries you want your worker are
you<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.660> want<00:00:39.809> your<00:00:40.020> larva<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.800> then<00:00:40.950> you

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
you you want your larva and then you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.610 
you you want your larva and then you
just<00:00:41.280> select<00:00:41.399> whatever<00:00:41.910> unit<00:00:42.450> from<00:00:42.660> there<00:00:42.930> so

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
just select whatever unit from there so

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.709 
just select whatever unit from there so
because<00:00:44.489> we're<00:00:44.760> focusing<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> keyboard

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
because we're focusing on the keyboard

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.229 
because we're focusing on the keyboard
after<00:00:46.170> selection<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.280> selection<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.969> placed

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
after selection the selection is placed

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.029 
after selection the selection is placed
on<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> mouse<00:00:48.629> hand<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.200> makes<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.860> thing

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
on the mouse hand this makes this thing

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.100 
on the mouse hand this makes this thing
shaves<00:00:50.430> off<00:00:50.640> milliseconds<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.600> these

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
shaves off milliseconds and these

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.959 
shaves off milliseconds and these
milliseconds<00:00:52.829> really<00:00:53.280> add<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.489> 200<00:00:54.420> here<00:00:55.969> 230

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
milliseconds really add up 200 here 230

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.490 
milliseconds really add up 200 here 230
seconds<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.780> had<00:00:57.870> 30<00:00:58.109> seconds

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
seconds it's like you had 30 seconds

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.290 
seconds it's like you had 30 seconds
more<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> first<00:00:59.190> 5<00:00:59.579> minutes<00:00:59.789> of<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.120> game

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
more in the first 5 minutes of a game

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.650 
more in the first 5 minutes of a game
than<00:01:00.570> your<00:01:00.690> enemy<00:01:01.020> did<00:01:02.000> at<00:01:03.000> least<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.420> far<00:01:03.600> as

work date will hit 30 seconds sooner
that's<00:01:09.960> not<00:01:10.140> what<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.290> mean<00:01:10.470> at<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that's not what I mean at all so the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.770 
that's not what I mean at all so the
macro<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.759> pretty<00:01:18.090> simple<00:01:18.560> hatcheries<00:01:19.700> Queen

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
macro is pretty simple hatcheries Queen

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.350 
macro is pretty simple hatcheries Queen
on<00:01:21.780> hatcheries<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.640> tab<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.000> evo

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
on hatcheries you can tab to your evo

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.289 
on hatcheries you can tab to your evo
chambers<00:01:25.250> although<00:01:26.250> usually<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:27.000> best<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
chambers although usually it's best to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.270 
chambers although usually it's best to
put<00:01:27.479> those<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.780> key<00:01:27.990> tag<00:01:28.259> first<00:01:28.920> thing<00:01:29.159> that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
put those on key tag first thing that

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.950 
put those on key tag first thing that
goes<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.549> key<00:01:29.759> tag<00:01:30.000> though<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.479> gonna<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.840> your

goes on key tag though is gonna be your

goes on key tag though is gonna be your
spawning<00:01:31.290> pool<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.920> important<00:01:32.579> in

exactly<00:01:34.320> when<00:01:34.740> your<00:01:34.829> speed<00:01:35.070> hits<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> that

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
exactly when your speed hits so that
