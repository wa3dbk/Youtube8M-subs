00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
this video is about how an MRI and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.310 
this video is about how an MRI and
magnetic<00:00:17.920> resonance<00:00:18.369> imaging<00:00:19.150> is<00:00:19.330> done<00:00:22.320> this

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
magnetic resonance imaging is done this

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.140 
magnetic resonance imaging is done this
is<00:00:23.590> a<00:00:23.710> display<00:00:24.220> of<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.520> strong<00:00:24.820> magnetic

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
is a display of the strong magnetic

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.159 
is a display of the strong magnetic

strong this poor nurse here has
volunteered<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.770> do<00:00:44.950> a<00:00:44.980> full<00:00:45.490> cervical<00:00:46.210> spine

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
volunteered to do a full cervical spine

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.180 
volunteered to do a full cervical spine
series<00:00:47.020> that<00:00:47.920> will<00:00:48.070> take<00:00:48.250> about<00:00:48.400> 15<00:00:49.030> minutes

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190

she panics in country will also receive
headphones<00:00:59.340> because<00:01:00.340> the<00:01:00.520> gradient<00:01:00.760> forces

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
headphones because the gradient forces

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.630 
headphones because the gradient forces
that<00:01:01.540> pull<00:01:01.780> on<00:01:01.900> the<00:01:01.989> cause<00:01:02.200> because<00:01:02.980> really

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
that pull on the cause because really

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.639 
that pull on the cause because really
really<00:01:04.000> loud<00:01:04.239> noises<00:01:04.540> sound<00:01:05.439> like<00:01:05.619> a

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
really loud noises sound like a

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:12.210 
really loud noises sound like a
sledgehammer<00:01:06.070> or<00:01:06.430> something<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:12.070> can

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
sledgehammer or something you can

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.310 
sledgehammer or something you can
probably<00:01:12.520> hear<00:01:13.119> a<00:01:13.180> noise<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.450> sounds<00:01:14.079> almost

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
probably hear a noise that sounds almost

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.889 
probably hear a noise that sounds almost
like<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.710> singing<00:01:15.130> bird<00:01:15.310> this<00:01:16.119> is<00:01:16.179> actually<00:01:16.689> the

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
like a singing bird this is actually the

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:27.109 
like a singing bird this is actually the
helium<00:01:17.409> cooling<00:01:17.829> for<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.310> MRI<00:01:18.789> device

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.819 

the<00:01:28.119> patient<00:01:28.570> is<00:01:28.689> now<00:01:28.869> receiving<00:01:29.259> an<00:01:29.680> antenna

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the patient is now receiving an antenna

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.830 
the patient is now receiving an antenna
that<00:01:32.829> is<00:01:32.979> placed<00:01:33.280> over<00:01:33.579> her<00:01:33.909> cervical<00:01:34.479> spine

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
that is placed over her cervical spine

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:44.230 
that is placed over her cervical spine
the<00:01:35.770> area<00:01:36.070> that<00:01:36.340> has<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:36.759> be<00:01:36.880> examined

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:02:06.490 

now<00:01:44.870> she's<00:01:45.170> being<00:01:45.380> pushed<00:01:45.680> into<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.190> MRI

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.169 

this<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.680> what<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.039> sounds<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.429> inside<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
this is what it sounds like inside the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:18.759 
this is what it sounds like inside the
MRI<00:02:09.509> right<00:02:09.989> now

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.220 

this<00:02:19.769> is<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> examiners<00:02:20.730> control<00:02:21.120> room<00:02:21.390> she

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
this is the examiners control room she

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.460 
this is the examiners control room she
just<00:02:22.470> did<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.739> very<00:02:23.129> short<00:02:23.519> overview<00:02:24.060> scan<00:02:24.629> no

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
just did a very short overview scan no

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.160 
just did a very short overview scan no
she<00:02:25.530> will<00:02:25.830> mark<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.370> area<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:27.540> has<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.080> be

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
she will mark the area that has to be

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.869 
she will mark the area that has to be
examined<00:02:28.709> exactly<00:02:29.930> yes

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
examined exactly yes

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.690 
examined exactly yes
that<00:02:32.879> was<00:02:33.060> my<00:02:33.209> dog's<00:02:33.420> name<00:02:33.720> was<00:02:34.200> Mitch<00:02:34.440> who<00:02:34.739> is

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
that was my dog's name was Mitch who is

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.300 
that was my dog's name was Mitch who is
now<00:02:35.910> explaining<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.019> antenna<00:02:37.410> coil<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:38.190> how

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
now explaining the antenna coil and how

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.430 
now explaining the antenna coil and how
it<00:02:38.459> works<00:02:38.700> sounding<00:02:39.269> in<00:02:39.450> imputing<00:02:39.930> not<00:02:40.140> all

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
it works sounding in imputing not all

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.190 
it works sounding in imputing not all
the<00:02:40.830> coil<00:02:41.069> basically<00:02:41.640> absorbs<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:43.019> radiation

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
the coil basically absorbs the radiation

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.119 
the coil basically absorbs the radiation
that<00:02:43.829> is<00:02:44.360> scattered<00:02:45.360> back<00:02:45.810> from<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.260> body<00:02:46.409> and

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
that is scattered back from the body and

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.030 
that is scattered back from the body and
thus<00:02:47.370> produces<00:02:47.700> images<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.629> weapon<00:02:48.989> that

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
thus produces images the weapon that

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.400 
thus produces images the weapon that
destroyed<00:02:50.040> NEMA<00:02:50.370> stand<00:02:50.700> out<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:54.109> I<00:02:55.109> guess

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
destroyed NEMA stand out and I guess

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.319 
destroyed NEMA stand out and I guess
here<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.920> got<00:02:56.099> him<00:03:01.519> every<00:03:02.519> sequence<00:03:02.849> has<00:03:03.299> a

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
here so got him every sequence has a

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.539 
here so got him every sequence has a
different<00:03:04.109> sound<00:03:04.319> this<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.160> sound<00:03:05.459> of

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
different sound this is the sound of

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.929 
different sound this is the sound of
this<00:03:05.640> sequence

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.149 

this<00:03:10.939> is<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.329> final<00:03:11.720> scandal<00:03:12.409> one<00:03:12.739> sequence

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
this is the final scandal one sequence

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.250 
this is the final scandal one sequence
of<00:03:13.280> death<00:03:13.459> knell<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.150> as<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.420> can<00:03:14.569> see<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:15.019> can

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
of death knell and as you can see I can

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.309 
of death knell and as you can see I can
clearly<00:03:15.620> see<00:03:16.629> signal<00:03:17.629> details<00:03:18.049> of<00:03:18.230> the

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
clearly see signal details of the
