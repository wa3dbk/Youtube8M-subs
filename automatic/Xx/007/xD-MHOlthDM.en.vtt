 if you have friends on the bearded channel 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.990
 my name was 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:09.440
 and this is a small podcast if you can 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.749
 express life channel own my 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.139
 life that's what you first wanted 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:18.230
 say sorry for sound quality 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.350
 and the video quality is actually yah 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.710
 podcast because I shoot on my 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.660
 phone and even though dear I do not know much 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.610
 how to take a year I use it and not 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.220
 once the video actually did not record anything 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.630
 I did not take a second shot I want to apologize for 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.710
 the fact that a long time did not leave the video to me 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.690
 Now there are very big piles at work and 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.510
 saturday 5th of july i sit home works see 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.870
 the weekend I think it's generally a satchel 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.930
 my own what I would like 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.630
 say monday 7th of july 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.489
 it turns out there will be a channel a little bit of victories on 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.190
 a different format now every day will be 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.870
 go out one by one that is in 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.520
 monday blind forest on tuesday 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.410
 there will be south park there on wednesday and so on 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.150
 will not alternate that is and so 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.580
 further so on the weekend I decided 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.190
 a little bit 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.080
 I decided to diversify the subject of the weekend 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.510
 play with you in tsivu hand that is 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.490
 will be a series of civilization probably 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.670
 first if all goes well we will not 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.500
 I will not promise anything exactly 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.150
 Well I hope that it will be released and immediately 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.970
 I'll warn you that you need to stock up 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.280
 and actually chips there Chuck beer 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.710
 who is that drinkers who eats because 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.920
 the village will be very long enough 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.580
 there may be at least an hour more but 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.340
 certainly not least here, in principle, must 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.520
 all I wanted to say at the moment 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.350
 I went to work out unfortunately not 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.760
 on Saturday do not fall asleep today say 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.350
 So 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.060
 tomorrow is not saturday and sunday 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.730
 the video will not be because 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.550
 finish urgent to cancel contacted 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.900
 all at work finish all their affairs in 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.750
 rubble principle 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.990
 I do not know you can see or not not seen judging 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.000
 for that kopeck on the phone I arrived 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.260
 new apartment to me wires stick everywhere 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.790
 they are not soldered to the wall wallpaper u slap not 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.860
 and so on I moved a new lodger 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.750
 the arch just gave up repair here that 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.550
 which in principle was when handed over 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.890
 an apartment 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.410
 when the house actually surrendered with this 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.970
 flat and he sends i like i need 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.730
 much more 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.680
 reworking but I hope I can find 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.780
 at this time and not to the detriment of the channel in 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.660

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.060
 do not take pictures except for 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.140
