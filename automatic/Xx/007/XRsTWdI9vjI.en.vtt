there the probably one of the noticeable

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.780 
there the probably one of the noticeable
features<00:01:05.119> of<00:01:05.300> this<00:01:05.449> is<00:01:05.750> that<00:01:06.229> it<00:01:06.530> has<00:01:06.800> antennas

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
features of this is that it has antennas

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.639 
features of this is that it has antennas
these<00:01:08.780> are<00:01:08.990> used<00:01:09.590> for<00:01:09.740> their<00:01:10.100> new<00:01:10.340> advanced

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
these are used for their new advanced

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.219 
these are used for their new advanced
beam<00:01:12.649> technology<00:01:13.610> which<00:01:14.000> is<00:01:14.270> more<00:01:14.570> focused<00:01:15.080> on

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
beam technology which is more focused on

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.609 
beam technology which is more focused on
sending<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:16.010> beam<00:01:16.340> out<00:01:16.549> to<00:01:16.820> one<00:01:17.090> or<00:01:17.659> multiple

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
sending a beam out to one or multiple

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.830 
sending a beam out to one or multiple
devices<00:01:19.100> at<00:01:19.430> once<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:19.940> they<00:01:20.090> get<00:01:20.270> an<00:01:20.450> equal

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
devices at once so they get an equal

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.120 
devices at once so they get an equal
amount<00:01:21.260> of<00:01:21.619> data<00:01:22.610> being<00:01:22.909> sent<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.270> them<00:01:24.070> so<00:01:25.070> to

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
amount of data being sent to them so to

plug<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:48.490> in<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:49.320> thought<00:02:50.320> that<00:02:50.530> was<00:02:50.650> really

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830

cool<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:53.410> here's<00:02:53.680> their<00:02:53.800> new<00:02:54.070> interface<00:02:54.610> I

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
cool so here's their new interface I

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.310 
cool so here's their new interface I
think<00:02:55.090> it's<00:02:55.210> really<00:02:55.390> cool<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.870> use<00:02:56.050> you<00:02:56.290> have

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
think it's really cool to use you have

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.000 
think it's really cool to use you have
your<00:02:56.650> device<00:02:57.040> list<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:59.020> have<00:02:59.290> your<00:02:59.590> guest

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
your device list you have your guest

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.100 
your device list you have your guest

which<00:03:05.380> we're<00:03:05.710> gonna<00:03:05.890> do<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:06.520> let's<00:03:06.790> go<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
which we're gonna do so let's go to the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.010 
which we're gonna do so let's go to the
speed<00:03:07.780> test<00:03:08.760> all<00:03:09.760> right<00:03:10.000> when<00:03:10.690> I<00:03:10.720> first

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
speed test all right when I first

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.110 
speed test all right when I first
started<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.650> was<00:03:11.770> able<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.220> get<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.460> thirty<00:03:12.910> one

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
started I was able to get a thirty one

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.120 
started I was able to get a thirty one
megabyte<00:03:13.600> download<00:03:14.110> speed<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:14.710> let's<00:03:14.980> begin

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
megabyte download speed so let's begin

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:24.490 
megabyte download speed so let's begin
this<00:03:15.460> test<00:03:15.790> starting<00:03:16.270> with<00:03:16.420> download<00:03:16.990> speed

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.560 

all<00:03:25.100> right<00:03:25.340> 24<00:03:25.970> Meg<00:03:26.350> 24.6<00:03:27.350> for<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.590> download

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
all right 24 Meg 24.6 for a download

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.590 
all right 24 Meg 24.6 for a download
upload<00:03:29.570> is<00:03:30.020> just<00:03:30.440> hitting<00:03:31.030> five<00:03:32.030> maybe<00:03:32.660> six

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
upload is just hitting five maybe six

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.180 
upload is just hitting five maybe six
it'll<00:03:35.600> be<00:03:35.870> about<00:03:36.080> five<00:03:36.140> point<00:03:36.950> seven

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
it'll be about five point seven

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.000 
it'll be about five point seven
megabytes<00:03:37.880> which<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> lot<00:03:39.170> better<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.560> had

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
megabytes which is a lot better I had

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.820 
megabytes which is a lot better I had
the<00:03:40.240> Linksys<00:03:42.310> e320<00:03:43.310> zero<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.840> my<00:03:45.080> last<00:03:45.350> one<00:03:45.650> and

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
the Linksys e320 zero is my last one and

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.310 
the Linksys e320 zero is my last one and
the<00:03:46.370> upload<00:03:46.820> speed<00:03:47.000> was<00:03:47.270> about<00:03:47.390> two<00:03:47.750> megabytes

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
the upload speed was about two megabytes

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.850 
the upload speed was about two megabytes
and<00:03:48.860> but<00:03:49.430> there<00:03:49.640> is<00:03:49.850> a<00:03:49.880> very<00:03:50.540> different<00:03:51.140> upload

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
and but there is a very different upload

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.040 
and but there is a very different upload
comparison<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:55.570> so<00:03:56.570> far<00:03:56.720> I've<00:03:56.870> had

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
comparison to that so far I've had

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.170 
comparison to that so far I've had
absolutely<00:03:57.350> no<00:03:57.920> problems<00:03:58.370> at<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:58.580> router<00:03:58.790> I

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
absolutely no problems at the router I

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:07.210 
absolutely no problems at the router I
have<00:03:59.780> downloaded<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.560> app<00:04:04.480> but<00:04:05.480> I<00:04:06.220> haven't

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
have downloaded the app but I haven't

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.890 
have downloaded the app but I haven't
really<00:04:07.400> got<00:04:07.580> to<00:04:07.760> use<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.150> too<00:04:08.330> much<00:04:10.120> but<00:04:11.120> for<00:04:11.390> so

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
really got to use it too much but for so

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.250 
really got to use it too much but for so
far<00:04:12.200> I<00:04:12.230> like<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:13.630> what<00:04:16.690> but<00:04:17.690> this<00:04:17.930> has<00:04:18.080> been<00:04:18.200> the

far I like it what but this has been the
