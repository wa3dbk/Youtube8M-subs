many<00:00:10.850> years<00:00:11.090> ago<00:00:11.240> this<00:00:11.690> was<00:00:11.900> a<00:00:11.960> typical

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.260 
many years ago this was a typical

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.650 
many years ago this was a typical
steering<00:00:12.890> wheel<00:00:13.100> but<00:00:13.340> today<00:00:13.700> it<00:00:14.210> couldn't

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
steering wheel but today it couldn't

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.320 
steering wheel but today it couldn't
even<00:00:14.990> legally<00:00:15.650> exist<00:00:15.760> on<00:00:16.760> a<00:00:16.789> car<00:00:17.090> that's

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
even legally exist on a car that's

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.899 
even legally exist on a car that's
driven<00:00:17.630> on<00:00:17.869> the<00:00:17.900> road<00:00:18.099> reason<00:00:19.099> being<00:00:19.310> it

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:19.909 
driven on the road reason being it

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:22.749 
driven on the road reason being it
doesn't<00:00:20.329> have<00:00:20.539> an<00:00:20.779> airbag<00:00:21.310> well<00:00:22.310> you<00:00:22.369> see<00:00:22.550> with

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
doesn't have an airbag well you see with

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.729 
doesn't have an airbag well you see with
the<00:00:22.849> advent<00:00:23.300> of<00:00:23.390> airbags<00:00:23.839> lots<00:00:24.289> of<00:00:24.499> things

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:24.739 
the advent of airbags lots of things

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.550 
the advent of airbags lots of things
changed<00:00:25.460> with<00:00:25.759> the<00:00:26.029> way<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:26.929> steering<00:00:27.349> wheels

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
changed with the way the steering wheels

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.220 
changed with the way the steering wheels
are<00:00:27.859> designed<00:00:28.009> and<00:00:28.699> the<00:00:29.300> wiring<00:00:29.630> that

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
are designed and the wiring that

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.299 
are designed and the wiring that
supplies<00:00:30.649> the<00:00:30.679> power<00:00:31.310> to<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:32.329> airbag<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:33.309> to

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
supplies the power to the airbag and to

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.849 
supplies the power to the airbag and to
the<00:00:34.550> buttons<00:00:34.910> on<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.300> wheel<00:00:35.379> you<00:00:36.379> see<00:00:36.410> in

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
the buttons on the wheel you see in

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.310 
the buttons on the wheel you see in
order<00:00:37.190> to<00:00:37.340> have<00:00:37.640> an<00:00:37.879> airbag<00:00:38.390> meet<00:00:38.960> federal

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
order to have an airbag meet federal

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.400 
order to have an airbag meet federal
standards<00:00:40.160> it<00:00:40.699> has<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:41.179> be<00:00:41.300> hardwired<00:00:42.019> into

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
standards it has to be hardwired into

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.860 
standards it has to be hardwired into
the<00:00:42.590> electrical<00:00:43.100> system<00:00:43.160> of<00:00:43.609> the<00:00:43.670> vehicle<00:00:44.149> so

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
the electrical system of the vehicle so

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.329 
the electrical system of the vehicle so
that<00:00:44.899> means<00:00:45.379> that<00:00:45.769> we<00:00:45.920> have<00:00:46.129> to<00:00:46.219> have

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
that means that we have to have

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.880 
that means that we have to have
something<00:00:46.670> like<00:00:46.879> we<00:00:47.149> see<00:00:47.629> right<00:00:47.660> here<00:00:48.289> this<00:00:48.739> is

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
something like we see right here this is

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.360 
something like we see right here this is
called<00:00:49.070> a<00:00:49.670> clock<00:00:50.120> spring<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:51.829> inside<00:00:52.339> of

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
called a clock spring and the inside of

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.119 
called a clock spring and the inside of
it<00:00:52.789> turns<00:00:53.210> with<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:53.899> steering<00:00:54.530> wheel<00:00:54.829> like

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
it turns with the steering wheel like

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.229 
it turns with the steering wheel like
this<00:00:55.550> it<00:00:56.239> unwinds<00:00:56.929> in<00:00:57.440> one<00:00:57.710> direction<00:00:57.949> and<00:00:58.579> it

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
this it unwinds in one direction and it

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.319 
this it unwinds in one direction and it
wings<00:00:59.510> back<00:00:59.929> up<00:01:00.230> in<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:00.739> other<00:01:00.920> direction<00:01:01.329> now

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
wings back up in the other direction now

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.040 
wings back up in the other direction now
here's<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.109> drill<00:01:03.379> if<00:01:04.159> you<00:01:04.519> have<00:01:04.820> anything<00:01:05.720> on

here's the drill if you have anything on

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.960 
here's the drill if you have anything on
your<00:01:06.380> steering<00:01:06.860> wheel<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:07.340> doesn't<00:01:07.730> work

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
your steering wheel that doesn't work

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.800 
your steering wheel that doesn't work
any<00:01:08.270> of<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.540> buttons<00:01:08.900> or<00:01:09.380> if<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:10.670> have<00:01:11.090> an

make sure the technician checks the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.220 
make sure the technician checks the
clock<00:01:16.370> spring<00:01:16.790> first<00:01:17.120> because<00:01:17.690> it's

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
clock spring first because it's

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.280 
clock spring first because it's
frequently<00:01:18.920> overlooked<00:01:19.780> all<00:01:20.780> right<00:01:20.930> but<00:01:21.170> what

as we see with this one over here it

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.090 
as we see with this one over here it
can't<00:02:11.090> be<00:02:11.390> put<00:02:11.600> back<00:02:11.900> together<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.560> can't<00:02:12.830> put
