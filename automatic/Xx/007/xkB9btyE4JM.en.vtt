00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
why haven't we seen a running bit of it

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.359 
why haven't we seen a running bit of it
because<00:00:20.840> unfortunately<00:00:21.840> my<00:00:22.710> motor<00:00:23.010> here<00:00:23.310> if

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
because unfortunately my motor here if

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.240 
because unfortunately my motor here if
you<00:00:23.460> could<00:00:23.580> see<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.990> you<00:00:24.990> see<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
you could see this you see that the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.009 
you could see this you see that the
bearing<00:00:26.550> went<00:00:26.730> bad<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.300> had<00:00:27.660> maybe

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
bearing went bad on it so I had maybe

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.400 
bearing went bad on it so I had maybe
beat<00:00:28.260> maybe<00:00:28.529> uh<00:00:29.900> geez<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.929> don't<00:00:31.170> even<00:00:31.230> know

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
beat maybe uh geez I don't even know

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.049 
beat maybe uh geez I don't even know
maybe<00:00:31.710> 150<00:00:32.369> battery<00:00:32.669> packs<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:35.059> I

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
maybe 150 battery packs on this so I

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.310 
maybe 150 battery packs on this so I
figured<00:00:36.510> soonerlater<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.050> gonna<00:00:37.200> go<00:00:37.290> I

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
figured soonerlater is gonna go I

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.569 
figured soonerlater is gonna go I
thought<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.680> was<00:00:37.770> my<00:00:37.860> main<00:00:38.070> bearing<00:00:38.430> but

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
thought it was my main bearing but

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.420 
thought it was my main bearing but
unfortunately<00:00:39.800> it's<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> main<00:00:41.100> bearing

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
unfortunately it's the main bearing

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.490 
unfortunately it's the main bearing
inside<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.450> motor<00:00:42.660> not<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> actual

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
inside the the motor not the actual

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.440 
inside the the motor not the actual
transmission<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.579> had<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.969> order<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.360> of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
transmission so I had to order one of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.110 
transmission so I had to order one of
those<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.809> know<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.050> waited<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.120> but

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
little bit of a lowly surface these just

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.800 
little bit of a lowly surface these just
didn't<00:01:41.220> keep<00:01:41.340> up<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.060> went<00:01:42.540> ahead<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.720> went

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
didn't keep up so I went ahead and went

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.170 
didn't keep up so I went ahead and went
with<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.259> low<00:01:43.979> C<00:01:44.220> 1/8<00:01:44.610> scale<00:01:44.759> whatever

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
with the the low C 1/8 scale whatever

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.429 
with the the low C 1/8 scale whatever
these<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.509> think<00:01:45.630> these<00:01:45.750> comes<00:01:45.960> stock<00:01:46.229> on

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
these are I think these comes stock on

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.870 
these are I think these comes stock on
they're<00:01:46.560> sort<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.250> these<00:01:47.430> little<00:01:47.640> mini

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
they're sort of like these little mini

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.639 
they're sort of like these little mini
pins<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.299> here<00:01:48.450> very<00:01:48.689> nice<00:01:48.930> tires<00:01:49.229> actually

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
pins on here very nice tires actually

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.399 
pins on here very nice tires actually
run<00:01:49.770> those<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.070> my<00:01:50.399> low<00:01:51.360> c8<00:01:51.720> as<00:01:51.899> well<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.350> you

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
run those on my low c8 as well so you

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.440 
run those on my low c8 as well so you
could<00:01:52.530> take<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.649> quick<00:01:52.829> look<00:01:53.009> over<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.369> run<00:01:54.360> it

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
could take a quick look over here run it

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.030 
could take a quick look over here run it
on<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.960> they<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.470> great<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.770> think<00:01:55.890> I

24 bucks shipped brand new it I mean you
can't<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.079> can't<00:02:01.320> heat<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.680> for<00:02:01.920> 25<00:02:02.219> bucks<00:02:02.399> so

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
can't you can't heat it for 25 bucks so

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.160 
can't you can't heat it for 25 bucks so
again<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.509> use<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.439> think<00:02:04.680> they<00:02:04.770> were<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
again I use the I think they were the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.410 
again I use the I think they were the
aka<00:02:07.170> adaptors<00:02:08.129> here<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.459> they<00:02:08.580> were<00:02:08.849> like<00:02:08.970> 14

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
aka adaptors here so they were like 14

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.300 
aka adaptors here so they were like 14
bucks<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> four<00:02:10.170> hour<00:02:10.440> 18<00:02:10.800> bucks<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
bucks for the four hour 18 bucks for the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.949 
bucks for the four hour 18 bucks for the
set<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.550> four<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:12.450> let<00:02:12.569> me<00:02:12.660> just<00:02:12.690> take<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> quick

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
now also went ahead and got the energy

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.619 
now also went ahead and got the energy
heatsink<00:02:22.530> with<00:02:22.709> fan<00:02:22.950> built-in<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.879> know<00:02:23.970> I've

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
had some problems with this energy fan

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.640 
had some problems with this energy fan
let<00:02:27.599> me<00:02:27.690> know<00:02:27.810> if<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.080> guys<00:02:28.170> can<00:02:28.379> leave<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.590> in
