Hi, Tim Ardnt here, Bowflex Personal
Trainer and we're here to show you how

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.740
to do a squat on the Bowflex Xtreme 2 SE.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.010
First thing we got to do is get the
machine setup. And you can see we've

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.430
gotten rid of the seat, and we've
actually attached the squat bar and lead to

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.550
this pulley. One thing I want to point
out is that this pulley you're going to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.300
want it as far forward as you can get it. As you can see, it will move back and lock into

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.650
different positions.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.160
You're going to want it here. Okay. The
other thing is you're going to want to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.619
get this strap set to a proper length for
you.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.950
We've already got that set up. And then
you can have to pick your resistance.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.129
We've already got the resistance set at 
50 pounds on each side, so it's a hundred

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.090
pounds total.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.020
Neil, why don't you come over here. So you'll see that Neil, we have this set up to a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.059
proper length for him, so he can actually get underneath the bar safely and effectively.

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.010
Okay, so from here the first movement we're going to do, is we're actually going

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.100
to line ourselves, well we're going to line up first so that you can see Neil's feet are

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.059
straight ahead.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.780
He's actually going to point these out just a little bit. Okay.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.420
What that's going to do is it's going to
line up all your joints together and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.590
save you from getting injured.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.970
So go ahead and do a couple reps here.
First thing, butt is going to move back.

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.460
You want to keep your chest nice and
tall. Nice and tight here through the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.259
core. And Neil's only going down as far
as he can comfortably control. If you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.700
go down and have a hard time getting

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.400
out of the position too low. Okay. One cool thing about the Bowflex here is that as

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.960
you move down the machine's actually gonna let off on the resistance and get stronger

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.590
as you come up, which is going to match
your body's natural resistance curve.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.100
Another thing we want to watch out for ... 
(if we come to the front)...

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.380
...is the knee buckling.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.950
Okay, so going ahead and show them what that might look like.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.480
Okay this is going to be bad on your knees.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.320
So what you want to do (go ahead and come up) when I said/told Neil originally too point his

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.369
toes out, that's going to solve that
problem in most cases. And as he comes

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.210
down,

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.910
we want this tracking right over the toe.
Okay, that's going to keep him safe.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.340
The other thing (for some people) it helps
to push from the outside portion of your

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.750
foot if you need to do that.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.980
Everything else is the same here. Down, nice comfortable level.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.000
That's it; that's how you do a proper
squat on the Bowflex Xtreme 2 SE.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.800
Another variation to do the squat
instead of using the bar would be to use the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.740
handles. And Neil's going to show you how to do that right now.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.520
All the same rules apply:

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.820
chest is up, back straight, butt moved back first. And that's how you do the squat with the handles.
