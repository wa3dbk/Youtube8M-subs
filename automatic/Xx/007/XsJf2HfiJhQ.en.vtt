00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 good people a lot of people are also asking 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.270
 to talk like Rafael 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.099
 I do not have the condition to pay 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.010
 private faculty with what I do and 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.410
 100 grants that the government does for people 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.680
 What is there that we can 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.960
 to study right? 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.720
 I do not have much information on this. 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.460
 It 's one I already passed in the vestibular some 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.990
 time then there is not at that time I 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.869
 do vestibular and did not know any 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.050
 thing I know there is such 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.489
 student funding or what 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.489
 Can you do these can be? 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.809
 looking for the website of the Ministry of 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.570
 education 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.850
 You go there on google fs may be 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.530
 looking for a bank branch to pick up 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.829
 information 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.140
 completely true with the bank until the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.289
 So far as I know how 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.850
 it finances part or all of all 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.469
 your tuition fees during the course 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.530
 whole then you have time to 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.399
 To pay this, it seems to me that nowadays 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.260
 if you work at psf south 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.280
 You'll end up having this, that's the way it is. 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.340
 these monthly payments afterwards so the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.350
 The suggestion I make is not to get stuck. 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.720
 there is good internet information up to some 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.220
 link bank on site of the year enter on site 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.920
 the ministry of education 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.930
 call Brasilia is not try to get 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.479
 the concrete information until the other 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.150
 I also hope that whenever you do 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.810
 He is a lottery is not something like that. 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.400
 Anyone who wants to know the truth will have it. 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.189
 many people so that through 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.680
 by means of the 111th Secretary of 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.979
 a senator got faithful 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.740
 now also places on the tip of the pencil 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.159
 neither will I go, it is better to enter 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.009
 college earlier to do the fies 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.619
 then pay these 200 and 300 thousand reais 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.270
 ahead or is it better to make one more 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.369
 time to study university 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.479
 that I'm going to pay nothing and I'll train 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.950
 Quiet without owing anything to anyone 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.560
 This thought was with me when I 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.829
 I need to encourage my father not to 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.899
 makes us private because if we 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.610
 We'll get it later. 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.630
 That's when I thought about it like that, but I got the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.450
 I'm going to graduate 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.340
 max is already peaceful quiet'm 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.450
 forming in tranquil medicine that I 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.920
 I will make my life 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.810
 suddenly have to train if I'm already 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.370
 the one that the great one already has 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.950
 for example that perhaps work 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.250
 pay those those monthly fees 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.660
 that are there for you to pay so I 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.720
 My time, I said no, I do not want 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.950
 This for me I'm going to do it right and 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.620
 make federal do without paying even ne 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.390
 there is also the enem that you climb 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.060

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.100

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.380
 they have scholarships now they are obliged to 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.730
 give some scholarships to students who come from 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.420
 prouni 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.130

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.120

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.770
 Give you this bag, I think I know.

 if not paid after that that bag 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.180
 integral and will not pay it ever again 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.280
 I have a friend of mine who is in college. 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.040
 shark santa catarina 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.920
 He has this bag won by prouni. 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.080
 rafael but you are discriminated against in 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.930
 college because I like her everyone 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.890
 It has money has no day that is so right 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.950
 it's not so it 's in college can you can 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.380
 being may even be that there are people 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.450
 who will only have this kind of attitude but 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.520
 are very few very very very 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.400
 few are bigger people will do 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.990
 A cool gang of chocolate candy spoons you know. 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.990
 help people will help you up 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:44.200
 financially speaking 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.370
 so I have not seen it until this day 11 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.530
 one person commented to me 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.180
 rafael was college medicine only has 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.670
 rich people because I'm afraid of 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.750
 go in there and not have good clothes and be 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.090
 discriminated 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.550
 There is no such thing in medical school. 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.410
 existing millionaire middle class people 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.740
 high class middle class beats all 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.410
 world right not only have we would do 95 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.300
 it's not the most good condition but 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.310
 so there are a lot of people there that she is not 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.380
 right there being public 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.760
 so there is not no going to have it not 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.040
 will suffer from it 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.080
 and if you come to suffer from it is a 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.420
 such a small thing the whole actor 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.280
 will not defend it will happen 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.020
 and another this is a very thought 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.310
 It's small for you too, who? 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.760
 You'll have to face everything in your 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.770
 life 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.450
 it's no use staying there it all turned into a sea 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.610
 roses will not be the important thing 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.170
 focus on the future 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.660
 no one will come to you with a 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:41.410
 You can, yes, but you can not. 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.330
 so going back will choose scholarship 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.670
 are quota holders 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:50.680
 who is quota enjoys his quota 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:53.230
 take advantage of your quota if you quote is sure if 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.750
 it's not right and wrong I do not know I do not 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.280

 public has proved that it is a 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.860
 college if you have one more color 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.510
 and the college provides this 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.090
 opportunity and enjoy 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.550
 Take the blame, it's not your fault 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.780
 That's why everyone thinks it's you. 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.180
 you have to take the opportunity that 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.420
 I'm painting there myself, I'm a friend. 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.220
