out<00:03:57.750> your<00:03:57.930> tongue<00:03:58.170> with<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.550> it's<00:03:59.550> rated<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:00.480> it

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
out your tongue with it it's rated so it

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.259 
out your tongue with it it's rated so it
last<00:04:00.810> longer<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.680> hurts<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.340> lot<00:04:02.400> more<00:04:03.030> it's

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
last longer and it hurts a lot more it's

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.539 
last longer and it hurts a lot more it's
heated<00:04:04.140> because<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.860> don't<00:04:05.250> want<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.459> be

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
come to your house what the worst type

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.960 
come to your house what the worst type
of<00:04:30.090> death<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.690> have<00:04:30.840> ever<00:04:31.110> heard<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:31.650> if<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:32.640> eat

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
of death I have ever heard of if you eat

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.050 
of death I have ever heard of if you eat
this<00:04:33.690> element<00:04:34.170> called<00:04:34.320> radium<00:04:34.890> your<00:04:35.790> body

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
this element called radium your body

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.950 
this element called radium your body
thinks<00:04:36.990> it's<00:04:37.320> calcium<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:39.300> absorbs<00:04:39.810> it

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
thinks it's calcium and it absorbs it

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.130 
thinks it's calcium and it absorbs it
into<00:04:40.230> your<00:04:40.380> spinal<00:04:40.800> structure<00:04:41.220> but<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:42.210> notice

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
into your spinal structure but I notice

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.830 
into your spinal structure but I notice
your<00:04:43.290> body<00:04:43.410> it's<00:04:43.800> radioactive<00:04:44.580> so<00:04:45.420> your<00:04:45.630> bones

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
your body it's radioactive so your bones

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.870 
your body it's radioactive so your bones
become<00:04:46.080> radioactive<00:04:46.560> it's<00:04:47.370> basically<00:04:47.730> like

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
become radioactive it's basically like

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.440 
become radioactive it's basically like
taking<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.660> knife<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:48.930> let's<00:04:49.830> heat<00:04:50.130> it<00:04:50.160> up

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
taking a knife and let's heat it up

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.860 
taking a knife and let's heat it up
stabbing<00:04:51.450> it<00:04:51.570> to<00:04:51.780> your<00:04:51.870> flesh<00:04:52.140> and<00:04:52.770> boiling<00:04:53.430> it

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
stabbing it to your flesh and boiling it

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.110 
stabbing it to your flesh and boiling it
inside<00:04:54.870> out<00:04:55.050> your<00:04:55.680> brain<00:04:55.980> will<00:04:56.580> be<00:04:56.610> inside

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
inside out your brain will be inside

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.260 
inside out your brain will be inside
this<00:04:57.240> little<00:04:57.510> bony<00:04:58.350> jar<00:04:59.010> which<00:04:59.580> is<00:04:59.730> your<00:04:59.910> skull

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
this little bony jar which is your skull

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.860 
this little bony jar which is your skull
that<00:05:00.960> is<00:05:01.110> now<00:05:01.290> radioactive<00:05:02.900> slowly<00:05:03.900> just

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
that is now radioactive slowly just

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.840 
that is now radioactive slowly just
melting<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:07.110> eating<00:05:07.650> away<00:05:07.830> because<00:05:08.490> alpha

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
melting and eating away because alpha

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.170 
melting and eating away because alpha
and<00:05:09.330> beta<00:05:09.480> particles<00:05:10.550> they<00:05:11.550> get<00:05:11.760> released

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
and beta particles they get released

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.420 
and beta particles they get released
from<00:05:12.390> the<00:05:12.690> radium<00:05:13.140> atom<00:05:13.940> well<00:05:14.940> hits<00:05:15.480> your<00:05:15.780> DNA

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
from the radium atom well hits your DNA

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.740 
from the radium atom well hits your DNA
least<00:05:17.430> you<00:05:17.550> can<00:05:17.700> do<00:05:17.820> is<00:05:17.850> die<00:05:18.270> of<00:05:18.450> radiation

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
least you can do is die of radiation

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.410 
least you can do is die of radiation
poisoning<00:05:19.110> but<00:05:19.650> since<00:05:20.190> they<00:05:20.340> got<00:05:20.490> iodine<00:05:21.120> and

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
poisoning but since they got iodine and

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.600 
poisoning but since they got iodine and
stuff<00:05:21.720> like<00:05:21.870> that<00:05:22.140> that<00:05:22.170> can<00:05:22.500> basically<00:05:23.280> stop

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
stuff like that that can basically stop

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.520 
stuff like that that can basically stop
it<00:05:23.880> at<00:05:24.420> least<00:05:24.600> you're<00:05:24.780> gonna<00:05:24.900> die<00:05:25.170> of<00:05:25.350> is

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
it at least you're gonna die of is

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.980
