00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:04.649
 welcome to the eighth video tutorial of 13 of that same month 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.159
 this time I will show you how 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:09.579
 set up 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:12.009
 level 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:13.349
 and it's not for 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.289
 to operate 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:16.689
 rendered 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:17.550
 with the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.659
 with very good graphics 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.039
 so if you do not have the viceroy 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.599
 better download it 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.599
 within this network decided to guardianship 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.189
 despite the proclamations she 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.770
 voice 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.770
 soil 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.750
 and later 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.880
 a few boxes 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.860
 what will they be 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.860
 go to your office 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.260
 this this title is the one that uses espil my nation 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.990
 from outdoors because there is also the elimination and shooting that is a bit 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.270
 different from the 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.040
 at sunset 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.040
 good to face 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.100
 let's first add 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.820
 waxed subject 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.810
 here then 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.470
 we select 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.470
 our we know how to choose 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.970
 one that says 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.550
 adjectives 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.930
 person does not give 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.930
 so they give us the visa 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.370
 p 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.250
 born on August 2 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.250
 we go as legislator where it says 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.360
 select it we are increasing 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.910
 what is the range 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.500
 notice the field 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.710
 illuminated 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.950
 therefore it is payroll 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.950
 participate all all the parties let's see 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.200
 It is done 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.200
 these are the buildings 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.780
 and those the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.070
 the field of numancy we are going to move modified the mind 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.899
 There are those who say shadows 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.079
 we put you active 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.989
 the opposition is 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.899
 dv 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:18.589
 now 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:21.589
 fuji the voice pointed 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.089
 and he said we were going 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.089
 They are common 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.309
 villazón 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:36.229
 it is already a whole town 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.229
 now we think of three games about gender 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.750
 good 2007 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.729
 well in these same tab 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.789
 let's finish with 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.269
 here one and it will be assigned 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.449
 flannery senator 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.739
 sacyr the first one we are already inspired to choose 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.989
 our render engine I am going to choose 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.429
 na 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.379
 well I have elected the viceroy 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.789
 but for those who do not have it directed please 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:09.189
 they usually have this 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.189
 so we are going to be definitive higinio vélez 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.289
 we are not facing a regime 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:22.169
 and all the steps and how this one has been dean only that says 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.399
 as sea 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:27.139
 here is very important 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.139
 was what he tells bbc that is multiplication in health 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:32.499
 for outdoor 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.409
 when you get an investment for interior 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.170
 he used this 15 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.819
 exponential 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.819
 but now they are now sc2 by the hosts until 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.159
 the former set of Spain 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.899
 let's go to the indirect flood 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:52.009
 This is very important because it is what really brings our 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:53.379
 reneses 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.849
 so many years 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.409
 it activates it a lot 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:59.419
 and then here is fine 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:00.359
 and here 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.359
 publish the 15 in the Cáceres 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.359
 also the parameters that you have to teach them 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.619
 well as this one is fine for a demanding render but pat walk a lot no 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.479
 it matters if your machine is powerful 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.389
 It will take a long time to learn 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.419
 so there are for tests 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.419
 here I use the 15 in low 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.879
 the mayor he said with her his missions 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.090
 Samil's mom 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.599
 I think I feel 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:31.620
 For tests 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.029
 already when 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:37.059
 the render already when the image is fine and I will not return with good quality 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.550
 I'll come back with the chemistry 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.330
 and in the previous 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.120
 What is it 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.289
 yes yes yes yes is internalized 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.199
 I put it to my family 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.529
 because if it takes a long time 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:53.580
 and this happens before 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.150
 20 up and up 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.439
 configured for a good rhythm 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:00.370
 Now you have to apply material 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.710
 despite a key 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.800
 to apply material supplies object 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.909
 first I will select the three boxes that are the buildings 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.969
 I'm going to put the same color 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.069
 now once standard 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.069
 the opi and then he said that obama had access to this 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.449
 and I'm going to put 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.669
 a colour 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:25.900
 and it is already 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.499
 the pharmacy here to allocate the material to the elections 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:32.020
 that is, the three boxes 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.430
 I want to give this building another 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.830
 material 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.449
 you will not kill 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.589
 leandro botti tepic 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:42.080
 now at this level 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.569
 I want it to be red 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.259
 but he did not aim 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:49.360
 it is not a detail 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.800
 and it is that it is for reflection as if it were a mirror 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.169
 we have 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.289
 they are all in white handling 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.389
 if we put black nova reflects nothing if we put the glass reflected with everything 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:01.909
 your team intensity 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:03.339
 the 'pole' lewis 

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:06.339
 of sentence so that it reflects very few 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:10.749
 refractions to make it transparent I will choose 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.029
 this other 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:17.189
 next to this one enis io to put it 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:20.400
 with reinforcements to give you an example of how to continue 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.400
 who put that stuff 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.669
 we put 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.969
 what will be with that intensity 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:30.119
 here it is important to apply laws 

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:32.219
 that says 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:36.509
 that affects the area because if we do not select it the shadow will do 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:39.360
 as if it were not transparent and yes yes we selected it 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.129
 will have a shadow 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:44.159
 jenkins function to its transparency be very low 

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:48.619
 now we're just going to give it a color 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:52.029
 blue 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:55.340
 you can give it the color you have only August for tests for 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.499
 several people who do not know how to use it 

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:59.099
 oakdale 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:02.099
 the images run the field and with this reservation 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.699
 as an example things like 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:09.039
 we press them on gender 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:10.060
 so that it begins to yield
