00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
to turn that sucker up up to high heat I

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.830 
to turn that sucker up up to high heat I
mean<00:04:28.900> you<00:04:29.110> want<00:04:29.380> this<00:04:29.910> boiling<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.120> like

mean you want this boiling and like
roaring<00:04:32.590> for<00:04:32.950> about<00:04:33.510> maybe<00:04:34.510> like<00:04:34.750> a<00:04:34.780> minute

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
roaring for about maybe like a minute

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.940 
roaring for about maybe like a minute
laughs<00:04:35.670> until<00:04:36.570> you<00:04:36.690> get<00:04:36.870> everything<00:04:37.200> mixed<00:04:37.800> in

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
laughs until you get everything mixed in

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.340 
laughs until you get everything mixed in
um<00:04:38.750> so<00:04:39.750> it's<00:04:39.960> just<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.560> really<00:04:41.510> dark<00:04:42.510> chocolate

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
um so it's just a really dark chocolate

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.710 
um so it's just a really dark chocolate
looking<00:04:43.830> mixture<00:04:44.280> just<00:04:44.520> like<00:04:44.670> this<00:04:44.940> once<00:04:45.600> you

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
looking mixture just like this once you

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.720 
looking mixture just like this once you
get<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:45.930> like<00:04:46.080> this<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.530> want<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:46.950> to<00:04:47.340> really

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
get it like this you want it to really

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.110 
get it like this you want it to really
boil<00:04:48.390> because<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:49.170> means<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.890> sugar<00:04:50.820> is

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
boil because that means the sugar is

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.020 
boil because that means the sugar is
caramelizing<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.430> that's<00:04:53.430> just<00:04:53.820> exactly

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
caramelizing and that's just exactly

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.750 
caramelizing and that's just exactly
what<00:04:54.720> you<00:04:54.960> want<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:55.680> then<00:04:56.400> you're<00:04:56.580> going<00:04:56.670> to

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
what you want and then you're going to

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.690 
what you want and then you're going to
turn<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.210> heat<00:04:57.390> completely<00:04:57.930> off<00:04:58.110> I<00:04:58.410> cut<00:04:59.340> my

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
turn the heat completely off I cut my

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.600 
turn the heat completely off I cut my
stick<00:05:00.330> of<00:05:00.450> butter<00:05:00.600> into<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.500> know<00:05:01.650> like<00:05:02.190> four

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
stick of butter into you know like four

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.060 
stick of butter into you know like four
cubes<00:05:03.060> just<00:05:03.630> to<00:05:03.810> make<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.140> melt<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.620> little<00:05:04.800> bit

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
cubes just to make it melt a little bit

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.540 
cubes just to make it melt a little bit
easier<00:05:05.580> and<00:05:06.260> since<00:05:07.260> the<00:05:07.410> heat<00:05:07.680> is<00:05:07.890> off<00:05:08.160> it's

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
easier and since the heat is off it's

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.280 
easier and since the heat is off it's
going<00:05:08.790> to<00:05:08.910> take<00:05:09.210> you<00:05:09.540> know<00:05:09.660> just<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:10.020> little<00:05:10.140> bit

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
going to take you know just a little bit

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.920 
going to take you know just a little bit
longer<00:05:10.680> but<00:05:11.310> in<00:05:11.520> about<00:05:11.640> a<00:05:11.820> minute<00:05:12.090> and<00:05:12.570> a<00:05:12.660> half

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
longer but in about a minute and a half

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.280 
longer but in about a minute and a half
your<00:05:13.560> butters<00:05:14.010> and<00:05:14.250> be<00:05:14.430> completely<00:05:14.970> melted<00:05:15.660> so

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
your butters and be completely melted so

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.890 
your butters and be completely melted so
just<00:05:16.650> you<00:05:17.010> know<00:05:17.040> keep<00:05:17.730> on<00:05:17.910> keeping<00:05:18.450> on<00:05:18.600> and

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
just you know keep on keeping on and

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.080 
just you know keep on keeping on and
then<00:05:19.590> it's<00:05:19.830> going<00:05:20.130> to<00:05:20.250> look<00:05:20.400> like<00:05:20.460> this<00:05:20.880> it's

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
then it's going to look like this it's

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.050 
then it's going to look like this it's
going<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.360> be<00:05:21.510> a<00:05:21.540> really<00:05:21.990> nice<00:05:22.640> kind<00:05:23.640> of<00:05:23.820> thin

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
going to be a really nice kind of thin

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.440 
going to be a really nice kind of thin
but<00:05:24.090> not<00:05:24.390> the<00:05:25.020> consistency<00:05:25.760> so<00:05:26.760> once<00:05:26.970> we<00:05:27.210> have

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
but not the consistency so once we have

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.330 
but not the consistency so once we have
this<00:05:27.750> all<00:05:27.960> this<00:05:28.230> is<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:28.530> best<00:05:28.740> part
