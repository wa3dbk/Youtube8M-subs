it fits the blade character quite well
the<00:02:01.650> knife<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.570> 50/50<00:02:04.380> grind<00:02:04.409> which<00:02:04.830> is<00:02:04.979> a

the knife is a 50/50 grind which is a

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.389 
the knife is a 50/50 grind which is a
bit<00:02:05.220> unusual<00:02:05.430> for<00:02:06.830> Davis<00:02:07.830> so<00:02:08.039> there's<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:08.340> too

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
bit unusual for Davis so there's not too

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.850 
bit unusual for Davis so there's not too
many<00:02:08.700> double<00:02:09.390> bevel<00:02:09.569> Davis<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.709> an

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
many double bevel Davis so this is an

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.440 
many double bevel Davis so this is an
ambidextrous<00:02:11.519> day<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:11.909> you<00:02:11.999> can<00:02:12.180> see<00:02:12.329> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
ambidextrous day but you can see the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.289 
ambidextrous day but you can see the
groin<00:02:12.719> right<00:02:12.930> there<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:14.189> it's<00:02:14.370> not<00:02:14.579> a<00:02:14.879> single

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
groin right there so it's not a single

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.209 
groin right there so it's not a single
bevel<00:02:15.599> like<00:02:15.749> many<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.170> them<00:02:16.290> are<00:02:16.530> most<00:02:16.889> of<00:02:17.099> them

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219
