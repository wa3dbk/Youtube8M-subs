00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.390
 very businesslike actually 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.810
 about the fact that there is at Hansa something similar 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.240
 on gun depends monstrously much and the same 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.240
 the knife is very light let me weigh it 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.549
 weighs all this miracle 69 grams 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:59.549
 very light knife is actually very 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:04.619
 well processed here so karbonchik 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:07.409

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.489
 neatly assembled knife great i'm cool 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.470
 just a deep clip just morning for 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.200
 that there is a dark hole there 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.579
 you can find fault well and let's see 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.959
 on the wedge 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:23.450
 now the camera he lives on his cheek 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.459
 here is handsome 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:32.970
 here is such a wonderful knife give 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:35.489
 rub lemon a little bit 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.790
 soldering iron such 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.380
 really awning Lensky so here's a knife 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.150
 looks from all sides 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:49.319
 let's look at this quality 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.480
 sateen chick is such a very beautiful knife 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.200
 we go thin enough such 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.769
 neat edge is very our symmetrical 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.180
 there are such 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:03.030
 under the finger stops but in general I tell you 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.940
 I will say that the knife produces only the most 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.760
 pleasant impressions despite the fact that he even 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.940
 also cuts out of the box we have here 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:17.569
 him even lilac than here let's 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.569
 so here you see done 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:27.520
 Syria Chick Party 57 Jack 334 ordered 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.530
 one person two such knives I do n't know 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.420
 why should he have two but both knives are made 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.790
 just great men actually a knife 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.810
 like and for a long time wanted well such 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.970
 in hands to twist 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.160
 Especially since the last time is not very 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.140
 began to like machines and I imagine 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.319
 I bought this wonderful but chic 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.810
 kershaw now he too for a while 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.750
 ousted blue 1 pocket 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.180
 until that moment, I think until 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.780
 completed project with Grandin Glauler and in 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.780
 there is something here but a knife very much the same 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.830
 worthy very well made of their own 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.480
 worth money here but then the length of the blade to them 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.830
 I will say that here remembers three and a half 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.959
 inches to 8 8 5 centimeters that knife 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.420
 quite legal it can be worn with 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.359
 again I repeat that it is very high 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.709
 workmanship 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:21.669
 dagger is very symmetrical such 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.860
 stylet probably all the same such as 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.830
 but very one-and-a-half bayonet for. this 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.070
 it is called clear that the reverse part on 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.340
 stupid not sharpened and that's probably on it 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.360
 and all tomorrow this knife is sent to 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:41.620
 its owner has a very nice spring 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.750
 here everything lies in our center is clear 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.729
 you need to rehearse him a little 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.760
 in order to expose the backlash 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.250
 backlash is quite small, I think 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.220
 that when I transfer this knife to my host 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.080
 just adjust as much as he likes 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.419
 but actually I really like how 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.360
 it folds spring i practically 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.789
 here I don't really feel if in 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.470
 kirsch and i'm there with the effort of putting in here 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:08.380
 all very neatly 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.250
 sure throw it all thanks everyone 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.250
 until
