that<00:05:37.750> actually<00:05:37.870> works<00:05:38.350> but<00:05:38.680> that's<00:05:39.040> that

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
that actually works but that's that

seems to be the general idea and the

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.070 
seems to be the general idea and the
other<00:05:41.560> the<00:05:41.860> other<00:05:41.980> final<00:05:42.610> point<00:05:42.820> is<00:05:43.080> Android

other the other final point is Android
now<00:05:44.560> they<00:05:44.919> already<00:05:45.250> make<00:05:45.550> a<00:05:45.960> operating<00:05:46.960> system

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
now they already make a operating system

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.170 
now they already make a operating system
that<00:05:47.380> runs<00:05:47.560> on<00:05:47.919> a<00:05:48.220> variety<00:05:48.669> of<00:05:48.700> touchscreen
