service you would like because there's

many different variations and highlights

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.900 
many different variations and highlights
for<00:00:22.260> example<00:00:22.740> if<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.949> look<00:00:23.130> at<00:00:23.310> Sienna<00:00:23.670> Miller

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
for example if you look at Sienna Miller

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.700 
for example if you look at Sienna Miller
her<00:00:24.269> highlights<00:00:24.720> will<00:00:25.140> be<00:00:25.170> completely

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
highlights because of the depth of the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.089

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
fourth tip would be to sleep with

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.219

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
conditioner in the head and the reason

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.560 
conditioner in the head and the reason
for<00:01:45.260> that<00:01:45.440> is<00:01:45.710> because<00:01:46.270> lungs<00:01:47.270> are<00:01:47.540> very

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
difficult to get shine on and if you

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.850 
difficult to get shine on and if you
sleep<00:01:50.270> with<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.450> conditioner<00:01:51.050> overnight<00:01:51.500> when
