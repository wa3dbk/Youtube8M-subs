down to the sea water we will be using

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.440 
down to the sea water we will be using
assistance<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.920> tag<00:01:28.100> boats<00:01:28.340> as<00:01:28.490> well<00:01:28.700> in

assistance the tag boats as well in

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.149 
assistance the tag boats as well in
addition<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:29.990> our<00:01:30.020> propulsion<00:01:30.439> system<00:01:30.950> it's

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
addition to our propulsion system it's

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.319 
addition to our propulsion system it's
quite<00:01:32.060> tight<00:01:32.409> very<00:01:33.409> tiny<00:01:33.710> river<00:01:34.009> with<00:01:34.329> very

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
curved as well so we'll be turning all

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.060 
curved as well so we'll be turning all
the<00:01:37.549> time<00:01:38.110> it's<00:01:39.110> gonna<00:01:39.289> take<00:01:39.380> approximately

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
the time it's gonna take approximately

actually dismantled this is the very old
railroad<00:01:50.899> bridge<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.700> we'll<00:01:52.700> have<00:01:52.939> a

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.210 

and<00:01:59.490> he's<00:01:59.580> gonna<00:01:59.760> take<00:02:00.030> next<00:02:00.440> to<00:02:01.440> ours<00:02:01.680> before

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
and he's gonna take next to ours before

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.910 
and he's gonna take next to ours before
we<00:02:02.550> start<00:02:02.790> approaching<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.450> lair<00:02:03.630> Bridge

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
we start approaching the lair Bridge

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.190 
we start approaching the lair Bridge
