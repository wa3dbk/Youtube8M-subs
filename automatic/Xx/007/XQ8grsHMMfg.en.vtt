time I would rehearse something it gave

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.619 
time I would rehearse something it gave
me<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.319> different<00:03:32.349> feeling<00:03:33.159> than<00:03:33.489> any<00:03:34.180> other

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
me a different feeling than any other

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.360 
me a different feeling than any other
kind<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:34.989> dance<00:03:35.200> that<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.409> had<00:03:35.620> been<00:03:35.769> doing<00:03:36.159> and

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
kind of dance that I had been doing and

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.559 
kind of dance that I had been doing and
as<00:03:36.909> much<00:03:37.090> as<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.750> felt<00:03:38.560> connected<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.939> the

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
as much as I I felt connected to the

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.860 
as much as I I felt connected to the
Balanchine<00:03:40.959> dances<00:03:41.650> there<00:03:42.400> was<00:03:42.870> something

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
Balanchine dances there was something

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.670 
Balanchine dances there was something
that<00:03:43.900> was<00:03:44.200> similarly<00:03:45.180> natural<00:03:46.180> about<00:03:46.680> about

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
that was similarly natural about about

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.000 
that was similarly natural about about
the<00:03:47.859> movement<00:03:48.400> for<00:03:48.700> my<00:03:49.540> body<00:03:49.780> that<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.650> also

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
the movement for my body that I also

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.250 
the movement for my body that I also
found<00:03:51.609> in<00:03:52.030> mr.<00:03:52.359> Taylor's<00:03:52.389> work<00:03:53.019> there<00:03:53.199> was

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
found in mr. Taylor's work there was

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.319 
found in mr. Taylor's work there was
something<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:53.560> made<00:03:53.829> sense<00:03:53.889> to<00:03:54.370> me<00:03:54.549> in<00:03:54.849> the

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
something that made sense to me in the

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.869 
something that made sense to me in the
same<00:03:55.569> way<00:03:55.840> and<00:03:56.139> they<00:03:56.319> were<00:03:56.459> possibly<00:03:57.459> two<00:03:57.760> of

same way and they were possibly two of
the<00:03:57.970> most<00:03:58.500> human<00:03:59.500> ways<00:04:00.099> of<00:04:00.340> choreographing

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
somewhere and taking where you go with

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.429 
somewhere and taking where you go with
that<00:06:17.650> whether<00:06:18.580> it<00:06:18.759> be<00:06:18.879> by<00:06:19.089> accident<00:06:19.839> which<00:06:20.259> is

00:06:20.429 --> 00:06:20.439 
that whether it be by accident which is

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:23.159 
that whether it be by accident which is
quite<00:06:20.649> often<00:06:20.860> or<00:06:21.159> on<00:06:22.089> purpose<00:06:22.330> and<00:06:22.719> then<00:06:22.810> he'll

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
quite often or on purpose and then he'll

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:24.959 
quite often or on purpose and then he'll
take<00:06:23.349> that<00:06:23.409> the<00:06:23.830> next<00:06:24.099> step<00:06:24.250> further<00:06:24.490> and<00:06:24.639> or

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:24.969 
take that the next step further and or

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:26.399 
take that the next step further and or
maybe<00:06:25.180> in<00:06:25.330> a<00:06:25.389> different<00:06:25.509> direction<00:06:25.779> than<00:06:26.080> he

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:26.409 
maybe in a different direction than he

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:29.219 
maybe in a different direction than he
intended<00:06:26.669> and<00:06:27.669> really<00:06:28.060> enjoy<00:06:28.360> it<00:06:28.539> and<00:06:28.750> I<00:06:28.839> think

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:29.229 
intended and really enjoy it and I think

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.980 
intended and really enjoy it and I think
he<00:06:29.319> really<00:06:29.529> likes<00:06:29.889> working<00:06:30.639> that<00:06:31.300> way<00:06:31.509> and<00:06:31.750> I

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
he really likes working that way and I

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.959 
he really likes working that way and I
think<00:06:32.289> that's<00:06:32.649> why<00:06:32.770> he<00:06:32.979> hires<00:06:33.129> people<00:06:33.399> that<00:06:33.729> he

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:33.969 
think that's why he hires people that he

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:36.329 
think that's why he hires people that he
can<00:06:34.120> see<00:06:34.300> have<00:06:34.419> a<00:06:34.449> strong<00:06:34.810> personality<00:06:35.620> at

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:36.339 
can see have a strong personality at

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:37.559 
can see have a strong personality at
auditions<00:06:36.669> and<00:06:37.029> that<00:06:37.120> sort<00:06:37.330> of<00:06:37.360> thing<00:06:37.419> that

auditions and that sort of thing that

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:39.990 
auditions and that sort of thing that
someone<00:06:38.169> who's<00:06:38.379> not<00:06:38.529> just<00:06:38.770> gonna<00:06:38.860> listen<00:06:39.729> and

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
someone who's not just gonna listen and

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.869
