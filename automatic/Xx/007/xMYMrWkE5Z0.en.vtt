we<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:30.060> finished<00:00:30.210> up<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:37.230> little<00:00:37.440> riff

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
we just finished up the the little riff

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:49.939 
we just finished up the the little riff
up<00:00:38.370> here

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.430 

back<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.539> you're<00:00:52.109> gonna<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
back to here and you're gonna do the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.810 
back to here and you're gonna do the
main<00:00:52.589> riff<00:00:52.769> a<00:00:52.890> couple<00:00:53.160> times<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.579> think<00:00:53.730> you're

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
main riff a couple times I think you're

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:04.439 
main riff a couple times I think you're
going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.089> twice

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.730 

and<00:01:04.900> we're<00:01:05.019> going<00:01:05.170> to<00:01:05.229> go<00:01:05.320> into<00:01:05.500> another

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
and we're going to go into another

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.850 
and we're going to go into another
transition<00:01:06.369> here<00:01:06.580> before<00:01:07.119> the<00:01:07.240> lead<00:01:07.420> okay<00:01:07.990> and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
transition here before the lead okay and

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
transition here before the lead okay and
this<00:01:09.009> transition<00:01:09.430> I'm<00:01:09.580> going<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.759> show<00:01:09.850> you

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
this transition I'm going to show you

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.179 
this transition I'm going to show you
two<00:01:10.119> ways<00:01:10.150> to<00:01:10.509> do<00:01:10.630> this<00:01:10.780> I'm<00:01:11.680> going<00:01:11.979> to<00:01:12.040> show

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
two ways to do this I'm going to show

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.280 
two ways to do this I'm going to show
you<00:01:12.220> a<00:01:12.369> derivative<00:01:12.670> of<00:01:13.030> what<00:01:13.930> I<00:01:13.960> did<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.259> first

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
you a derivative of what I did the first

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.800 
you a derivative of what I did the first
time<00:01:14.590> earlier<00:01:14.979> in<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.700> song<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:16.180> then<00:01:16.720> I'm

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
time earlier in the song and then I'm

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.499 
time earlier in the song and then I'm
going<00:01:16.930> to<00:01:16.960> show<00:01:17.140> you<00:01:17.170> a<00:01:17.619> second<00:01:18.070> way<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.159> do<00:01:18.340> it

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
going to show you a second way to do it

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.840 
going to show you a second way to do it
the<00:01:19.509> first<00:01:19.720> way<00:01:19.990> let<00:01:20.950> me<00:01:20.979> do<00:01:21.159> that<00:01:21.280> again<00:01:21.340> let

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
the first way let me do that again let

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:36.039 
the first way let me do that again let
me<00:01:21.940> play<00:01:22.149> it<00:01:22.299> first

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.270 

and<00:01:37.240> then<00:01:38.240> we're<00:01:38.359> gonna<00:01:38.450> go<00:01:38.600> into<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.899> lead

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
and then we're gonna go into the lead

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.410 
and then we're gonna go into the lead
okay<00:01:40.750> so<00:01:41.750> what<00:01:42.140> did<00:01:42.229> I<00:01:42.289> just<00:01:42.469> do<00:01:42.649> there<00:01:43.420> turn

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
okay so what did I just do there turn

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.429 
okay so what did I just do there turn
off<00:01:44.570> delay<00:01:45.530> again<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.340> drive

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
off delay again and the drive

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.809 
off delay again and the drive
you<00:01:48.740> just<00:01:49.069> remember<00:01:49.969> we<00:01:50.329> just<00:01:50.360> came<00:01:50.869> off<00:01:51.109> of

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
you just remember we just came off of

00:01:51.819 --> 00:02:03.649 
you just remember we just came off of
the<00:01:55.539> we<00:01:56.539> came<00:01:56.719> down<00:01:56.869> here

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.669 

focus<00:02:04.320> twice

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.619 

I<00:02:09.799> threw<00:02:10.459> that<00:02:10.489> little<00:02:11.170> East<00:02:12.170> ring<00:02:12.469> in<00:02:12.590> there

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
I threw that little East ring in there

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.410 
I threw that little East ring in there
yes<00:02:14.629> try<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.670> again<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:16.909> the<00:02:17.030> transition

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
yes try this again so the transition

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.479 
yes try this again so the transition
after<00:02:18.019> playing<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.530> main<00:02:18.680> riff<00:02:18.859> twice<00:02:19.159> is

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
after playing the main riff twice is

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:30.070 
after playing the main riff twice is
this

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.809 

and<00:02:31.080> we're<00:02:31.260> gonna<00:02:31.380> go<00:02:31.530> into<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.800> lead<00:02:31.950> okay

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
and we're gonna go into the lead okay

and we're gonna go into the lead okay
one<00:02:33.180> more<00:02:33.300> time

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.660 

okay<00:02:46.319> at<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.470> beginning<00:02:47.860> of<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.459> first

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
okay at the beginning of the first

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.830 
okay at the beginning of the first
transition<00:02:48.970> we<00:02:49.090> did<00:02:49.209> earlier<00:02:49.450> in<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.599> song

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
transition we did earlier in the song

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:59.690 
transition we did earlier in the song
what<00:02:50.170> I<00:02:50.200> did<00:02:50.379> was<00:02:50.560> this

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.660 

I<00:03:00.080> ended<00:03:01.080> there<00:03:01.800> was<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.950> different<00:03:02.220> pause<00:03:02.400> in

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
I ended there was a different pause in

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.920 
I ended there was a different pause in
there<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:02.970> ended<00:03:03.270> on<00:03:03.390> this<00:03:03.630> on<00:03:03.840> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
there and I ended on this on the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.070 
there and I ended on this on the
g-string<00:03:04.140> I<00:03:04.500> did<00:03:04.740> and<00:03:05.690> then<00:03:06.690> went<00:03:06.840> up<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.930> the

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
g-string I did and then went up to the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.650 
g-string I did and then went up to the
harmonic<00:03:07.550> this<00:03:08.550> time<00:03:08.819> I<00:03:09.030> did<00:03:09.270> something<00:03:09.510> a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
harmonic this time I did something a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.910 
harmonic this time I did something a
little<00:03:09.930> slightly<00:03:10.140> different<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.650> went<00:03:10.830> like

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
little slightly different I went like

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.390 
little slightly different I went like
this

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.039 

I<00:03:20.450> added<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.540> paused

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
I added I paused

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.140 
I added I paused
I<00:03:22.140> didn't<00:03:22.739> pause<00:03:22.890> in<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.459> beginning<00:03:23.879> as<00:03:23.970> much

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
I didn't pause in the beginning as much

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.699 
I didn't pause in the beginning as much
and<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:24.480> threw<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:24.900> four<00:03:25.860> notes<00:03:26.420> as<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:28.319> suppose

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
and I threw in four notes as I suppose

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.440 
and I threw in four notes as I suppose
as<00:03:28.950> opposed<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:31.879> again<00:03:32.879> you<00:03:33.180> can<00:03:33.299> just

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
as opposed to this again you can just

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.759 
as opposed to this again you can just
change<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.720> up<00:03:33.870> however<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.260> like

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
change it up however you like

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.440 
change it up however you like
but<00:03:35.250> at<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.430> end<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.579> day<00:03:35.730> before<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.269> lead

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
but at the end of day before the lead

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.530 
but at the end of day before the lead
here's<00:03:37.170> what<00:03:37.349> I'm<00:03:37.439> doing<00:03:38.060> I'm<00:03:39.060> going<00:03:39.120> like

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
here's what I'm doing I'm going like

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:51.840 
here's what I'm doing I'm going like
this<00:03:41.390> all<00:03:42.390> clean

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:59.030 

it<00:03:52.850> comes

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.360 

we're<00:04:00.040> gonna<00:04:00.159> go<00:04:00.280> down<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.640> lead<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:03.280> we

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
we're gonna go down to the lead so we

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:29.890 
we're gonna go down to the lead so we
came<00:04:03.549> off<00:04:03.730> of<00:04:03.849> this

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.260 

that<00:04:30.900> so<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:31.169> just<00:04:31.319> want<00:04:31.470> to<00:04:31.500> end<00:04:31.650> on<00:04:35.270> so

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
that so you just want to end on so

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.879 
that so you just want to end on so
that's<00:04:36.449> what<00:04:36.660> I<00:04:36.690> did<00:04:36.840> in<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:36.990> cover<00:04:37.169> here's

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
that's what I did in the cover here's

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.080 
that's what I did in the cover here's
another<00:04:38.160> way<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.400> do<00:04:38.550> this<00:04:38.669> it's<00:04:38.849> a<00:04:38.910> little

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
another way to do this it's a little

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.950 
another way to do this it's a little
more<00:04:39.240> complicated

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
more complicated

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.510 
more complicated
I<00:04:39.990> just<00:04:40.229> wanted<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.560> it's<00:04:40.949> a<00:04:41.039> little<00:04:41.190> fuller

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
I just wanted to it's a little fuller

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.370 
I just wanted to it's a little fuller
it's<00:04:41.849> got<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.030> little<00:04:42.300> more<00:04:42.509> if<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.139> really

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
it's got a little more if you really

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.779 
it's got a little more if you really
want<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.620> strum<00:04:44.069> through<00:04:44.280> this<00:04:44.400> a<00:04:44.460> little<00:04:44.639> bit

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
want to strum through this a little bit

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.879 
want to strum through this a little bit
more<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.810> we<00:04:45.960> play<00:04:46.139> it<00:04:46.259> first<00:04:46.500> it'll<00:04:46.740> go<00:04:46.860> like

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
more and we play it first it'll go like

00:04:46.889 --> 00:05:05.730 
more and we play it first it'll go like
this<00:04:47.250> see<00:04:47.610> if<00:04:47.669> I<00:04:47.759> get<00:04:47.910> this<00:04:48.030> right

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.040 

okay<00:05:06.740> so<00:05:06.800> I<00:05:07.189> was<00:05:07.429> picking<00:05:07.729> more<00:05:08.089> in<00:05:08.449> this

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
okay so I was picking more in this

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.119 
okay so I was picking more in this
version<00:05:09.289> so<00:05:09.679> let<00:05:09.800> me<00:05:09.889> show<00:05:10.069> you<00:05:10.099> what<00:05:10.279> that<00:05:10.429> was

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:12.129 
version so let me show you what that was

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:14.559 
version so let me show you what that was
this<00:05:13.129> is<00:05:13.309> sometimes<00:05:13.520> hard<00:05:13.909> to<00:05:13.969> do<00:05:14.179> it<00:05:14.270> slower

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
this is sometimes hard to do it slower

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.299 
this is sometimes hard to do it slower
than<00:05:14.839> it<00:05:14.929> is<00:05:15.020> for<00:05:15.409> me<00:05:15.529> to<00:05:15.649> play<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:15.860> faster

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:16.309 
than it is for me to play it faster

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:27.310 
than it is for me to play it faster
essentially<00:05:17.300> we're<00:05:17.419> going<00:05:17.449> to<00:05:17.599> do<00:05:17.719> this

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.630 

you

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:06:00.149 

okay<00:05:34.570> one<00:05:35.570> more<00:05:35.690> time<00:05:35.750> that<00:05:36.350> is<00:05:36.500> this

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.879 

it's<00:06:00.879> a<00:06:00.939> lot<00:06:01.119> as<00:06:01.240> slow<00:06:01.419> as<00:06:01.539> I<00:06:01.629> can<00:06:01.659> do<00:06:01.990> it<00:06:02.110> okay

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
it's a lot as slow as I can do it okay

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.489 
it's a lot as slow as I can do it okay
that<00:06:03.430> came<00:06:03.610> out<00:06:03.759> perfect<00:06:04.210> and<00:06:04.389> then<00:06:05.080> go<00:06:05.259> to<00:06:05.319> the

00:06:05.489 --> 00:06:05.499 
that came out perfect and then go to the

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:24.800 
that came out perfect and then go to the
lead<00:06:05.759> so<00:06:06.759> we<00:06:06.879> get<00:06:07.029> this

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.690 

and<00:06:25.810> then<00:06:25.930> to<00:06:26.050> the<00:06:26.110> lead<00:06:27.090> turn<00:06:28.090> on<00:06:29.580> delay<00:06:30.580> in

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700 
and then to the lead turn on delay in

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.050 
and then to the lead turn on delay in
the<00:06:30.790> drive<00:06:31.920> again<00:06:32.920> this<00:06:33.190> is<00:06:33.340> just<00:06:33.580> the<00:06:33.700> second

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
the drive again this is just the second

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.280 
the drive again this is just the second
way<00:06:34.150> to<00:06:34.180> do<00:06:34.390> the<00:06:34.480> transition<00:06:34.780> if<00:06:34.990> you<00:06:35.080> want<00:06:35.230> to

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
way to do the transition if you want to

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:58.020 
way to do the transition if you want to
do<00:06:35.380> a<00:06:35.410> little<00:06:35.700> differently

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.750 

okay<00:06:59.030> so<00:06:59.390> that<00:06:59.540> covers<00:06:59.800> two<00:07:00.800> transitions<00:07:01.430> this

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.760 
okay so that covers two transitions this

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:07.909 
okay so that covers two transitions this
version

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:17.980 

or<00:07:08.919> this<00:07:09.370> version

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.230 

okay<00:07:18.990> finally<00:07:19.770> got<00:07:19.919> through<00:07:20.099> it<00:07:20.280> and<00:07:20.819> now

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 
okay finally got through it and now

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.949 
okay finally got through it and now
we're<00:07:21.419> on<00:07:21.449> to<00:07:21.870> the<00:07:22.259> lead<00:07:22.440> guitar
