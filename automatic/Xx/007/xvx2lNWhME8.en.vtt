hey<00:00:04.740> guys<00:00:04.950> this<00:00:05.160> is<00:00:05.220> chasing<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.819> warehouse

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
hey guys this is chasing the warehouse

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.880 
hey guys this is chasing the warehouse
and<00:00:06.420> today<00:00:06.690> we're<00:00:07.020> gonna<00:00:07.109> be<00:00:07.290> taking<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.649> quick

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
and today we're gonna be taking a quick

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.450 
and today we're gonna be taking a quick
look<00:00:07.919> at<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.790> CCM<00:00:09.450> Tax<00:00:09.840> 5050<00:00:10.769> -<00:00:10.980> ice<00:00:11.190> hockey

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
look at the CCM Tax 5050 - ice hockey

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.509 
look at the CCM Tax 5050 - ice hockey
skates<00:00:11.880> so<00:00:12.690> we've<00:00:12.900> got<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.139> speed<00:00:13.440> blade<00:00:13.769> 4.0

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519

getting<00:00:47.280> into<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> quarter<00:00:47.820> package<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.750> is

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
getting into the quarter package this is

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.529 
getting into the quarter package this is
the<00:00:49.020> fiber<00:00:49.260> reinforced<00:00:50.010> quarter<00:00:50.539> definitely

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the fiber reinforced quarter definitely

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.900 
the fiber reinforced quarter definitely
a<00:00:51.600> big<00:00:51.870> jump<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.260> stiffness<00:00:52.920> compared<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> what

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
a big jump in stiffness compared to what

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.139 
a big jump in stiffness compared to what
we<00:00:54.059> saw<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.539> 4050<00:00:55.410> -<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:56.520> attack<00:00:56.910> frame

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
we saw in that 4050 - that attack frame

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.150 
we saw in that 4050 - that attack frame
you<00:00:57.300> could<00:00:57.420> really<00:00:57.809> feel<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:58.649> but

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
you could really feel it on this one but

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.279 
you could really feel it on this one but
it<00:00:59.250> runs<00:00:59.670> along<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.210> sides<00:01:00.480> here<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.960> you

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
it runs along the sides here and you

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.540 
it runs along the sides here and you
know<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.770> there's<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> lot<00:01:02.370> of

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
know you can see there's a lot of

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.039 
know you can see there's a lot of
stiffness<00:01:02.820> down<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:03.989> to

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
stiffness down here so it's going to

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
stiffness down here so it's going to
allow<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.589> out<00:01:04.710> tons<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.339> power<00:01:05.519> out

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
allow you to get out tons of power out

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.149 
allow you to get out tons of power out
of<00:01:06.090> each<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.570> every<00:01:06.840> stride<00:01:07.170> also<00:01:07.979> has<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
of each and every stride also has a

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.580 
of each and every stride also has a
really<00:01:08.490> durable<00:01:08.880> shell<00:01:09.210> casing<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.810> well<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
really durable shell casing as well it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.260 
really durable shell casing as well it
also<00:01:10.799> looks<00:01:11.189> great<00:01:11.400> especially<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
also looks great especially with the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.990 
also looks great especially with the
nicest<00:01:12.600> aesthetic<00:01:13.320> touches<00:01:13.909> getting<00:01:14.909> in

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
nicest aesthetic touches getting in

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.640 
nicest aesthetic touches getting in
another<00:01:15.150> tongue<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.900> also<00:01:16.170> pretty<00:01:16.530> good

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
another tongue this is also pretty good

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.200 
another tongue this is also pretty good
upgrade<00:01:16.920> because<00:01:17.310> they're<00:01:17.670> using<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.970> lot

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
upgrade because they're using a lot

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
upgrade because they're using a lot
stiffer<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.930> lot<00:01:19.439> more<00:01:19.710> dense

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
stiffer a lot more dense

stiffer a lot more dense
evie<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> phones<00:01:21.119> than<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.540> saw<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.869> that

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
evie a phones than what we saw in that

we see it in this um tacks line a nice

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.679 
we see it in this um tacks line a nice
soft<00:01:55.439> touch<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.369> very<00:01:56.670> durable<00:01:57.000> but

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
soft touch to it it's very durable but

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.030 
soft touch to it it's very durable but
the<00:01:57.840> best<00:01:58.049> thing<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.469> about<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.920> that

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
the best thing I like about it is that

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.679 
the best thing I like about it is that
it's<00:01:59.159> very<00:01:59.460> moisture<00:01:59.909> wicking<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.570> has

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
it's very moisture wicking and it has

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.480 
it's very moisture wicking and it has
that<00:02:00.840> traditional<00:02:01.409> feel<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:01.890> very

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
that traditional feel so very

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.069 
that traditional feel so very
comfortable<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.299> really<00:02:03.479> helps<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.780> push

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
comfortable but it really helps to push

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.660 
comfortable but it really helps to push
out<00:02:04.290> moisture<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.920> those<00:02:05.070> air<00:02:05.310> vent<00:02:05.520> holes

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
