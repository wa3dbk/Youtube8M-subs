construction<00:00:40.850> crafting<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.030> agility<00:00:42.360> i

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
construction crafting and agility i

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.200 
construction crafting and agility i
think<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.899> left<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.010> isn't<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.820> isn't<00:00:45.000> that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
think is left so it isn't it isn't that

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.660 
think is left so it isn't it isn't that
hard<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:46.620> i<00:00:46.649> should<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.129> getting<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.460> pretty

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
hard so i should be getting it pretty

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.250 
hard so i should be getting it pretty
soon<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> mornings<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.660> part<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.079> really

soon but the mornings and part is really
the<00:00:49.590> only<00:00:49.649> reason<00:00:50.039> why<00:00:50.129> i<00:00:50.160> haven't<00:00:50.309> done<00:00:50.520> it

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the only reason why i haven't done it

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.209 
the only reason why i haven't done it
yet<00:00:50.840> but<00:00:51.840> that's<00:00:52.559> not<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> main<00:00:52.890> point<00:00:53.160> in

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
