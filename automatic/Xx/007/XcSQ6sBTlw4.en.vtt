hi<00:00:00.599> and<00:00:00.900> welcome<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.230> my<00:00:01.350> tutorial<00:00:01.410> video<00:00:02.100> on

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hi and welcome to my tutorial video on

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.220 
hi and welcome to my tutorial video on
the<00:00:02.490> halo<00:00:02.730> 4<00:00:03.240> cheats<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.140> glitches<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:05.089> upon

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
the halo 4 cheats and glitches and upon

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.629 
the halo 4 cheats and glitches and upon
discovering<00:00:07.230> these<00:00:07.470> glitches<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:07.980> ended<00:00:08.580> up

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
discovering these glitches I ended up

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.129 
discovering these glitches I ended up
doing<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.970> quick<00:00:09.150> playthrough<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.809> rushing

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
doing a quick playthrough and rushing

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.290 
doing a quick playthrough and rushing
through<00:00:10.349> on<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.590> actual<00:00:10.920> game<00:00:10.950> itself<00:00:11.190> on<00:00:12.090> the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
through on the actual game itself on the

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.049 
through on the actual game itself on the
first<00:00:12.509> level<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.200> first<00:00:13.889> glitch<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.610> find<00:00:14.880> is

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
first level the first glitch to find is

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.140 
first level the first glitch to find is
pretty<00:00:15.299> simple<00:00:15.890> as<00:00:16.890> soon<00:00:17.160> as<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.520> started<00:00:17.940> you

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
pretty simple as soon as you started you

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.450 
pretty simple as soon as you started you
head<00:00:18.480> left<00:00:18.750> then<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.380> head<00:00:19.619> straight<00:00:19.830> forward

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
head left then you head straight forward

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.670 
head left then you head straight forward
you'll<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.240> four<00:00:21.660> different<00:00:22.080> types<00:00:22.500> of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
you'll have four different types of

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.259 
you'll have four different types of
monsters<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.970> could<00:00:24.119> probably

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
monsters and you could probably

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.730 
monsters and you could probably
differentiate<00:00:24.930> them<00:00:25.109> by<00:00:25.230> their<00:00:25.410> colors

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
differentiate them by their colors

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.519 
differentiate them by their colors
they'll<00:00:26.400> end<00:00:26.640> up<00:00:26.730> chasing<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:28.380> try

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
they'll end up chasing you and just try

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.140 
they'll end up chasing you and just try
and<00:00:28.590> complete<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.980> full<00:00:29.250> circuit<00:00:29.699> until<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
and complete a full circuit until the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.080 
and complete a full circuit until the
entire<00:00:30.390> map<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.840> clear<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.460> then<00:00:32.460> what's<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
entire map is clear and then what's the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.970 
entire map is clear and then what's the
code<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.600> kill<00:00:33.870> them<00:00:34.050> each<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.890> these

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
code you can kill them each of these

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.040 
code you can kill them each of these
four<00:00:35.219> monsters<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:35.820> they<00:00:35.940> will<00:00:36.120> respawn<00:00:36.540> so

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
four monsters but they will respawn so

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.200 
four monsters but they will respawn so
timing<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.100> key<00:00:38.370> when<00:00:38.550> you're<00:00:38.730> trying<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> put

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
timing is key when you're trying to put

00:00:39.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
timing is key when you're trying to put
complete<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.809> entire<00:00:39.930> circuit

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.800 

haha
