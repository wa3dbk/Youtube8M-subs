00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.730
 something tasty 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.730
 for more 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.170
 now 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.090
 my love 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.860
 once 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.860
 sometimes 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.710
 those who are first congratulations 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.500
 for the great theme they are playing 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.870
 I wanted you to tell me if you have any 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.400
 favorite player in the atp or some that 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.640
 be an example for you that you look like 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.160
 play that you like but I think david 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.000
 Ferrer is a great example for 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.760
 all or better than fight every point 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.640
 very intense very professional so it's 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.410
 a great example for many 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.440
 tennis players like me so we come 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.350
 growing 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.559
 obviously I wish I could do what 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.910
 that make feel a little pressure to 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.649
 level said out there Argentine power 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.290
 many already know you good chile 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.670
 also people understood and gives you a 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.850
 little pressure to be marked with a 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.480
 promise or with someone who can and will 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.270
 get away 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.340
 I believe that pressure is something vital that 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.850
 will always be had a sport 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.670
 of a lot of pressure 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.340
 and I want to go driving every little bit to go 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.729
 learning to handle it 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.750
 something that I can not control so a 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.020
 little bit cut me my short career that I take 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.990
 he learned 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.810
 He does not know how to handle it and I think I'm very 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.149
 happy of my advance of how I'm going 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.610
 improving and growing as it 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.900
 I really enjoy it and the fact is here 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.390
 in this tournament for me something 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.610
 very good you never imagine last year 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.610
 good this year this year here so 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.540
 I am very happy and I think I hope 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.900
 keep competing 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.880
 to get a little out of tennis like a 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.390
 data that you like what your passion is 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:12.330
 that look that you follow I am not very fanatic 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:16.230
 I like to see a lot of football 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:20.220
 Chilean football also do not know how to play him 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.870
 speak I join me with my friend awaits 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.010
 things 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.280
 when I'm in the nitrate court 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.160
 forget me a little he had that there is 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.560
 very draining so 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.830
