00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy with the

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.460 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy with the
upcoming<00:00:03.240> update<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:03.840> new<00:00:03.990> ash<00:00:04.170> in<00:00:04.440> the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
upcoming update to the new ash in the

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.170 
upcoming update to the new ash in the
next<00:00:04.859> patch<00:00:05.069> I<00:00:05.339> figured<00:00:05.819> it'd<00:00:05.910> be<00:00:06.000> worth

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
next patch I figured it'd be worth

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.789 
next patch I figured it'd be worth
taking<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.690> look<00:00:06.720> over<00:00:07.170> since<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.470> think<00:00:07.649> it's<00:00:07.740> a

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
taking a look over since I think it's a

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.169 
taking a look over since I think it's a
pretty<00:00:07.950> cool<00:00:08.099> kit<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.519> will<00:00:08.730> prove<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.150> be

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
pretty cool kit and will prove to be

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.680 
pretty cool kit and will prove to be
quite<00:00:09.450> strong<00:00:09.960> let's<00:00:10.620> get<00:00:10.769> started<00:00:11.630> now<00:00:12.630> the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
quite strong let's get started now the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.330 
quite strong let's get started now the
main<00:00:12.929> changes<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.410> ash<00:00:13.530> come<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:13.980> form<00:00:14.190> of

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
main changes to ash come in the form of

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.000 
main changes to ash come in the form of
her<00:00:14.460> passive<00:00:14.969> her<00:00:15.389> Q<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.929> her<00:00:16.020> Hawk<00:00:16.230> shot<00:00:16.529> her

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
her passive her Q and her Hawk shot her

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.220 
her passive her Q and her Hawk shot her
volley<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.609> her<00:00:17.730> ultimate<00:00:18.090> remained<00:00:18.480> mostly

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
volley and her ultimate remained mostly

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.220 
volley and her ultimate remained mostly
unchanged<00:00:19.980> her<00:00:20.640> old<00:00:20.910> Q<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.480> now<00:00:21.720> moved<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.140> her

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
unchanged her old Q is now moved to her

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.230 
unchanged her old Q is now moved to her
passive<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:22.949> every<00:00:23.220> single<00:00:23.519> auto<00:00:23.670> attack<00:00:24.000> with

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
passive so every single auto attack with

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.750 
passive so every single auto attack with
her<00:00:24.449> now<00:00:24.960> slows<00:00:25.410> at<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> cost<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.220> zero<00:00:26.279> mana

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
her now slows at the cost of zero mana

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.939 
her now slows at the cost of zero mana
the<00:00:27.420> trade-off<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.930> now<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.410> slow<00:00:28.740> at

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
the trade-off is now that the slow at

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.279 
the trade-off is now that the slow at
early<00:00:29.279> levels<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.820> really<00:00:30.449> really<00:00:30.810> weak<00:00:31.019> and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
early levels is really really weak and

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.740 
early levels is really really weak and
kind<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.099> non-existent<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.420> really

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
kind of non-existent but it's really

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.990 
kind of non-existent but it's really
nice<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> not<00:00:34.500> use<00:00:34.829> man<00:00:35.070> at<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> perma<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.700> people

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
nice to not use man at a perma so people

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.639 
nice to not use man at a perma so people
now<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> scales<00:00:36.630> up<00:00:36.840> really<00:00:37.140> well<00:00:37.350> in

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
now and it scales up really well in

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.709 
now and it scales up really well in
addition<00:00:38.280> she<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:38.940> no<00:00:39.059> longer<00:00:39.239> critically

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
addition she can no longer critically

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.720 
addition she can no longer critically
strike<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.469> her<00:00:40.559> passive<00:00:41.010> scales<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.550> gives

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
strike but her passive scales and gives

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.400 
strike but her passive scales and gives
her<00:00:41.850> bonus<00:00:42.090> damage<00:00:42.360> depending<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.170> how<00:00:43.290> much

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
her bonus damage depending on how much

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.950 
her bonus damage depending on how much
crit<00:00:43.710> chance<00:00:43.739> she<00:00:44.219> has<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.480> also

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
crit chance she has this is also

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.450 
crit chance she has this is also
actually<00:00:46.289> pretty<00:00:46.469> good<00:00:46.710> because<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.160> bonus

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
actually pretty good because the bonus

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.220 
actually pretty good because the bonus
damage<00:00:47.640> scales<00:00:48.090> well<00:00:48.360> enough<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.870> crit

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
damage scales well enough with crit

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.350 
damage scales well enough with crit
chance<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.770> make<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.610> really<00:00:51.120> do

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
chance to make it so that you really do

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.840 
chance to make it so that you really do
just<00:00:51.750> about<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.320> same<00:00:52.530> amount<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.980> damage<00:00:53.370> but

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
just about the same amount of damage but

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.430 
just about the same amount of damage but
without<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.300> RNG<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.170> crit<00:00:55.410> chance

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
without the RNG that crit chance

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.770 
without the RNG that crit chance
normally<00:00:56.129> brings<00:00:56.430> which<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.390> sweet

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
normally brings which is really sweet

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.810 
normally brings which is really sweet
now<00:00:58.410> she<00:00:58.500> really<00:00:58.980> doesn't<00:00:59.280> run<00:00:59.430> out<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.579> mana

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
now she really doesn't run out of mana

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.459 
now she really doesn't run out of mana
that<00:01:00.090> much<00:01:00.359> unless<00:01:00.660> you're<00:01:00.840> spamming<00:01:01.079> volley

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that much unless you're spamming volley

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.439 
that much unless you're spamming volley
off<00:01:01.739> cooldown<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.699> gives<00:01:02.820> her<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> lot<00:01:03.270> more

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
off cooldown so it gives her a lot more

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.210 
off cooldown so it gives her a lot more
resources<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> work<00:01:04.379> with<00:01:04.589> which<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.949> really

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
resources to work with which is really

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.219 
resources to work with which is really
awesome<00:01:05.460> especially<00:01:05.939> since<00:01:06.659> mana<00:01:06.990> issues

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
awesome especially since mana issues

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.050 
awesome especially since mana issues
were<00:01:07.619> such<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> big<00:01:08.159> problem<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:08.760> her<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
were such a big problem for her in the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.980 
were such a big problem for her in the
past<00:01:10.430> her<00:01:11.430> Q<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:11.939> builds<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.630> stack<00:01:12.960> of

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
past her Q now builds up a stack of

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.109 
past her Q now builds up a stack of
focus<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.799> lasts<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.250> about<00:01:14.310> five<00:01:14.640> seconds

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
focus that lasts for about five seconds

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.850 
focus that lasts for about five seconds
whenever<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.570> hit<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> target<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.320> when<00:01:16.650> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
whenever you hit a target and when you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.710 
whenever you hit a target and when you
activate<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> ability<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.030> get<00:01:18.270> increased

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
activate the ability you get increased

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.300 
activate the ability you get increased
attack<00:01:19.020> speed<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.470> your<00:01:19.680> passive<00:01:20.100> slow

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
attack speed and your passive slow

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.580 
attack speed and your passive slow
amount<00:01:20.610> increases<00:01:21.090> based<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.960> how<00:01:22.080> many<00:01:22.140> focus

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
amount increases based on how many focus

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.499 
amount increases based on how many focus
stacks<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.460> addition<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.390> had

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
stacks you have in addition if you had

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.240 
stacks you have in addition if you had
five<00:01:24.750> stacks<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.320> focus<00:01:25.650> when<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.830> use<00:01:26.100> this

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
five stacks of focus when you use this

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.560 
five stacks of focus when you use this
ability<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.880> now<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> gives<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.390> some

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
ability and now it gives you some

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.450 
ability and now it gives you some
rapid-fire<00:01:27.930> attacks<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> nice<00:01:29.130> chunk

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
rapid-fire attacks that do a nice chunk

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.550 
rapid-fire attacks that do a nice chunk
of<00:01:29.549> damage<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.450> decently<00:01:30.900> strong<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.380> makes

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
of damage it's decently strong it makes

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.289 
of damage it's decently strong it makes
her<00:01:31.650> early<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.100> mid<00:01:32.220> game<00:01:32.400> damage<00:01:32.790> reasonably

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
her early and mid game damage reasonably

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.260 
her early and mid game damage reasonably
higher<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.020> nice<00:01:34.170> change<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:35.270> lastly

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
higher so it's a nice change and lastly

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.179 
higher so it's a nice change and lastly
her<00:01:36.509> hog<00:01:36.750> shot<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.110> pretty<00:01:37.470> much<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.650> same<00:01:37.950> but

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
her hog shot is pretty much the same but

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.929 
her hog shot is pretty much the same but
it's<00:01:38.310> now<00:01:38.520> global<00:01:39.329> which<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.320> honest<00:01:40.710> is

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
it's now global which to be honest is

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.149 
it's now global which to be honest is
totally<00:01:41.939> insane<00:01:42.950> especially<00:01:43.950> at<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
totally insane especially at the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.520 
totally insane especially at the
competitive<00:01:44.520> level<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.479> alone<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.020> enough

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
competitive level this alone is enough

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.190 
competitive level this alone is enough
to<00:01:46.710> make<00:01:46.860> ash<00:01:47.189> really<00:01:47.610> strong<00:01:48.119> add<00:01:48.540> into<00:01:49.170> that

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
to make ash really strong add into that

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.410 
to make ash really strong add into that
that<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.740> now<00:01:49.890> uses<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.280> charge<00:01:50.729> system<00:01:51.240> that

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
that it now uses a charge system that

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.510 
that it now uses a charge system that
stores<00:01:51.570> two<00:01:52.049> charges<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.159> really

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
stores two charges and so it's really

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.240 
stores two charges and so it's really
good<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.149> honestly<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.110> my<00:01:55.170> opinion<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
good and honestly in my opinion is the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.789 
good and honestly in my opinion is the
biggest<00:01:56.729> buff<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.540> update<00:01:58.079> since<00:01:58.649> if

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
biggest buff of this update since if

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.200 
biggest buff of this update since if
you're<00:01:58.950> skilled<00:01:59.219> enough<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.700> skill<00:01:59.939> pretty

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
you're skilled enough this skill pretty

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.999 
you're skilled enough this skill pretty
much<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.540> becomes<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:01.049> clairvoyance<00:02:01.770> but

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
much just becomes a clairvoyance but

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.039 
much just becomes a clairvoyance but
better<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.240> use<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.600> track<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
better and you can use it to track the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.660 
better and you can use it to track the
enemy<00:02:04.350> jungler<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.920> set<00:02:05.070> up<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.250> boatload<00:02:05.460> of

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
enemy jungler and set up a boatload of

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.730 
enemy jungler and set up a boatload of
place<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.329> really<00:02:06.509> deny<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.140> many<00:02:07.350> options

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
place and really deny so many options

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.160 
place and really deny so many options
for<00:02:07.799> your<00:02:08.009> opponents

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
for your opponents

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.170 
for your opponents
so<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.920> played<00:02:11.130> ash<00:02:11.310> for<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.580> few<00:02:11.760> games<00:02:11.880> on<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
so I played ash for a few games on the

using it effectively her mid game team

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.850 
using it effectively her mid game team
fights<00:02:23.310> are<00:02:23.690> reasonably<00:02:24.690> better<00:02:24.930> now<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.470> in

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
fights are reasonably better now and in

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.650 
fights are reasonably better now and in
combo<00:02:26.280> with<00:02:26.430> her<00:02:26.520> arrow<00:02:26.760> her<00:02:27.030> team<00:02:27.270> fights<00:02:27.510> in

her<00:02:29.910> raw<00:02:30.120> damage<00:02:30.510> as<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.660> whole<00:02:30.989> has<00:02:31.230> gone<00:02:31.440> up<00:02:31.620> by

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
her raw damage as a whole has gone up by

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.470 
her raw damage as a whole has gone up by
a<00:02:31.860> decent<00:02:32.340> amount<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.239> have<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.360> lot

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
more room to work with and it's really

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.320 
more room to work with and it's really

three or so is still fairly lackluster
it<00:03:00.030> got<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.330> bit<00:03:00.510> better<00:03:00.690> with<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.019> change<00:03:01.260> to

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
it got a bit better with the change to

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.930 
it got a bit better with the change to
her<00:03:01.500> Q<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.040> relating<00:03:02.459> has<00:03:02.549> gone<00:03:02.760> from

her Q and so relating has gone from

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.600 
her Q and so relating has gone from
below<00:03:03.330> average<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:04.049> about<00:03:04.709> average<00:03:05.250> early<00:03:05.580> on

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
below average to about average early on

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.059 
below average to about average early on
and<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.660> does<00:03:06.840> get<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.110> lot<00:03:07.440> better<00:03:07.680> once<00:03:07.950> he

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
and it does get a lot better once he

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.890
