because the more people who are making

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.670 
because the more people who are making
and<00:01:16.460> selling<00:01:16.640> artisan<00:01:17.299> jewelry<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:18.170> more<00:01:18.409> it

and selling artisan jewelry the more it
gets<00:01:18.860> into<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.250> public's<00:01:19.729> consciousness<00:01:20.120> the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
gets into the public's consciousness the

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.500 
gets into the public's consciousness the
more<00:01:20.900> consumers<00:01:21.530> see<00:01:21.830> it<00:01:21.890> and<00:01:22.130> desire<00:01:23.000> it<00:01:23.270> so

more consumers see it and desire it so

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.570 
more consumers see it and desire it so
in<00:01:23.659> that<00:01:23.810> sense<00:01:24.140> competition<00:01:24.950> for<00:01:25.100> artisan

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
in that sense competition for artisan

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.620 
in that sense competition for artisan
jewelry<00:01:25.790> helps<00:01:26.570> all<00:01:26.840> artists<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.590> jewelers

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
jewelry helps all artists and jewelers

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.990 
jewelry helps all artists and jewelers
the<00:01:29.630> second<00:01:30.110> issue<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.740> I<00:01:30.770> see<00:01:31.190> is<00:01:31.490> that

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
the second issue that I see is that

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.530 
the second issue that I see is that
jewelry<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.720> not<00:01:32.990> necessity<00:01:34.240> people<00:01:35.240> buy

jewelry is not necessity people buy

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.539 
jewelry is not necessity people buy
jewelry<00:01:36.049> because<00:01:36.320> they<00:01:36.710> want<00:01:37.010> it<00:01:37.130> because

they love it because it attracts them

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.609 
they love it because it attracts them
because<00:01:40.549> it<00:01:40.670> reminds<00:01:41.180> them<00:01:41.330> of<00:01:41.420> somebody<00:01:41.900> all
