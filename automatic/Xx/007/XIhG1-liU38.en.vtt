00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
at the very beginning game get that good

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
start because i want to try to get a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.179 
start because i want to try to get a
good<00:01:39.180> gameplay<00:01:39.600> scorestreaks<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.710> all<00:01:40.950> up

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
good gameplay scorestreaks can be all up

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.950 
good gameplay scorestreaks can be all up
to<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:41.640> what<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> run<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.479> UAV

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
to you but what I like to run is the UAV

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.870 
to you but what I like to run is the UAV
and<00:01:43.170> system<00:01:43.530> hack<00:01:43.680> definitely<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> best

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
and system hack definitely the best

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.340 
and system hack definitely the best
killstreaks<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.659> use<00:01:45.810> we're<00:01:46.020> trying<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> go

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
killstreaks to use we're trying to go

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.260 
killstreaks to use we're trying to go
for<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.530> DNA<00:01:46.710> bomb<00:01:46.979> if<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.610> want<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.880> try<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.060> go

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
for a DNA bomb if you want to try to go

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.330 
for a DNA bomb if you want to try to go
for<00:01:48.630> hot<00:01:48.899> kills<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.680> should<00:01:49.860> probably<00:01:50.159> run

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
for hot kills you should probably run

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.210 
for hot kills you should probably run
bombing<00:01:51.030> run<00:01:51.180> warbird<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.020> maybe<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.829> UAV

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
bombing run warbird and maybe the UAV

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.679 
bombing run warbird and maybe the UAV
that's<00:01:53.520> definitely<00:01:53.880> ones<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.360> i<00:01:54.420> would<00:01:54.570> use

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
that's definitely ones that i would use

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.450 
that's definitely ones that i would use
probably<00:01:55.049> take<00:01:55.170> up<00:01:55.320> XO<00:01:55.740> overclock<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.340> just

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
probably take up XO overclock and just

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.370 
probably take up XO overclock and just
use<00:01:56.610> 3<00:01:56.850> killstreaks<00:01:57.299> now<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> 13

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
use 3 killstreaks now we have the 13
