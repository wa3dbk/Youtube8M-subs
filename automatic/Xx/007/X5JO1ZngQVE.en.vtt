00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
 and now I'm going to show you a video that 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.370
 base the combination of the videos 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.590
 previous 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.200
 the combination the conversion of the video 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:13.680
 from photoshop 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.900
 and from the video of the cars it turns out that 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.599
 I was with everyone's people and I've 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.000
 asked for permission to use one of their 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.000
 cars 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.060
 to place the session session 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.060
 photographic is already 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:38.530
 came and took pictures and you see the 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.530
 montage that took some pictures 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.339
 and the number of people who have 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.149
 swirling in brief seconds to 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:51.450
 Sometimes the best thing is to take things out when 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.920
 reverse no 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.810
 instead of taking what everyone 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.160
 is looking to draw just the opposite 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:01.090
 what you're seeing people who are 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.090
 this 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.890
 do not 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.869
 I love 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.560
 people 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.590
 away from home 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.570
 total 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.040
 about love 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.310
 security is the subject of the daughters of 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.810
 they were the wounded 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:58.390
 but not 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:58.390
 to people who are very interesting
