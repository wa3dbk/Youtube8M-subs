or smaller then go ahead and paint it on
and<00:04:17.360> it<00:04:17.480> automatically<00:04:17.959> matches<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.620> color

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
and it automatically matches the color

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:25.660 
and it automatically matches the color
of<00:04:19.130> your<00:04:19.220> background<00:04:19.630> which<00:04:20.630> is<00:04:20.660> fun<00:04:24.490> blur<00:04:25.490> it

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
of your background which is fun blur it

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.220 
of your background which is fun blur it
and<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:27.110> might<00:04:27.410> be<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.650> little<00:04:27.890> more<00:04:28.280> extreme

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
and that might be a little more extreme

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.990 
and that might be a little more extreme
so<00:04:30.230> if<00:04:30.530> you<00:04:30.650> don't<00:04:30.860> like<00:04:31.040> it<00:04:31.220> that<00:04:31.250> blurry<00:04:31.760> you
