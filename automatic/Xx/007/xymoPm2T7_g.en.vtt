00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.220 

so<00:00:01.079> one<00:00:02.040> of<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.250> readers<00:00:02.580> asked<00:00:03.300> me<00:00:03.510> about<00:00:03.750> how

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
so one of the readers asked me about how

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.150 
so one of the readers asked me about how
you<00:00:04.290> create<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:05.390> formula<00:00:06.390> template<00:00:06.960> in<00:00:07.200> Excel

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
you create a formula template in Excel

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.450 
you create a formula template in Excel
and<00:00:09.200> so<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.260> went<00:00:10.500> through<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.950> created<00:00:11.250> one

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
and so I went through and I created one

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.740 
and so I went through and I created one
so<00:00:12.000> here<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.740> in<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:14.040> formula<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.570> this

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
so here it is in this formula in this

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.019 
so here it is in this formula in this
template<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.260> way<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.529> use<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.160> up<00:00:17.730> in

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
template the way you use it is up in

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.939 
template the way you use it is up in
this<00:00:18.180> box<00:00:18.420> here<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.960> put<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.350> name<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
this box here you put the name of the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:20.599 
this box here you put the name of the
formula

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
formula

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.000 
formula
I<00:00:20.640> just<00:00:20.970> put<00:00:21.150> test<00:00:21.390> formula<00:00:21.810> there<00:00:21.990> then<00:00:22.859> you

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
I just put test formula there then you

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.839 
I just put test formula there then you
can<00:00:23.039> enter<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.760> batch<00:00:24.000> size<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.810> do<00:00:25.140> all<00:00:25.650> my

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
can enter the batch size I do all my

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.759 
can enter the batch size I do all my
formulating<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.000> grams<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.599> here's<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.170> 500

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
formulating in grams so here's a 500

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.599 
formulating in grams so here's a 500
gram<00:00:28.949> batch

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
gram batch

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.749 
gram batch
I<00:00:29.660> want<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> assumptions<00:00:31.289> when<00:00:31.470> making

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
I want the assumptions when making

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.299 
I want the assumptions when making
cosmetic<00:00:32.759> product<00:00:33.149> at<00:00:33.690> least<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.649> sheet

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
cosmetic product at least for this sheet

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.130 
cosmetic product at least for this sheet
is<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.790> water<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.450> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.660> be<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> most

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
is that water is going to be the most

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.530 
is that water is going to be the most
abundant<00:00:37.550> ingredient<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:39.270> will<00:00:39.450> be

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
abundant ingredient and this will be

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.650 
abundant ingredient and this will be
true<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.960> most<00:00:40.200> surfactant<00:00:41.129> based<00:00:41.660> cosmetics

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
true of most surfactant based cosmetics

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.229 
true of most surfactant based cosmetics
for<00:00:43.200> oil-based<00:00:43.890> cosmetics<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.700> won't<00:00:45.000> be

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
for oil-based cosmetics is won't be

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.290 
for oil-based cosmetics is won't be
really<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> case<00:00:46.309> but<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.460> convenient<00:00:47.910> here

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
really the case but it's convenient here

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.979 
really the case but it's convenient here
so<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.829> box<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.730> put<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.420> ingredient

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
so in this box you put the ingredient

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.689 
so in this box you put the ingredient
you<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.590> you're<00:00:52.890> going<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.100> use<00:00:53.340> leave<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
you that you're going to use leave the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.180 
you that you're going to use leave the
water<00:00:54.030> one<00:00:54.210> there<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.870> water<00:00:55.469> will<00:00:55.739> kelp<00:00:56.039> be

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
water one there and water will kelp be

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.849 
water one there and water will kelp be
calculated<00:00:56.820> out<00:00:56.969> all<00:00:57.629> your<00:00:58.050> ingredient<00:00:58.649> they

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
calculated out all your ingredient they

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.090 
calculated out all your ingredient they
all<00:00:59.039> your<00:00:59.250> formula<00:00:59.640> should<00:00:59.879> equal<00:01:00.180> 100%<00:01:01.100> total

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
all your formula should equal 100% total

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.479 
all your formula should equal 100% total
and<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:03.359> amount<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.350> see<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> batch<00:01:05.189> will

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and the amount you see in the batch will

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.580 
and the amount you see in the batch will
be<00:01:05.519> located<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.540> put<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.869> 500<00:01:07.380> grams

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
be located there so I put in 500 grams

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.950 
be located there so I put in 500 grams
it'll<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> 500<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:08.820> if<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.479> were<00:01:09.600> making<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
it'll be a 500 there if we were making a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.840 
it'll be a 500 there if we were making a
15<00:01:10.380> hundred<00:01:10.500> grand<00:01:10.920> batch<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.460> see<00:01:11.670> it's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
15 hundred grand batch you see it's

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.859 
15 hundred grand batch you see it's
changes<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> 1500<00:01:14.150> will<00:01:15.150> go<00:01:15.299> back<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.659> 500

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
changes the 1500 will go back to 500

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.420 
changes the 1500 will go back to 500
though<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.970> suppose<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.659> had<00:01:18.840> something<00:01:19.080> like

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
though so suppose we had something like

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.830 
though so suppose we had something like
sodium<00:01:20.990> laureth<00:01:22.009> sulfate<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:24.240> were<00:01:24.420> using

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
sodium laureth sulfate and we were using

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.749 
sodium laureth sulfate and we were using
it<00:01:24.960> at<00:01:26.330> 30<00:01:27.330> percent<00:01:27.680> so<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:29.040> type<00:01:29.220> 30<00:01:29.549> in

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
it at 30 percent so you just type 30 in

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.730 
it at 30 percent so you just type 30 in
the<00:01:29.850> percentage<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.409> see<00:01:31.590> what

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the percentage now you can see what

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.460 
the percentage now you can see what
happened<00:01:32.070> here<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:33.119> 30<00:01:33.390> percent<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:34.049> it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
happened here the 30 percent here it

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.469 
happened here the 30 percent here it
calculated<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.310> amount<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.640> need<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
calculated the amount you need so for a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.499 
calculated the amount you need so for a
500<00:01:37.259> gram<00:01:37.409> batch<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.890> need<00:01:38.070> 150<00:01:38.909> grams<00:01:39.240> of

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
500 gram batch you need 150 grams of

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.230 
500 gram batch you need 150 grams of
SLES<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.670> what<00:01:41.790> happened<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
SLES you can see what happened to the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.109 
SLES you can see what happened to the
water<00:01:42.479> here<00:01:42.780> -<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.320> subtracted<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.250> 30%<00:01:44.610> so

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
water here - it's subtracted that 30% so

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.940 
water here - it's subtracted that 30% so
now<00:01:45.240> there's<00:01:45.390> only<00:01:45.509> 70<00:01:45.990> percent<00:01:46.320> water<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
now there's only 70 percent water and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.859 
now there's only 70 percent water and
tells<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.610> how<00:01:47.640> much<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:47.970> need<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.390> water<00:01:48.659> in

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
tells you how much you need to water in

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.310 
tells you how much you need to water in
a<00:01:48.960> batch<00:01:49.140> 350<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.850> could<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.270> go<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.869> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
a batch 350 so you could just go on and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.969 
a batch 350 so you could just go on and
add<00:01:53.189> stuff<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.180> add<00:01:54.799> guar<00:01:57.200> polymer<00:01:58.200> that's

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
add stuff so you add guar polymer that's

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.980 
add stuff so you add guar polymer that's
not<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> NCI<00:01:59.939> name<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.659> get<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> idea

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
not the I NCI name but you get the idea

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.109 
not the I NCI name but you get the idea
and<00:02:01.530> suppose<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.549> one<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.030> at<00:02:03.180> 0.2%<00:02:05.119> now

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
and suppose this one is in at 0.2% now

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.330 
and suppose this one is in at 0.2% now
the<00:02:06.180> water<00:02:06.570> has<00:02:06.659> subtracted<00:02:07.380> out<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:08.129> amount

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the water has subtracted out the amount

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.669 
the water has subtracted out the amount
of<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.550> batch<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.940> calculated<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.780> these

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
of the batch is calculated and these

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.500 
of the batch is calculated and these
still<00:02:10.979> add<00:02:11.160> up<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> way<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.330> would

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
still add up and so the way you would

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.400 
still add up and so the way you would
use<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.170> could

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
use this is you could

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.690 
use this is you could
continue<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:14.040> type<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.580> ingredients

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
continue to just type in ingredients

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.430 
continue to just type in ingredients
these<00:02:17.700> kalampore<00:02:18.420> actual<00:02:18.870> amount<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.260> how

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
these kalampore actual amount is how

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.020 
these kalampore actual amount is how
much<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.740> actually<00:02:20.130> put<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.550> batch<00:02:20.730> which

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
much you actually put in the batch which

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.760 
much you actually put in the batch which
you<00:02:21.210> should<00:02:21.420> write<00:02:21.630> in<00:02:21.810> as<00:02:22.050> you're<00:02:22.350> making<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
you should write in as you're making the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.170 
you should write in as you're making the
batch<00:02:23.000> now<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.690> next<00:02:25.020> column<00:02:25.200> here<00:02:26.180> helps

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
batch now this next column here helps

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.330 
batch now this next column here helps
you<00:02:27.300> cost<00:02:27.600> out<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.200> formula<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:28.980> know<00:02:29.190> how

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
you cost out the formula so you know how

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.540 
you cost out the formula so you know how
much<00:02:29.550> these<00:02:29.820> formulas<00:02:30.270> cost<00:02:30.570> per<00:02:31.080> pound<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.950> do

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
much these formulas cost per pound I do

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.930 
much these formulas cost per pound I do
per<00:02:32.850> pound<00:02:33.150> just<00:02:33.990> because<00:02:34.380> it's<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.430> convenient

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
per pound just because it's a convenient

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.240 
per pound just because it's a convenient
way<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.330> that's<00:02:36.570> how<00:02:36.920> Americans<00:02:37.920> figure

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
way and that's how Americans figure

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.180 
way and that's how Americans figure
stuff<00:02:38.520> out<00:02:38.810> probably<00:02:39.810> should<00:02:39.990> do<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.230> cost<00:02:40.920> per

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
stuff out probably should do it cost per

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.050 
stuff out probably should do it cost per
litre<00:02:41.460> or<00:02:41.750> cost<00:02:42.750> per<00:02:42.840> gram<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.820> pound<00:02:44.820> works

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
litre or cost per gram but pound works

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.320 
litre or cost per gram but pound works
out<00:02:45.240> better<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.490> so<00:02:47.490> what<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.910> way<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.090> work

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
out better so so what the way you work

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.450 
out better so so what the way you work
this<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.840> put<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.680> cost<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.310> raw

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
this is you put in the cost of the raw

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.430 
this is you put in the cost of the raw
material<00:02:51.000> from<00:02:51.210> your<00:02:51.270> supplier<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.080> suppose

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
material from your supplier so suppose

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.100 
material from your supplier so suppose
you<00:02:52.590> can<00:02:52.710> get<00:02:52.800> SLES<00:02:53.490> for<00:02:53.850> 30<00:02:54.510> cents<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.930> pound

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
you can get SLES for 30 cents a pound

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.600 
you can get SLES for 30 cents a pound
you<00:02:55.380> type<00:02:55.740> in<00:02:55.980> 0.30<00:02:56.970> 30<00:02:57.960> cents<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.650> then<00:02:59.460> it

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
you type in 0.30 30 cents and then it

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.150 
you type in 0.30 30 cents and then it
calculates<00:03:00.120> how<00:03:00.300> much<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.590> formula<00:03:02.040> per

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
calculates how much in this formula per

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.010 
calculates how much in this formula per
pound<00:03:02.460> that's<00:03:02.910> going<00:03:03.210> to<00:03:03.270> add<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.780> in<00:03:03.930> this

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
pound that's going to add so in this

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.960 
pound that's going to add so in this
case

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
case

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.150 
case
SLES<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:06.270> adding<00:03:06.540> nine<00:03:06.750> cents<00:03:07.440> per<00:03:07.650> pound<00:03:07.890> of

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
SLES is adding nine cents per pound of

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.120 
SLES is adding nine cents per pound of
formula<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.750> guar<00:03:09.990> polymer<00:03:10.530> costs<00:03:10.950> two

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
formula so the guar polymer costs two

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.550 
formula so the guar polymer costs two
dollars<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.580> pound<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:13.670> this<00:03:14.670> case<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.560> 0.004

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
dollars a pound and this case is 0.004

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.310 
dollars a pound and this case is 0.004
so<00:03:16.800> that's<00:03:17.010> point<00:03:17.370> four<00:03:17.730> cents<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.390> then<00:03:19.110> it

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
so that's point four cents and then it

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.949 
so that's point four cents and then it
adds<00:03:19.500> up<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:19.830> total<00:03:20.340> here<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:21.330> if<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.720> want<00:03:21.900> to

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
adds up the total here so if you want to

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.620 
adds up the total here so if you want to
cost<00:03:22.170> out<00:03:22.410> your<00:03:22.560> formula<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:24.150> can<00:03:24.330> just<00:03:24.510> go

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
cost out your formula you can just go

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.300 
cost out your formula you can just go
through<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.930> put<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.260> cost<00:03:25.500> per<00:03:25.740> pound<00:03:25.980> here

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
through and put the cost per pound here

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.890 
through and put the cost per pound here
this<00:03:26.880> number<00:03:27.300> will<00:03:27.510> calculate<00:03:27.810> things<00:03:28.470> out

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
this number will calculate things out

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.600 
this number will calculate things out
finally<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.080> can<00:03:31.230> put<00:03:31.410> type<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.160> procedure

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
finally you can put type in a procedure

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.610 
finally you can put type in a procedure
and<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.000> specifications<00:03:33.840> here<00:03:34.020> and<00:03:34.320> you<00:03:34.440> can
