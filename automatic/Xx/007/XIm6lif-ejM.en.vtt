 plus 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.360
 Hi, I'm Alejandra CobiÃ¡n and you're in my 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.610
 house that is your house if today everything is in 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.790
 the thing that to me to me to me super 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.040
 surprised this idea I saw it in interest and 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.829
 I loved we are going to make a candle 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.320
 amazing with good silicone we're going to 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.419
 use a glass of candles and very 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.960
 simple of these that you buy in the 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:31.840
 super a silicone gun and sticks 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.420
 Silicone much I like this 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.430
 gun because that's how hard to use and 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.980
 in your heats very well and the only thing 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.640
 we are going to do is start to build as 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.040
 very crazy figures 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.489
 the joke is that they are putting these 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.489
 figures 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.480
 this is fine father to put it with 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.360
 some candles have well done other 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.730
 pastel figures for signs of 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.130
 candy tables you can mix with things 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.290
 super fun but different now 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.500
 we're going to let it dry we're going to let it 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.570
 a little while in the fridge to be able 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.460
 unmold with more you have to check that 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.250
 all the figures have more or less 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.159
 united and are not very distant 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.590
 connections there are many holes good the 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.410
 We put in a little while to the receipt about 15 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.240
 20 minutes and it's more if you leave it a 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.250
 day for another better and now what we're going 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.630
 to do is with this spatula let's go 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.360
 getting little by little 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.299
 so that it is detaching this only 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.820
 You can put on the glass or 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.590
 supplemental there is no way to put it 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.920
 about something else because as I already 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.920
 we started 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.100
 we achieve public life at the end 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.850
 how did you like me I loved 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.730
 that the little thing super parents in 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.750
 different for weddings for such events 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.670
