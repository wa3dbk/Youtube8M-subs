00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.400
 and hello hello and welcome to this 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.179
 tutorial my first job 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.070
 why is the chance so it's all about 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.090
 the tutorial why play here what he 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.099
 then probably already see the title 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.750
 can not attractive games themselves 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.170
 but I found a page where 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.119
 that works well or just where the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.769
 I'm sure that download is safe 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.460
 you are sure my program he suggests 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.140
 every time but I think that is 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.210
 because it's a war game so 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.679
 you can almost every game with 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.219
 dragon I show you first now like 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:40.950
 sports have the side easy www.mc 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.559
 already my whole things www.scake.com 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.760
 playstation 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.210
 if you then on the side of time now 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.489
 minecraft on how far away now even 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.840
 so this downlight is really here 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.940
 latest games are here just to 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.739
 download available then either 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.800
 if the games are too big are the in 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.030
 different shown divided here 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.460
 the game is here for example 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.520
 nor thy suffering here this is the year 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.390
 ends that is for example for the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.090
 fund so i do not imagine games 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.509
 yes, at least looks as good as the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.979
 side then you can let this game 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.299
 format pop ups in the popup blocker 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.700
 probably if you do not have one 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.350
 Buck has consistently wegzuklick yes 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.270
 I download everyone, I would have to do that 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.950
 So therefore realize a one program 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.540
 program would need that winrar 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.340
 I probably do not have that much 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.450
 everyone is also linked means one 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:48.570
 can it then click but to get 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:49.860
 written on this form here 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.250
 go down already looks alone 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.420
 away everything draufklicken what no 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.040
 I do not know what yet 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.850
 But next time is one 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.380
 Town game was down already 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.070
 as they are all players 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.930
 means that really works 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.369
 Also new games like before than that will be 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.649
 always updated and so it was 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.360
 really good and free 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.709
 because you really go down very far 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.329
 go there is just about every 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.040
 I think there is also a game 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.930
 seen yes I say yes for example 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.930
 Just painted forest as I do that now 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.780
 you can find them here quickly 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:31.470
 that's really big 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:33.329
 very big kÃ¶ris alpha 0.12 the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.349
 I believe until this is what I think 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:39.049
 the latest version of the whole popup 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.390
 here 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:46.950
 cool games certain there richter 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.650
 even if here is the forest alpha 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.510
 blablabla ok then he already sees that 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.829
 cover here is still game information for 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.239
 every day i have a day 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.769
 longer by just any players 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.900
 clicked and the downloaded always 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.840
 playing is good or something here 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.750
 just a description of forest here 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.099
 you already do not only exist here 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.439
 a download-link as we most 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.000
 teams several left their mega is the 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.980
 safest site the fastest site 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.290
 I do not want to use pictures upload like that 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.400
 it does not seem like that either 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:20.730
 So say here from november 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.810
 is julias cloud ii 22 bald 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.639
 possible goes on megawatt is safest 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.540
 then you will be redirected here 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.669
 his side adfc so everyone would 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.620
 of you know where the guy a bit 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.659
 You do not get money for it because 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.049
 That's not easy things to do 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.180
 do 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.040
 then you are invited here now the celebration 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.699
 Rhineland you can on your computer 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.659
 download 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:47.129
 I already downloaded the game and 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.889
 yes , we can now click on it 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:53.760
 that's just a rare file for that 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:55.440
 do you need then I could 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.479
 actually show how to do that well 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.609
 still does not bock the heart always 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.810
 we have to prove the knowledge in 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.159
 the comments will also be written 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.389
 still want to have a very hot dance 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.090
 or not explained that in the comics 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.109
 the same winner opened the 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.790
 Enter password 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:13.370
 because you think so shit is easy 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.370
 a fool is not here 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.570
 here would then have somewhere that fits 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.340
 he understand himself hot password that 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.459
 i can also change my description 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.400
 write 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.580
 it's the same for every game 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.770
 play the same here is even extra 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.009
 the company say something again something 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.740
 they need to come for that too 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.280
 comments so you to the best 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.509
 can give 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.759
 we do not want anyone right and they do 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.900
 but since you can always see but the 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.099
 piece does not work because of the 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.020
 Write that for the commercial 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.720
 ignition and on this side anyway 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:57.699
 The password is very influential 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:59.500
 the games could show off 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.820
 do that is I would always go out 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.120
 then you can also manage password 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:10.330
 and then add that as a password 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:12.729
 add and yes and then here is the 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.169
 follow the world so I'll do it 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.000
 now not important marker valuable 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.639
 to start 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.949
 who clicks on it and it works 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:24.460
 finished so I guess that's it 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:27.940
 The nabu is easier for this season 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.400
 because if you want that was there from me 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.470
 has fallen completely open 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.690
 I would like to know 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.789
 it's my first or better 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.320
 a first first video so me 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:43.060
 maybe do other trails if you like 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.650
 it feels good or writes me of the 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.409
 comments not intended to make control 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.060
 if I can or if I can 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.199
 necessarily see if I can do it like that 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.270
 and I like to do tutorial 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.889
 for that too if I am very interested 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:59.969
 so not very interested 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:59.969
 At least that was thank you for watching
