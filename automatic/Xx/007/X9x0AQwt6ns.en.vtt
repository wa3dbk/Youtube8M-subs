 modern and powerful and so what happened

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.609
 computers 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.739
 but for playstation 3 how could you 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.570
 notice in the list of consoles the poison is not

 enough xbox 360 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.879
 this mistake was explained by the director himself 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.220
 companies reporting that microsoft policy 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.790

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.680
 consoles 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.110
 a square enix do not intend to refuse 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.600
 from the main feature of the game because of some 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.790
 the whim of a monopolist getting into the game 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.380

 from performance 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.579
 they don't have a storyline here 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.679
 scroll through the text or listen 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.090
 monotone and sound saver because 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.549

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.509
 actor 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.490
 interesting still to be a surprise for 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.890
 players will become a lack of binding 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.450
 classes you can become a magician tank and 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.670
 even the archers 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.350
 the corresponding weapon is she

 virtual world of trial and book for 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.170
 sorcerers 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.390
 the blade is looking for swordsmen and even classes 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.729
 as such implementations exist on their 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.739
 replacement came the disciplines of magic and weapons 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.399
 for more peaceful purposes ideally 

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:56.500
 will fit 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.299
 the skill of a blacksmith or merchant who 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.110
 studied according to your personal 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.360
 preferences 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.780
 the game world has also changed 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.060
 got up a little less but brighter huge 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.209
 flying islands in the air are snow covered 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.040
 slopes and this is only the beginning well and minus 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.680
 of all this magnificence was the transition 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.560
 between locations as 2 lines each or 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.629
 dragon nest optimization saved the situation 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.600
 thanks to which the download is new 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.680
 the terrain takes place in just a couple of seconds 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.690
 if you want to know the way out 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.790
 ambitions itâ€™s time to go for 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.859
 the next boss in the original version 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.480
 developers used the classic 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.239
 combat 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.849
 subject dependent on individual rollback 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.299
 spells but at the request of fans warmed 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.060
 ribs 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.340
 a battle system was introduced 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.379
 its essence is that the group 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.030
 hero has a certain time to attack 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.280
 the monster after which it starts 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.660
 own counterattack system to 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.250
 Unfortunately, it requires improvements 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.010
 but square enix promised to fix 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.739
 the situation is already to release when the game comes out 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.200
 it's hard to answer this question now 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.239
 there is an active testing project in 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.260
 which has already been attended by 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.060
 million players 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.730
 developers in the absence of serious 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.790
 improvements plans to release a project already 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.190
 on August 25th exactly then will be made 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.500
 recent adjustments and gamers will be 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.120
