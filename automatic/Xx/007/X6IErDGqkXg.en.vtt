00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.619
 I all solo a video and I think this 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.160
 it is the last on the new things 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.590
 of the installation 1.5 pm kpc and good 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.970
 let's go in search of quartz I put them 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.090
 in normal mode 0 survival and we go there 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.040
 let's go to the neder 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.650
 and that's supposed to be turned off 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.690
 turn the portal but good once here 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.920
 in the leader as you see this course is 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.350
 pretty common here is there you see it's very 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.410
 common is I believe as the most carbon 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.970
 common because it 's very easy to find and I 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.860
 fed up with those textures that are spinning 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.410
 Look, I can not find you how to deactivate 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.260
 and you can chop even with a peak of 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.450
 Stone us the expense and everything up with 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.470
 one diamond 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.180
 as you can see and he releases them as before 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.840
 I think you had to sew or something like that 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.840
 like that 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.180
 and as you can see it's very easy to get 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.160
 this block that has no great use and another 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.130
 what they added is that it can be done 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.450
 with this stone as from leider we are going to 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.640
 our oven 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.550
 and let's put this stone 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.720
 so while it was once the fret 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.720
 1 2 3 4 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.910
 and we have these two bricks 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.610
 of the leader that are those of the strengths 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.360
 I do not know what to do while you know 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.360
 they are there 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.450
 the fourth 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.390
 and with four of these we can be these 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.640
 bricks from the leader's strengths and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.039
 because with that we can also do 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.380
 the fences and stairs and this is the great 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.630
 change in a leader that happened and then 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.369
 well these would be the big changes 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.890
 of this new update apart from 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.780
 the patched bucs and so on and so good 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.410
 we would see each other in the next video until 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.709
 the next 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.709
 goodbye
