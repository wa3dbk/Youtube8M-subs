next<00:02:01.560> stop<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.770> extinction<00:02:02.549> though<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.600> all

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
next stop the extinction though it all

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.730 
next stop the extinction though it all
sounds<00:02:04.200> relatively<00:02:04.560> easy
