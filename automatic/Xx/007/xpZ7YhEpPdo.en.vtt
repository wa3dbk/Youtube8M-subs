know we'll see here if it's low and it
still<00:00:36.930> lets<00:00:37.050> me<00:00:37.140> skip<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.469> I'm<00:00:37.530> probably

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
still lets me skip and I'm probably

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.529 
still lets me skip and I'm probably
gonna<00:00:37.950> skip<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:38.579> let's<00:00:38.940> listen<00:00:44.329> give<00:00:45.329> to

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
gonna skip it but let's listen give to

other<00:01:13.229> nifty<00:01:13.530> feature<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.250> our<00:01:14.369> animatronics

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
other nifty feature of our animatronics

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.490 
other nifty feature of our animatronics
is<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.630> built<00:01:15.900> with<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> spring

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
is that they are built with a spring

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.380 
is that they are built with a spring
lock<00:01:16.710> mechanism<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.790> spring<00:01:18.210> lock

lock mechanism this spring lock

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.480 
lock mechanism this spring lock
mechanism<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.170> intended<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> switch<00:01:20.070> off<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
mechanism is intended to switch off the

mechanism is intended to switch off the
electronic<00:01:21.060> parts<00:01:21.360> inside<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
electronic parts inside of the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.020 
electronic parts inside of the
animatronic<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.799> order<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.430> an<00:01:23.520> employee<00:01:23.850> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
animatronic in order for an employee to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.719 
animatronic in order for an employee to
fit<00:01:24.360> inside<00:01:24.540> safely<00:01:25.220> now<00:01:26.220> they<00:01:26.369> wouldn't<00:01:26.670> be

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
fit inside safely now they wouldn't be

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.230 
fit inside safely now they wouldn't be
so<00:01:26.939> bad<00:01:27.150> but<00:01:28.100> since<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.369> still<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.000> an<00:01:30.119> early

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
so bad but since it's still in an early

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.690 
so bad but since it's still in an early
stage<00:01:30.560> there's<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.680> chance<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.400> spring

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
stage there's a chance that the spring

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.940 
stage there's a chance that the spring
lock<00:01:32.880> mechanism<00:01:33.540> might<00:01:33.810> reactivate<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
lock mechanism might reactivate the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.580 
lock mechanism might reactivate the
animatronic<00:01:35.900> with<00:01:36.900> someone<00:01:37.409> inside<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:40.409> it's

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
animatronic with someone inside so it's

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
animatronic with someone inside so it's
important<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.369> keep<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> animatronics

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
important that you keep the animatronics

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.040 
important that you keep the animatronics
away<00:01:43.049> from

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
away from

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.860 
away from
to<00:01:44.380> reduce<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.920> chances<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.520> this<00:01:45.640> happening

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
to reduce the chances of this happening

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.140 
to reduce the chances of this happening
how<00:01:46.870> can<00:01:47.080> you<00:01:47.200> do<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.590> well<00:01:48.400> in<00:01:49.000> your

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
how can you do that well in your

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
could see that being a challenge later

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.060 
could see that being a challenge later
on<00:05:20.930> because<00:05:21.200> you<00:05:21.320> got<00:05:21.440> to<00:05:21.560> find<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.890> right

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
on because you got to find the right

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.890 
on because you got to find the right
time<00:05:22.370> to<00:05:22.430> actually<00:05:22.940> flip<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:23.450> switch<00:05:23.690> because

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
time to actually flip the switch because

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.940 
time to actually flip the switch because
you<00:05:24.050> don't<00:05:24.169> wanna<00:05:24.289> flip<00:05:24.440> it<00:05:24.530> too<00:05:24.620> early

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
you don't wanna flip it too early

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.670
