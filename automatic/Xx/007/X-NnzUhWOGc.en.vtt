00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.910
 pay attention corinthians it seems that 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.620
 it will be difficult on cef 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.620
 I think you're underestimating me. 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.720
 This is what I call a beautiful 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.720
 input 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.579
 Hi, you're connected here on the consoles and 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.249
 brazil games here who speaks to you is the lion 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:31.519
 and today you follow in the history of 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:33.170
 joker joker the joker does me 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.180
 I really enjoyed playing the game through 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.920
 game that is a very easy character of 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.310
 play mainly for those who are 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.930
 beginning because he has power in 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.550
 virtually everything that is button 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.610
 so you will put for example to 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.130
 backwards or backwards half moon 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.870
 with any button and he took the button 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.990
 of the click clear but with practically 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.820
 any button and it does something 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.600
 Other thing it has very easy combos 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.210
 to use 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.210
 are combos that you just need to use the 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.740
 buttons you use as for example a and 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.840
 in yxayx ey 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.420
 it's not that it's not those combos that you 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.310
 have to put forward and back x 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.020
 down I do not know what it is that these 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.580
 combustion a little bit harder 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.280
 for who is starting a little more 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.350
 complicated then the good character and a 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.220
 friendly character to whom it is 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.220
 starting to play 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:47.100
 let's wake up windows mobile and bpi 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.100
 lose 1 you're fired 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.100
 start in the history of the game that 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.009
 that having a fight with the harley was clear 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.090
 that the wackiest couple I think 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.980
 comics are two very characters 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.040
 charismatic the joker today is considered 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.250
 one of the biggest comic book villains 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.950
 It is difficult to understand why because he is 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.230
 a crazy clown no more than that 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.200
 he does not have any superpowers he does not 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.200
 is super smart as lex luthor as 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.810
 that the charism he can overcome 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.350
 any kind of physical power 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.380
 flight or intelligence then it is difficult 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.920
 to understand how this happened. 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.470
 fame all of the game that one thing 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.020
 interesting of course and of course extreme 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.840
 does not heal him I always question myself 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.390
 the joker he is bad business of him is the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.190
 badness or it's crazy that sometimes I 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.160
 I think it's not a bad guy, it's bad. 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.630
 what he has is basically the madness is 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.970
 completely crazy he does not have a 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.640
 certain goal he wants to see the circus 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.959
 catching fire seems like just that 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.269
 what he wants to see I'll try to use a 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.700
 eider here we'll see if I can because 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.769
 I believe she gave me a conversation 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.040
 lazarenta I believe that there will be one 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:21.310
 between a game and the harley that 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.690
 Let's see if it works for us. 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.690
 hurt who loves 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:58.200
 rio de hi be defended built to run 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.200
 you are fired 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.560
 silva 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.530
 in itself the superman joker verse exists to 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.489
 possibility of the game wants to win this 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.340
 combat 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.560
 of course, but also clear that the 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.630
 game he creates a story here so that 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.150
 these combats are viable 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.800
 just as it was in the mortal 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.900
 kombat versus said 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.150
 mortal kombat versus the city the story 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.430
 the radio was cool I liked the 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.070
 the history they have created to make 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.720
 fighting in the deadly kombat verse says so 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.540
 It's the deadly kombat vs 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.720
 It was a gambling drug story that 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.030
 created I found it half badly explained 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.340
 but the exceptional game can not 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.320
 compare indices like mortal kombat 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.020
 versus vice and what are you enjoying?

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.610
 bye 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.639
 the joker failed to raise 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.620
 your clan 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.540
 but still believed that a 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:49.010
 similar organization could succeed 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:51.290
 in his dimension the joker performed a 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.449
 series of devastating terrorist acts 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.790
 terrorize the population and then 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:58.639
 managed to convince the most naive of 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.500
 that it was the only hope of safety 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.479
 new plan the joker started to have 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.000
 millions of members worldwide 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:07.430
 and to commit regular attacks against 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.360
 governments causing chaos in the economy 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.360
 global
