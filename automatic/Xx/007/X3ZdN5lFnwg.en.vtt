we're<00:00:21.500> going<00:00:21.650> to<00:00:21.710> work<00:00:21.950> with<00:00:21.980> rumba<00:00:22.849> clave<00:00:23.029> and

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
we're going to work with rumba clave and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.560 
we're going to work with rumba clave and
downbeats<00:00:24.849> learning<00:00:25.849> to<00:00:26.000> play<00:00:26.150> the<00:00:26.240> two

downbeats learning to play the two

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.960 
downbeats learning to play the two
together<00:00:27.050> learning<00:00:27.800> to<00:00:28.100> incorporate<00:00:28.789> that

together learning to incorporate that

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.120 
together learning to incorporate that
into<00:00:29.180> your<00:00:29.390> body<00:00:29.630> and<00:00:29.930> then<00:00:30.439> learning<00:00:30.710> to<00:00:30.859> move

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
your body in such a way that the feel of

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.400 
your body in such a way that the feel of
the<00:00:33.830> music<00:00:34.250> is<00:00:35.050> incorporated<00:00:36.050> into<00:00:36.260> your

playing of the cloud I want to point out
that<00:00:39.190> one<00:00:40.190> of<00:00:40.220> the<00:00:40.370> important<00:00:40.850> reasons<00:00:41.330> for

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
that one of the important reasons for

being able to play clave a with the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.700 
being able to play clave a with the
downbeat<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:45.440> lock<00:00:46.040> that<00:00:46.339> into<00:00:46.580> your<00:00:46.820> body<00:00:47.089> is

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
downbeat and lock that into your body is

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.860 
downbeat and lock that into your body is
because<00:00:48.710> when<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.640> people<00:00:49.850> around<00:00:50.269> you<00:00:50.600> if

you're<00:01:05.840> much<00:01:06.080> more<00:01:06.350> likely<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:06.770> be<00:01:07.070> stable<00:01:07.640> and

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
you're much more likely to be stable and

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.380 
you're much more likely to be stable and
give<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.479> players<00:01:08.750> around<00:01:09.170> you<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.470> nice<00:01:10.390> bed

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
want to start with just keeping the beat

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.770 
want to start with just keeping the beat
one<00:01:20.000> two<00:01:20.840> one<00:01:21.770> two<00:01:22.010> three<00:01:22.160> four<00:01:23.650> and<00:01:25.780> adding

one two one two three four and adding
the<00:01:26.900> clave<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.230> to<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:27.980> we<00:01:28.790> want<00:01:28.910> to<00:01:29.030> make

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
the clave a to it and we want to make

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.450 
the clave a to it and we want to make
sure<00:01:29.210> then<00:01:29.740> that<00:01:31.630> we<00:01:32.630> feel<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.460> downbeats

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
sure then that we feel the downbeats

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.960 
sure then that we feel the downbeats
very<00:01:34.820> strongly<00:01:35.240> one<00:01:36.230> two<00:01:36.620> three<00:01:37.160> four<00:01:37.580> two<00:01:37.940> two

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
three four then we're going to start on

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.490 
three four then we're going to start on
the<00:01:40.010> three<00:01:40.370> side<00:01:40.670> of<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.030> rumba<00:01:41.330> clave<00:01:41.480> a<00:01:41.630> do

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
the three side of the rumba clave a do

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:59.000 
the three side of the rumba clave a do
it<00:01:42.590> with<00:01:42.740> me<00:01:42.980> one<00:01:43.220> two<00:01:44.030> here<00:01:44.930> we<00:01:45.230> go

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.770 

now<00:02:00.010> you<00:02:00.070> should<00:02:00.640> hear<00:02:01.150> if<00:02:01.300> you<00:02:01.420> put<00:02:01.660> it

so<00:05:32.650> these<00:05:33.650> are<00:05:33.890> things<00:05:34.130> that<00:05:34.280> we<00:05:34.550> do<00:05:34.789> to<00:05:35.150> get

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
so these are things that we do to get

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.690 
so these are things that we do to get
the<00:05:35.720> feel<00:05:36.500> and<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:39.860> kinesthetic

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
the feel and the the kinesthetic

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.990 
the feel and the the kinesthetic
awareness<00:05:41.060> of<00:05:41.900> Chloe<00:05:42.289> in<00:05:42.650> our<00:05:42.919> body<00:05:43.160> until<00:05:43.789> it

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
awareness of Chloe in our body until it

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.310 
awareness of Chloe in our body until it
finally<00:05:44.330> becomes<00:05:45.550> so<00:05:46.550> automatic<00:05:47.270> that<00:05:47.539> we

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
finally becomes so automatic that we

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.950 
finally becomes so automatic that we
don't<00:05:48.470> even<00:05:48.620> have<00:05:48.740> to<00:05:48.890> think<00:05:49.070> twice<00:05:49.190> about<00:05:49.430> it

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960
