waxing out they've also introduced this
new<00:00:49.890> trigger<00:00:50.160> system<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.789> see<00:00:50.969> on

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
new trigger system that you can see on

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.799 
new trigger system that you can see on
the<00:00:51.180> side<00:00:51.329> over<00:00:51.539> there

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the side over there

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.779 
the side over there
and<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.680> does<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.100> allows<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> snap

and what this does it allows you to snap

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.549 
and what this does it allows you to snap
out<00:00:54.000> or<00:00:54.180> remove<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> blade<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.050> replace<00:00:55.320> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
out or remove the blade and replace it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.139 
out or remove the blade and replace it
in<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.800> matter<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.129> seconds<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.969> is

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
in a matter of seconds this is

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.099 
in a matter of seconds this is
definitely<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.780> revolutionary

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
definitely going to be revolutionary

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
quick side now is that this trigger

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.960 
quick side now is that this trigger
system<00:01:04.110> can't<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:04.830> accidentally<00:01:05.460> accessed

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
system can't be accidentally accessed

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.280 
system can't be accidentally accessed
it's<00:01:06.390> not<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> sort<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.900> trigger<00:01:07.110> system

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
it's not the sort of trigger system

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
it's not the sort of trigger system
you're<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.770> be<00:01:07.830> able<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.010> hit<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
tangled up along the boards it's not

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.380 
tangled up along the boards it's not
something<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.760> you're<00:01:11.880> gonna<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.180> able<00:01:12.270> to
