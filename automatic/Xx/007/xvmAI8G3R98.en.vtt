00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.119 
wondering but also with the surface the
type<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.450> service<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:07.079> it<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.739> little<00:03:08.010> bit

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
type of service is it is a little bit

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.920 
type of service is it is a little bit
smoother<00:03:08.519> which<00:03:08.640> isn't<00:03:08.940> downside<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.750> only

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
smoother which isn't downside the only

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.509 
smoother which isn't downside the only
downside<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.319> if<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.680> have<00:03:10.709> maybe<00:03:11.129> sweaty

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
downside is if you have maybe sweaty

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.460 
downside is if you have maybe sweaty
your<00:03:11.670> hands<00:03:11.940> or<00:03:12.150> claiming<00:03:12.360> hands<00:03:12.720> or<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.349> know

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
your hands or claiming hands or you know

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.949 
your hands or claiming hands or you know
you<00:03:14.040> are<00:03:14.220> typing<00:03:14.430> like<00:03:14.700> this<00:03:14.879> whatever<00:03:15.599> and

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
you are typing like this whatever and

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.030 
you are typing like this whatever and
then<00:03:16.110> your<00:03:16.230> wrists<00:03:16.470> start<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:16.890> get<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> little

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
then your wrists start to get a little

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.440 
then your wrists start to get a little
sweaty<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.549> it<00:03:17.670> condenses<00:03:18.030> on<00:03:18.150> here<00:03:18.299> this

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
sweaty and it condenses on here this

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.199 
sweaty and it condenses on here this
will<00:03:18.660> be<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> little<00:03:19.500> bit<00:03:19.650> slope<00:03:19.859> a<00:03:19.980> year

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
will be a little bit slope a year

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.849 
will be a little bit slope a year
slippier<00:03:21.209> slippery<00:03:21.989> err<00:03:22.109> i<00:03:22.410> guess<00:03:22.680> i<00:03:22.799> don't

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
slippier slippery err i guess i don't

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.620 
slippier slippery err i guess i don't
know<00:03:23.040> comes<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.670> little<00:03:23.760> bit<00:03:23.940> more<00:03:24.060> slick<00:03:24.450> and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
know comes a little bit more slick and

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.300 
know comes a little bit more slick and
so<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:25.139> might<00:03:25.319> not<00:03:25.350> be<00:03:25.470> appealing<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.160> you

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
so that might not be appealing to you

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.860 
so that might not be appealing to you
but<00:03:26.519> again<00:03:26.730> that's<00:03:26.940> nothing<00:03:27.269> wrong<00:03:27.569> on<00:03:27.720> their

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
but again that's nothing wrong on their

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.150 
but again that's nothing wrong on their
part<00:03:28.109> that's<00:03:28.260> just<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.530> way<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:28.769> physics

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
part that's just the way that physics

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.009 
part that's just the way that physics
works<00:03:29.370> with<00:03:29.609> moisture<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.209> smooth<00:03:30.480> surfaces

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
works with moisture and smooth surfaces

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.289 
works with moisture and smooth surfaces
so<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.459> pretty<00:03:32.639> much<00:03:32.730> all<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:32.970> had<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.209> say

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
so that is pretty much all I had to say

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.360 
so that is pretty much all I had to say
it's<00:03:33.810> pretty<00:03:34.470> darn<00:03:34.620> good<00:03:34.680> quality<00:03:35.130> if<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.310> the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
it's pretty darn good quality if I the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.589 
it's pretty darn good quality if I the
rate<00:03:35.579> is<00:03:35.790> scale<00:03:35.970> out<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.180> 10<00:03:36.359> it<00:03:36.510> would

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
rate is scale out of 10 it would

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.569 
rate is scale out of 10 it would
definitely<00:03:36.810> get<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.200> 10<00:03:37.440> for<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.889> fact<00:03:38.099> that<00:03:38.250> is

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
definitely get a 10 for the fact that is

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.250 
definitely get a 10 for the fact that is
really<00:03:39.180> durable<00:03:39.480> really<00:03:40.109> high<00:03:40.230> quality

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
really durable really high quality

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.710 
really durable really high quality
materials<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.010> very<00:03:41.430> well<00:03:41.849> made<00:03:42.150> precision

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
materials and very well made precision

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.780 
materials and very well made precision
cutting<00:03:42.959> everything's<00:03:43.620> fine<00:03:43.680> about<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.609> best

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
cutting everything's fine about the best

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.030 
cutting everything's fine about the best
part<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.510> price<00:03:45.780> point<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.290> for

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
part is the price point and for

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.460 
part is the price point and for
something<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:47.849> looks<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.510> good<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:49.079> last

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
something that looks this good and last

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.470 
something that looks this good and last
as<00:03:49.650> long<00:03:49.680> as<00:03:50.010> as<00:03:50.160> durable<00:03:50.489> as<00:03:50.609> it<00:03:50.819> is<00:03:51.030> it's

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
as long as as durable as it is it's

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.470 
as long as as durable as it is it's
surprising<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:52.139> they<00:03:52.290> can<00:03:52.470> market<00:03:52.799> this<00:03:52.950> for

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
surprising that they can market this for

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.059 
surprising that they can market this for
2995<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.810> for<00:03:55.230> something<00:03:55.440> like<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:55.889> said

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
2995 and for something like I said

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.339 
2995 and for something like I said
that's<00:03:56.250> really<00:03:56.579> high<00:03:56.700> quality<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.299> you<00:03:58.230> know

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
that's really high quality and you know

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.020 
that's really high quality and you know
it's<00:03:58.470> very<00:03:58.590> durable<00:03:58.919> it's<00:03:59.579> a<00:03:59.669> really<00:03:59.819> good

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
it's very durable it's a really good

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.780 
it's very durable it's a really good
price<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.510> for<00:04:00.959> something<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.410> know<00:04:01.790> again

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
price and for something you know again

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.430 
price and for something you know again
just<00:04:03.030> awesome<00:04:03.510> product<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.200> i<00:04:04.230> would

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
again 10 out of 10 for me which pre it's

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.190 
again 10 out of 10 for me which pre it's
pretty<00:04:08.459> hard<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.819> meet<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.630> be<00:04:09.720> quite<00:04:09.930> honest

pretty hard to meet to be quite honest

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.530 
pretty hard to meet to be quite honest
but<00:04:10.620> because<00:04:11.400> I<00:04:11.639> carbons<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.150> pretty<00:04:12.299> darn

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
but because I carbons is a pretty darn

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.089 
but because I carbons is a pretty darn
good<00:04:12.599> company<00:04:12.959> I<00:04:13.019> cannot<00:04:13.440> recommend<00:04:13.620> them<00:04:13.950> any

more than I already have so this has
pretty<00:04:16.380> much<00:04:16.530> been<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.799> review<00:04:17.160> for<00:04:17.579> the
