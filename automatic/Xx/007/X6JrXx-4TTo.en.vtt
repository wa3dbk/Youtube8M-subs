00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
and here we have to drive to a self-loop

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:40.190 
and here we have to drive to a self-loop
a<00:01:34.729> little<00:01:35.729> ranch<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:37.340> fetch<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.960> here<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.110> have

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
a little ranch to fetch it here we have

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.679 
a little ranch to fetch it here we have
two<00:01:40.350> carbon<00:01:40.740> fiber<00:01:40.950> legs<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.179> said<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.630> is

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
two carbon fiber legs as I said this is

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.149 
two carbon fiber legs as I said this is
the<00:01:42.990> GE<00:01:43.320> model<00:01:43.939> it<00:01:44.939> has<00:01:45.350> this<00:01:46.350> type<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.679> closure

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the GE model it has this type of closure

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.389 
the GE model it has this type of closure
to<00:01:47.789> get<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> clips<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.659> also<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.159> think

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
to get the clips you also have I think

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.429 
to get the clips you also have I think
it's<00:01:50.549> called<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> GT<00:01:51.360> model<00:01:51.750> where<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.289> have

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
it's called the GT model where you have

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.550 
it's called the GT model where you have
to<00:01:52.590> twist<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.130> grips<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:54.350> personally<00:01:55.350> don't

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
to twist the grips I personally don't

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.319 
to twist the grips I personally don't
like<00:01:55.649> them<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.039> much<00:01:56.250> because<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.939> tend<00:01:57.209> to

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
like them that much because I tend to

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.779 
like them that much because I tend to
rip<00:01:57.869> them<00:01:58.079> too<00:01:58.289> too<00:01:58.709> strongly<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.429> like

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
rip them too too strongly so I like

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.240 
rip them too too strongly so I like
these<00:02:00.060> because<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:01.259> know<00:02:01.409> when<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.770> open

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
these because you know when it's open

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.910 
these because you know when it's open
and<00:02:02.399> when<00:02:03.179> it's<00:02:03.329> closed

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.350 

carbon<00:02:07.920> fiber<00:02:08.160> doesn't<00:02:08.519> really<00:02:08.789> feel<00:02:09.000> cold

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
carbon fiber doesn't really feel cold

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.330 
carbon fiber doesn't really feel cold
sometimes<00:02:09.599> people<00:02:10.229> say<00:02:10.349> oh<00:02:10.380> this<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.739> more

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
sometimes people say oh this is more

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.600 
sometimes people say oh this is more
cold<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.989> just<00:02:13.680> clip<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.160> land<00:02:14.370> and

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
cold and you just clip the land and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:22.460 
cold and you just clip the land and
their<00:02:14.970> legs<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:15.329> this<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:18.620> get<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:21.470> frypot

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
their legs like this to get the frypot

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.190 
their legs like this to get the frypot
in<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.769> correct<00:02:23.010> position<00:02:23.630> as<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:24.989> see

this and then you can lock the legs in

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.879 
this and then you can lock the legs in
the<00:02:53.819> first<00:02:54.060> position<00:02:54.660> all<00:02:55.200> right<00:02:55.230> well<00:02:55.620> this

the first position all right well this
is<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.100> first<00:02:56.280> position<00:02:58.519> second<00:02:59.519> position

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549

and then there's also a third position

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.210

for<00:03:03.120> it's<00:03:03.209> almost<00:03:03.950> completely<00:03:04.950> flat<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:07.220> don't

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
for it's almost completely flat I don't

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.220 
for it's almost completely flat I don't
know<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.579> exact<00:03:08.940> degrees<00:03:09.269> yet<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.780> then<00:03:13.109> you

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
know the exact degrees yet and then you

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.849 
know the exact degrees yet and then you
can<00:03:13.380> put<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.680> center<00:03:13.980> column<00:03:14.220> up<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.859> it's

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
can put the center column up and it's

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.740 
can put the center column up and it's
almost<00:03:17.040> like<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.790> light<00:03:18.150> stand<00:03:18.480> or<00:03:18.599> something

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
almost like a light stand or something

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.909 
almost like a light stand or something
like<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.079> like<00:03:21.049> microphone<00:03:22.049> stands<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.859> it

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
like that like microphone stands so it

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.449 
like that like microphone stands so it
can<00:03:23.220> go<00:03:23.430> almost<00:03:23.940> completely<00:03:24.389> flat<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:26.340> a

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
can go almost completely flat in a

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.599 
can go almost completely flat in a
locked<00:03:26.700> position<00:03:26.790> um<00:03:27.769> well<00:03:28.769> it's<00:03:29.250> really

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
locked position um well it's really

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.300 
locked position um well it's really
really<00:03:30.000> light<00:03:30.230> that's<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.380> first<00:03:31.709> thing<00:03:31.980> for

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
really light that's the first thing for

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.150 
really light that's the first thing for
me<00:03:33.120> that's<00:03:33.329> very<00:03:33.569> noticeable<00:03:34.319> in<00:03:34.620> comparison

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
me that's very noticeable in comparison

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.729 
me that's very noticeable in comparison
to<00:03:35.220> my<00:03:35.870> Manfrotto<00:03:38.570> this<00:03:39.570> leg<00:03:39.840> also<00:03:40.199> has<00:03:40.560> the

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
to my Manfrotto this leg also has the

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.400 
to my Manfrotto this leg also has the
foam<00:03:40.949> padding<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.579> you<00:03:42.449> can

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
foam padding and you can

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.700 
foam padding and you can
twist<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:43.770> off<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.460> believe<00:03:45.350> yeah<00:03:46.350> there<00:03:46.620> we

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
twist this off I believe yeah there we

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.380 
twist this off I believe yeah there we
go

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
go

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.990 
go
and<00:03:48.920> then<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.520> becomes<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:51.950> leg<00:03:52.950> section<00:03:53.730> for

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
and then this becomes a leg section for

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.110 
and then this becomes a leg section for
a<00:03:54.030> monopod<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:55.160> then<00:03:56.160> you<00:03:56.310> also<00:03:56.490> have<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.820> do

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
a monopod and then you also have to do

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.450 
a monopod and then you also have to do
something<00:03:57.480> with<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.810> column<00:03:58.800> over<00:03:58.980> here<00:03:59.250> but

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
something with the column over here but

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.030 
something with the column over here but
I'm<00:03:59.580> not<00:03:59.610> sure<00:03:59.970> how<00:04:00.210> that<00:04:00.240> works<00:04:00.390> yet<00:04:00.890> but<00:04:01.890> as

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
I'm not sure how that works yet but as

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.770 
I'm not sure how that works yet but as
you<00:04:02.190> can<00:04:02.310> see<00:04:02.520> you<00:04:02.670> get<00:04:02.820> this<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.300> single<00:04:03.540> leg

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
you can see you get this the single leg

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:15.560 
you can see you get this the single leg
and<00:04:04.310> then<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.570> extends<00:04:12.470> there<00:04:13.470> we<00:04:13.560> go<00:04:14.420> so<00:04:15.420> the

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
and then it extends there we go so the

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.110 
and then it extends there we go so the
first<00:04:15.600> time<00:04:17.299> these<00:04:18.299> legs<00:04:18.600> are<00:04:18.840> extended<00:04:19.049> so

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
first time these legs are extended so

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.560 
first time these legs are extended so
it's<00:04:21.120> all<00:04:21.480> still<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:21.959> little<00:04:22.230> bit<00:04:22.530> new<00:04:23.390> could<00:04:24.390> go

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
it's all still a little bit new could go

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.060 
it's all still a little bit new could go
a<00:04:24.600> little<00:04:24.840> bit<00:04:25.020> smoother<00:04:25.410> but<00:04:25.560> I<00:04:25.680> think<00:04:25.920> this

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
a little bit smoother but I think this

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.370 
a little bit smoother but I think this
will<00:04:26.600> that's<00:04:27.600> more<00:04:27.900> time<00:04:28.640> there<00:04:29.640> we<00:04:29.700> go<00:04:30.320> as<00:04:31.320> you

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
will that's more time there we go as you

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.760 
will that's more time there we go as you
can<00:04:31.560> see<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:31.950> get<00:04:32.070> quite<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.580> long<00:04:32.820> leg<00:04:33.500> I<00:04:34.500> think

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
can see you get quite a long leg I think

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.810 
can see you get quite a long leg I think
it's<00:04:35.130> something<00:04:35.340> like<00:04:35.910> 1<00:04:36.510> 1<00:04:36.960> year<00:04:37.530> or<00:04:37.560> 52<00:04:39.230> but

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
it's something like 1 1 year or 52 but

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.060 
it's something like 1 1 year or 52 but
yeah<00:04:41.820> I<00:04:42.060> think<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.480> will<00:04:42.600> find<00:04:43.290> for<00:04:43.560> a<00:04:43.590> monopod

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
yeah I think it will find for a monopod

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.070 
yeah I think it will find for a monopod
we're<00:04:44.520> very<00:04:44.970> very<00:04:45.360> light<00:04:45.600> again<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:48.080> it's

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
we're very very light again and it's

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.710 
we're very very light again and it's
really<00:04:49.380> incredible<00:04:49.920> because<00:04:50.570> because<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.600> the

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
really incredible because because of the

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.580 
really incredible because because of the
carbon<00:04:51.930> fiber

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
carbon fiber

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.970 
carbon fiber
I<00:04:52.620> think<00:04:53.010> this<00:04:53.810> tripod<00:04:54.810> only<00:04:55.110> waits<00:04:55.320> for<00:04:55.950> a

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
I think this tripod only waits for a

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.210 
I think this tripod only waits for a
minute<00:04:56.340> revs<00:04:56.550> but<00:04:56.940> it<00:04:57.060> can<00:04:57.240> take<00:04:57.420> 15<00:04:57.840> kilos<00:04:58.230> so

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
minute revs but it can take 15 kilos so

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.240 
minute revs but it can take 15 kilos so
that's<00:04:59.400> more<00:04:59.610> than<00:04:59.730> enough<00:04:59.760> for<00:05:00.030> my<00:05:00.950> 5d<00:05:01.950> Mark<00:05:02.190> 3

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
that's more than enough for my 5d Mark 3

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.990 
that's more than enough for my 5d Mark 3
and<00:05:04.580> 70<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.610> 200<00:05:05.880> plus<00:05:06.360> extender<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.760> I<00:05:08.760> think

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
and 70 to 200 plus extender and I think

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.290 
and 70 to 200 plus extender and I think
it<00:05:09.090> will<00:05:09.270> work<00:05:09.330> very<00:05:09.480> funny<00:05:10.230> I<00:05:10.850> must<00:05:11.850> say<00:05:12.060> these

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
it will work very funny I must say these

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.860 
it will work very funny I must say these
closures<00:05:13.020> here<00:05:13.790> there<00:05:14.790> are<00:05:14.940> little<00:05:15.150> bits<00:05:15.270> well

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
closures here there are little bits well

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.960 
closures here there are little bits well
this<00:05:16.380> is<00:05:16.500> still<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.710> little<00:05:16.830> stiff<00:05:17.250> and<00:05:17.490> this

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
this is still a little stiff and this

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.320 
this is still a little stiff and this
feels<00:05:18.240> a<00:05:18.420> little<00:05:18.450> bit<00:05:18.810> plasticky<00:05:19.820> so<00:05:20.820> I<00:05:20.850> hope

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
feels a little bit plasticky so I hope

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.580 
feels a little bit plasticky so I hope
they<00:05:21.630> will<00:05:21.870> hold<00:05:23.030> but<00:05:24.030> I<00:05:24.060> guess<00:05:24.560> time<00:05:25.560> will

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
they will hold but I guess time will

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.130 
they will hold but I guess time will
tell

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
tell

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.270 
tell
then<00:05:28.140> I<00:05:28.440> also<00:05:28.740> have<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.570> b2<00:05:30.570> ball<00:05:30.870> hat<00:05:31.280> from

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
then I also have the b2 ball hat from

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:40.270 
then I also have the b2 ball hat from
trio<00:05:33.120> bo<00:05:36.530> comes<00:05:37.530> in<00:05:37.680> their<00:05:38.060> nice<00:05:39.060> velvety

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
trio bo comes in their nice velvety

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:48.850 
trio bo comes in their nice velvety
proper<00:05:41.280> with<00:05:43.610> the<00:05:44.610> golden<00:05:45.030> letters<00:05:45.210> a<00:05:45.630> pouch<00:05:45.930> I

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.500 

think<00:05:49.860> this<00:05:50.040> is<00:05:50.190> something<00:05:50.370> like<00:05:50.640> 400<00:05:51.240> grams

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
think this is something like 400 grams

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.250 
think this is something like 400 grams
but<00:05:52.050> you<00:05:52.200> can<00:05:52.380> check<00:05:52.560> photo<00:05:52.950> tip<00:05:53.930> website<00:05:54.930> or

their

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.320 
their
and<00:05:57.800> this<00:05:58.700> looks<00:05:59.180> really<00:05:59.300> nice<00:05:59.600> as<00:05:59.870> well<00:06:01.330> this

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
and this looks really nice as well this

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.320 
and this looks really nice as well this
is<00:06:02.390> my<00:06:02.660> first<00:06:02.930> ball<00:06:03.140> that<00:06:03.290> I'm<00:06:03.560> buying<00:06:03.800> so

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
is my first ball that I'm buying so

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.210 
is my first ball that I'm buying so
that's<00:06:05.330> just<00:06:05.540> a<00:06:05.690> reference<00:06:05.870> here<00:06:06.740> on<00:06:06.890> the<00:06:07.010> side

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
that's just a reference here on the side

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.990 
that's just a reference here on the side
you<00:06:07.430> have<00:06:07.460> a<00:06:08.330> water<00:06:08.870> level<00:06:09.320> two<00:06:10.160> sides<00:06:10.460> one<00:06:10.820> of

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
you have a water level two sides one of

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.300 
you have a water level two sides one of
them<00:06:11.180> one<00:06:11.480> critical<00:06:12.160> this<00:06:13.160> is<00:06:13.220> like<00:06:15.310> plate

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
them one critical this is like plate

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.110 
them one critical this is like plate
it's<00:06:16.580> locked

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
it's locked

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.640 
it's locked
and<00:06:17.300> you<00:06:17.390> have<00:06:17.510> a<00:06:17.570> button<00:06:17.930> on<00:06:18.020> the<00:06:18.140> side<00:06:18.380> here

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
and you have a button on the side here

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.840 
and you have a button on the side here
to<00:06:19.000> get<00:06:20.000> it<00:06:20.090> off<00:06:20.440> with<00:06:21.440> a<00:06:21.590> little<00:06:21.740> smile<00:06:22.100> loop

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
to get it off with a little smile loop

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:32.050 
to get it off with a little smile loop
here<00:06:28.660> you<00:06:29.660> can<00:06:30.070> quickly<00:06:31.070> lock<00:06:31.400> it<00:06:31.550> here<00:06:31.760> into

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
here you can quickly lock it here into

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.230 
here you can quickly lock it here into
place<00:06:32.440> then<00:06:33.440> you<00:06:33.530> have<00:06:33.650> three<00:06:33.890> knobs<00:06:34.070> one<00:06:34.880> for

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
place then you have three knobs one for

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.560 
place then you have three knobs one for
the<00:06:35.390> panorama<00:06:36.250> which<00:06:37.250> it<00:06:37.460> has<00:06:37.640> indications

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
the panorama which it has indications

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.740 
the panorama which it has indications
for<00:06:38.750> here<00:06:39.190> one<00:06:40.190> for<00:06:40.430> friction<00:06:40.910> and<00:06:41.180> one<00:06:41.450> for

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
for here one for friction and one for

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.400 
for here one for friction and one for
overall<00:06:43.360> blocking<00:06:44.360> I<00:06:44.600> think<00:06:45.020> this<00:06:45.140> is<00:06:45.260> the

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
overall blocking I think this is the

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.700 
overall blocking I think this is the
locking<00:06:45.740> football<00:06:46.160> and<00:06:46.540> this<00:06:47.540> one<00:06:48.200> over<00:06:48.500> here

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
locking football and this one over here

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.250 
locking football and this one over here
is<00:06:48.740> for<00:06:49.100> putting<00:06:49.850> friction<00:06:50.330> on<00:06:50.420> it's<00:06:50.600> not<00:06:50.810> much

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260 
is for putting friction on it's not much

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.940 
is for putting friction on it's not much
different<00:06:53.020> then<00:06:54.020> when<00:06:54.230> I<00:06:54.260> do<00:06:54.410> it<00:06:54.620> like<00:06:54.770> this

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:54.950 
different then when I do it like this

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.880 
different then when I do it like this
now<00:06:55.370> it's<00:06:55.550> completely<00:06:55.940> loose<00:06:56.270> and<00:06:56.990> then<00:06:57.740> you

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:57.890 
now it's completely loose and then you

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.670 
now it's completely loose and then you
can<00:06:58.100> stiffen<00:06:58.910> it<00:06:59.240> up<00:06:59.330> quite<00:06:59.780> a<00:06:59.840> bit<00:07:00.080> now<00:07:00.320> it's

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
can stiffen it up quite a bit now it's

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.300 
can stiffen it up quite a bit now it's
almost<00:07:00.830> locked<00:07:01.130> again<00:07:02.410> to<00:07:03.410> have<00:07:03.800> better

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
almost locked again to have better

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.820 
almost locked again to have better
control<00:07:04.550> over<00:07:04.760> your<00:07:05.150> camera<00:07:06.080> well<00:07:06.320> sits<00:07:06.620> on

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
control over your camera well sits on

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.470

the<00:07:07.460> tripod<00:07:08.530> looks<00:07:09.530> really<00:07:09.830> nice<00:07:10.300> for<00:07:11.300> me<00:07:11.420> it

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.480 
the tripod looks really nice for me it

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.200 
the tripod looks really nice for me it
was<00:07:11.750> something<00:07:11.930> like<00:07:12.200> 55<00:07:12.590> euros<00:07:13.160> to<00:07:13.430> have<00:07:14.180> a

Poland and within the EU and this one
was<00:07:22.610> I<00:07:23.060> believe<00:07:25.180> 130<00:07:26.180> euro<00:07:26.600> something<00:07:27.110> like

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.230 
was I believe 130 euro something like

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.930 
was I believe 130 euro something like
that<00:07:27.470> so<00:07:28.370> for<00:07:28.910> a<00:07:28.970> coffin<00:07:29.420> carbon<00:07:30.170> fiber<00:07:30.350> tripod

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:30.940 
that so for a coffin carbon fiber tripod

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.680 
that so for a coffin carbon fiber tripod
travel<00:07:31.940> tripod<00:07:32.150> very<00:07:33.110> light<00:07:33.730> really<00:07:34.730> folds<00:07:35.570> up

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:35.690 
travel tripod very light really folds up

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.530 
travel tripod very light really folds up
very<00:07:35.900> nicely<00:07:36.170> also<00:07:36.680> a<00:07:36.920> monopod<00:07:37.520> with<00:07:37.760> me<00:07:37.940> and

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:38.540 
very nicely also a monopod with me and

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.300 
very nicely also a monopod with me and
this<00:07:38.990> is<00:07:39.110> something<00:07:39.470> I<00:07:39.590> can<00:07:39.770> take<00:07:39.890> with<00:07:40.130> me<00:07:40.280> on

this is something I can take with me on
a<00:07:40.430> plane<00:07:40.730> and<00:07:42.100> well<00:07:43.100> I<00:07:44.380> think<00:07:45.380> it'll<00:07:45.560> work<00:07:45.650> very

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:46.550 
a plane and well I think it'll work very

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.440 
a plane and well I think it'll work very
nicely<00:07:47.500> I'll<00:07:48.500> try<00:07:48.800> to<00:07:48.860> put<00:07:49.610> up<00:07:49.760> another<00:07:50.060> post

when I've played around with it a little
bit<00:07:52.790> more<00:07:53.090> and<00:07:54.580> also<00:07:55.580> after<00:07:56.120> my<00:07:56.240> vacation<00:07:56.810> to
