00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:45.920
 compact soap station cinema

 you playstation vita man and of shorter 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.720
 many of you are probably interested in the question 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.360
 is it worth buying this piece of iron 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.370

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.920

 summer friend right now, we'll tell you everything 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.720
 and show and the conclusions you have already made 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.520
 first we will turn your attention to 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.860
 what sony vse decided to keep up with 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.780
 fashion and found it necessary to stuff 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.700
 its console as much as possible 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.820
 today is already relevant 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.509
 touch screen camera here and dattama 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.310
 gyroscope and in the case of the 3g model slot for 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.899
 sim cards and accordingly the opportunity 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.060
 access to the Internet any wanted asya 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.710
 because time is easy for you 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.479
 sit for five minutes and not check 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.460
 did anyone write you a message or 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.220
 threw off the wall picture with a cat or video 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.360
 green elephant but generally 3g models 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.189
 there may be a benefit 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.350
 like the multiplayer option 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.930
 even when you are not in jerk 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.149
 home, or on the toilet in the McDuck where here 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.619
 and there is a wifi in the case with 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.509
 little big planet vita 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.549
 You can play multiplayer enough 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.469
 just like before everyone 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.420
 level offers you to join 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.540
 people who are at the moment themselves 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.940
 roll your balls on the same level 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.470
 or if you play one you 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.600
 will be notified 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.280
 allow or not allow some 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.160
 stranger join your game 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.350
 sony fight against loneliness is 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.360
 by the way in this thing is something unique 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.460
 what else have you seen anywhere else 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.800
 on other devices this is the back 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.270
 touchpad which works like 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.640
 front touch pad 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.620
 but with the opposite meaning that in 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.230
 some games like little big planet 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.940
 can be integrated into the gameplay that 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.590
 can please fans of innovation 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.780
 interoperability extensions 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.610
 player with a game that now allow with 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.100
 ease to play all sorts of shooters 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.530
 wherever you are near the computer 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.050
 next to the console next to the game 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.209
 automaton whatever doomed place you 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.190
 fate has not brought you always 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.380
 captivate yourself shooting non-existent 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.030
 enemies console home screen at all 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.430
 controlled only by your not fat 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.890
 some dirty fingers buttons there are not 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.170
 used in general and use 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.660
 Sensors in the game depends on the most 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.459
 games and if she forcibly subsided that 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.560
 what will need to be done for 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.170
 passing using touchpads 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.250
 nowhere in this case will not go away 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.170
 little big planet 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.640
 there are moments when you have to press 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.130
 any item on the screen to 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.049
 push it into the wall or press it down 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.940
 back touch panel who would have it 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.739
 push or drag 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.750
 crap what of course probably can not 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.030
 it was making versions for ps3 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.560
 also for some gameplay process 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.310
 games and generally just for personal 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.620
 use 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.450
 console pushed and two cameras one 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.250
 front and 1 rear 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.870
 immediately worth noting that for 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.209
 professional photo hunting 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.459
 not one of them will suit you 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.350
 what's interesting is camera integration 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.630
 in the gameplay process of some games 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.070
 case with little big planet with its help 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.209
 you can create your own 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.010
 stickers 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.019
 which you can then hang on 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.860
 walls in multiplayer mode 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.620
 for 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.640
 sean slobber skim aimless 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.110
 pastime depending on 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.500
 of what you decide to take on 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.960
 her 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.280
 but there are those games that are in real 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.590
 time when capturing on camera 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.090
 the room around you will be on top 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.980
 pictures insert your own 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.380
 the elements are right dynamically changing 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.030
 perspective for this you really will be 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.950
 must be laid out on the surface 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.860
 cards included with the console 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.690
 capture again veterans are not accustomed 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.910
 use anything besides keys this 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.770
 ability is unlikely to catch on but 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.780
 its very presence can be considered quite 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.519
 still funny interesting bullshit which 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.590
 any way will help you seduce your 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.840
 A classmate you invite to 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.760
 home help to do homework well, 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.350
 now it is worth mentioning the most important 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.450
 what basically determines the success 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.720
 does this console issue this console 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.000
 good grafon well you could hear such 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.530
 phrases like almost nothing 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.150
 inferior in terms of playing itself 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.310
 cinema station 3 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.800
 if ancharted on it looks slightly 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.419
 worse than any of them on ps3 then in 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.490
 little big planet this difference and not 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.860
 notice almost like one to one 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.020
 games on this console are on average 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.419
 somewhere and a half mower there is of course and 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.800
 all sorts of mini-games for 70 rubles but 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.410
 the cost of all sorts there fashionable 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.630
 blockbusters sometimes come up to 2000 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.500
 rubles so if you are interested 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.110
 this unit 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.210
 read more about it on the Internet 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.760
 and finally, we'll tell you about the most 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.800
 bloody most brutal most indescribable 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.870
 indescribable survival race 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.479
 which will soon come out and eclipse all 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.700
 of their competitors this genre mud 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.210
 frag armageddon forget about twisted 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.080
 metal 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.080
 in front of you 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.560
 if you're wondering what is it different 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.560
 from simple little big to this I will tell you 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.730
 the only thing than they are in principle similar 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.220
 This is what you can also change 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.440
 the look of your sackboy and forest girl and 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.780
 and still collect translucent 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.340
 spectacle balls and if you are curious about 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.960
 what is it probably amazing 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.790
 wonderful game narrates 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.050
 and what can you do in it 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.290
 at least one of these questions 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.170
 the answer is 1 in this top view game 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.730
 you can ride and shoot cars brutally 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.710
 killing unhappy vehicles 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.900
 you earn extra hay 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.760
 time that sooner or later come to an end 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.390
 and you will write could you have passed the level 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.610
 well done interesting we go further second 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.990
 you have the opportunity to ride 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.970
 in a closed arena with the same 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.580
 happy owners of a copy of this game 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.950
 like you and beat each other shit 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.270
 picking up all sorts of guns on the road and 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.130
 shoot each other 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.680
 dying at the same time at the first hit 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.910
 and almost immediately resurrecting everything near 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.770
 hollow 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.050
 and then doing it all over the new 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.150
 wins the one who more flunked others 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.980
 further as you could have yourself 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.330
 guess you are granted 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.330
 opportunity to participate in 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.830
 Well, in general, taking part in the race 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.160
 you will come across on the way too 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.349
 all sorts of translucent spheres and weapons or 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.270
 same turbo boosters that you can 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:50.250
 use to slow down the rest and 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.970
 get ahead and win in the end 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.720
 the race being in the first place all 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.849
 the above are even possible 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.099
 anything else that I failed 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:00.900
 see waiting for those who decide to purchase 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:03.060

 survival and just racing so what 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.120
 let's sum up 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:08.909
 if you like to play wherever you are 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.729
 were you can safely take to mind 

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:13.530
 if you have children or you have 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:15.870
