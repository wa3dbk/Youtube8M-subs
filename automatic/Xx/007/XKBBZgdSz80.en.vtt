00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
at four point eight gigs you can see you

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.719 
at four point eight gigs you can see you
can<00:01:16.740> easily<00:01:17.040> adjust<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:19.189> warning<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
can easily adjust the warning and the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.410 
can easily adjust the warning and the
limit<00:01:21.030> by<00:01:21.360> simply<00:01:21.840> sliding<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.520> either

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
limit by simply sliding on the either

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.530 
limit by simply sliding on the either
red<00:01:25.020> tab<00:01:25.530> or<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.850> orange<00:01:27.240> tab<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.060> fairly

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
red tab or the orange tab so it's fairly

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.999 
red tab or the orange tab so it's fairly
straightforward<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.650> easy<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.130> use<00:01:33.259> and<00:01:34.259> you

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
straightforward and easy to use and you

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.219 
straightforward and easy to use and you
can<00:01:35.189> adjust<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:37.049> amount<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.250> want

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
can adjust the amount that you want

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.800 
can adjust the amount that you want
fairly<00:01:40.229> easily

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.340 

so<00:01:47.470> I<00:01:47.500> went<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.070> about<00:01:48.430> five<00:01:48.759> gigs<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:50.170> that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
so I went to about five gigs so that

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.950 
so I went to about five gigs so that
means<00:01:50.560> it'll<00:01:50.770> warn<00:01:51.159> me<00:01:51.369> once<00:01:51.850> I<00:01:51.970> get<00:01:52.149> 25<00:01:52.630> gigs

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
means it'll warn me once I get 25 gigs

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.289 
means it'll warn me once I get 25 gigs
and<00:01:53.290> stop<00:01:53.710> me<00:01:53.920> once<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:54.220> reach<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.700> four<00:01:55.000> point

app to view the data it brings you up

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.280 
app to view the data it brings you up
this<00:02:07.929> chart<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:10.090> can<00:02:10.119> also<00:02:10.420> restrict

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
this chart you can also restrict

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.680 
this chart you can also restrict
background<00:02:11.920> data<00:02:12.099> so<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:12.849> not<00:02:13.000> updating

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
background data so it's not updating

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.360 
background data so it's not updating
automatically<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:15.459> tells<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.910> what's

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
automatically and it tells you what's

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.920 
automatically and it tells you what's
foreground<00:02:18.370> usage<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.180> what's<00:02:19.420> background

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
foreground usage and what's background

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.770 
foreground usage and what's background
usage<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.799> you<00:02:21.160> can<00:02:21.340> drill<00:02:22.090> down<00:02:22.120> right<00:02:22.750> to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
usage and you can drill down right to

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.220 
usage and you can drill down right to
the<00:02:23.130> specific<00:02:24.130> date<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:24.730> want<00:02:25.200> with<00:02:26.200> a

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
the specific date that you want with a

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.910 
the specific date that you want with a
specific<00:02:26.590> app<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.810> it's<00:02:28.959> very<00:02:29.200> useful<00:02:29.500> to

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
specific app so it's very useful to

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.600 
specific app so it's very useful to
narrow<00:02:30.220> down<00:02:30.310> what's<00:02:30.790> using<00:02:31.150> your<00:02:31.269> data

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
narrow down what's using your data

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.120 
narrow down what's using your data
what's<00:02:33.610> also<00:02:33.819> good<00:02:34.239> is<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.989> can<00:02:35.170> set<00:02:35.620> your

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
what's also good is you can set your

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.670 
what's also good is you can set your
phone<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.489> match<00:02:36.849> your<00:02:37.090> billing<00:02:37.420> cycle<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.590> if

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
phone to match your billing cycle so if

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.089 
phone to match your billing cycle so if
you<00:02:38.799> change<00:02:39.130> your<00:02:39.220> cycle<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:40.450> can<00:02:40.660> have<00:02:40.840> that

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
you change your cycle you can have that

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.830
