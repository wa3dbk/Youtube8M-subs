00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.130 

on<00:02:11.100> this<00:02:12.100> harness<00:02:12.460> I'm<00:02:12.790> going<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.240> little

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
on this harness I'm going to a little

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.370 
on this harness I'm going to a little
bit<00:02:14.230> more<00:02:14.410> work<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.860> leash<00:02:15.160> is<00:02:15.430> only<00:02:16.380> like

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
bit more work to the leash is only like

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.210 
bit more work to the leash is only like
few<00:02:17.650> inches<00:02:17.800> long

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
few inches long

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.760 
few inches long
now<00:02:19.730> book<00:02:20.150> him<00:02:20.390> too

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
now book him too

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:31.110 
now book him too

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.360 

so<00:02:31.659> obviously<00:02:32.349> he<00:02:32.620> isn't<00:02:32.769> going<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.099> go<00:02:33.190> very

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
so obviously he isn't going to go very

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.440 
so obviously he isn't going to go very
far<00:02:33.700> from<00:02:33.940> me<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.830> he<00:02:35.830> just<00:02:36.069> sits<00:02:36.220> down<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:37.120> I

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
wish that I can't believe back to see

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.759 
wish that I can't believe back to see
more<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.000> them<00:02:40.299> then<00:02:40.900> whenever<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.290> stopped<00:02:41.590> he
