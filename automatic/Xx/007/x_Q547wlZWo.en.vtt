00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.310
 I want to introduce you very much 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.990
 interesting modern technology 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.309
 which is called families 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.609
 very beautiful get products 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:16.869
 clothes 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.009
 what kind of accessories do even the panels do 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.499
 before you live please hryvnia 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:23.499
 live century 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.359
 very pretty 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.169
 made in this technique 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.380
 she is so shaggy and very comfortable 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.210
 and here's a handbag 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.160
 make the technique very simple and possible too 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.460
 use about percentage thousand 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.570
 the clock will show cani who like me 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.720
 interesting in drawing by texture 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.310
 and you can do it out of cotton 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.200
 to make some kind of silk fabric 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.570
 you need to have a good fabric locomotive 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.460
 this is the most important condition therefore our 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.130
 wonderful Russian calico 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.150
 always fits perfectly because 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.560
 they are subtle and about talents master chic 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.860
 so you take a few 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.910
 layers of fabric 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.560
 The beret is based on again fabrics which 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.280
 you are not interested to attack the evening here 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.840
 here she is black here she is so greenish 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.560
 I took purple on you put 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.070
 layers of fabrics which you need so that they lax 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.230
 mothers 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.450
 creating such a volume 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.120
 put the fabric up 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.210
 create top drawing 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.610
 this is a string of linen strictly pursuing 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.159
 oil 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.360
 conversation conditions 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.170
 in response, breaking the thread 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.570
 grow up consider your canvas under 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.790
 magpies 5 degrees in this jar is very 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.799
 will help and no way here in this line 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.760
 are marked 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.520
 hail sm 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.259
 this is 45 degrees 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.820
 where it is necessary here and this here 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.820
 your ruler you put it 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.800
 you put it here 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.980
 this is the line on which is marked 45 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.490
 degrees we put sweat liver and no here 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.930
 so pour so transverse 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.740
 respectively, in the year this edge of the line 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.330
 we will show 45 degrees which 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.199
 we need 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.729
 significant 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:14.469
 band width and chip family 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.909
 these here should be neither more nor 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.799
 less than one centimeter not more 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:19.659
 one and a half 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.819
 here this cancel to us too in this 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.439
 will help 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.819
 here is the line that I led to her 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.819
 I spread this and Andreyev 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.029
 there is a strip that is not needed right now I 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:33.629
 still do 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.719
 even less probably mbk are unchanged like this 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.159
 here's the seas strip family again 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.149
 spend 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:41.729
 and thus 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.729
 Churchill's rage all my canvas 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.309
 are we not or all of our canvas 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.939
 pinned him with pins and now darkening 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.309
 which we pinned 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.179
 we have to flash 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:10.279
 and almost do not have to win in color 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:12.759
 along each line checks all fabric sew 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.759
 through 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:18.069
 this is where our squad comes in handy 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.069
 magic point 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:28.479
 next striped 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.559
 don't do everything in one direction 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.489
 niche and the Terek unfolds in 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.879
 different otherwise your chamber will shine 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.799
 one relative to the other here you are 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.799
 in this direction now we return back 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.439
 to her must be at least six seven 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.879
 layers otherwise your families will be very 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.019
 liquid 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.849
 if you use kokoity 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.739
 silk fabric which is very good 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.299
 bursting 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.379
 then you will have the sensation of massaging 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.159
 To her 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.449
 Now we are actually creating with you 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.449
 new textile canvas 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.440
 he had tissues such 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.980
 and we are creating new fabrics 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.980
 fabrics 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.669
 now here we are all affected by this 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.860
 bands scores now we do not affect them 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.280
 the bottom layer according to information from 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.280
 we cut 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.720
 that's what else you need rags like 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.689
 brought and so 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.689
 all our canvas we cut 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:57.680
 here 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.539
 that's how we cut it 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:00.830
 and now 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.949
 but married here is what to do to pat it 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.080
 and so pretty 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.860
 tough 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.930
 just very tough 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.379
 already passed see 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.379
 like a russian woman 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.580
 Well, if only to pull 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.129
 as it should 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:24.369
 what ultimately im when we're all 

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:26.739
 absolutely we should get this 

00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:29.589
 here 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:31.009
 this form of cosmetic bag 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.129
 specially here when with flower a 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:34.779
 here she will be shaggy
