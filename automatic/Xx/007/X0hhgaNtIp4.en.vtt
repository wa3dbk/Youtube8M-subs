in<00:00:08.240> this<00:00:08.480> video<00:00:08.840> I'm<00:00:09.139> going<00:00:09.380> to<00:00:09.559> show<00:00:09.740> you<00:00:09.799> how

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:10.280> use<00:00:10.639> the<00:00:11.000> constraint<00:00:11.860> orbit<00:00:13.180> you<00:00:14.180> know

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.270 
to use the constraint orbit you know

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.369 
to use the constraint orbit you know
when<00:00:14.450> you're<00:00:14.600> especially<00:00:15.139> when<00:00:15.260> you're

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
when you're especially when you're

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.650 
when you're especially when you're
working<00:00:15.650> on<00:00:15.980> 3d<00:00:17.380> the<00:00:18.380> orbit<00:00:19.279> is<00:00:19.490> really<00:00:19.910> useful

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
working on 3d the orbit is really useful

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.150 
working on 3d the orbit is really useful
here<00:00:20.690> so<00:00:21.050> that<00:00:21.199> you<00:00:21.350> can<00:00:21.529> observe<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.900> 3d

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
here so that you can observe the 3d

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.210 
here so that you can observe the 3d
object<00:00:25.160> that<00:00:25.339> you<00:00:25.490> created<00:00:26.380> so<00:00:27.380> you<00:00:27.439> can<00:00:27.679> you

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
object that you created so you can you

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.759 
object that you created so you can you
can<00:00:28.400> use<00:00:28.609> the<00:00:28.820> orbit<00:00:29.269> by<00:00:29.509> going<00:00:29.869> to<00:00:30.080> view<00:00:30.109> and

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
can use the orbit by going to view and

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.840 
can use the orbit by going to view and
click<00:00:31.099> on<00:00:31.310> constraint<00:00:32.029> orbit<00:00:32.810> or<00:00:33.850> shortcut

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
click on constraint orbit or shortcut

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.520 
click on constraint orbit or shortcut
key<00:00:35.090> out<00:00:35.360> X<00:00:37.090> so<00:00:38.090> if<00:00:38.300> I<00:00:38.449> click<00:00:38.690> on<00:00:38.840> constraint

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
key out X so if I click on constraint

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.740 
key out X so if I click on constraint
orbit<00:00:40.300> and<00:00:41.300> now<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.129> cursor<00:00:43.129> becomes<00:00:43.550> an<00:00:44.059> icon

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
orbit and now the cursor becomes an icon

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.569 
orbit and now the cursor becomes an icon
that<00:00:45.190> rotates<00:00:46.190> right<00:00:46.719> so<00:00:47.719> now<00:00:47.870> if<00:00:48.079> I<00:00:48.320> click<00:00:49.039> and

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
that rotates right so now if I click and

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.569 
that rotates right so now if I click and
drag<00:00:49.640> going<00:00:50.300> to<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.660> right<00:00:52.149> this<00:00:53.149> one<00:00:53.359> goes<00:00:53.629> up

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
drag going to the right this one goes up

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.319 
drag going to the right this one goes up
and<00:00:55.579> down<00:00:58.359> now<00:00:59.359> but<00:00:59.629> while<00:01:00.079> I'm<00:01:00.230> doing<00:01:00.260> this

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
and down now but while I'm doing this

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.660 
and down now but while I'm doing this
hold<00:01:02.329> down<00:01:02.480> your<00:01:02.629> Shift<00:01:03.489> key<00:01:04.750> and<00:01:06.490> this<00:01:07.490> one

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
hold down your Shift key and this one

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.980 
hold down your Shift key and this one
will<00:01:07.850> appear<00:01:07.970> right<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.800> as<00:01:10.340> you<00:01:10.520> can<00:01:10.670> see

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
will appear right so as you can see

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.730 
will appear right so as you can see
there<00:01:11.990> are<00:01:12.640> four<00:01:13.640> circles<00:01:14.420> which<00:01:15.320> means<00:01:15.620> to

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
there are four circles which means to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.930 
there are four circles which means to
say<00:01:15.950> if<00:01:16.550> I<00:01:16.760> go<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.030> this<00:01:17.360> circle<00:01:17.930> here<00:01:18.760> on<00:01:19.760> the

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
say if I go to this circle here on the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.380 
say if I go to this circle here on the
right<00:01:20.150> side<00:01:20.480> and<00:01:21.020> I<00:01:21.110> click<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:21.950> drag<00:01:22.010> now<00:01:22.640> I

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
right side and I click and drag now I

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.930 
right side and I click and drag now I
can<00:01:23.780> rotate<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.730> object<00:01:27.430> now<00:01:28.430> while<00:01:28.700> holding

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
can rotate the object now while holding

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.110 
can rotate the object now while holding
down<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.420> shift<00:01:29.690> key<00:01:29.870> if<00:01:30.800> I<00:01:31.010> click<00:01:31.310> on<00:01:31.520> this

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
down the shift key if I click on this

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.100 
down the shift key if I click on this
one<00:01:32.180> here<00:01:32.750> on<00:01:32.900> top<00:01:33.200> now<00:01:33.980> I<00:01:34.010> can<00:01:34.400> bring<00:01:34.700> it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
one here on top now I can bring it

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.620 
one here on top now I can bring it
rotate<00:01:36.110> it<00:01:36.140> going<00:01:36.650> this<00:01:36.830> way<00:01:37.100> now<00:01:39.370> if<00:01:40.370> you<00:01:41.060> go

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
rotate it going this way now if you go

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.820 
rotate it going this way now if you go
outside<00:01:41.990> of<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.770> circle<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:44.380> watch<00:01:45.380> if<00:01:45.680> I

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
outside of the circle and watch if I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.510 
outside of the circle and watch if I
click<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.340> go<00:01:46.640> like<00:01:46.820> this<00:01:47.740> now<00:01:48.740> it<00:01:49.010> rotates

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
click and go like this now it rotates

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.780 
click and go like this now it rotates
that<00:01:49.850> way<00:01:50.680> okay<00:01:51.970> so<00:01:52.970> now<00:01:53.120> this<00:01:53.420> way<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.920> then

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
that way okay so now this way and then

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.500 
that way okay so now this way and then
this<00:01:55.970> way<00:01:56.030> here<00:01:57.280> now<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:58.340> can<00:01:58.610> also<00:01:58.820> click

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
this way here now you can also click

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.680 
this way here now you can also click
inside<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:00.110> circle<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.920> move<00:02:04.130> around<00:02:04.630> but<00:02:05.630> I

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
inside a circle to move around but I

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.229 
inside a circle to move around but I
notice<00:02:06.080> if<00:02:06.230> I<00:02:06.350> do<00:02:06.410> that<00:02:06.800> I<00:02:07.070> lose<00:02:07.730> control<00:02:07.910> of

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
notice if I do that I lose control of

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.640 
notice if I do that I lose control of
the<00:02:08.450> object<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.709> movement<00:02:10.099> of<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.340> object<00:02:11.650> so

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
the object the movement of the object so

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.910 
the object the movement of the object so
it's<00:02:13.489> best<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:14.090> use<00:02:14.379> this<00:02:15.379> one<00:02:15.650> here

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.550 

I'm<00:02:19.920> gonna<00:02:20.100> fix<00:02:20.490> this<00:02:20.640> one<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.990> then<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.350> can

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
I'm gonna fix this one and then you can

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.870 
I'm gonna fix this one and then you can
rotate<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.370> go<00:02:23.610> outside<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.810> circle

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
rotate so you go outside of the circle

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.740 
rotate so you go outside of the circle
this<00:02:26.880> way<00:02:28.520> you're<00:02:29.520> actually<00:02:29.940> not<00:02:30.120> rotating

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
this way you're actually not rotating

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.810 
this way you're actually not rotating
the<00:02:30.870> object<00:02:30.990> you're<00:02:31.440> just<00:02:31.650> rotating<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.220> view

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
the object you're just rotating the view

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.380 
the object you're just rotating the view
so<00:02:34.520> here<00:02:36.710> you<00:02:37.710> can<00:02:37.740> also<00:02:38.250> while<00:02:38.850> doing<00:02:39.180> this

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
so here you can also while doing this

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.350 
so here you can also while doing this
while<00:02:40.290> you're<00:02:40.470> holding<00:02:41.340> down<00:02:41.490> your<00:02:41.550> Shift<00:02:42.000> key

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
while you're holding down your Shift key

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.360 
while you're holding down your Shift key
you<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.110> also<00:02:43.500> press<00:02:44.310> your<00:02:44.580> middle<00:02:44.850> button<00:02:45.209> to

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
you can also press your middle button to

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.180 
you can also press your middle button to
pan<00:02:47.600> so<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.630> have<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.140> release<00:02:49.440> your<00:02:49.709> shift

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
pan so you have to release your shift

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.250 
pan so you have to release your shift
key<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:50.700> then<00:02:51.390> hold<00:02:51.690> down<00:02:51.780> your<00:02:52.050> middle

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
to do to go back to your orbit instead

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.250 
to do to go back to your orbit instead
of<00:02:59.670> going<00:03:00.090> view<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.810> then<00:03:00.930> click<00:03:01.140> on

shift don't release then this one will

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:26.250 
shift don't release then this one will
appear

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.590 

then<00:03:27.260> release<00:03:27.620> your<00:03:27.680> shift<00:03:28.280> key<00:03:28.580> then<00:03:29.210> you<00:03:29.300> can

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
then release your shift key then you can

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.160 
then release your shift key then you can
