00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.690

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.479

 not too much stress I'm going to make look 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.479
 a hope i have something to do well then go 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.589
 We now get to work with it after the face 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:55.970
 eyes as always with a 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.170
 eyeshadow base 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.330
 when you use eyeshadow from it 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.339
 keep your eye shadow last longer and 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.960
 the more intense in color we let god me 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.150
 eye shadow base to do I do not know 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.040
 why but that happened and then saw 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.510
 I also really sometimes I think it is real 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.820
 necessary because of course you don't really 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.460
 it works but it really works 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.510
 well with me anyway then 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.070
 when he went into the real me in the 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:23.480
 lines and it didn't look like it 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:25.460
 eye shadow base under the eye shadow as 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.410
 first I use this h &amp; m pallet 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.940
 This kind of curious eyeshadow palette in 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.950
 dust minute 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.600
 I go this soft color one last 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.290
 put in the box all over my 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.290
 moving eyelid 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.190
 then I take this completely eye shadow 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.650
 number 53 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.230
 this is a matte dark brown color and 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.640
 I will turn it on in the arcade arch 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.650
 this is going to try to be as sharp as possible 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.180
 do this by means of a crease brush in 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.920
 this is just a very pointed brush 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:58.390
 well and yes my concerts and he in 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.390
 the arcade arch is easier to reach 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.050
 what the outside 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.050
 I connect the line 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.130
 then I go with something to tap 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.170
 tapered blending brush this is from 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.489
 mac this is number two must be 17 in it 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.440
 really the nicest blending brush is there 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.620
 I go the brown color 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.250
 also apply a little bit in you above 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.250
 and blur 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.799
 I now take this beautiful eye shadow 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.170
 from catrice this is the liquid metal 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.230

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.879
 and this is new eye shadows and well 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.040
 yes the colors of the shine is real 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.299
 insanely beautiful I go with the small 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.980
 but you can also use a regular brush 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.049
 I prefer using eye shadow brush 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.360
 something flatter and she feels and 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.819
 nice flat brush 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.540
 he has purple hairs that I will go now 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.700
 apply 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.700
 here in the middle of moving eyelid 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:15.170
 and along the lower lash so that I 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.879
 put it in the middle 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.700
 the light never falls to my eyes and seems 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.260
 also with it bigger and more open to it 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.269

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.480

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:34.519
 I put it in the mini's corners and what 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.109
 a little video is that i wipe away with 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.200
 the foundation brush that I used for this 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.859
 previously have used for my foundation 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.549
 to be sure 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.319
 I take the eye shadows a little 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.849
 I will still go with the other side of the box 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.590

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.599

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.260
 Well ensure your foundation all day 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.180

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.890

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.130
