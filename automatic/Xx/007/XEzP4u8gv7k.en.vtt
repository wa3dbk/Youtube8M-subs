giant chunk which is first I thought was

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.370 
giant chunk which is first I thought was
just<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.730> chunk<00:01:22.030> of<00:01:22.120> the<00:01:22.270> runner<00:01:22.450> but<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.140> turns

just a chunk of the runner but it turns

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.860 
just a chunk of the runner but it turns
out<00:01:23.530> this<00:01:23.680> is<00:01:23.830> actually<00:01:24.040> a<00:01:24.580> little<00:01:25.300> stand<00:01:25.630> that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
out this is actually a little stand that

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.020 
out this is actually a little stand that
you<00:01:25.990> can<00:01:26.170> just<00:01:26.440> one<00:01:26.650> store<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.610> fists<00:01:27.910> you're

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
you can just one store the fists you're

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.640 
you can just one store the fists you're
not<00:01:28.180> using<00:01:28.540> on<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.880> then<00:01:31.000> once<00:01:31.150> you<00:01:31.270> assemble

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
not using on and then once you assemble

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.190 
not using on and then once you assemble
everything<00:01:32.650> on<00:01:32.980> to<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.340> body<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:34.200> can

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
everything on to the body you can

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.160 
everything on to the body you can
actually<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.590> actually<00:01:35.620> fits<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.220> heels<00:01:36.520> so

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
actually it actually fits the heels so

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.210 
actually it actually fits the heels so
because<00:01:38.170> it's<00:01:38.320> so<00:01:38.380> small<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:38.800> can<00:01:39.010> put<00:01:39.130> the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
because it's so small you can put the

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.070 
because it's so small you can put the
heels<00:01:39.400> of<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:39.610> figure<00:01:39.850> in<00:01:39.970> there<00:01:40.180> and<00:01:40.390> have<00:01:41.050> a

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
heels of the figure in there and have a

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.969 
heels of the figure in there and have a
little<00:01:41.290> kind<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:42.010> support<00:01:42.400> stand<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.890> he

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
little kind of support stand so he

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.670 
little kind of support stand so he
doesn't<00:01:45.250> wobble<00:01:45.400> off<00:01:45.610> your<00:01:45.760> shelf<00:01:46.680> which

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
doesn't wobble off your shelf which

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.810 
doesn't wobble off your shelf which

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
which I thought was really neat that

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.670 
which I thought was really neat that
they<00:01:48.940> included<00:01:49.390> just<00:01:49.960> a<00:01:50.080> little<00:01:50.290> piece<00:01:50.500> of<00:01:50.530> the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
they included just a little piece of the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.740 
they included just a little piece of the
runner<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:51.040> cut<00:01:51.220> off<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.610> you<00:01:52.270> say<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:52.630> don't

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
runner you cut off and you say you don't

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.630 
runner you cut off and you say you don't
have<00:01:52.900> to<00:01:52.990> worry<00:01:53.290> about<00:01:53.350> losing<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.950> fists<00:01:54.340> or

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
have to worry about losing the fists or

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.300 
have to worry about losing the fists or
him<00:01:55.510> falling<00:01:55.840> over<00:01:56.080> on<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.560> display<00:01:56.979> so<00:01:57.190> you<00:01:57.220> can

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
him falling over on a display so you can

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.750 
him falling over on a display so you can
see<00:01:57.550> think<00:01:57.870> really<00:01:58.870> really<00:01:59.170> small<00:01:59.470> a<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.250> little

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.580 
see think really really small a a little
bigger<00:02:00.970> than<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.150> Lego<00:02:01.330> figure<00:02:01.420> well<00:02:02.409> I'm

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
bigger than a Lego figure well I'm

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.560 
bigger than a Lego figure well I'm
definitely<00:02:02.799> bigger<00:02:03.159> than<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.310> Lego<00:02:03.520> figure<00:02:03.570> but

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
definitely bigger than a Lego figure but

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.920 
definitely bigger than a Lego figure but
a<00:02:04.780> smaller<00:02:05.290> action<00:02:06.130> figure<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.750> thing

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
a smaller action figure for the thing

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.419 
a smaller action figure for the thing
and<00:02:08.049> slightly<00:02:08.470> super<00:02:08.860> deformed<00:02:09.129> but<00:02:09.310> not

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
and slightly super deformed but not

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.720 
and slightly super deformed but not
quite<00:02:09.670> as<00:02:10.319> disproportioned<00:02:11.319> as<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.830> real

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
quite as disproportioned as the real

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.160 
quite as disproportioned as the real
deform<00:02:13.120> figure<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.569> reviewed<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.049> other

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
deform figure that I reviewed the other

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.490 
deform figure that I reviewed the other
day<00:02:14.379> but<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.099> here<00:02:15.250> he<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.400> with<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.549> quarter

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
the real deform and there's a little

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:22.949 
the real deform and there's a little
plug<00:03:22.120> on<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.329> back<00:03:22.480> if<00:03:22.599> you<00:03:22.629> want<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.810> use<00:03:22.930> a
