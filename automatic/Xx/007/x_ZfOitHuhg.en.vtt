00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.010
 hello very good let's see in this video 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.770
 tutorial how to solve a problem that 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.840
 it's happening quite frequently and 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.380
 especially when we handle windows 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.689
 server 2008 inside virtual machines 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:29.070
 where we add and remove cards 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.510
 network I remember well to set the theme 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.760
 it's the next microsoft has 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.440
 registered this little problem of 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.610
 agreement and the solution it gives is the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.379
 next set we're going to put the have 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.629
 already put the situation in agreement 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.110
 I want you to observe how we have in 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.590
 actually a card 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.830
 let's see it so you can see it fixed 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.350
 you see we have a single network card in 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.930
 the system but it helps 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.040
 notice that I have been adding cards 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:04.070
 I've been removing them from the network 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.930
 and as you can see this has this 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.510
 network card has an ip address and 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.670
 I will try to place another ip address 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.770
 different agreement and so go to 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.230
 understand perfectly because sure 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.780
 that you ever have happened right in his 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:21.850
 we give properties we are going to change the 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:25.570
 ip address for example by a 105 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.360
 it's worth 105 here 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:33.350
 about 105 11 we accept 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.370
 and notice us the address ip 192 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.920
 168 105 11 what specific for this 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.190
 order is already assigned to another adapter 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.790
 network and gives us the name if we give 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.160
 account 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.470
 that network card we no longer the 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.060
 we have in the system of agreement 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.590
 so what happens then? 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.510
 it happens that here we would start having a 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.280
 problem because this ip address does not the 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.830
 we could place because it has another 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.590
 adapter and then even if we tell you 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.900
 that we want to remove that configuration from 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.780
 that adapter we could continue to have 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.670
 problems agree and normal would be 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.370
 tell him yes he will remove that 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.610
 agreement setting but this 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.400
 problem could continue to persist 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.870
 so what are we going to do 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.140
 Well, what we are going to do is very easy 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.209
 really remove those adapters that 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.640
 although we do not see them in the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.590
 window of network connections those 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.020
 cards are still on windows server 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.620
 2008 and therefore what we are going to do 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.520
 is to remove them from the system in accordance 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.090
 I 'm going to cancel I 'm going to cancel 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:46.420
 canceled this other window and see if 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.160
 I'm going to start control panel 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.890
 I open the device manager 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.350
 I open the branch of network adapters and 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.960
 you see only one appears then what 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.230
 what we are going to do is show everyone 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.330
 the devices even those that are not 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.100
 although not present in 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.500
 agreement as are those other cards of 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.200
 network that are really there are defined 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.420
 inside the server 2008 and what I want 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.910
 to do is to clean it I want to remove those 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.370
 network cards that are no longer 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.330
 agreement well as we do it then 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.720
 very easy 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.270
 let's catch and we 're going to start 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.900
 symbol of the system 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.820
 and the first thing we're going to do is 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.350
 activate a variable where we are going to 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.360
 say that in this case show the 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.290
 devices do not present that variable 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.290
 we're going to activate it with set and then 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.290
 mgr 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:54.260
 show script under none present underscore 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:57.500
 of vice is equal to 1 of agreement we press 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.840
 intro and now since we're here in 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.550
 command mode let's tell you that 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.780
 start the device manager 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.480
 of m &amp; g 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.709
 mt point 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.150
 of msc press intro here we have the 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:20.720
 device administrator 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.720
 now let's open to see do not appear 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.520
 well in this case as we can check 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.070
 they do not appear because what you have to 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.590
 activate is the visibility of 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.300
 devices not present then 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:39.770
 we open the menu see and select 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.770
 show hidden devices 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.409
 well in this case as you can check 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.149
 we have to fix 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:53.819
 that card and this card is no longer 

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:56.399
 agreement you see it is in a light gray of 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:58.349
 agreement then those devices that 

00:04:56.399 --> 00:05:00.989
 they are in light gray as they are connection 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.269
 intel network and the one that ends in two and in 

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:04.709
 three that we have to remove them and you will see 

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:06.929
 as now we no longer have problems for 

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:11.270
 place the ip address that we were trying 

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:13.420
 then secondary button and uninstall 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.360
 we accept 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:20.260
 and we take the other and secondary button and 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.170
 uninstall and accept 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.990
 Well, now with this we have been 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.120
 clean and cleaned network cards that 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.900
 they were not in the system anymore but he 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.660
 I kept recording that information 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.270
 we close 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.900
 we closed this other window and now 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.390
 we will try to modify another 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.270
 once from the properties the address 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.190
 ip that before there were not two problems 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.620
 then we enter the properties and you 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.449
 let's put the 105 that was the one 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.539
 we tried before 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:58.150
 in agreement we accept and as you can 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:01.150
 check what you see now it does not give the 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.949
 error of agreement very well remember that 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.169
 This is a simple solution to be able to 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:07.659
 eliminate those network cards that 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:11.080
 really are no longer in the system and 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:13.240
 they give us ip address problems 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.069
 agreement and then this then what we 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.080
 can give is a great problems of 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.870
 head when we start to install 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.029
 active directories with themes of fs or 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.759
 replication and etcetera according 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:29.550
 then fix it as soon as possible 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:29.550
 in this way, come on, see you later
