00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.920 

so<00:00:17.550> here's<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.740> side-on<00:00:19.740> leak<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:20.820> my<00:00:21.090> squat

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
so here's a side-on leak for my squat

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.640 
so here's a side-on leak for my squat
I've<00:00:22.670> formed<00:00:23.670> my<00:00:23.850> body<00:00:24.150> position<00:00:24.390> now<00:00:25.170> before

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
I've formed my body position now before

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.019 
I've formed my body position now before
in<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> past<00:00:26.070> whenever<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.460> was<00:00:26.520> doing<00:00:26.730> squats

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
in the past whenever I was doing squats

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.660 
in the past whenever I was doing squats
I<00:00:27.210> had<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> serious<00:00:28.230> amount<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.160> winking

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
I had a serious amount of but winking

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.670 
I had a serious amount of but winking
going<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.090> since<00:00:30.930> they<00:00:31.110> have<00:00:31.349> been<00:00:31.380> doing

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
going on since they have been doing

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.650 
going on since they have been doing
front<00:00:32.160> squats<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.000> as<00:00:33.150> you<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.330> see<00:00:33.449> there's

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
front squats and as you can see there's

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.090 
front squats and as you can see there's
still<00:00:33.900> a<00:00:33.930> bit<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> butt<00:00:34.650> wink<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.920> think

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
still a bit of a butt wink I think

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.369 
still a bit of a butt wink I think
that's<00:00:35.220> a<00:00:35.309> natural<00:00:35.570> amount<00:00:36.570> there<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.050> my

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
that's a natural amount there but my

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.880 
that's a natural amount there but my
goodness<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.540> vastly<00:00:39.540> improved<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
goodness that is vastly improved and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.910 
goodness that is vastly improved and
I'll<00:00:41.879> put<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> link<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.080> the<00:00:43.110> description<00:00:43.350> here

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
I'll put a link in the description here

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.770 
I'll put a link in the description here
where<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> put<00:00:44.430> my<00:00:44.550> first<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.449> type<00:00:45.629> in

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
where I put my first and just type in

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.399 
where I put my first and just type in
but<00:00:46.170> winking<00:00:46.710> our<00:00:47.160> dog's<00:00:47.519> butt<00:00:47.820> wink<00:00:48.409> and

but winking our dog's butt wink and

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.390 
but winking our dog's butt wink and
you'll<00:00:50.190> see<00:00:50.629> that<00:00:51.629> before<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.500> he's<00:00:52.650> really

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
you'll see that before it he's really

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.789 
you'll see that before it he's really
really<00:00:53.640> curved<00:00:54.089> at<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.479> very<00:00:54.659> bottom<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.290> the

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:55.799 
really curved at the very bottom of the

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:58.310 
really curved at the very bottom of the
of<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.430> squat<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:57.269> definitely<00:00:57.690> front<00:00:57.960> squat

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
of the squat but definitely front squat

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.829 
of the squat but definitely front squat
here<00:00:58.650> has<00:00:59.010> massively<00:00:59.820> improved<00:01:00.420> out<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.720> that

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
here has massively improved out of that

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.420 
here has massively improved out of that
where<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.049> camera<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.650> it<00:01:01.769> a<00:01:01.799> better<00:01:02.100> or<00:01:02.400> a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
where the camera is it a better or a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.520 
where the camera is it a better or a
different<00:01:03.150> angle<00:01:03.269> where<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.049> can't<00:01:04.320> really

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
different angle where you can't really

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280 
different angle where you can't really
see<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> bubbling<00:01:04.979> keep<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.510> can

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
see the bubbling keep going on but I can

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.520 
see the bubbling keep going on but I can
I<00:01:07.500> will<00:01:07.710> 100%<00:01:08.100> see<00:01:08.940> I'm<00:01:09.150> very<00:01:09.229> satisfied<00:01:10.229> with

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
there's definitely still okay I'm not

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.279 
there's definitely still okay I'm not
saying<00:01:27.090> there's<00:01:27.240> not<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.479> curve<00:01:27.750> at<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.170> bottom

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.599 
saying there's not a curve at the bottom
there<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:28.649> in<00:01:29.630> comparison<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.840> past<00:01:31.609> that

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
there but in comparison to the past that

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.389 
there but in comparison to the past that
looks<00:01:32.969> far<00:01:33.479> more<00:01:33.719> natural<00:01:34.320> than<00:01:34.770> before<00:01:35.159> if

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
looks far more natural than before if

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.609 
looks far more natural than before if
you<00:01:36.359> watch<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.750> weight<00:01:36.960> although<00:01:37.289> this<00:01:37.469> is

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you watch the weight although this is

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.169 
you watch the weight although this is
with<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> kind<00:01:38.039> of<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.159> fisheye<00:01:38.609> lens<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.000> see

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
with a kind of a fisheye lens you see

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.060
