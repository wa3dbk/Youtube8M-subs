00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
all right a few of them

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.560 
all right a few of them
first<00:01:59.770> off<00:02:00.010> let's<00:02:00.190> highlight<00:02:00.340> jumping<00:02:01.030> the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
first off let's highlight jumping the

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.940 
first off let's highlight jumping the
jump<00:02:01.870> is<00:02:02.050> it's<00:02:02.320> probably<00:02:02.800> the<00:02:02.860> most

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
jump is it's probably the most

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.590 
jump is it's probably the most
complicated<00:02:03.280> step<00:02:03.970> it's<00:02:04.180> really<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.479> only

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
complicated step it's really the only

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.590 
complicated step it's really the only
step<00:02:04.870> right<00:02:05.080> essentially<00:02:05.979> um<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:06.790> dud<00:02:07.150> will

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
step right essentially um this dud will

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.359 
step right essentially um this dud will
will<00:02:07.870> constantly<00:02:08.410> happen<00:02:08.860> where<00:02:09.009> you'll<00:02:09.160> kind

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
will constantly happen where you'll kind

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.810 
will constantly happen where you'll kind
of<00:02:09.460> jump<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:10.300> you'll<00:02:10.450> this<00:02:11.430> you're<00:02:12.430> just<00:02:12.459> kind

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
of jump and you'll this you're just kind

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.020 
of jump and you'll this you're just kind
of<00:02:12.910> jump<00:02:13.209> either<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.560> or<00:02:14.860> then<00:02:15.550> once<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:15.910> get

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
of jump either that or then once you get

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.500 
of jump either that or then once you get
past<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.540> we'll<00:02:16.959> do<00:02:17.080> this<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.320> lot<00:02:18.390> where<00:02:19.390> the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
past that we'll do this a lot where the

there in skateboarding
you're<00:04:06.760> actually<00:04:07.150> flicking<00:04:07.600> out<00:04:07.750> off<00:04:08.680> the

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
you're actually flicking out off the

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.760 
you're actually flicking out off the
side<00:04:09.310> of<00:04:09.490> your<00:04:09.580> foot<00:04:09.790> kind<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.150> like<00:04:10.270> that

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
side of your foot kind of like that

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
side of your foot kind of like that
that's<00:04:11.770> not<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.220> way<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.370> do<00:04:12.520> it

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
that's not the way I do it

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.880 
that's not the way I do it
maybe<00:04:13.150> it's<00:04:13.390> because<00:04:13.570> um<00:04:14.110> it's<00:04:14.440> a<00:04:14.500> longboard

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
maybe it's because um it's a longboard

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.620 
maybe it's because um it's a longboard
different<00:04:15.610> dimensions<00:04:16.030> different<00:04:16.239> weights

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
different dimensions different weights

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.530 
different dimensions different weights
different<00:04:17.470> physics<00:04:18.280> involved<00:04:18.400> but<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.299> might

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
different physics involved but it might

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.360 
different physics involved but it might
just<00:04:19.690> be<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.200> never<00:04:20.470> skateboarded<00:04:20.770> so<00:04:21.340> I

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
just be that I never skateboarded so I

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.240 
just be that I never skateboarded so I
never<00:04:21.580> really<00:04:21.850> learned<00:04:22.120> that<00:04:22.270> way<00:04:23.040> but<00:04:24.040> I<00:04:24.070> will

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
never really learned that way but I will

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.600 
never really learned that way but I will
say<00:04:24.400> this<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:26.050> do<00:04:26.260> you<00:04:26.950> sweat<00:04:27.250> kind<00:04:27.520> of

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
say this and you do you sweat kind of

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.550 
say this and you do you sweat kind of
back<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.120> down<00:04:28.420> I<00:04:28.660> almost<00:04:28.810> kind<00:04:29.020> of<00:04:29.140> kick<00:04:29.290> down

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
back and down I almost kind of kick down

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.050 
back and down I almost kind of kick down
with<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.920> board

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
with the board

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.330 
with the board
that's<00:04:31.510> called<00:04:31.720> mob<00:04:32.110> in<00:04:32.710> skateboarding<00:04:33.040> I

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
that's called mob in skateboarding I

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.280 
that's called mob in skateboarding I
don't<00:04:33.490> think<00:04:33.610> it's<00:04:33.730> very<00:04:33.820> good<00:04:34.180> term<00:04:34.450> but<00:04:35.200> it

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
don't think it's very good term but it

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.970 
don't think it's very good term but it
gets<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.500> job<00:04:35.530> done

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
gets the job done

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.550 
gets the job done
okay<00:04:36.310> gets<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:36.820> job<00:04:36.970> done<00:04:37.030> on<00:04:37.330> a<00:04:37.360> longboard<00:04:37.990> so

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
okay gets the job done on a longboard so

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.340 
okay gets the job done on a longboard so
I<00:04:38.590> flick<00:04:38.980> down<00:04:39.660> occasionally<00:04:40.660> like<00:04:40.870> I'll<00:04:41.110> try

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
I flick down occasionally like I'll try

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.260 
I flick down occasionally like I'll try
it<00:04:41.470> that<00:04:41.680> way<00:04:41.890> I<00:04:42.190> might<00:04:42.460> hit<00:04:42.700> it<00:04:42.730> every<00:04:42.880> once<00:04:43.150> in

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
it that way I might hit it every once in

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.030 
it that way I might hit it every once in
a<00:04:43.330> while<00:04:43.450> but<00:04:43.690> I<00:04:43.930> have<00:04:44.290> a<00:04:44.350> lot<00:04:44.530> better<00:04:44.800> luck

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
a while but I have a lot better luck

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.310 
a while but I have a lot better luck
kind<00:04:45.820> of<00:04:45.910> flicking<00:04:46.150> back<00:04:46.480> and<00:04:46.750> down<00:04:47.020> with<00:04:47.230> the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
kind of flicking back and down with the

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.870 
kind of flicking back and down with the
board

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.940
