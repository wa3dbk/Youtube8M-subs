should<00:01:43.590> say<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.040> FX<00:01:44.700> circuit<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:45.960> an

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
should say is the FX circuit we have an

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.469 
should say is the FX circuit we have an
exclusive<00:01:46.439> arrangement<00:01:46.829> with<00:01:47.399> FX<00:01:47.850> exciters

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
exclusive arrangement with FX exciters

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.319 
exclusive arrangement with FX exciters
to<00:01:49.020> produce<00:01:49.430> effect<00:01:50.430> circuits<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.000> stringed

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
to produce effect circuits and stringed

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.120 
to produce effect circuits and stringed
instruments<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> very<00:01:52.470> first<00:01:52.799> base

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
instruments this is the very first base

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.999 
instruments this is the very first base
we<00:01:53.820> have<00:01:53.909> ever<00:01:54.060> put<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> FX<00:01:54.750> circuit<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.320> so

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
we have ever put the FX circuit in so

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.100 
we have ever put the FX circuit in so
the<00:01:56.159> FX<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.700> actually<00:01:57.090> an<00:01:57.180> exciter<00:01:57.570> circuit

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the FX is actually an exciter circuit

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.310 
the FX is actually an exciter circuit
big<00:01:58.619> bottom<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.250> compression<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:01.079> really

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
big bottom and compression so you really

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.469 
big bottom and compression so you really
have<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.469> hear<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.799> bass<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.159> understand<00:02:02.729> how

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
have to hear the bass to understand how

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.050 
have to hear the bass to understand how
much<00:02:03.689> percussiveness<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.829> low-end<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.969> it

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
much percussiveness and low-end that it
