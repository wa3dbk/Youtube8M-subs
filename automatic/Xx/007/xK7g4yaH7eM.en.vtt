this<00:04:32.530> is<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:32.740> classics<00:04:33.280> because<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.759> movie

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
this is the classics because the movie

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.600 
this is the classics because the movie
version<00:04:34.210> has<00:04:34.509> in<00:04:34.659> all<00:04:35.259> black<00:04:35.710> pants<00:04:36.400> and

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
version has in all black pants and

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.300 
version has in all black pants and

both of yellow dots which means they're
rare<00:05:32.440> so<00:05:33.400> pretty<00:05:33.789> cool<00:05:33.969> not<00:05:34.630> interested<00:05:35.199> in

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
rare so pretty cool not interested in

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:35.850 
rare so pretty cool not interested in
the<00:05:35.440> rest

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
the rest

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.670 
the rest
maybe<00:05:36.219> the<00:05:36.520> ground<00:05:36.729> assault<00:05:37.060> your<00:05:37.270> own<00:05:37.680> but

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
maybe the ground assault your own but

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.379 
maybe the ground assault your own but
whiplash<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:39.310> Iron<00:05:39.460> Man<00:05:39.550> mark<00:05:39.940> 5<00:05:40.150> definitely

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
whiplash and Iron Man mark 5 definitely

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.980 
whiplash and Iron Man mark 5 definitely
not<00:05:40.719> picking<00:05:41.020> those<00:05:41.169> up<00:05:42.449> maybe<00:05:43.449> I<00:05:43.599> think<00:05:43.719> I'll

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
not picking those up maybe I think I'll

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.640 
not picking those up maybe I think I'll
pass

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
pass

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.370 
pass
it's<00:05:44.979> probably<00:05:45.370> just<00:05:45.430> wait<00:05:45.699> for<00:05:45.880> wave<00:05:46.060> 3<00:05:46.419> see

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
it's probably just wait for wave 3 see

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.519 
it's probably just wait for wave 3 see
if<00:05:47.440> I<00:05:47.620> can<00:05:47.800> still<00:05:48.099> catch<00:05:48.310> any<00:05:48.580> of<00:05:48.669> the<00:05:48.789> wave<00:05:49.000> 1

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:49.529 
if I can still catch any of the wave 1

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:02.430 
collected these Mega Bloks figures no
actually<00:06:00.669> second<00:06:01.090> time<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:01.479> first<00:06:01.659> ones<00:06:02.020> are

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
actually second time the first ones are

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.100 
actually second time the first ones are
the<00:06:02.770> I<00:06:03.129> have<00:06:03.610> the<00:06:03.759> sets<00:06:04.000> of<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.509> war<00:06:04.750> machine

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
the I have the sets of the war machine

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.379 
the I have the sets of the war machine
the<00:06:05.139> Iron<00:06:05.500> Man<00:06:05.650> 2<00:06:05.889> war<00:06:06.069> machine<00:06:06.430> and<00:06:08.370> mark<00:06:09.370> 6<00:06:10.180> I
