a<00:00:33.810> riff<00:00:34.500> basically<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.940> little<00:00:36.390> section<00:00:36.750> of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
a riff basically is a little section of

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.870 
a riff basically is a little section of
a<00:00:36.960> song<00:00:37.340> typically<00:00:38.340> something<00:00:38.580> that's

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
a song typically something that's

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.850 
a song typically something that's
recognizable<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.320> want<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.590> break<00:00:40.830> up

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
recognizable and we want to break up

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.370 
recognizable and we want to break up
songs<00:00:41.340> into<00:00:41.730> little<00:00:42.059> sections<00:00:42.870> little<00:00:43.140> riffs

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
songs into little sections little riffs

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.140 
songs into little sections little riffs
little<00:00:43.770> bits<00:00:43.920> hard<00:00:44.100> parts<00:00:44.400> and<00:00:44.580> have<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
little bits hard parts and have you

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.640 
little bits hard parts and have you
practiced<00:00:45.360> those<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> way<00:00:46.530> that

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
practiced those and this is a way that

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.160 
practiced those and this is a way that
any<00:00:47.130> teacher<00:00:47.580> would<00:00:48.450> teach<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.930> play<00:00:49.080> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
any teacher would teach you to play a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.380 
any teacher would teach you to play a
song<00:00:49.500> basically<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.340> game<00:00:50.550> looks<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:51.150> how

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
song basically the game looks at how

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.510 
song basically the game looks at how
you're<00:00:51.600> doing<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.140> it'll<00:00:52.680> let<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.309> know

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
you're doing and it'll let you know

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.549 
you're doing and it'll let you know
which<00:00:53.850> sections<00:00:54.540> you<00:00:54.660> haven't<00:00:55.020> done<00:00:55.140> well<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
which sections you haven't done well and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.710 
which sections you haven't done well and
you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.040> go<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.550> practice<00:00:57.030> them<00:00:57.150> we<00:00:57.629> have

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
you can go in and practice them we have

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.210 
you can go in and practice them we have
three<00:00:58.019> ways<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.769> in<00:00:58.949> our<00:00:59.010> riff

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
three ways that you do that in our riff

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.369 
three ways that you do that in our riff
repeater<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.970> of<00:01:00.090> them<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.360> free<00:01:00.629> speed<00:01:00.870> which

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
repeater one of them is free speed which

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.780 
repeater one of them is free speed which
just<00:01:01.650> takes<00:01:01.830> you<00:01:01.980> through<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> song<00:01:02.460> at<00:01:02.670> your

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
just takes you through the song at your

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.329 
just takes you through the song at your
own<00:01:02.940> pace<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.650> calculates<00:01:04.650> your<00:01:04.739> speed<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
own pace and calculates your speed and

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.180 
own pace and calculates your speed and
then<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.210> size<00:01:06.420> okay<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.110> plated<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.649> fifty

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
then the size okay you plated it fifty

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.150 
then the size okay you plated it fifty
percent<00:01:08.520> speed<00:01:08.940> and<00:01:09.229> eventually<00:01:10.229> as<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.920> play

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
percent speed and eventually as you play

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.370 
percent speed and eventually as you play
this<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.610> bunch<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.479> times<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.960> muscle<00:01:13.290> memory

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
this a bunch of times your muscle memory

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.230 
this a bunch of times your muscle memory
gets<00:01:13.649> better<00:01:13.950> you'll<00:01:14.220> speed<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.820> up<00:01:14.940> to<00:01:15.149> be

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
gets better you'll speed it up to be

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.999 
gets better you'll speed it up to be
playing<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.690> at<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.930> hundred<00:01:16.170> percent<00:01:16.590> another

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
playing it at a hundred percent another

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.219 
playing it at a hundred percent another
similar<00:01:17.640> mode<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.360> riff<00:01:18.539> accelerator

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
similar mode is the riff accelerator

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.170 
similar mode is the riff accelerator
which<00:01:19.710> will<00:01:19.860> actually<00:01:20.009> calculate<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> time

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
which will actually calculate the time

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.610 
which will actually calculate the time
that<00:01:22.050> it<00:01:22.140> takes<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.830> finish<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> song

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.070 

and<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.460> it'll<00:01:29.610> slow<00:01:30.090> down<00:01:30.120> the<00:01:30.510> tempo<00:01:30.660> of

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
and then it'll slow down the tempo of

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.470 
and then it'll slow down the tempo of
the<00:01:31.410> song<00:01:31.440> and<00:01:32.430> you'll<00:01:32.580> try<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.820> play<00:01:33.060> along<00:01:33.330> at

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
the song and you'll try to play along at

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.630 
the song and you'll try to play along at
that<00:01:33.630> slow<00:01:33.900> tempo<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.010> will<00:01:35.100> continue<00:01:35.190> to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that slow tempo and it will continue to

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.970 
that slow tempo and it will continue to
play<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.030> increasingly<00:01:36.540> fast<00:01:37.050> tempos<00:01:37.620> till

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
play that increasingly fast tempos till

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.230 
play that increasingly fast tempos till
you<00:01:38.100> play<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.490> roof<00:01:38.760> of<00:01:38.910> one<00:01:38.970> hundred<00:01:39.060> percent

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
you play the roof of one hundred percent

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.840 
you play the roof of one hundred percent
yet<00:01:39.870> another<00:01:40.170> mode<00:01:40.440> just<00:01:40.830> called<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.580> rift

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
yet another mode just called the rift

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.490 
yet another mode just called the rift
level<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.540> you're<00:01:42.690> going<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.840> start<00:01:43.140> at<00:01:43.230> a<00:01:43.320> low

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
level so you're going to start at a low

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.470 
level so you're going to start at a low
level<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.640> those<00:01:44.760> correct<00:01:45.240> it's

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
level and as you get those correct it's

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.180 
level and as you get those correct it's
going<00:01:45.660> to<00:01:45.720> level<00:01:45.900> you<00:01:46.170> up<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.590> another<00:01:46.800> section

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
going to level you up so another section

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.500 
going to level you up so another section
of<00:01:47.280> our<00:01:47.430> game<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.850> called<00:01:47.910> technique

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
of our game is called technique

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.900 
of our game is called technique
challenges<00:01:49.020> their<00:01:49.440> brief<00:01:49.890> musical<00:01:50.160> attitudes

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
challenges their brief musical attitudes

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.530 
challenges their brief musical attitudes
and<00:01:51.120> they're<00:01:51.300> basically<00:01:51.720> little<00:01:52.680> snippets<00:01:53.220> of

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
and they're basically little snippets of

and they're basically little snippets of
music<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.900> would<00:01:55.410> teach<00:01:55.650> you<00:01:55.860> how<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.700> do

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
music that would teach you how to do

specific techniques or bend is a
technique<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.300> use<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.600> guitar<00:02:00.960> where

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
technique that you use on guitar where

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.770 
technique that you use on guitar where
you<00:02:01.470> actually<00:02:02.010> Bend<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.880> pitch<00:02:03.480> of<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
you actually Bend the pitch of the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.200 
you actually Bend the pitch of the
string<00:02:04.110> by<00:02:04.530> pushing<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.100> string<00:02:05.370> up<00:02:05.580> on<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
string by pushing the string up on the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.700 
string by pushing the string up on the
fretboard<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:07.050> one<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.410> more<00:02:07.530> difficult

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
