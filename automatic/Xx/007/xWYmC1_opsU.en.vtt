are<00:00:08.180> you<00:00:08.690> differentiate<00:00:09.170> yourself<00:00:09.830> from

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:10.209 
are you differentiate yourself from

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:15.240 
are you differentiate yourself from
singapore<00:00:11.209> airline<00:00:11.480> product<00:00:11.840> in<00:00:11.930> the<00:00:12.049> quantum

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.560 

processor<00:00:18.070> we<00:00:19.070> have<00:00:19.270> nearly<00:00:20.270> a<00:00:20.390> hundred

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
processor we have nearly a hundred

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.540 
processor we have nearly a hundred
thirty<00:00:21.080> Airlines<00:00:21.560> going<00:00:21.890> through<00:00:22.040> jee<00:00:22.220> bhar

thirty Airlines going through jee bhar

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.160 
thirty Airlines going through jee bhar
so<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.789> could<00:00:24.119> say<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:24.720> actually<00:00:25.080> have

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
so you could say that we actually have

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.870 
so you could say that we actually have
30<00:00:26.039> competitors<00:00:26.970> Justin<00:00:27.720> at<00:00:27.810> one

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
30 competitors Justin at one

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.330 
30 competitors Justin at one
obviously<00:00:30.480> our<00:00:30.509> part<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.080> different

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
obviously our part is different

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.420 
obviously our part is different
and<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.550> try<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.880> differentiate<00:00:33.360> which<00:00:33.930> is

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
and we try to differentiate which is

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.530 
and we try to differentiate which is
very<00:00:35.430> much<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> international<00:00:36.270> carrier

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
very much the international carrier

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.330 
very much the international carrier
that's<00:00:36.720> based<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.170> Dubai<00:00:37.470> just<00:00:37.860> extremely

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
that's based in Dubai just extremely

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.830 
that's based in Dubai just extremely
good<00:00:38.550> place<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.970> be<00:00:39.090> geograph<00:00:39.810> it's<00:00:40.739> halfway

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
good place to be geograph it's halfway

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.540 
good place to be geograph it's halfway
Far<00:00:43.140> East<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.560> halfway<00:00:43.770> between<00:00:43.950> Russia<00:00:44.430> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
Far East is halfway between Russia and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.940 
Far East is halfway between Russia and
Africa<00:00:45.060> so<00:00:45.870> geographically<00:00:46.470> were<00:00:46.740> in<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> very

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
Africa so geographically were in a very

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.480 
Africa so geographically were in a very
fortunate<00:00:47.400> position

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
fortunate position

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.410 
fortunate position
we<00:00:50.060> reflect<00:00:50.540> that<00:00:50.720> by<00:00:50.960> having<00:00:51.170> cabin<00:00:51.680> crew

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
we reflect that by having cabin crew

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.080 
we reflect that by having cabin crew
30<00:00:53.750> nationalities

so<00:00:55.450> when<00:00:55.630> you<00:00:55.720> get<00:00:55.870> on<00:00:55.990> there

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
so when you get on there

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.400 
so when you get on there
credible<00:00:58.410> language<00:00:58.740> capability

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
credible language capability

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.260 
credible language capability
so<00:01:01.070> many<00:01:01.970> languages

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
so many languages

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.900 
so many languages
318<00:01:03.930> before<00:01:04.230> we<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.440> have<00:01:04.559> about<00:01:04.800> 15<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.790> 20

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
318 before we can have about 15 to 20

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.230 
318 before we can have about 15 to 20

overcome that

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.980 
overcome that
is<00:01:34.590> too<00:01:35.100> early<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.490> tell<00:01:35.730> because<00:01:36.450> we've<00:01:36.720> just

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
is too early to tell because we've just

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.540 
is too early to tell because we've just
received<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.560> airplanes<00:01:38.010> are<00:01:38.280> very

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
received the airplanes are very

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.960 
received the airplanes are very
functional<00:01:38.880> service<00:01:39.780> so

functional service so
I<00:01:42.060> think<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> challenge<00:01:43.110> obviously

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
I think the challenge obviously

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.710 
I think the challenge obviously
initially<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.580> true<00:01:44.880> even<00:01:45.630> though

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
initially is really true even though

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.170 
initially is really true even though
we've<00:01:45.900> trained<00:01:46.200> them
