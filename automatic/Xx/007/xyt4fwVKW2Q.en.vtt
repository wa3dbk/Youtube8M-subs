00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.920
 it is very very small and much 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.979

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.549
 hard but I offer you exactly 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.950

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.759
 a little white left to 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:02.000
 it looked more beautifully stuck 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:06.140
 proceed to decorating decided to take 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.140
 standard brown 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.190
 I want our books to go beyond 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.319
 the edges so I coat with glue 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.230
 only one edge is good second to me 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.459
 very well 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.799
 I would advise you girls 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.810
 decorate such razukrashki here 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.140
 by pastel pencils because 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.180
 they have such a nice touch this 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.040

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.880

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.280
 if you do not like it you can leave 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.230

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.540

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.689
 corners i want to glue it here and here 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.480
 then find out why 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:32.480

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.549
 happy with what happened the rest 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.260
 I want to leave a place to 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.329
 write books here that I want 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.489

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.799
 so that I already had some plan and 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.510

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.370
 those books that I would like to read 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.750
 so if you want to advise me 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.209

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.069
 comments if you have already read 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.280
 some books are just cretins on the site 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.750
 recommendations this would be nice too 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.440
 that's what happened to me with this 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.750
 page 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.489
 I have deprived too much of decorating 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.709
 these are the inscriptions here I think that here I am 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.260
 write your review and even then if you do not 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.849
 will want and I will add something else here 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.949
 I also have such a picture 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:23.440
 found clippings from different magazines books 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.030
 who want to read for a long time 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.010
 take a closer look at them later 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.349
 there is glue here here it is already 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.680
 leave room to order if still 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:35.870
 I want to read something here 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.870

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.060
 I will add here for dessert that I have 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.830
 it turned out it seems to me very cool I 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.780
 I think that here I still have to 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.389
 fill my diary 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.889
 and it seems to me that there is nothing more 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:54.650
 I need to take my book clippings closer and 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.810
 You can find them in any magazine. 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.389

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.650
 color printer them to print and this 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.330
 it will be very cool to me 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.030

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.800
