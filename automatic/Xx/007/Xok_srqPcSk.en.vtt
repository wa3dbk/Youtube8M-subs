00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
to do is you want to just go to the top

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.470 
to do is you want to just go to the top
here<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:07.070> then<00:03:07.489> just<00:03:07.670> let<00:03:07.850> your<00:03:08.030> guy<00:03:08.180> roll

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
down and just get over the logs like

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.410 
down and just get over the logs like
that<00:03:11.239> and<00:03:12.100> then<00:03:13.100> once<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:13.790> go<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.030> down<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.299> as

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
that and then once you go and down it as

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.870 
that and then once you go and down it as
soon<00:03:14.660> as<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:14.900> hit<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.140> water<00:03:15.320> press<00:03:16.070> Y<00:03:16.280> then

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
soon as you hit the water press Y then

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.699 
soon as you hit the water press Y then
your<00:03:17.030> guy<00:03:17.120> will<00:03:17.269> do<00:03:17.390> this<00:03:17.600> you<00:03:18.290> got<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.530> make

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
your guy will do this you got to make

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.130 
your guy will do this you got to make
sure<00:03:18.739> you<00:03:19.010> just<00:03:19.670> as<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:19.880> hit<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.269> water<00:03:20.480> and

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
sure you just as you hit the water and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.960 
sure you just as you hit the water and
then<00:03:21.650> if<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:21.860> look<00:03:21.950> at<00:03:22.100> that<00:03:22.190> sign<00:03:22.519> I<00:03:22.870> my<00:03:23.950> 10

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
then if you look at that sign I my 10

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.699 
then if you look at that sign I my 10
and<00:03:25.970> then<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.360> looks<00:03:26.660> like<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.840> line<00:03:27.049> a<00:03:27.079> square

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
and then I looks like a line a square

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.150 
and then I looks like a line a square
and<00:03:27.829> a<00:03:27.890> why<00:03:28.070> or<00:03:28.370> an<00:03:28.970> O<00:03:29.150> I'm<00:03:29.390> not<00:03:29.540> sure<00:03:29.780> I'm<00:03:31.510> yo<00:03:32.510> yo

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
and a why or an O I'm not sure I'm yo yo

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.289 
and a why or an O I'm not sure I'm yo yo
probably<00:03:34.160> looking<00:03:34.400> at<00:03:34.489> wrong<00:03:34.670> that's<00:03:35.180> the

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
probably looking at wrong that's the

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.210 
probably looking at wrong that's the
second<00:03:35.720> sign<00:03:35.959> also<00:03:36.530> you<00:03:36.739> get<00:03:36.799> a<00:03:36.860> nice<00:03:37.010> little

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
second sign also you get a nice little
