00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
we are at peplum at 8:00 for 2013 and I

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.480 
we are at peplum at 8:00 for 2013 and I
have<00:00:15.459> my<00:00:15.639> hands<00:00:16.090> on<00:00:16.299> the<00:00:16.930> envy<00:00:17.410> slatebook<00:00:17.800> x2

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
have my hands on the envy slatebook x2

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.429 
have my hands on the envy slatebook x2
so<00:00:18.669> this<00:00:18.790> is<00:00:18.910> an<00:00:19.000> NVIDIA<00:00:19.390> Tegra<00:00:19.450> 4<00:00:19.779> tablet

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
so this is an NVIDIA Tegra 4 tablet

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.249 
so this is an NVIDIA Tegra 4 tablet
burning<00:00:20.919> at<00:00:21.119> 1.8<00:00:22.119> gigahertz<00:00:22.150> it<00:00:22.869> comes<00:00:23.050> with

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
burning at 1.8 gigahertz it comes with

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.370 
burning at 1.8 gigahertz it comes with
32<00:00:23.770> gigabytes<00:00:23.800> of<00:00:24.279> memory<00:00:24.849> and<00:00:25.779> 2<00:00:26.019> gigabytes

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
32 gigabytes of memory and 2 gigabytes

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.740 
32 gigabytes of memory and 2 gigabytes
of<00:00:26.560> RAM<00:00:26.949> so<00:00:27.340> this<00:00:27.519> is<00:00:27.609> actually<00:00:27.910> an<00:00:28.029> HD<00:00:28.359> display

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
of RAM so this is actually an HD display

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.509 
of RAM so this is actually an HD display
I'm<00:00:29.289> gonna<00:00:29.439> put<00:00:29.650> this<00:00:29.740> down<00:00:29.920> on<00:00:30.099> the<00:00:30.130> table

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519

have on here so you can see that the
performance<00:00:54.590> is<00:00:55.040> fabulous<00:00:55.520> is<00:00:55.640> exactly<00:00:56.030> what

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
performance is fabulous is exactly what

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.450 
performance is fabulous is exactly what
we'd<00:00:56.300> expect<00:00:56.330> from<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.930> x2<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:57.860> we<00:00:57.950> do<00:00:58.070> have<00:00:58.220> a

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
we'd expect from the x2 so we do have a

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.040 
we'd expect from the x2 so we do have a
front-facing<00:00:58.910> camera<00:00:59.480> let's<00:00:59.660> just<00:00:59.780> hold<00:00:59.900> out

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
if that a better view and if we pop this

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.730 
if that a better view and if we pop this

rocker now all of this stuff is really
integrated<00:01:31.310> from<00:01:31.729> my<00:01:31.880> tests<00:01:32.330> on<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:33.560> Envy

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
integrated from my tests on the the Envy

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.370 
integrated from my tests on the the Envy
x2<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:35.150> was<00:01:35.390> really<00:01:35.660> kind<00:01:35.869> of<00:01:35.930> nice<00:01:36.140> and

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
x2 this was really kind of nice and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.980 
x2 this was really kind of nice and
seamless<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:37.190> well<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:38.210> didn't<00:01:38.510> really<00:01:38.720> have

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
seamless and well you didn't really have

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.120 
seamless and well you didn't really have
to<00:01:39.140> look<00:01:39.260> like<00:01:39.680> you<00:01:39.830> didn't<00:01:39.979> have<00:01:40.040> to

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
to look like you didn't have to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.310 
to look like you didn't have to
physically<00:01:40.729> look<00:01:41.030> at<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.479> tablet<00:01:41.750> in<00:01:42.080> order

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
physically look at the tablet in order

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.969 
physically look at the tablet in order
to<00:01:42.470> activate<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:43.100> that<00:01:43.400> was<00:01:43.520> kind<00:01:43.760> of<00:01:43.880> nice

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
to activate it so that was kind of nice

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.700 
to activate it so that was kind of nice
now<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.520> main<00:01:45.969> event<00:01:46.469> obviously<00:01:47.469> for

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
now the main event obviously for

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.770 
now the main event obviously for
something<00:01:47.979> like<00:01:48.130> this<00:01:48.310> is<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:48.759> it<00:01:49.119> docks<00:01:49.420> in

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
something like this is that it docks in

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.179 
something like this is that it docks in
let's<00:01:49.990> see<00:01:50.079> if<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.200> can<00:01:50.320> do<00:01:50.439> it<00:01:50.530> with<00:01:50.619> one<00:01:50.770> hand

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
let's see if I can do it with one hand

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.270 
let's see if I can do it with one hand

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
it did start charging now if we just

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.169 
it did start charging now if we just
head<00:02:02.380> into<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.770> settings<00:02:03.130> we<00:02:03.310> can<00:02:03.340> look<00:02:03.700> and

very similar to what was going on with
the<00:02:13.840> nvx<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.890> keyboard<00:02:15.250> layout<00:02:15.400> seems<00:02:15.790> the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
the nvx to the keyboard layout seems the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.610 
the nvx to the keyboard layout seems the
same<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.510> trackpad<00:02:16.750> seems<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.410> same
