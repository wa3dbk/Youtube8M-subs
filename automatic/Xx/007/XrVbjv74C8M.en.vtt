00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.979 
into your router and then it's going to
have<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.870> power<00:02:19.709> cable<00:02:19.980> there<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:21.209> is<00:02:21.720> what's

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
have a power cable there this is what's

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.789 
have a power cable there this is what's
going<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.200> talk<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.920> on<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:24.769> system<00:02:25.769> here

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
going to talk to that on the system here

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.100 
going to talk to that on the system here
so<00:02:26.310> what<00:02:26.580> I'm<00:02:26.670> going<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.819> do<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:28.220> log<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.549> and

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
so what I'm going to do is log on and

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.960 
so what I'm going to do is log on and
show<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.170> how<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.500> works<00:02:31.980> basically<00:02:32.549> you'll

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
show you how that works basically you'll

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.720 
show you how that works basically you'll
just<00:02:33.150> give<00:02:33.360> your<00:02:33.510> phone<00:02:33.780> or<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.650> computer<00:02:34.950> or

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
just give your phone or a computer or

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.910 
just give your phone or a computer or
iPad<00:02:36.180> or<00:02:36.360> whatever<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.810> got<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.349> you're

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
iPad or whatever you got and you're

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.670 
iPad or whatever you got and you're
going<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.099> log<00:02:38.370> into<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:39.230> log<00:02:40.230> into<00:02:40.590> your

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
going to log into it log into your

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.039 
going to log into it log into your
system<00:02:41.099> and<00:02:41.220> then<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:42.060> can<00:02:42.239> actually<00:02:42.420> send

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
system and then you can actually send

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.470 
system and then you can actually send
this<00:02:43.290> lock<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.829> new<00:02:44.160> code<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.670> can<00:02:44.819> program<00:02:45.090> a

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
this lock a new code you can program a

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.680 
this lock a new code you can program a
new<00:02:45.660> code<00:02:45.959> directly<00:02:46.829> into<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:48.269> can<00:02:48.420> send

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
new code directly into it you can send

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.509 
new code directly into it you can send
it<00:02:48.810> right<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.349> so<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> neighbor<00:02:49.920> can<00:02:50.220> get<00:02:50.370> in

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
it right to it so a neighbor can get in

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.110 
it right to it so a neighbor can get in
you<00:02:51.030> can<00:02:51.060> unlock<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.440> can<00:02:52.620> lock<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.220> you

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
you can unlock it you can lock it you

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.199 
you can unlock it you can lock it you
can<00:02:55.040> basically<00:02:56.040> it's<00:02:56.489> going<00:02:56.609> to<00:02:56.700> build<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.180> a

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
can basically it's going to build you a

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.479 
can basically it's going to build you a
file<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.049> you're<00:02:58.650> going<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:58.859> be<00:02:58.980> able<00:02:59.069> to<00:02:59.220> see

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
they had to type that code in for it to

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:37.890 
they had to type that code in for it to
work<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:29.489> let<00:03:29.670> me<00:03:30.079> log<00:03:31.079> in<00:03:31.380> here<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:32.100> my<00:03:32.600> account

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.080

and they have an app for this - that

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.030 
and they have an app for this - that
makes<00:03:40.269> it<00:03:40.360> faster<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:41.080> just<00:03:41.319> haven't<00:03:41.560> set<00:03:41.799> it<00:03:41.830> up

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
makes it faster I just haven't set it up

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:49.130 
makes it faster I just haven't set it up
yet

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.750

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.899 

this<00:03:55.360> is<00:03:55.540> all<00:03:55.920> password-protected<00:03:56.920> so

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
this is all password-protected so

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:04.679 
this is all password-protected so
everything<00:03:58.599> stays<00:03:58.900> nice<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.230> safe<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:04.360> then

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689 
everything stays nice and safe and then

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.130 
everything stays nice and safe and then
once<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.079> log<00:04:05.290> in<00:04:06.390> it's<00:04:07.390> going<00:04:07.659> to<00:04:07.780> give<00:04:07.989> you

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
got a plug light actually I got a

00:04:47.919 --> 00:05:00.670 
got a plug light actually I got a
promise<00:04:48.280> back<00:04:48.520> in

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.980 

need<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:01.340> let<00:05:01.490> that<00:05:01.520> think<00:05:01.970> for<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.300> second<00:05:03.940> and

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
need to let that think for a second and

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:15.730 
need to let that think for a second and
then<00:05:06.729> I'm<00:05:07.729> sure<00:05:08.030> it<00:05:08.330> will<00:05:08.479> come<00:05:08.540> back<00:05:08.990> on

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:24.439 

walk

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:25.610 

you<00:05:24.930> should<00:05:25.110> have<00:05:25.229> thought<00:05:25.349> about<00:05:25.409> that

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
you should have thought about that

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.559 
you should have thought about that
before<00:05:26.159> I<00:05:26.189> unplugged<00:05:26.639> it<00:05:26.789> I<00:05:26.939> guess<00:05:27.120> it<00:05:27.270> needs<00:05:27.419> a

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:27.569 
before I unplugged it I guess it needs a

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:50.720 
before I unplugged it I guess it needs a
second<00:05:27.930> to<00:05:27.990> warm<00:05:28.289> up<00:05:28.469> and<00:05:28.620> think

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.450 

the<00:05:51.730> other<00:05:51.880> good<00:05:52.120> thing<00:05:52.300> about<00:05:52.330> this<00:05:52.720> too<00:05:52.990> is

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
the other good thing about this too is

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.770 
the other good thing about this too is
they<00:05:54.460> don't<00:05:54.700> come<00:05:54.940> out<00:05:55.030> phone<00:05:55.240> doing<00:05:55.450> this<00:05:55.600> is

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
basically based on a mechanical function

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.910 
basically based on a mechanical function
of<00:06:21.430> it<00:06:21.810> there<00:06:22.810> we<00:06:22.900> go<00:06:23.050> now<00:06:23.410> we<00:06:23.470> send<00:06:23.740> a<00:06:23.890> signal

my review I think it's great I'm putting
one<00:06:54.160> on<00:06:54.340> my<00:06:54.490> front<00:06:54.730> door<00:06:55.000> this<00:06:55.990> one<00:06:56.170> right<00:06:56.320> here

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
one on my front door this one right here

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.050 
one on my front door this one right here

the walk hasn't changed in a long long
time<00:07:10.150> and<00:07:10.690> it's<00:07:11.170> still<00:07:11.470> using<00:07:11.860> the<00:07:11.980> basic

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 
time and it's still using the basic

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.310 
time and it's still using the basic
mechanical<00:07:13.000> functions<00:07:13.540> of<00:07:13.690> the<00:07:13.810> original
