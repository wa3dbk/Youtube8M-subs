00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
right and I want to do is like just

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.540 
right and I want to do is like just
apply<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.960> everywhere

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.580 

you<00:01:52.120> start<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.450> pull<00:01:52.570> it<00:01:52.750> out<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:55.240> there<00:01:55.420> we<00:01:55.540> go

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
you start to pull it out so there we go

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.280 
you start to pull it out so there we go
those<00:01:57.220> line<00:01:57.400> is<00:01:57.520> good<00:01:57.700> gets<00:01:58.180> I<00:01:58.360> guess<00:01:58.540> cuz<00:01:58.840> it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
those line is good gets I guess cuz it

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.570 
those line is good gets I guess cuz it
starts<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.590> like<00:01:59.710> rub<00:01:59.920> off<00:02:00.100> if<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:00.400> keep

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
starts to like rub off if you keep

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.950 
starts to like rub off if you keep
rubbing<00:02:00.910> it<00:02:00.970> in<00:02:01.150> too<00:02:01.270> much<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:01.660> maybe<00:02:01.690> you

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
rubbing it in too much so maybe you

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.930 
rubbing it in too much so maybe you
should<00:02:02.140> like<00:02:02.260> apply<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:02.740> with<00:02:03.280> foundation<00:02:03.910> I

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
should like apply that with foundation I

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.700 
should like apply that with foundation I
think<00:02:03.970> it's<00:02:04.210> stay<00:02:04.390> on<00:02:04.510> better<00:02:04.750> but<00:02:05.500> that's

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
think it's stay on better but that's

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.280 
think it's stay on better but that's
them<00:02:06.130> about<00:02:06.430> it<00:02:06.610> for<00:02:06.820> now<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:07.210> then<00:02:08.020> go<00:02:08.140> on<00:02:08.260> to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
them about it for now and then go on to

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.510 
them about it for now and then go on to
the<00:02:08.410> eyes<00:02:08.560> actually<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:10.980> zombies<00:02:11.980> eyes<00:02:12.160> are

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
the eyes actually so zombies eyes are

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.990

very<00:02:13.170> black<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.440> intensified<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.490> we're

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
very black and intensified so we're

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.820
