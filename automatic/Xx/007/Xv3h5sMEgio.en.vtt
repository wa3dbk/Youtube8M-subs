about right for this song I'm going to
check<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.370> mix<00:02:01.820> put<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.210> around<00:02:02.450> 30%<00:02:03.130> let's

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
check that mix put that around 30% let's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.110 
check that mix put that around 30% let's
take<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.310> listen<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:04.610> what<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:04.820> sounds<00:02:05.090> like

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
take a listen to what it sounds like

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.500 
take a listen to what it sounds like
without<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.750> delay<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:07.640> here's<00:02:08.149> what<00:02:08.360> the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
without the delay and here's what the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.310 
without the delay and here's what the
delay<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.970> next<00:02:11.090> effect<00:02:11.480> slot<00:02:11.720> I'm<00:02:11.870> going<00:02:12.080> to

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
delay the next effect slot I'm going to

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.949 
delay the next effect slot I'm going to
put<00:02:12.739> in<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.250> noise<00:02:13.549> gate<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.269> case<00:02:14.480> you're<00:02:14.750> not

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
put in a noise gate in case you're not

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.840 
put in a noise gate in case you're not
using<00:02:15.320> a<00:02:15.410> very<00:02:15.620> action<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.190> control<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.640> little

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
using a very action to control a little

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.250 
using a very action to control a little
bit<00:02:17.030> of<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.269> background<00:02:17.540> noise<00:02:18.019> so<00:02:18.200> I'm

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
bit of that background noise so I'm

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.960 
bit of that background noise so I'm
going<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.410> go<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.590> dynamics<00:02:19.190> I'm<00:02:19.459> going<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.790> put

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
going to go to dynamics I'm going to put

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.860 
going to go to dynamics I'm going to put
both<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.540> decay<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.500> threshold<00:02:21.799> to<00:02:22.340> zero

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870

for the next effect block I'm going to

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.850 
for the next effect block I'm going to
select<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:26.000> pitch<00:02:26.420> because<00:02:27.110> you'll<00:02:27.380> notice<00:02:27.709> in

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
select a pitch because you'll notice in

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.470 
select a pitch because you'll notice in
the<00:02:27.980> song<00:02:28.250> there's<00:02:28.549> a<00:02:28.610> couple<00:02:28.910> spots<00:02:29.150> where

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
the song there's a couple spots where

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.440 
the song there's a couple spots where
he's<00:02:29.799> harmonizing<00:02:30.799> his<00:02:31.160> guitar<00:02:31.850> part<00:02:32.209> by

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
he's harmonizing his guitar part by

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.140 
he's harmonizing his guitar part by
doing<00:02:32.840> overdubs<00:02:33.650> but<00:02:33.980> we<00:02:34.190> can<00:02:34.340> emulate<00:02:34.820> that

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
doing overdubs but we can emulate that

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.699 
doing overdubs but we can emulate that
here<00:02:35.600> by<00:02:35.810> using<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.739> smart<00:02:37.070> harmony<00:02:37.489> feature

in the key of a we're going to select

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.660 
in the key of a we're going to select
minor<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:42.350> for<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.920> interval<00:02:43.370> we're<00:02:43.549> going

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
minor and for the interval we're going

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.660 
minor and for the interval we're going
to<00:02:43.760> select<00:02:43.940> thirds<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:45.140> for<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.190> mix<00:02:46.459> I'm

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
to select thirds and for the mix I'm

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.539 
to select thirds and for the mix I'm
going<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.850> put<00:02:47.030> this<00:02:47.209> around<00:02:47.600> 33%<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:49.280> give<00:02:49.489> you

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
going to put this around 33% so give you

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.130 
going to put this around 33% so give you
an<00:02:49.640> idea<00:02:49.790> what<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.269> is<00:02:50.450> going<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.660> sound<00:02:50.870> like

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
an idea what this is going to sound like

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.530 
an idea what this is going to sound like
without<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.980> harmony<00:02:52.459> on<00:02:52.700> I'm<00:02:53.120> just<00:02:53.360> going<00:02:53.510> to

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
without the harmony on I'm just going to

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.060 
without the harmony on I'm just going to
play<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.900> little<00:02:54.050> lick<00:02:54.349> with<00:02:54.620> nothing<00:02:55.069> on

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
play a little lick with nothing on

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.170 
play a little lick with nothing on
and<00:02:58.070> here's<00:02:58.490> what<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.790> harm<00:03:00.520> in<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.850> next

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
and here's what the harm in the next

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.930 
and here's what the harm in the next
effects<00:03:02.480> block<00:03:02.780> I'm<00:03:03.020> going<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.590> select

with<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.380> rotary<00:03:15.890> drums<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:16.520> we're<00:03:16.640> going<00:03:16.760> to

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
with the rotary drums so we're going to

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.480 
with the rotary drums so we're going to
use<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.720> in<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.200> later<00:03:18.500> part<00:03:18.800> of<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:18.980> song<00:03:19.190> I

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
use that in a later part of the song I

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.880 
use that in a later part of the song I
went<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.480> tempo<00:03:20.810> sync<00:03:21.050> that<00:03:21.170> two<00:03:21.320> sixteenth

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
went to tempo sync that two sixteenth

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.740 
went to tempo sync that two sixteenth
notes<00:03:22.160> I'm<00:03:22.580> going<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.940> put<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.270> depth<00:03:23.540> at<00:03:23.720> a

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
notes I'm going to put the depth at a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.780 
notes I'm going to put the depth at a
hundred<00:03:24.110> percent<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:25.100> I'm<00:03:25.340> going<00:03:25.490> to<00:03:25.550> put<00:03:25.700> the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
hundred percent and I'm going to put the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.070 
hundred percent and I'm going to put the
mix<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.270> around<00:03:26.800> 80<00:03:27.800> percent<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:29.660> we<00:03:29.780> can<00:03:29.900> take

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
mix it around 80 percent so we can take

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.210 
mix it around 80 percent so we can take
a<00:03:30.110> listen<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.500> hear<00:03:30.740> what<00:03:30.860> it<00:03:30.950> sounds<00:03:31.190> like

50%<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:58.100> I'm<00:03:58.460> going<00:03:58.610> to<00:03:58.670> put<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.940> mix<00:03:59.210> at

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
50% and I'm going to put the mix at

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.950 
50% and I'm going to put the mix at
around<00:03:59.510> 10%<00:04:00.610> so<00:04:01.610> you<00:04:01.700> can<00:04:01.850> take<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.180> listen<00:04:02.570> and

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
around 10% so you can take a listen and

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.480 
around 10% so you can take a listen and
hear<00:04:03.050> what<00:04:03.350> it<00:04:03.440> sounds<00:04:03.800> like<00:04:03.860> without<00:04:04.070> that

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
hear what it sounds like without that

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:11.200 
hear what it sounds like without that
reverb<00:04:06.220> here's<00:04:07.220> with<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.460> reverb<00:04:10.090> so<00:04:11.090> now

let's<00:04:11.390> go<00:04:11.540> over<00:04:11.630> to<00:04:11.690> controllers<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.470> see<00:04:12.650> how

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
let's go over to controllers and see how

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.820 
let's go over to controllers and see how
we're<00:04:12.890> going<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.070> control<00:04:13.370> this<00:04:14.350> I'm<00:04:15.350> going<00:04:15.710> to

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
we're going to control this I'm going to

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.849 
we're going to control this I'm going to
assign<00:04:16.460> my<00:04:17.000> plexi<00:04:17.570> lead<00:04:17.750> 100<00:04:18.260> bright<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:18.830> a

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
assign my plexi lead 100 bright to a

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.680 
assign my plexi lead 100 bright to a
footswitch<00:04:19.460> I'm<00:04:19.820> going<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.000> put<00:04:20.120> that<00:04:20.239> on<00:04:20.359> foot

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
footswitch I'm going to put that on foot

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.650 
footswitch I'm going to put that on foot
switch<00:04:20.960> to<00:04:21.440> because<00:04:22.010> whenever<00:04:22.310> I<00:04:22.760> select<00:04:23.180> my

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
switch to because whenever I select my

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.320 
switch to because whenever I select my
modulation<00:04:24.530> I<00:04:24.770> want<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.370> amp<00:04:25.580> model<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.120> turn

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
modulation I want the amp model to turn

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.450 
modulation I want the amp model to turn
off<00:04:26.540> so<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.900> get<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.140> nice<00:04:27.290> clean<00:04:27.680> signal<00:04:27.950> going

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
off so I get a nice clean signal going

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.000 
off so I get a nice clean signal going
in<00:04:28.610> for<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.510> rotary<00:04:29.870> drum<00:04:30.200> so<00:04:30.710> that's<00:04:30.860> going

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
in for the rotary drum so that's going

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.860 
in for the rotary drum so that's going
