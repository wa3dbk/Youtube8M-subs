00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.150
 we live in the midst of numbers often 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.719
 we do not notice this 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:18.939
 phenomenon is not unlike what 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:22.250
 happens with the famous letter stolen in the 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.040
 tale of poe the numbers escape the 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.520
 our look because I'm in a certain 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:34.340
 too much sense the numbers are 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:40.430
 cultural objects even before that 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:42.530
 concepts that are the proud through i 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.010
 which and fabric 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.160
 our way of seeing the world there 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.160
 surrounds 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.850
 obviously the first numbers and those that 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.800
 in a sense they are also coded 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:02.870
 in our neuronal circuits are i 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:07.430
 numbers for the positive 12 34 c already e 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:11.930
 these numbers contain a good one 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.050
 dose of mystery is so true that to the of 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.490
 beyond their obvious applications to 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.550
 everyday life that is to bring 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.650
 calculate are also loads of 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.580
 symbolic meanings of all cultures 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.150
 through all ages and by 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.770
 religious meanings but you say 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.580
 of course we all remember the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.680
 superstitions surrounding the numbers 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.720
 as 13 17 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:44.390
 beyond the natural integers state 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.220
 the numbers are narrow 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.720
 irrational there are complex numbers and 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.049
 other families of numbers even more 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.130
 exotic often and willingly 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:01.729
 history of mathematics in general for 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.950
 have a look even more panoramic 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:09.039
 to link two concepts 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.680
 elementary it is necessary to pass 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:16.040
 through correct and physical concepts 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.439
 more and more generally there is always in a 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.290
 some sense a reason hidden in 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:23.239
 mathematics, that is, as a great man said 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.909
 mathematician of the twentieth century will be michael 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.029
 patia there is always a reason more 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.029
 deep
