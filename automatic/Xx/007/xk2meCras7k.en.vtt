00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:10.570
 Thank you very much for meeting today . 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.440
 A lot of things this time 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:17.490
 We put you the inconvenience 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.490
 I am sorry 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.450
 a 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.860
 About mother 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.860
 I will explain 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:54.359
 There was a report as to whether the mother had received welfare support and said that 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.359
 It is a fact 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:12.460
 It is time when we received welfare support 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:15.900
 It is time when you have no work as an entertainer yet 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.930
 At that time the mother was alone 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.450
 I worked at the supermarket's fresh fish 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.180
 Around that time 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.980
 I was sick and sick 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:35.360
 I went to the doctor and it took a doctor stop 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.360
 The mother has decided by himself in the form of receiving welfare 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.950
 At that time 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.820
 From the direction of welfare 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.820
 I received a story that I could not take care of my mother. 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.520
 My annual income at that time was less than 1 million yen 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:00.350
 At this stage 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.970
 Sorry, but the fact that you will not be able to take care of mother 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:08.300
 On the cheek of Bushi 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.300
 We were allowed to return towards the documents and wrote one-stroke 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:18.260
 I will do my best 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:21.760
 I wanted to get out of life protection early 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.760
 It does not go well in reality 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.610
 The receipt of the welfare of the mother started from Sugo 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.519
 I 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.530
 By coming out to Tokyo and appearing on TV 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:46.490
 It takes a considerable amount of time 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:50.770
 Even during environmental changes much less myself I will get married 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.770
 I could have a family inside myself 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.900
 Even after leaving Tokyo 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.310
 My by investment 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.310
 Even my wife 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.099
 Now I make a living ask them to a byte 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.060
 Only when a few years have passed since then 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.880
 nationwide 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.880
 To a television show 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.850
 I can let out 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.410
 From the welfare office 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.970
 I received a story that I can not help my mother 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.310
 Bring the story back to your family 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.599
 On which it was firmly story 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.599
 In charge of welfare 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.120
 If you can help 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:57.709
 However, I do my best as I can now 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.870
 Let's make the cheek of the blessed person a story that you can not help but you still want to 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.819
 Thank you 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.819
 We returned processing luck 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.900
 Several years have passed since then and from the welfare office again 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:23.009
 I would like to hear from you say that you can increase the amount of increase support 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.900
 again 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.900
 And have your story and those of family 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.840
 Make sure to increase the amount of fire 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.460
 The amount of money delayed every month 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.990
 Please present 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:47.650
 Talk and discuss with the welfare 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.650
 We were allowed to return towards the documents decided to increase 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.990
 So far after consulting with all the welfare people 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:02.040
 So it was decided 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:02.040
 Whether there is any problem regarding things 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.150
 I could not even imagine 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:13.880
 Now 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:16.090
 I am deeply sorry that I thought it was a very sweet idea 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.090
 was 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:42.460
 My job is doing 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.460
 My income is not stable at all
