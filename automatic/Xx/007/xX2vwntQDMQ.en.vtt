00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.740
 in the question that came to our use 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.050
 a viewer suggests us men 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.150

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.370
 share with us trends in 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.440

 Andres Garzón at Las Heras and today we are going to 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.420
 make cuts to show textures 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.420
 male trained 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.600
 the first cut that we have designed 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:38.430
 it's a bit radical around the perimeter 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:42.450
 with a faded graphics 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.450
 descending to the front 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.769
 the hair cut 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.870
 is part of the personality is part of 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.910
 the expression of each one 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.980
 yes 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.950
 i 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.690
 they call it a lot your fish that are like 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.190
 boats with a lot of volume in the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.070
 Top of the rose be the fronts 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.580
 it's very important to have as 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.090
 allies to mold the hair 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.320
 Texturizers are the foams the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.320
 shine in silicone 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.580
 There are several trends in several 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.000
 influences is the part of everything 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.640
 English of everything that are movements 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.270
 volumes in the part 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.260
 of the forehead the falls there is also another 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.610
 information that is the rebellious part 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.250
 d 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.140
 to zero degrees the entire perimeter 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.530
 of 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.990
 head and create a lot of movement and 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.990
 texture on top 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.490
 in that other alternative to comb 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.650
 these cuts are going to work those 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.960
 very clean sides are now 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.590
 faced by the machine doing 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.360
 degrees as before was not with machine 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.110
 but they were with glitter with 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.660
 rubber bands but this part insults me 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:24.610
 volumes on the top is a 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.459
 look very very very very clean already very 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.519
 galán also then they will see what is 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.030
 a very cool alternative for the 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.030
 modern men 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.740
 Y 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.320
 can not use everything that exists 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.110
 I for example part that I love 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.060
 study and be at the forefront in 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.100
 how about techniques and that I love 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.100
 investigate I love to be aware of 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.960
 the cinema has a lot of cinema 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.580
 information because there is evocation of 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.950
 all the times 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.950
 the magazines the internet 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.189
 Question 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.840
 all right 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.040
 this cut much too much 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.579
 rebellion 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.269
 is to expand them wet the top 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:44.140
 not so linear and so narrow but a little 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.359
 wider with a lot of texture always 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:51.379
 fading the part of the crown 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:54.519
 towards the forehead but I want it to look 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.519
 a lot of texture 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:20.150
 if you're a little cooler winter if 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.210
 you're more summer like the movement in 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.660
 the colors that you like to handle 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:30.580
 not introverted and extroverted that can 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:35.970
 to be adapted to fall into the error of 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.970
 and put on the look that looks like someone
