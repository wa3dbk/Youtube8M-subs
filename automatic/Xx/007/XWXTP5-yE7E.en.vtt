00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
the faster you clean them more you know

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.610 
the faster you clean them more you know
to<00:05:12.210> create<00:05:12.389> your<00:05:12.539> chance<00:05:12.900> of<00:05:13.020> success<00:05:13.080> of

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
want to keep moving around like this

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.500 
want to keep moving around like this
maybe<00:05:19.080> leave<00:05:19.350> it<00:05:19.470> out<00:05:19.560> for<00:05:19.770> a<00:05:19.830> couple<00:05:20.039> days<00:05:20.510> and

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
maybe leave it out for a couple days and

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.180 
maybe leave it out for a couple days and
then<00:05:21.570> once<00:05:22.139> you<00:05:22.229> got<00:05:22.380> it<00:05:22.470> like<00:05:22.620> this<00:05:22.740> come<00:05:23.010> back

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
then once you got it like this come back

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.710 
then once you got it like this come back
the<00:05:23.310> next<00:05:23.340> day<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:23.639> flip<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.030> so<00:05:24.389> you<00:05:24.510> get<00:05:24.630> the
