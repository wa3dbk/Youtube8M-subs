00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 miau 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:42.500
 the 731 pokemon all this starts with 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.990
 the first editions of pokemon red 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.960
 and win 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.870
 but not any rectangle but the 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.580
 early Japanese versions that 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:57.370
 supposedly they were 151 cartridges 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.860
 altered with objective purposes that 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.480
 later that would be known as the 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.080
 lavender ton syndrome 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.909
 what happened was that the player after 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.460
 go through the game to the point where 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.150
 was this town 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.010
 whose story was that in that place the 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.869
 pokemon were going to rest after 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.659
 a prosperous life with your trainers 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.210
 like all pokemon game the tower 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.900
 It was full of trainers tombs and 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.060
 sinister type pokemon and ghosts 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.000
 but when we try to go out to capture 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.070
 some pokemon in the tall grass that 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.040
 was next to the tower things were 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.650
 they put a little 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.740
 weird so to speak 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.930
 since in the third box of grass that 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.470
 It was stuck to the hill above 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.620
 down from the trees something happened the 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.170
 background music was altered 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.170
 and at that point things came out of the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.370
 reality of the game first the player 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.920
 was attacked by the 731 pokemon which 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.860
 It's a strange thing because the beginning of 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.850
 battles always says the name of the 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.330
 attacking pokemon 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.710
 and also his sprite 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.710
 it was something out of the ordinary 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.069
 said sprite changed shape in the 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.489
 which one could appreciate a building 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.670
 unknown so far what seemed 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.650
 a scientist with a face mask 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.599
 holding a human body 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.930
 to the imperial flag of the army 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.470
 Japanese fascist with the kanjis empire 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.020
 in a corner 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.290
 and other sprays and recognizable by their 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.290
 low quality 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.550
 all these sprites came from 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.310
 Empire of the Second World War 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.280
 where japan joined the fascist army 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.650
 from germany or better known as the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.439
 nazi army 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:03.560
 there's the first point of all this 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:03.560
 issue of number 731 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.569
 do not 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.569
 no no no 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.640
 do not 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.090
 Division 1 conducted investigations 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:26.340
 about bubonic plague 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.760
 anthrax and tuberculosis 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.280
 humans using for this purpose 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.989
 he built a prison with capacity for 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.989
 300 to 400 prisoners 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.060
 Division 2 was in charge of testing the 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.640
 biological weapons focusing on the 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.650
 design and manufacture of devices for 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.769
 spread pathogens and parasites 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.510
 division 3 was busy producing 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.590
 projectiles loaded with agents 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.370
 pathogens 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.540
 Division 4 produced various materials 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.540
 for the experiments 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.060
 division 5 trained the new 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.680
 staff members the divisions 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:16.060
 6 7 and 8 units of medical supplies and 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.940
 administrative 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.030
 and now the why of this in a game of 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.310
 pokemon what was his purpose 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.340
 It all begins one night either for 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.660
 Mr. Nakamura one of the managers 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.810
 of game freak 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.600
 but a few minutes later his son died 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.090
 in a traffic accident just the 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.280

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.849

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.029
 head 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.940
 in his chest the exchanges were written 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:50.880
 of emperor 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.470
 his other son died because the 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.990
 midnight Lord Nakamura 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.350
 I put a pair of headphones with the tone 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.000
 key in seeing sounding repetitively 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.000
 hours later he got up by the effects 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.129
 of the tournament he took a knife and he 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.259
 he cut the empire swaps from his chest 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:15.539
 I try to attack the passengers of a 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:18.479
 close car struggled then escaped 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:22.149
 they chased him until he was eliminated 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:26.099
 the next day Mr. Nakamura 

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:29.379
 committed suicide near midnight 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.870
 minutes before the games were 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.980
 revealed 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.150
 hanging from a tree in the forest 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.750

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.990
 fake 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.610
 Lord Nakamura's body was 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.280
 found the next day by the 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.670
 police 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.500
 Lord Nakamura carried in his chest 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:58.860
 the swaps of empires 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.870
 Mr. hardware received the letter the 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.060
 which for reasons of respect the 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:08.230
 researcher did not disclose his entire 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:11.710
 the letter said the following 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.620
 loved ones to double today is the beginning of 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.740
 a new era in japan 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.360
 a new empire of which I am 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.900
 responsable 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.599
 I can not like to delay member my 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.249
 creation revealed in the following 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:29.099
 months 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:31.569
 visions of my father 's work me 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:33.650
 torments 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:36.400
 our dear what 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.770
 will be the first martyr of the new empire 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:43.430
 followed by my other son as our 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:45.700
 collapsing society uprooted by its 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:49.060
 own youth 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:52.220
 a phoenix must rise from the ashes 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:56.150
 the new great Japanese empire 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:59.240
 the rest of the letter was omitted 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:01.700
 the attempts of Mr. Nakamura to create 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.730
 a new Japanese empire were more than 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:07.430
 obvious turning all children 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.720
 that they bought the game in warriors 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.970
 New Empire 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.930
 but that explains the visions of the Lord 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:19.020
 Nakamura Division 4 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:22.380
 Mr. Nakamura's father fuses 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.510
 tamura work producing materials 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:28.620
 according to the Lord's version 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:31.120
 harold the father of Lord Nakamura was 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.699
 a very conservative man 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.900
 had an imperial flag of japan in 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:39.880
 his wall and followed all the traditions 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:43.540
 what influenced the youth of the Lord 

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:46.500
 the camera now we know the background of 

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:50.150
 these versions of pokemon and their relationship 

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:55.510
 with unit 731 

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.510
 myth or reality judge yourselves
