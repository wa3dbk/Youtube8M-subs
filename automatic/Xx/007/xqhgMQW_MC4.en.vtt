Museum<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.720> Natural<00:00:03.899> Science<00:00:04.410> I<00:00:04.620> asked<00:00:05.040> him<00:00:05.160> if

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
Museum of Natural Science I asked him if

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.380 
Museum of Natural Science I asked him if
he<00:00:05.279> could<00:00:05.370> tell<00:00:05.549> me<00:00:05.640> more<00:00:05.670> about<00:00:05.850> oil<00:00:06.210> and

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
he could tell me more about oil and

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.700 
he could tell me more about oil and
especially<00:00:06.690> where<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.140> find<00:00:07.350> it

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
especially where to find it

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.290

welcome to the Houston Museum of Natural
Science<00:00:09.960> you've<00:00:10.260> come<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.679> right<00:00:10.800> place

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
Science you've come to the right place

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.799 
Science you've come to the right place
if<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.370> want<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.580> learn<00:00:11.639> about<00:00:11.700> oil<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.330> learned

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
if you want to learn about oil I learned

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.480 
if you want to learn about oil I learned
in<00:00:12.960> school<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.380> oil<00:00:13.590> gas<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:13.950> coal<00:00:14.219> are

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
in school that oil gas and coal are

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.890 
in school that oil gas and coal are
called<00:00:14.700> fossil<00:00:15.179> fuels<00:00:15.389> because<00:00:15.509> they're<00:00:15.750> made

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
called fossil fuels because they're made

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.029 
called fossil fuels because they're made
from<00:00:16.049> plants<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.410> animals<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.830> lived

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
from plants and animals that lived

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.859 
from plants and animals that lived
millions<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.609> years<00:00:17.699> ago<00:00:17.850> that's<00:00:18.359> correct<00:00:18.660> but

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
millions of years ago that's correct but

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.300 
millions of years ago that's correct but
we<00:00:18.990> actually<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.439> start<00:00:19.529> further<00:00:20.010> back

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
we actually have to start further back

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.500 
we actually have to start further back
than<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.670> when<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> earth<00:00:20.939> was<00:00:21.240> first

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
than that when the earth was first

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.870 
than that when the earth was first
forming<00:00:21.930> really<00:00:22.410> billions<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.220> years<00:00:23.460> ago<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
forming really billions of years ago the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.550 
forming really billions of years ago the
Earth's<00:00:24.060> crust<00:00:24.359> began<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.869> move<00:00:25.080> around<00:00:25.230> on

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
Earth's crust began to move around on

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.109 
Earth's crust began to move around on
top<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.039> Earth's<00:00:26.220> hot<00:00:26.430> liquid<00:00:26.820> center

top of the Earth's hot liquid center

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.419 
top of the Earth's hot liquid center
this<00:00:27.570> movement<00:00:28.109> created<00:00:28.470> spaces<00:00:28.800> between<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
this movement created spaces between the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.910 
this movement created spaces between the
land<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> sedimentary<00:00:30.539> basins<00:00:31.140> let<00:00:31.650> me<00:00:31.710> show

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
land on a sedimentary basins let me show

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.490 
land on a sedimentary basins let me show
you<00:00:32.000> that's<00:00:33.000> what<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.360> call<00:00:33.630> research<00:00:34.050> just

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
you that's what I call research just

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.470 
you that's what I call research just
imagine<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.250> chocolate<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> land

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
imagine that the chocolate is the land

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.600 
imagine that the chocolate is the land
and<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.140> chewy<00:00:37.350> caramel<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:38.160> here<00:00:38.489> it's

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
and the chewy caramel is here it's

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.580 
and the chewy caramel is here it's
liquid<00:00:38.790> Center<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.629> see<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.930> sunken<00:00:40.320> space

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
liquid Center you see the sunken space

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.280 
liquid Center you see the sunken space
is<00:00:40.800> opening<00:00:41.190> these<00:00:41.790> basins<00:00:42.480> made<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> perfect

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
is opening these basins made the perfect

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.490 
is opening these basins made the perfect
places<00:00:43.500> for<00:00:43.680> oil<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.129> gas<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.309> cool<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:46.079> what

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
places for oil and gas to cool so what

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.260 
places for oil and gas to cool so what
happened<00:00:46.800> after<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> basins<00:00:47.430> formed<00:00:47.730> these

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
happened after the basins formed these

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.569 
happened after the basins formed these

microscopic plants and animals thrived
in<00:00:55.079> these<00:00:55.199> basins<00:00:55.590> how<00:00:56.039> did<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> plants<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
in these basins how did the plants and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.700 
in these basins how did the plants and
animals<00:00:57.180> become<00:00:57.480> oil<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.140> plants<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
animals become oil the plants and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.680 
animals become oil the plants and
animals<00:00:59.010> died<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.609> their<00:00:59.699> remains<00:00:59.850> piled<00:01:00.449> up

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690

on the basement floor this organic

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.880 
on the basement floor this organic
matter<00:01:03.059> eventually<00:01:03.750> transformed<00:01:04.470> into<00:01:04.680> oil

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
matter eventually transformed into oil

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.410

animals just decay and decompose under
normal<00:01:08.880> conditions<00:01:09.090> yes<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:10.439> oil<00:01:10.590> and

gas to form anaerobic conditions must
exist

what are anaerobic conditions those are

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.179 
what are anaerobic conditions those are
just<00:01:16.140> places<00:01:16.500> where<00:01:16.530> there's<00:01:16.740> no<00:01:16.920> oxygen

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
just places where there's no oxygen

just places where there's no oxygen
present<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.720> organic<00:01:19.080> material<00:01:19.470> was<00:01:19.619> then

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
present the organic material was then

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.590 
present the organic material was then
covered<00:01:20.100> by<00:01:20.250> sediment<00:01:20.759> forming<00:01:21.119> distinct

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
covered by sediment forming distinct

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.780 
covered by sediment forming distinct

at<00:01:23.850> this

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.719 

that's<00:01:30.189> cool

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
that's cool

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.910 
that's cool
so<00:01:31.180> once<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.930> organic<00:01:32.290> matter<00:01:32.409> is<00:01:32.619> covered

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
so once the organic matter is covered

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.249 
so once the organic matter is covered
with<00:01:33.040> sediment<00:01:33.250> how<00:01:33.850> does<00:01:34.119> it<00:01:34.240> become<00:01:34.360> oil<00:01:34.720> the

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
with sediment how does it become oil the
