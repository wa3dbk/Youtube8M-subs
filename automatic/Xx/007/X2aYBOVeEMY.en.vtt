zombies that I got with four of my

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.219 
zombies that I got with four of my
friends<00:01:05.650> a<00:01:06.280> couple<00:01:06.400> nights<00:01:07.060> ago<00:01:07.240> we<00:01:08.080> were

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
friends a couple nights ago we were

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.899 
friends a couple nights ago we were
playing<00:01:08.500> for<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.830> really<00:01:09.159> really<00:01:09.190> long<00:01:09.430> time

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
playing for a really really long time

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.820 
playing for a really really long time
and<00:01:10.240> this<00:01:10.810> is<00:01:10.960> one<00:01:11.110> of<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.260> best<00:01:11.439> games<00:01:11.560> that

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
and this is one of the best games that

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.240 
and this is one of the best games that
I've<00:01:11.920> had<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:12.340> far<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:13.680> didn't<00:01:14.680> want<00:01:14.830> to<00:01:14.890> do<00:01:15.010> the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
I've had so far I didn't want to do the

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.670 
I've had so far I didn't want to do the
whole<00:01:15.460> game<00:01:15.790> just<00:01:16.090> because<00:01:16.240> it<00:01:16.479> was<00:01:17.410> like<00:01:17.620> a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
whole game just because it was like a

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.590 
whole game just because it was like a
2-hour<00:01:17.950> game<00:01:18.400> or<00:01:18.610> maybe<00:01:18.790> even<00:01:18.880> three<00:01:19.270> hours

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
2-hour game or maybe even three hours

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.020 
2-hour game or maybe even three hours
because<00:01:19.840> we<00:01:20.170> spent<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.770> lot<00:01:20.800> of<00:01:21.010> time<00:01:21.160> in<00:01:21.700> the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
because we spent a lot of time in the

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.790 
because we spent a lot of time in the
middle<00:01:22.240> rounds<00:01:22.510> just<00:01:22.990> screwing<00:01:23.440> around<00:01:23.530> and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
middle rounds just screwing around and

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.000 
middle rounds just screwing around and
stuff<00:01:24.040> like<00:01:24.160> that<00:01:24.280> so<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.930> really<00:01:26.620> didn't<00:01:26.860> want

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
stuff like that so I really didn't want

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.790 
stuff like that so I really didn't want
to<00:01:27.070> do<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.220> series<00:01:27.490> on<00:01:27.820> it<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:29.020> I<00:01:29.050> just<00:01:29.290> chose<00:01:29.530> one

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
to do a series on it so I just chose one

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.170 
to do a series on it so I just chose one
of<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:29.980> better<00:01:30.130> rounds<00:01:30.550> towards<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.000> end

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
of the better rounds towards the end

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.390 
of the better rounds towards the end
this<00:01:31.870> wasn't<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.350> last<00:01:32.500> round<00:01:32.860> we<00:01:33.070> actually

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
this wasn't the last round we actually

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.910 
this wasn't the last round we actually
ended<00:01:33.580> up<00:01:33.670> making<00:01:34.390> it<00:01:34.600> all<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.840> way<00:01:34.930> around<00:01:35.050> 27

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
ended up making it all the way around 27

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.220 
ended up making it all the way around 27
and<00:01:36.130> we<00:01:36.970> just<00:01:37.150> kind<00:01:37.270> of<00:01:37.360> got<00:01:37.480> screwed<00:01:37.900> over<00:01:37.990> and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
and we just kind of got screwed over and

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.590 
and we just kind of got screwed over and
around<00:01:38.320> 27<00:01:39.010> because<00:01:39.400> we<00:01:39.790> all<00:01:39.910> ran<00:01:40.420> out<00:01:40.570> of

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
around 27 because we all ran out of

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.380 
around 27 because we all ran out of
weapons<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:41.470> we<00:01:42.250> just<00:01:42.460> got<00:01:42.790> overpowered

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
weapons and we just got overpowered

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.910 
weapons and we just got overpowered
within<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.780> first<00:01:44.020> leg<00:01:44.260> minute<00:01:44.620> or<00:01:44.740> so

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
within the first leg minute or so

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.410 
within the first leg minute or so
because<00:01:45.190> this<00:01:45.550> tactic<00:01:45.970> that<00:01:46.120> we're<00:01:46.270> using

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
because this tactic that we're using

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.530 
because this tactic that we're using
right<00:01:46.720> now<00:01:47.340> slowly<00:01:48.340> gets<00:01:48.640> less<00:01:49.300> and<00:01:49.330> less

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
right now slowly gets less and less

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.560 
right now slowly gets less and less
effective<00:01:50.140> as<00:01:50.290> you<00:01:50.380> can<00:01:50.530> see<00:01:51.360> even<00:01:52.360> in<00:01:52.480> this

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
effective as you can see even in this

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.480 
effective as you can see even in this
round<00:01:52.870> we<00:01:53.020> kind<00:01:53.230> of<00:01:53.290> we<00:01:53.500> kind<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:53.740> got<00:01:53.830> lucky<00:01:54.250> in

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
round we kind of we kind of got lucky in

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.820 
round we kind of we kind of got lucky in
a<00:01:54.700> sense<00:01:54.730> that<00:01:55.090> we<00:01:55.750> got<00:01:55.900> that<00:01:56.020> max<00:01:56.260> ammo<00:01:56.530> there

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
a sense that we got that max ammo there

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.380 
a sense that we got that max ammo there
because<00:01:57.159> without<00:01:57.400> it<00:01:57.580> we<00:01:57.760> probably<00:01:58.120> wouldn't

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
because without it we probably wouldn't

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.030 
because without it we probably wouldn't
have<00:01:58.510> gone<00:01:58.540> far<00:01:58.990> and<00:01:59.320> you'll<00:01:59.680> actually<00:01:59.770> notice

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
have gone far and you'll actually notice

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.760 
have gone far and you'll actually notice
it<00:02:00.310> later<00:02:00.490> in<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.700> video<00:02:00.790> I<00:02:01.210> do<00:02:01.600> skip<00:02:02.500> around

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
it later in the video I do skip around

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.560 
it later in the video I do skip around
when<00:02:03.070> we<00:02:03.190> leave<00:02:03.370> this<00:02:03.550> area<00:02:03.790> because<00:02:04.330> there's

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
when we leave this area because there's

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.120 
when we leave this area because there's
a<00:02:04.630> good<00:02:04.780> amount<00:02:04.900> of<00:02:05.080> time<00:02:05.290> that<00:02:05.350> we<00:02:05.680> spend<00:02:05.950> just

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
a good amount of time that we spend just

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.710 
a good amount of time that we spend just
running<00:02:06.490> around<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.820> map<00:02:07.030> when<00:02:07.420> they're<00:02:07.570> all

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
running around the map when they're all

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.169 
running around the map when they're all
out<00:02:07.870> of<00:02:07.900> ammo<00:02:08.140> because<00:02:09.129> at<00:02:09.580> first<00:02:09.789> we<00:02:10.000> didn't

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
out of ammo because at first we didn't

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.910 
out of ammo because at first we didn't
know<00:02:10.239> what<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.479> do<00:02:10.659> and<00:02:10.899> then<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.560> just<00:02:11.799> decided

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
know what to do and then I just decided

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.070 
know what to do and then I just decided
to<00:02:12.250> buy<00:02:12.400> more<00:02:12.580> ammo<00:02:12.849> for<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:13.150> 70<00:02:13.420> for<00:02:13.629> you<00:02:13.810> so

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
to buy more ammo for this 70 for you so

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.509 
to buy more ammo for this 70 for you so
that'll<00:02:14.349> be<00:02:14.409> later<00:02:14.620> on<00:02:14.830> you'll<00:02:15.040> see<00:02:15.129> that<00:02:15.400> it

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
that'll be later on you'll see that it

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.600 
that'll be later on you'll see that it
skips<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.150> sorry<00:02:16.599> about<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:17.280> but<00:02:18.280> yeah<00:02:18.430> like

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
obviously I'm sure you all expected that

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.819 
obviously I'm sure you all expected that
but<00:03:00.310> aside<00:03:00.730> from<00:03:00.790> him<00:03:01.319> think<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:02.409> people<00:03:02.709> that

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
but aside from him think the people that

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.199 
but aside from him think the people that
I<00:03:02.889> did<00:03:03.040> this<00:03:03.159> game<00:03:03.400> with<00:03:03.579> we're<00:03:03.760> on<00:03:03.879> the<00:03:03.970> top<00:03:04.180> of

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
I did this game with we're on the top of

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.710 
I did this game with we're on the top of
the<00:03:04.359> leaderboards<00:03:04.810> for<00:03:04.900> our<00:03:05.079> friends<00:03:05.459> and

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
the leaderboards for our friends and

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.819 
the leaderboards for our friends and
yeah<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:07.750> guess<00:03:07.900> that's<00:03:08.109> it<00:03:08.200> for<00:03:08.409> the<00:03:08.470> gameplay

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
yeah I guess that's it for the gameplay

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.229 
yeah I guess that's it for the gameplay
if<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.099> guys<00:03:09.220> want<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.489> see<00:03:09.609> more<00:03:09.790> zombies

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
if you guys want to see more zombies

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.970 
if you guys want to see more zombies

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
gameplay I could either do a series with

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.149 
gameplay I could either do a series with
four<00:03:12.400> people<00:03:13.000> or<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.299> could<00:03:13.450> do<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.569> solo<00:03:13.870> or<00:03:14.319> I

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
four people or I could do a solo or I

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.099 
four people or I could do a solo or I
could<00:03:15.370> just<00:03:15.400> do<00:03:15.639> game<00:03:16.180> plays<00:03:16.420> like<00:03:16.629> this<00:03:16.870> where

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
could just do game plays like this where

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.300 
could just do game plays like this where
if<00:03:17.200> we<00:03:17.230> have<00:03:17.409> a<00:03:17.439> round<00:03:17.829> that<00:03:18.010> we<00:03:18.129> just

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
if we have a round that we just

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.899 
if we have a round that we just
absolutely<00:03:18.909> destroy<00:03:19.450> zombies<00:03:20.549> then<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:21.670> can

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
absolutely destroy zombies then you can
