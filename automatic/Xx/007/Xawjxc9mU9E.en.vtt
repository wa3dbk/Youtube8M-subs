00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:08.570
 hello today we are going to learn how to wrap 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.240
 a book or a rectangular frame of this 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.610
 original shape by helping us with a 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.980
 handkerchief without needing anything more than a 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.320
 handkerchief 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.099
 the result as you can see is very nice 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.099
 I hope you like it 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.490
 Well, since we 're going to give away a 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.840
 book or an elongated frame with a photo or 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.400
 something of that style because we're just going to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.890
 need that the gift in this case the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.890
 book and the handkerchief that we are going to expand 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.550
 we will start stretching our 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.470
 handkerchief on a smooth surface for 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.350
 catch our book 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.020
 and start wrapping them with the tip 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.860
 towards the back 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.790
 and we started to wrap it like that with the 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.790
 well stretched handkerchief 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.059
 until we have done enough 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.700
 turns to have used the 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.640
 whole handkerchief 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.630
 the last end as it says this that 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.200
 it stands out we're going to leave it down 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.200
 for now 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.820
 ok then we would have 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.810
 the extremes and all the rest would be 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.830
 wrapped up about our book we're going to 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.400
 take now the two ends as you see and 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.970
 we are going to interweave those without knotting 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.240
 ok is that we pass one for each side 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.060
 and then to the sides upwards the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.979
 work is going to repeat with a lateral 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.440
 I take it to this side the other side 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.630
 to the other side and then the side as 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.929
 below it goes up and the east 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.679
 downwards it's good, well, not the 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.869
 we have well past tightened well and 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.810
 let's go around our 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.780
 package you see that here was 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.660
 the remaining part that nothing will happen 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.970
 because now it will be well caught 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.370
 let's take the two extremes and let's 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.769
 just tie a knot 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.519
 so that it is fixed we will make another knot 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.519
 about this 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.930
 and finally we will just have to open 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.980
 well our handkerchief so that our 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.980
 tie look pretty 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.480
 and we would have wrapped up our book or a 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.300
 photo frame or something that this size 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.990
 so rectangular this wrapper of 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.870
 exact for a rectangular thing and it's 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.550
 very easy very apparent and it is really 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.630
