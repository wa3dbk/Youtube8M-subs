and prior to braiding I always find it

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.380

not work with the style that you're

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.719 
not work with the style that you're
going<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:32.280> make<00:01:32.430> sure<00:01:32.579> they're

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
going with but just make sure they're

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.880 
going with but just make sure they're
protected<00:01:32.909> for<00:01:33.420> example<00:01:34.020> by<00:01:34.439> making<00:01:34.770> sure

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
protected for example by making sure

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.069 
protected for example by making sure
that<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.220> section<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.970> hair<00:01:36.000> take<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
that the section of hair take for the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.679 
that the section of hair take for the
braid<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.650> not<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> tiny<00:01:39.090> section<00:01:39.420> with<00:01:39.659> a

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
braid is not like a tiny section with a

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.940 
braid is not like a tiny section with a
large<00:01:39.930> braid<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.610> careful<00:01:42.090> about<00:01:42.180> that

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
large braid so be careful about that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.679 
large braid so be careful about that
when<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.100> take<00:01:44.340> out<00:01:44.520> right<00:01:44.939> can<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.390> go

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
when you take out right can you just go

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.160 
when you take out right can you just go
into<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> new<00:01:46.229> set<00:01:46.909> no<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.450> should<00:01:48.630> ideally

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
into a new set no you should ideally

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.560 
into a new set no you should ideally
have<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> two<00:01:49.740> week<00:01:49.920> break<00:01:50.159> between<00:01:50.640> braids<00:01:51.149> to
