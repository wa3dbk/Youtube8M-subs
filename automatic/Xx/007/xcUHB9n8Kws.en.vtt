00:00:02.578 --> 00:00:03.398
What are you?

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:05.265
What do you mean?

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.880
I am Naveen Bansal

00:00:07.047 --> 00:00:09.580
Executive Regional Manager, Mokart.com

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:10.970
What are you?

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:12.710
Mr Jitendra Maheshwari

00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:13.975
Senior developer

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:16.849
But what are you?

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:18.575
My name is Yogendra Kumar Pandey

00:00:18.594 --> 00:00:20.126
And I am your Operations Incharge

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:22.008
What are you, man?

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.813
I am Saurabh Mandal

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.656
Marketing Head at Tecknity

00:00:26.613 --> 00:00:28.644
You are beer, you dumbfu*k.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:30.472
You are beer

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.206
I quit my job last night.

00:00:34.254 --> 00:00:34.839
Why ?

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.473
You have pitched your idea for
startup a hundred times.

00:00:36.473 --> 00:00:37.324
Why dont you do something?

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:39.789
Silicon Valley is coming up at Hiranandani

00:00:39.816 --> 00:00:41.606
This is the time

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:43.045
Jitu, you know what..

00:00:43.387 --> 00:00:46.332
Whenever we recieve your code,
we forward it without testing

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.143
Why to run and waste time?

00:00:48.184 --> 00:00:49.707
Jitu, entire task is dependent on tech end.

00:00:49.738 --> 00:00:51.378
How would we manage without you?

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:54.324
Please try to understand,
I cannot quit my job now.

00:00:55.152 --> 00:00:58.462
Sir, the staff has requested the lunch time
to be extended from 15 minutes to half an hour

00:00:58.502 --> 00:01:00.527
Denied.
Let them stay hungry and stay foolish.

00:01:00.613 --> 00:01:02.957
If we want our company to grow as big as Apple...

00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:04.527
Then he needs to be Steve Jobs,

00:01:04.552 --> 00:01:05.915
You need to be Steve Wozniak,

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:07.368
And I need to be Sean Parker

00:01:07.393 --> 00:01:09.326
Sean Parker was from Facebook

00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:11.383
You all are engineers, you need an MBA

00:01:11.408 --> 00:01:13.636
How would you run a company without business expertise?

00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:16.048
This is our shit Mandal. We dont need you.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.629
Mandal, I hope you are not a serial killer.

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:19.467
Only if looks could kill.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.725
Naveen, do you really think your idea is one in a million?

00:01:27.683 --> 00:01:30.024
But how would we get a funding, Bhati?

00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:31.307
How would it happen?

00:01:31.332 --> 00:01:32.713
Not everyone is as lucky as you are.

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:35.183
Finally something good is happening in my company.

00:01:35.183 --> 00:01:38.127
People are realizing my potential
I am a valuable employee to the company dude.

00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:40.362
Hey Naveen, we have no jobs.

00:01:40.662 --> 00:01:42.719
We have to start a company with or without Jitu.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:45.678
Look Yogi, without Jitu we have no company.

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:47.760
I really want to be a part of this.

00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:51.202
I wont do it for you,
I would do it for myself.

00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:53.353
Even if you think it is your passion...

00:01:53.378 --> 00:01:55.002
...and thats the reason you are quitting job.

00:01:55.857 --> 00:01:57.763
But this is not your passion, Naveen

00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:00.710
Leave the cushion of your salary and face the real world.

00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:04.002
You would then understand how luck is made.

00:02:04.027 --> 00:02:06.381
We want people in our company
who have some work experience.

00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:08.072
who have worked at a senior level.

00:02:08.097 --> 00:02:10.196
See, you need to figure out what they need.

00:02:10.315 --> 00:02:12.491
I would earn so much on getting funds,

00:02:12.516 --> 00:02:15.872
I will buy Mokart and sell it on OLX

00:02:15.897 --> 00:02:19.290
When the graduates of this country
get bored of their 9 to 5 jobs,

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.318
they think of just three ideas to get out of it.

00:02:24.322 --> 00:02:25.142
MBA,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.614
IAS,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.593
... or else STARTUP.

00:02:35.965 --> 00:02:37.658
We would become entrepreneurs
after quiting job!!

00:02:37.683 --> 00:02:39.278
Can you even spell entrepreneur?

00:02:39.338 --> 00:02:39.963
E-

00:02:39.988 --> 00:02:40.757
N-

00:02:40.782 --> 00:02:41.782
T-

00:02:43.453 --> 00:02:46.122
Hey. To be entrepreneurs, We need
the spirit not the spelling.
