off<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> chance<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.360> leaving<00:01:39.659> what<00:01:39.810> we

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
off you have a chance of leaving what we

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.350 
off you have a chance of leaving what we
call<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> hollow<00:01:40.439> straw<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> hollow<00:01:41.340> stock<00:01:41.790> so

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
call a hollow straw or a hollow stock so

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.420 
call a hollow straw or a hollow stock so
if<00:01:42.450> he<00:01:42.600> cuts<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.170> right<00:01:43.799> at<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> ground<00:01:44.220> like

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
if he cuts this right at the ground like

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.280 
if he cuts this right at the ground like
that<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.939> does<00:01:45.150> nothing<00:01:45.479> with<00:01:45.900> them<00:01:46.079> other

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
that and does nothing with them other

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.740 
that and does nothing with them other
than<00:01:46.409> remove<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.100> yucky<00:01:47.430> stalks<00:01:48.119> last<00:01:48.450> year's

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
than remove the yucky stalks last year's

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.719 
than remove the yucky stalks last year's
growth<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.829> have<00:01:49.860> what<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.340> would<00:01:50.579> consider

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
growth you have what we would consider

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.810 
growth you have what we would consider
to<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.299> hollow<00:01:51.689> straw<00:01:52.320> or<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:53.009> hollow<00:01:53.399> stock

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
to be a hollow straw or a hollow stock

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.730 
to be a hollow straw or a hollow stock
that<00:01:54.060> leads<00:01:54.299> directly<00:01:54.509> down<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.110> those<00:01:55.290> tubers

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
that leads directly down to those tubers

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.410 
that leads directly down to those tubers
and<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.159> wet<00:01:56.369> climate<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:56.939> us<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and in a wet climate like us in the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.749 
and in a wet climate like us in the
northwest<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.290> we<00:01:58.649> leave<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.009> exposed<00:01:59.490> all

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
northwest if we leave that exposed all

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.240 
northwest if we leave that exposed all
winter<00:02:00.060> most<00:02:01.020> likely<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.680> gonna<00:02:01.950> fill

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
winter most likely it's just gonna fill

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.130 
winter most likely it's just gonna fill
up<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:02.520> water<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.600> has<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> good<00:02:04.079> chance

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
up with water and that has a good chance

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.840 
up with water and that has a good chance
of<00:02:04.500> rotting<00:02:04.829> those<00:02:05.009> tubers<00:02:05.399> out<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.729> you'll

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
of rotting those tubers out and you'll

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.580 
of rotting those tubers out and you'll
have<00:02:06.060> nothing<00:02:06.240> by<00:02:06.570> spring<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.409> that's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
have nothing by spring so that's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.800 
have nothing by spring so that's
probably<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.130> number<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:08.970> problem<00:02:09.479> we<00:02:09.630> see

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
probably the number one problem we see

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.559 
probably the number one problem we see
in<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.079> northwest<00:02:11.070> is<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.459> they<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:12.299> leave

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
in the northwest is that they just leave

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.809 
in the northwest is that they just leave
them<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.080> nothing<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:14.099> we<00:02:14.280> really

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
them and do nothing so we really

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.580 
them and do nothing so we really
recommend<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.540> you're<00:02:15.750> going<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:16.140> leave<00:02:16.319> them

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
recommend if you're going to leave them

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.180 
recommend if you're going to leave them
in

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
in

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.270 
in
and<00:02:17.390> cover<00:02:18.390> them<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.320> cut<00:02:19.680> these<00:02:19.890> stocks

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
and cover them that you cut these stocks

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.070 
and cover them that you cut these stocks
down<00:02:20.550> now<00:02:20.790> they<00:02:20.940> could<00:02:21.150> be<00:02:21.270> cut<00:02:21.510> down<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.750> this

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
down now they could be cut down to this

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.160 
down now they could be cut down to this
height<00:02:22.350> or<00:02:22.980> cut<00:02:23.460> all<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.790> way<00:02:23.910> down<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.930> want

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
height or cut all the way down you want

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.840 
height or cut all the way down you want
to<00:02:25.290> cut<00:02:25.470> them<00:02:25.560> down<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:26.130> where<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.580> see<00:02:26.610> a

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
to cut them down to where you see a

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.300 
to cut them down to where you see a
solid<00:02:27.240> stock<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.320> he's<00:02:28.530> gonna<00:02:28.710> get<00:02:28.920> down<00:02:29.130> and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
solid stock so he's gonna get down and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.590 
solid stock so he's gonna get down and
you<00:02:29.370> can<00:02:29.550> already<00:02:29.730> see<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.000> there's<00:02:30.360> water

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
you can already see that there's water

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.470 
you can already see that there's water
just<00:02:31.530> sitting<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.190> stock<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:33.030> that's

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
just sitting in this stock and that's

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.270 
just sitting in this stock and that's
because<00:02:33.840> just<00:02:34.110> those<00:02:34.320> stocks<00:02:34.650> have<00:02:34.980> some

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
because just those stocks have some

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.520 
because just those stocks have some
moisture<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:35.850> them<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.360> if<00:02:36.690> we<00:02:36.900> leave<00:02:37.200> that

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
moisture in them and if we leave that

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.650 
moisture in them and if we leave that
exposed<00:02:38.130> that's<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:38.940> gonna<00:02:39.090> continue<00:02:39.390> to

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
exposed that's just gonna continue to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.750 
exposed that's just gonna continue to
fill<00:02:39.840> up<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.470> rot<00:02:40.740> down<00:02:40.920> those<00:02:41.190> tubers<00:02:41.580> so

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
fill up and rot down those tubers so

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.150 
fill up and rot down those tubers so
you're<00:02:41.940> going<00:02:42.360> till<00:02:42.960> you<00:02:42.990> get<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.590> solid

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
you're going till you get to a solid

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.640 
you're going till you get to a solid
stock<00:02:44.850> so<00:02:45.120> he's<00:02:45.300> gonna<00:02:45.450> go<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.930> should<00:02:45.990> be<00:02:46.260> just

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
stock so he's gonna go it should be just

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.930 
stock so he's gonna go it should be just
about<00:02:46.830> below<00:02:47.430> ground<00:02:47.820> level<00:02:49.520> he's<00:02:50.520> getting

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
about below ground level he's getting

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.550 
about below ground level he's getting
he's<00:02:51.390> getting<00:02:51.720> there<00:02:51.900> but<00:02:52.050> he's<00:02:52.170> got<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.440> keep

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
he's getting there but he's got to keep

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.580 
he's getting there but he's got to keep
going<00:02:52.830> until<00:02:53.070> he<00:02:53.310> gets<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.940> solid<00:02:54.510> stock<00:02:55.320> and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
going until he gets to a solid stock and

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.260 
going until he gets to a solid stock and
now<00:02:55.680> if<00:02:56.040> you're<00:02:56.220> covering<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.700> with<00:02:56.820> plastic

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
now if you're covering it with plastic

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.510 
now if you're covering it with plastic
you<00:02:58.020> wouldn't<00:02:58.350> necessarily<00:02:58.530> have<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.280> get<00:02:59.400> to

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
you wouldn't necessarily have to get to

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.730 
you wouldn't necessarily have to get to
the<00:02:59.640> solid<00:03:00.000> stock<00:03:00.240> it's<00:03:01.050> not<00:03:01.200> going<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.470> be<00:03:01.590> as

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
the solid stock it's not going to be as

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.500 
the solid stock it's not going to be as
important<00:03:02.280> because<00:03:02.580> there<00:03:02.820> isn't<00:03:02.970> going<00:03:03.360> to

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
important because there isn't going to

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.580 
important because there isn't going to
be<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.810> straw<00:03:04.170> left<00:03:04.470> open<00:03:04.830> for<00:03:04.860> moisture

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
be that straw left open for moisture

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.380 
be that straw left open for moisture
there<00:03:07.590> we're<00:03:08.250> gonna<00:03:08.340> get<00:03:08.550> down<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.880> solid

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
there we're gonna get down to that solid

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.150 
there we're gonna get down to that solid
like<00:03:09.540> we<00:03:09.690> said<00:03:09.900> now<00:03:10.050> again<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:10.710> is<00:03:10.890> really

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
like we said now again this is really

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.770 
like we said now again this is really
important<00:03:11.610> if<00:03:11.790> you're<00:03:12.060> not<00:03:12.270> going<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.660> do

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
important if you're not going to do

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.530 
important if you're not going to do
anything<00:03:13.170> other<00:03:13.920> than<00:03:14.190> remove<00:03:14.700> those<00:03:15.120> stocks

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
anything other than remove those stocks

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.650 
anything other than remove those stocks
so<00:03:15.980> there<00:03:16.980> we<00:03:17.100> go<00:03:17.250> we're<00:03:17.460> down<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.880> solid<00:03:18.120> and

plastic so it means cutting them off
just<00:03:36.180> flattening<00:03:36.720> out<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.870> ground<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.320> little

adding a heat protector in case we do
get<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.520> cold<00:04:20.820> snap<00:04:21.060> or<00:04:21.390> a<00:04:21.419> freeze<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.770> could

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
get a cold snap or a freeze this could

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.900 
get a cold snap or a freeze this could
be<00:04:23.190> hay<00:04:23.400> straw<00:04:24.330> leaves<00:04:25.169> dirt<00:04:25.979> whatever<00:04:26.610> you've

late<00:04:36.240> March<00:04:36.630> early<00:04:36.960> March<00:04:37.650> depends<00:04:38.100> on<00:04:38.190> where

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
late March early March depends on where

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.790 
late March early March depends on where
you<00:04:39.000> are<00:04:39.030> in<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.570> US<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:39.870> what<00:04:40.200> your<00:04:40.320> climates

weather has warmed up and we assume that

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.250 
weather has warmed up and we assume that
it's<00:04:47.340> getting<00:04:47.640> closer<00:04:47.850> to<00:04:48.180> growing<00:04:48.510> time<00:04:48.690> you

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
it's getting closer to growing time you

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.230 
it's getting closer to growing time you
might<00:04:49.590> in<00:04:49.800> your<00:04:49.830> area<00:04:50.310> want<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:50.700> put<00:04:50.850> some<00:04:51.030> slug

going<00:05:00.450> to<00:05:00.600> be<00:05:00.690> leaving<00:05:00.990> them<00:05:01.140> in<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.350> ground

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
going to be leaving them in the ground

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.650 
going to be leaving them in the ground
now<00:05:02.130> remember<00:05:02.580> if<00:05:02.790> you<00:05:03.060> left<00:05:03.300> them<00:05:03.480> in<00:05:03.570> the

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
now remember if you left them in the

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.330 
now remember if you left them in the
ground<00:05:03.810> you<00:05:04.110> have<00:05:04.380> to<00:05:04.560> make<00:05:04.680> sure<00:05:04.890> you're<00:05:05.070> in<00:05:05.220> a

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
ground you have to make sure you're in a

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.450 
ground you have to make sure you're in a
climate<00:05:05.820> that<00:05:06.390> they<00:05:06.570> will<00:05:06.780> not<00:05:07.080> freeze<00:05:07.860> if

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
climate that they will not freeze if

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.760 
climate that they will not freeze if
that<00:05:08.850> freeze<00:05:09.180> goes<00:05:09.540> down<00:05:09.840> six<00:05:10.290> inches<00:05:10.620> or

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
that freeze goes down six inches or

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.260 
that freeze goes down six inches or
wherever<00:05:10.950> those<00:05:11.160> tubers<00:05:11.550> are<00:05:11.670> located<00:05:12.150> in

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
wherever those tubers are located in

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.660 
wherever those tubers are located in
your<00:05:12.420> soil<00:05:12.630> they<00:05:13.290> are<00:05:13.410> gone<00:05:13.620> they<00:05:14.130> will<00:05:14.340> rock

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
your soil they are gone they will rock

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.060 
your soil they are gone they will rock
they<00:05:14.910> are<00:05:15.090> a<00:05:15.120> tuber<00:05:15.630> and<00:05:15.810> not<00:05:16.020> a<00:05:16.050> bulb<00:05:16.380> so

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
they are a tuber and not a bulb so

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.210 
they are a tuber and not a bulb so
freeze<00:05:17.810> destroys<00:05:18.810> them<00:05:19.110> so<00:05:19.410> yeah<00:05:19.740> so<00:05:19.920> the<00:05:20.010> more

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
freeze destroys them so yeah so the more

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.010 
freeze destroys them so yeah so the more
more<00:05:20.790> insulation<00:05:21.090> you<00:05:21.300> can<00:05:21.420> put<00:05:21.510> on<00:05:21.630> top<00:05:21.810> more

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
more insulation you can put on top more

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.460 
more insulation you can put on top more
soil<00:05:22.350> more<00:05:22.680> leaves<00:05:23.240> every<00:05:24.240> inch<00:05:24.420> is<00:05:24.720> really

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
soil more leaves every inch is really

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.320 
soil more leaves every inch is really
important<00:05:25.920> so<00:05:26.130> especially<00:05:26.850> the<00:05:27.090> colder

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
important so especially the colder

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.440 
important so especially the colder
climates<00:05:28.340> good<00:05:29.340> in<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.580> northwest<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.240> water

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
climates good in the northwest the water

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.960 
climates good in the northwest the water
the<00:05:30.840> raincoat<00:05:31.650> the<00:05:31.860> plastic<00:05:32.340> keeps<00:05:32.700> that

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
the raincoat the plastic keeps that

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.240 
the raincoat the plastic keeps that
water<00:05:33.270> off<00:05:33.570> of<00:05:33.750> them<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.260> dirt<00:05:34.470> the<00:05:34.950> straw

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
water off of them the dirt the straw

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.430 
water off of them the dirt the straw
will<00:05:35.850> add<00:05:36.030> blankets<00:05:36.480> of<00:05:36.570> warmth<00:05:36.840> if<00:05:36.990> you're<00:05:37.260> in

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
will add blankets of warmth if you're in

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.680 
will add blankets of warmth if you're in
the<00:05:37.590> East<00:05:37.620> Coast<00:05:38.190> back<00:05:38.520> in<00:05:38.670> the<00:05:38.760> Midwest<00:05:38.940> this

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
the East Coast back in the Midwest this

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.240 
the East Coast back in the Midwest this
is<00:05:39.900> not<00:05:40.110> even<00:05:40.380> an<00:05:40.620> option<00:05:40.740> for<00:05:41.160> you<00:05:41.220> to

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
is not even an option for you to

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.730 
is not even an option for you to
consider<00:05:41.370> because<00:05:42.090> your<00:05:42.330> cold<00:05:42.930> winters<00:05:43.470> will

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
consider because your cold winters will

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.290 
consider because your cold winters will
definitely<00:05:44.220> get<00:05:44.370> down<00:05:44.610> deeper<00:05:45.000> than<00:05:45.150> where

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
definitely get down deeper than where

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.780 
definitely get down deeper than where
those<00:05:45.480> tubers<00:05:45.900> are<00:05:46.220> for<00:05:47.220> those<00:05:47.340> of<00:05:47.550> you<00:05:47.640> that

option we're gonna show you how to go
ahead<00:05:55.230> and<00:05:55.620> dig<00:05:55.860> so<00:05:56.430> he's<00:05:56.610> gonna<00:05:56.760> go<00:05:56.970> ahead<00:05:57.060> and

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
ahead and dig so he's gonna go ahead and

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.850 
ahead and dig so he's gonna go ahead and
lop<00:05:57.510> this<00:05:57.780> old<00:05:57.990> plant<00:05:58.290> off<00:05:58.530> that<00:05:58.770> is

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
lop this old plant off that is

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.310 
lop this old plant off that is
definitely<00:05:59.400> taken<00:05:59.790> a<00:05:59.880> frost<00:06:00.150> and<00:06:00.540> get<00:06:01.110> rid<00:06:01.290> of

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
definitely taken a frost and get rid of

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.680 
definitely taken a frost and get rid of
those<00:06:01.560> old<00:06:01.830> stalks<00:06:02.190> last<00:06:02.520> year's<00:06:02.850> plant<00:06:03.270> and

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
those old stalks last year's plant and

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.020 
those old stalks last year's plant and
again<00:06:04.320> we've<00:06:04.500> told<00:06:05.250> you<00:06:05.340> about<00:06:05.490> the<00:06:05.730> open

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
again we've told you about the open

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.550 
again we've told you about the open
stalks<00:06:06.300> but<00:06:06.480> it<00:06:06.570> does<00:06:06.750> not<00:06:06.900> matter<00:06:07.140> at<00:06:07.380> this

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
stalks but it does not matter at this

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.770 
stalks but it does not matter at this
point<00:06:07.890> he<00:06:08.160> doesn't<00:06:08.370> have<00:06:08.760> to<00:06:09.420> worry<00:06:09.630> about

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
point he doesn't have to worry about

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.210 
point he doesn't have to worry about
cutting<00:06:10.260> that<00:06:10.380> stock<00:06:10.650> all<00:06:10.830> the<00:06:10.920> way<00:06:11.040> down

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
cutting that stock all the way down

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.740 
cutting that stock all the way down
because<00:06:11.370> he's<00:06:11.700> gonna<00:06:11.880> be<00:06:12.030> digging<00:06:12.330> the<00:06:12.480> clump

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
because he's gonna be digging the clump

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.660 
because he's gonna be digging the clump
out<00:06:12.870> and<00:06:13.170> that<00:06:13.290> stocks<00:06:13.620> not<00:06:13.860> gonna<00:06:14.160> be<00:06:14.310> open

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:14.670 
out and that stocks not gonna be open

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.580 
out and that stocks not gonna be open
for<00:06:15.240> water<00:06:15.450> cuz<00:06:15.780> it's<00:06:15.930> gonna<00:06:16.050> get<00:06:16.230> cut<00:06:16.440> off

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
for water cuz it's gonna get cut off

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.350 
for water cuz it's gonna get cut off
when<00:06:16.800> we<00:06:16.950> do<00:06:17.160> divide<00:06:17.550> make<00:06:17.850> sure<00:06:18.030> you<00:06:18.150> see<00:06:18.330> that

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
when we do divide make sure you see that

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.350 
when we do divide make sure you see that
video<00:06:18.800> later<00:06:19.800> that<00:06:20.220> we<00:06:20.340> have<00:06:20.460> also<00:06:20.700> shown<00:06:21.120> you

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
video later that we have also shown you

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.630 
video later that we have also shown you
so<00:06:22.140> we're<00:06:22.230> gonna<00:06:22.320> go<00:06:22.530> around<00:06:22.620> the<00:06:23.190> clump<00:06:23.460> with

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
so we're gonna go around the clump with

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.450 
so we're gonna go around the clump with
a<00:06:23.670> fork<00:06:24.120> which<00:06:24.360> allows<00:06:24.750> us<00:06:25.080> to<00:06:25.290> hopefully<00:06:25.470> lift

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
a fork which allows us to hopefully lift

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.460 
a fork which allows us to hopefully lift
up<00:06:26.820> those<00:06:27.060> tubers<00:06:27.480> without<00:06:27.750> snapping<00:06:28.080> them

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
up those tubers without snapping them

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.350 
up those tubers without snapping them
all<00:06:28.740> off<00:06:29.010> so<00:06:29.340> he's<00:06:29.520> gonna<00:06:29.670> go<00:06:29.850> around<00:06:30.180> and

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
all off so he's gonna go around and

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.960 
all off so he's gonna go around and
around<00:06:30.740> lift<00:06:31.740> them<00:06:31.950> up<00:06:31.980> you<00:06:32.310> can<00:06:32.520> use<00:06:32.700> shovels

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
around lift them up you can use shovels

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.060 
around lift them up you can use shovels
and<00:06:33.390> you<00:06:33.480> do<00:06:33.660> have<00:06:33.840> a<00:06:33.900> chance<00:06:34.230> no<00:06:34.500> matter<00:06:34.740> what

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
and you do have a chance no matter what

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.070 
and you do have a chance no matter what
of<00:06:35.310> breaking<00:06:35.940> some<00:06:36.180> of<00:06:36.300> the<00:06:36.360> tubers<00:06:36.720> or<00:06:36.840> maybe

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
of breaking some of the tubers or maybe

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.080 
of breaking some of the tubers or maybe
even<00:06:37.200> poking<00:06:37.860> through<00:06:38.130> one<00:06:38.550> of<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.760> tubers

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
even poking through one of the tubers

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.780 
even poking through one of the tubers
won't<00:06:39.720> hurt<00:06:40.080> it<00:06:40.230> at<00:06:40.380> all<00:06:40.620> don't<00:06:41.070> be<00:06:41.250> afraid<00:06:41.640> if

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 
won't hurt it at all don't be afraid if

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.250 
won't hurt it at all don't be afraid if
you<00:06:41.940> snap<00:06:42.150> one<00:06:42.450> tuber<00:06:42.840> off

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
you snap one tuber off

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.650 
you snap one tuber off
or<00:06:43.410> if<00:06:43.860> you<00:06:43.950> poke<00:06:44.460> it<00:06:44.490> with<00:06:44.640> the<00:06:44.910> fork<00:06:45.210> it'll<00:06:45.540> be

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
or if you poke it with the fork it'll be

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.050 
or if you poke it with the fork it'll be
just<00:06:45.960> fine

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
just fine

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.280 
just fine
these<00:06:48.060> clumps<00:06:48.390> have<00:06:48.570> only<00:06:48.720> been<00:06:48.960> in<00:06:49.140> the

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
these clumps have only been in the

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.350 
these clumps have only been in the
ground<00:06:49.470> one<00:06:49.890> year<00:06:50.250> so<00:06:50.490> imagine<00:06:51.090> if<00:06:51.210> you've

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
ground one year so imagine if you've

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.300 
ground one year so imagine if you've
left<00:06:51.570> it<00:06:51.780> in<00:06:51.900> many<00:06:52.260> years<00:06:52.620> you<00:06:52.830> will<00:06:53.010> have<00:06:53.070> a

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
left it in many years you will have a

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.290 
left it in many years you will have a
huge<00:06:54.110> clump<00:06:55.110> so<00:06:55.980> kind<00:06:56.460> of<00:06:56.580> have<00:06:56.730> to<00:06:56.880> just<00:06:57.090> look

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
huge clump so kind of have to just look

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.330 
huge clump so kind of have to just look
that<00:06:57.540> what<00:06:58.440> you're<00:06:58.590> seeing<00:06:58.800> here<00:06:58.920> might<00:06:59.310> seem

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
that what you're seeing here might seem

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.070 
that what you're seeing here might seem
a<00:06:59.550> little<00:06:59.640> simple<00:07:00.180> if<00:07:00.270> you've<00:07:00.480> left<00:07:00.630> yours<00:07:00.930> in

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
a little simple if you've left yours in

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.170 
a little simple if you've left yours in
a<00:07:01.170> few<00:07:01.350> years<00:07:01.530> when<00:07:01.740> you<00:07:01.830> go<00:07:02.010> to<00:07:02.580> dig<00:07:02.790> so<00:07:03.000> he's

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
a few years when you go to dig so he's

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.000 
a few years when you go to dig so he's
just<00:07:03.330> tapping<00:07:03.600> the<00:07:03.840> dirt<00:07:04.020> off<00:07:04.200> we're<00:07:04.740> pretty

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.010 
just tapping the dirt off we're pretty

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.790 
just tapping the dirt off we're pretty
sandy<00:07:05.430> soil<00:07:05.700> here<00:07:05.910> so<00:07:06.120> it<00:07:06.240> actually<00:07:06.420> works

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
sandy soil here so it actually works

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.530 
sandy soil here so it actually works
pretty<00:07:07.800> good<00:07:07.950> for<00:07:08.280> us<00:07:08.310> so<00:07:08.640> I'll<00:07:08.880> dream<00:07:09.210> land

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:09.540

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:13.380 
that raised up you can see how deep

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.650 
that raised up you can see how deep
those<00:07:13.680> tubers<00:07:14.040> ended<00:07:14.340> up<00:07:14.460> being<00:07:14.760> down<00:07:15.060> he's
