kicking<00:00:46.729> around<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:47.030> idea<00:00:47.089> i<00:00:47.659> got<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:48.199> 90

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
kicking around the idea i got a 90

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.340 
kicking around the idea i got a 90
suburban<00:00:49.040> and<00:00:49.159> that's<00:00:49.280> an<00:00:49.400> 85<00:00:49.790> chevy<00:00:50.269> cake<00:00:50.510> to

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
suburban and that's an 85 chevy cake to

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.560 
suburban and that's an 85 chevy cake to
1500<00:00:52.309> half-ton<00:00:52.970> and<00:00:54.549> the<00:00:55.549> differences<00:00:56.150> are

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
1500 half-ton and the differences are

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.500 
1500 half-ton and the differences are
subtle<00:00:56.869> between<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.650> two<00:00:57.830> models<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:59.000> 90

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
subtle between the two models the 90

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.509 
subtle between the two models the 90

it's in the way so you know it's got the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.740 
it's in the way so you know it's got the
full<00:01:17.660> serpentine<00:01:18.290> setup<00:01:18.710> on<00:01:18.920> it<00:01:19.480> like<00:01:20.480> you<00:01:20.510> see

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
full serpentine setup on it like you see

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.300 
full serpentine setup on it like you see
there<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.230> then<00:01:21.380> 85<00:01:22.720> doesn't<00:01:24.010> kind<00:01:25.010> of<00:01:25.159> got

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
there and then 85 doesn't kind of got

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.000 
there and then 85 doesn't kind of got
that<00:01:27.280> v-belt<00:01:28.280> serpentine<00:01:29.060> combination<00:01:29.990> titan

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
that v-belt serpentine combination titan

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.450 
that v-belt serpentine combination titan
setup<00:01:31.730> and<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:33.380> way<00:01:33.500> I<00:01:33.530> had<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:33.920> thing<00:01:34.159> set

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
setup and the way I had this thing set

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.930 
setup and the way I had this thing set
up

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940

and that could be yellin de that's part

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.640 
and that could be yellin de that's part
of<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.880> bracketry<00:02:13.390> right<00:02:13.570> here<00:02:13.750> built<00:02:14.500> that

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
of the bracketry right here built that

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.950 
of the bracketry right here built that
big<00:02:14.830> plate<00:02:15.400> bracket<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:18.190> this<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.330> now<00:02:19.660> an<00:02:19.840> air

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
big plate bracket and this is now an air

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.110 
big plate bracket and this is now an air
compressor<00:02:20.140> yeah

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
compressor yeah

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.590 
compressor yeah
and<00:02:23.850> I'm<00:02:26.010> gonna<00:02:27.010> do<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.250> different<00:02:27.850> set<00:02:28.270> up<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.570> a

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
and I'm gonna do a different set up on a

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.180 
and I'm gonna do a different set up on a
suburban<00:02:28.990> simply<00:02:29.590> because<00:02:29.770> I<00:02:29.830> don't<00:02:29.980> have<00:02:30.070> the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
suburban simply because I don't have the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.030 
suburban simply because I don't have the
real<00:02:30.340> estate<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.670> put<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.120> big<00:02:31.330> piece<00:02:31.540> of

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
real estate to put that big piece of

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.720 
real estate to put that big piece of
cast<00:02:33.040> iron<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.520> think<00:02:33.730> weighs<00:02:33.880> 40<00:02:34.270> plus<00:02:34.870> pounds

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
cast iron I think weighs 40 plus pounds

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.770 
cast iron I think weighs 40 plus pounds
and<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:36.820> really<00:02:37.000> don't<00:02:37.060> have<00:02:37.240> in<00:02:37.300> your<00:02:37.360> room<00:02:37.540> for

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.420 
the other truck is on the other side and
then<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.730> alternator<00:02:43.210> is<00:02:43.270> on<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:43.630> side<00:02:43.900> and

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
then the alternator is on this side and

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.740 
then the alternator is on this side and
Chris<00:02:45.430> everything's<00:02:45.850> backwards<00:02:46.090> because<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
Chris everything's backwards because the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.190 
Chris everything's backwards because the
certainty<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.350> set<00:02:47.530> up<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:49.300> don't<00:02:49.780> think<00:02:50.080> I

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
certainty is set up and I don't think I

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.500 
certainty is set up and I don't think I
can<00:02:50.320> get<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.500> longer<00:02:50.740> belt<00:02:52.020> there's<00:02:53.020> my<00:02:53.200> welder

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
can get a longer belt there's my welder

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.400 
can get a longer belt there's my welder
it's<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.630> modified<00:02:58.110> alternator<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.230> we'll

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
it's a modified alternator and we'll

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.410 
it's a modified alternator and we'll
make<00:02:59.560> another<00:02:59.800> video<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.250> go<00:03:00.970> through<00:03:01.240> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
make another video to go through the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.310 
make another video to go through the
process<00:03:01.690> of<00:03:02.170> modifying<00:03:03.420> old-school<00:03:04.420> Delco

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.760 

alternator<00:03:08.320> convert<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.070> a<00:03:09.300> DC<00:03:10.300> welder<00:03:10.770> but

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
alternator convert it to a DC welder but

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.000 
alternator convert it to a DC welder but
I<00:03:12.540> checked<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.870> there's<00:03:14.170> actually<00:03:14.709> a<00:03:14.739> belt
