00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.220
 friends followers subscribers and all 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.680
 those who have found this video 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.570
 by pure chance, greet them again 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.429
 evil kitten to georgia with a new 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.199
 one piece video but first 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.839
 I will answer the question you asked me 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.300
 better 2009 which wants to know why 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:25.009
 I started to see myself as a box since it is not a 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.079
 manga known and as I said in the 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.319
 special episode I'm not one of those who 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:32.539
 they read many manes well since they have been doing for a long time 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:34.510
 when your brand was a page with a 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.649
 stable structure in the main menu 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.170
 recommended a manga every week 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.109
 different they just put some of their 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.629
 cut and a brief synopsis the truth 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.850
 is that I never paid much attention to them but a 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.710
 day they put medaka box and called me a lot 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.629
 the attention the drawing quality that 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.539
 I had coming to remind me of the 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.370
 drawings of glow nickel zinc was like that 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.170
 I decided to give it a try but not 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.109
 I made the mistake of starting to see the 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.780
 manga from the beginning guagua like that 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.230
 start with the beginning is a mistake if 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.600
 cat, do not go with the unam 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.900
 to see the sleeves from the end to the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.570
 good beginning not from the end but 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.580
 if something already advanced I explain to 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.800
 difference from most people 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.720
 my need to spoil me for me 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.640
 come to interest in something the great 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.470
 most of the series that I've come to 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.930
 see and that have fascinated me I did not start them 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.390
 to see from his first episode I'll put 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.190
 as an example to one piece when 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.350
 they began to broadcast by cartoon 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.600
 networks I was simply made an anime 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.490
 more of the bunch and pretty ridiculous by 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.320
 what when they stopped transmitting it 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.510
 through that channel I simply let 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.940
 fell into oblivion was not until 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.250
 years later that by chance I saw the 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.170
 AMV said drying of the struggle between the 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.180
 very guardas against those that interest me 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.660
 really for this manga and I started to 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.580
 read it so I already know how rare 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.590
 times the first chapter of a series or 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.810
 manga make me get your attention 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.180
 story I chose to launch a chapter of 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.190
 medical box was specifically the chapter 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.200
 in which we are explained the ability of 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.360
 icod and it was more than anything for this 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.830
 character that I decided to start reading the 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.000
 manga you are very strange 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.730
 I already know I egg ok ok a lot of me now 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.950
 they touch one piece theories I'll start with 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.140
 a current manga event on 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.210
 which is one of the most stupid solutions 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.920
 I've never seen but like now 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.110
 has accustomed us to this kind of 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.870
 situations because the truth did not reach me 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.670
 embitter the experience x 3 I mean 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.120
 the recovery of the quotes 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.190
 Don Chinga key or by the way I have 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.930
 that giving credit to girl heals after he 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.910
 he had told me that the head of 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.100
 conchi house looked like a lawyer 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.350
 probably gap broke at a stroke 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.560
 and that was exactly what happened but in 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.180
 a much more ridiculous scale x 3 in your 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.280
 moment I did not notice it because now we 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.090
 is very used to a design of 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.500
 very extravagant characters x 3 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.690
 going back to the theory now that I don 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.459
 Chila has recovered the original form of 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.410
 your head will surely be very 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.120
 grateful with sweet and will become 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.190
 together with bryant and in area two very 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.950
 valuable during this saga and maybe in 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.720
 future adventures 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.700
 now something that has come to me 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.890
 happening is that surely we will see 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.050
 a rematch between baby face and frank and 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.910
 I know you should think that a rematch will not 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.860
 it makes sense then it would be to repeat a 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.050
 defeat for the girl weapons but they 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.000
 I remember that in ponchar frankie he got 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.489
 an overwhelming advantage thanks to its 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.500
 generally quiet unless you fan that 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.690
 has created capsules dragon ball you 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.390
 this time he does not wear it so 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.069
 the fight could be much more even without 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.989
 However, France lasted a long time 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.910
 entered the is pink without some kind of 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.769
 weapon and I think a good power up for 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.200
 franchise the use of artifacts made 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.239
 to fall or I know that this occurred to me 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.310
 because this character simply does not 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.530
 I can imagine it using some type 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.290
 of check if perhaps the one to listen but 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.510
 nothing else I have left my theory 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.610
 favorite of this occasion until the end 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.950
 x 3 although those who see my publications 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.230
 or they follow me on facebook and they must 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.900
 know and I think that this saga will be 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.760
 the triumphant return of over king this 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.980
 based on the fact that this time bear 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.110
 is having more prominence 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.000
 than on other occasions and thanks to their 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.400
 lies has become the idol of 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.990
 the fool is all this smells to me 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.040
 net 

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:25.070
 x 3 but if I do not fly anything I do not 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.140
 I was referring to that monkey but it does not matter 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.850
 would be all for now keep to the 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.070
 pending of the new channel of sheen si 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.960
 you look for mexico where several theorizer 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.330
 is we will be uploading videos of one 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.180
 I leave the link in the description of 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.430
 video god I never imagined that a 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.140
 tender and innocent kitten as I was to 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.420
 trigger the emergence of so many 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.490
 what whole and alliances but if not 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.350
 it would have been me I would have been someone else 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.970
 so presume that all this is 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.510
 thanks to my travels ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:56.210
 but what a superb kitten I am x 3 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:59.840
 tender and innocent clear and I am doÃ±a 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.270
 white my water leave me in peace good 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.100

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.730
 say goodbye to you evil kitten 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.960
