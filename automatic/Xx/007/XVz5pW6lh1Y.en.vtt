00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.189
 silence in its constant evolution and with more than 20 years of experience in 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:13.200
 environment 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.380
 continues the vanguard in the treatment of waste an example of this is the new 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.439
 composting plant 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.090
 the guiding principle was to generate a project with an environmental impact 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:28.320
 positive by returning high-quality compost to the natural site 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.320
 and not cause any harm to the environment 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.730
 the plant was built integrating it with the natural environment 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.239
 the process 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.219
 was selected for his great environmental gifts I know he allows his 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.690
 continuous operation under any weather condition 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.250
 does not require content 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.180
 there are no rodent insects howard is there is no generation of odors 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.080
 unpleasant since the fermentation process itself takes 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.360
 out in a closed digester in which the material to be composted is introduced and 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.299
 if we add it permanently 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.750
 the amount of air sadly necessary to maintain the process 

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:15.749
 erotic 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.020
 the process begins with the reception of the materials has behaved 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.770
 those consisting of waste takeoffs and marking as for example 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.860
 vegetables daddies onions fruits 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.030
 and macri to the bar of as it was to more troncoso cut of grass 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.650
 which were selected at source and transported in 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.650
 differentiated to the composting plant 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.450
 There are two storage areas for materials, some for barber materials and 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.450
 another for fairs and markets waste 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.530
 funes and censored the waste is made the mixture of both streams 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.730
 residual 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.860
 in a suitable proportion to be later transferred to the team of 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.860
 fermentation 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.769
 The registration team consists of a hopper where the mixture is loaded 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.139
 implied that through a piston it is introduced in plastic silos 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.139
 horizontal 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:43.459
 Along with the material to be carried, a blanket is introduced into the silo 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.459
 be gauged through which the necessary air is injected 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.180
 to develop lorica overnight stays 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.709
 During the fermentation process, a facet develops in the first place 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.180
 as physicists where the highest temperatures will be reached and it is in this phase 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.209
 where the phytopathogenic events were controlled 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:11.599
 once we finish the temperature 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.719
 it develops the pass unharmed clica where the final decomposition occurs 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:22.909
 this undeveloped aerobic paving stage for approximately 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.999
 45 days during which control parameters must be controlled 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.389
 process 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.319
 during this period a weight reduction of approximately 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.660
 70% 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.000
 and its volume decreases by 60% 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:44.519
 once the fermentation stage has been completed 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.760
 if the ripening of the product takes 45 days 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.959
 approximately and they develop inside the same bags thread but 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.399
 having generated a cut throughout the same 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:01.029
 after this time of maturation 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:06.250
 the compost the removed from the silos to be associated for its completion 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.500
 consistent mentalized in order to obtain the desired particle size 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.929
 the compost in these conditions is suitable to be used to 

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:21.419
 bulk with bags of different sizes the plant has a capacity 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.460
 operative 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.900
 of two thousand tons per month 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.860
 this amount of waste in process I went from the treatment plant 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.830
 biological start-up by ceamse 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.830
