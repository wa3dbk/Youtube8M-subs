00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.720 
what i know they blue LEDs light em up
so<00:04:26.530> hopefully<00:04:26.680> when<00:04:26.919> I<00:04:26.950> get<00:04:27.040> all<00:04:27.250> this<00:04:27.370> powered

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
so hopefully when I get all this powered

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.909 
so hopefully when I get all this powered
up<00:04:27.850> this<00:04:28.060> should<00:04:28.270> look<00:04:28.419> really<00:04:28.480> really<00:04:29.110> sweet

I've done a reasonably good job at the

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.170 
I've done a reasonably good job at the
cable<00:05:02.380> management<00:05:02.560> with<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.640> case<00:05:03.850> you<00:05:04.000> can

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
cable management with the case you can

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.500 
cable management with the case you can
see<00:05:04.360> they're<00:05:05.370> one<00:05:06.370> of<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.490> best<00:05:06.789> ideas<00:05:07.270> having

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
see they're one of the best ideas having

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.180 
see they're one of the best ideas having
these<00:05:07.600> lit<00:05:07.810> up<00:05:07.900> for<00:05:08.080> modders<00:05:08.350> it<00:05:08.560> looks<00:05:08.740> really

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
these lit up for modders it looks really

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.860 
these lit up for modders it looks really
good<00:05:09.340> much<00:05:09.789> better<00:05:10.000> than<00:05:10.060> having<00:05:10.330> a<00:05:10.510> cold

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
good much better than having a cold

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.210 
good much better than having a cold
cathode<00:05:11.200> or<00:05:11.229> anything<00:05:11.590> like<00:05:11.620> that<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:12.100> just

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
cathode or anything like that and just

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.070 
cathode or anything like that and just
looks<00:05:12.430> really<00:05:12.820> nice<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.419> way<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.630> cables<00:05:13.990> are

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
looks really nice the way the cables are

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.140 
looks really nice the way the cables are
just<00:05:14.260> just<00:05:14.590> pop<00:05:14.800> out<00:05:14.950> there<00:05:15.160> straight<00:05:15.520> they
