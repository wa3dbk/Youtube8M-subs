00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
look at it after a while it looks like

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.679

a bit to suit my skin tone I guess one

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.339 
a bit to suit my skin tone I guess one
bad<00:02:07.159> thing<00:02:07.189> about<00:02:07.609> this<00:02:08.030> is<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.360> because<00:02:09.110> I

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
bad thing about this is that because I

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.280 
bad thing about this is that because I
do<00:02:09.410> have<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.979> birthmark<00:02:10.519> here<00:02:11.150> if<00:02:12.049> it

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
do have a birthmark here if it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.559 
do have a birthmark here if it
camouflages<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.549> changes<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.209> same

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
camouflages and changes to the same

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.009 
camouflages and changes to the same
color<00:02:14.870> as<00:02:15.200> my<00:02:15.530> birthmark<00:02:15.920> it's<00:02:16.129> not<00:02:16.310> exactly

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
color as my birthmark it's not exactly

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.559 

looks<00:03:02.790> really<00:03:03.120> wise<00:03:03.330> maybe<00:03:04.080> one<00:03:05.000> layer<00:03:06.000> might

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
looks really wise maybe one layer might

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.410 
looks really wise maybe one layer might
have<00:03:06.900> been<00:03:07.760> more<00:03:08.760> than<00:03:08.970> enough<00:03:09.209> already

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
have been more than enough already

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.350 
have been more than enough already
it<00:03:12.420> just<00:03:12.630> does<00:03:12.840> not<00:03:12.870> suit<00:03:13.500> my<00:03:13.800> skin<00:03:14.060> color<00:03:15.060> at

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
it just does not suit my skin color at

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.150 
it just does not suit my skin color at

all
we'll<00:03:17.160> see<00:03:17.400> how<00:03:17.520> it<00:03:17.670> goes<00:03:17.700> after<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.720> color<00:03:18.930> is

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
we'll see how it goes after the color is

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.699 
we'll see how it goes after the color is
set<00:03:19.260> in<00:03:19.470> for<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.340> while<00:03:20.610> now

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.849 

okay<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:27.489> now<00:03:28.269> this<00:03:28.510> half<00:03:28.870> of<00:03:29.019> my<00:03:29.230> face

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859

half only has one and yeah we'll check
back<00:03:37.030> in<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.629> while<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.959> see<00:03:38.530> how<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:39.459> colors

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
back in a while to see how the colors

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:47.220 
back in a while to see how the colors
have<00:03:40.000> set<00:03:40.299> in<00:03:43.980> hi<00:03:44.980> okay<00:03:45.609> and<00:03:46.090> now<00:03:46.480> I've<00:03:46.930> waited

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
have set in hi okay and now I've waited

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.470 
have set in hi okay and now I've waited
for<00:03:47.650> about<00:03:48.099> 15<00:03:48.700> minutes<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.540> see<00:03:49.900> if<00:03:50.340> the

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
for about 15 minutes to see if the

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.319 
for about 15 minutes to see if the
pigments<00:03:52.769> have<00:03:53.769> really<00:03:54.430> matched<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:55.090> color

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
pigments have really matched the color

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.539 
pigments have really matched the color
of<00:03:55.599> my<00:03:55.870> face<00:03:56.230> and<00:03:56.620> how<00:03:56.859> the<00:03:56.920> second<00:03:57.400> layer

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
of my face and how the second layer

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.520 
of my face and how the second layer
looks<00:03:57.849> in<00:03:58.030> comparison<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.689> the<00:03:58.870> first<00:03:59.079> layer<00:03:59.260> I

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
looks in comparison to the first layer I

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.659 
looks in comparison to the first layer I
think<00:04:00.519> it's<00:04:00.760> actually<00:04:00.939> not<00:04:01.389> bad<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:03.250> doesn't

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
think it's actually not bad it doesn't

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.970 
think it's actually not bad it doesn't
make<00:04:03.790> me<00:04:03.970> look<00:04:04.000> too<00:04:04.260> washed<00:04:05.260> out<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.769> the

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
make me look too washed out and the

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.610 
make me look too washed out and the
coverage<00:04:06.489> is<00:04:06.669> actually<00:04:07.150> not<00:04:07.900> bad<00:04:07.959> at<00:04:08.290> all<00:04:08.409> and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
coverage is actually not bad at all and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.970 
coverage is actually not bad at all and
let's<00:04:09.189> apply<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:10.180> other<00:04:10.329> side<00:04:10.780> as<00:04:11.409> well<00:04:11.739> so<00:04:11.769> I

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
let's apply the other side as well so I

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:20.650 
let's apply the other side as well so I
can<00:04:12.219> balance<00:04:12.400> out<00:04:12.700> my<00:04:12.730> face

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.840 

and<00:04:21.140> really<00:04:22.900> massaging<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.950> greens<00:04:25.250> into<00:04:25.610> my

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
and really massaging the greens into my

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.410 
and really massaging the greens into my
skin<00:04:26.230> and<00:04:27.230> you<00:04:27.530> can<00:04:27.680> feel<00:04:27.920> them<00:04:28.130> like<00:04:28.370> sort<00:04:29.360> of

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
skin and you can feel them like sort of

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.860 
skin and you can feel them like sort of
popping<00:04:29.780> below<00:04:30.440> your<00:04:30.920> fingers<00:04:31.690> under<00:04:32.690> your

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
popping below your fingers under your

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.370 
popping below your fingers under your
skin<00:04:33.200> it<00:04:34.010> feels<00:04:34.070> pretty<00:04:35.060> smooth<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.990> moment

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
skin it feels pretty smooth the moment

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.730 
skin it feels pretty smooth the moment
the<00:04:36.830> greens<00:04:37.130> disappear<00:04:37.760> and<00:04:38.080> get<00:04:39.080> seeped<00:04:39.470> into

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
the greens disappear and get seeped into

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.390 
the greens disappear and get seeped into
your<00:04:40.040> skin<00:04:40.280> so<00:04:40.520> that's<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.420> good<00:04:41.630> thing<00:04:42.010> so<00:04:43.010> it

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
your skin so that's a good thing so it

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.660 
your skin so that's a good thing so it
looks<00:04:43.640> a<00:04:43.760> lot<00:04:44.180> more<00:04:44.830> balanced<00:04:45.830> right<00:04:46.130> now<00:04:46.340> that

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
looks a lot more balanced right now that

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.450 
looks a lot more balanced right now that
I<00:04:46.700> have<00:04:47.060> two<00:04:47.630> layers<00:04:47.870> across<00:04:48.440> my<00:04:48.710> entire<00:04:48.860> face

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
I have two layers across my entire face

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
I have two layers across my entire face
and<00:04:51.040> you<00:04:52.040> can<00:04:52.190> see<00:04:52.520> that<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:52.940> coverage<00:04:53.330> is

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
and you can see that the coverage is

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.930 
and you can see that the coverage is
actually<00:04:53.870> really<00:04:54.140> not<00:04:54.470> bad<00:04:54.680> at<00:04:54.980> all<00:04:55.280> because

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
actually really not bad at all because

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.390 
actually really not bad at all because
my<00:04:56.290> birthmark<00:04:57.290> has<00:04:57.530> started<00:04:57.950> to<00:04:58.100> look<00:04:58.250> a

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
my birthmark has started to look a

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.310 
my birthmark has started to look a
little<00:04:58.550> bit<00:04:58.760> more<00:04:58.940> covered<00:04:59.330> up<00:04:59.480> and<00:04:59.720> lighten

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
little bit more covered up and lighten

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.460 
little bit more covered up and lighten
but<00:05:01.190> I'm<00:05:01.400> pretty<00:05:01.670> sure<00:05:01.760> that<00:05:01.970> I<00:05:02.600> would<00:05:03.170> still

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
but I'm pretty sure that I would still

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.540 
but I'm pretty sure that I would still
have<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:03.770> go<00:05:04.550> over<00:05:04.820> with<00:05:05.000> another<00:05:05.420> concealer

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
have to go over with another concealer

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.530 
have to go over with another concealer
for<00:05:07.550> some<00:05:08.000> of<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.210> patches<00:05:09.190> yeah<00:05:10.190> I<00:05:10.580> do<00:05:11.180> not

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
for some of the patches yeah I do not

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.600 
for some of the patches yeah I do not
think<00:05:11.960> I<00:05:12.200> need<00:05:12.560> to<00:05:12.590> put<00:05:12.980> a<00:05:13.040> third<00:05:13.400> layer

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
think I need to put a third layer

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.450 
think I need to put a third layer
anymore<00:05:14.210> because<00:05:14.690> I<00:05:14.870> think<00:05:15.080> this<00:05:15.410> is<00:05:15.530> as<00:05:15.800> thick

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
anymore because I think this is as thick

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.230 
anymore because I think this is as thick
