and<00:00:43.870> we're<00:00:43.989> going<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.170> try<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.380> start<00:00:44.680> this

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
and we're going to try and start this

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.229 
and we're going to try and start this
monster<00:00:45.580> diesel<00:00:45.970> with<00:00:46.090> this<00:00:46.239> thing<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:49.120> know

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
monster diesel with this thing you know

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.020 
monster diesel with this thing you know
typically<00:00:49.900> we<00:00:50.050> had

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
typically we had

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.680 
typically we had
have<00:00:52.629> this<00:00:52.780> yellow<00:00:53.079> top<00:00:53.550> optima<00:00:54.550> here

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
have this yellow top optima here

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:04.049 
have this yellow top optima here
along<00:00:57.350> with<00:00:57.379> this<00:00:57.829> red<00:00:58.699> top<00:00:59.030> optima<00:00:59.390> here<00:01:00.160> and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.999 

I'm<00:01:04.449> just<00:01:04.659> curious<00:01:04.869> you<00:01:05.590> know<00:01:05.619> what's<00:01:05.890> going

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
I'm just curious you know what's going

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.510 
I'm just curious you know what's going
to<00:01:06.040> happen<00:01:06.130> when<00:01:06.579> we<00:01:06.700> try<00:01:06.909> to<00:01:06.939> start<00:01:07.299> this<00:01:07.420> car

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
to happen when we try to start this car

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.480 
to happen when we try to start this car
over<00:01:09.520> this<00:01:09.700> truck<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:12.369> battery<00:01:14.340> keep<00:01:15.340> in

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
over this truck it's battery keep in

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.620 
over this truck it's battery keep in
mind<00:01:15.520> this<00:01:15.850> truck<00:01:16.210> is<00:01:16.479> cold<00:01:17.020> so<00:01:17.670> I'll<00:01:18.670> show<00:01:18.880> you

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:30.260 

okay<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.610> it's<00:01:24.820> cold<00:01:25.149> see<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:28.829> cold<00:01:29.829> truck

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
okay and it's cold see so cold truck

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.810 
okay and it's cold see so cold truck
glow<00:01:31.270> plugs<00:01:31.570> on<00:01:31.720> here<00:01:31.929> we<00:01:32.020> go

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.250 

let's<00:01:38.750> try<00:01:38.930> on<00:01:40.270> okay<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.390> battery<00:01:41.720> is<00:01:41.810> cold<00:01:42.050> so

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
let's try on okay the battery is cold so

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.190 
let's try on okay the battery is cold so
you<00:01:42.530> let<00:01:43.010> it<00:01:43.130> sit<00:01:43.310> for<00:01:43.370> a<00:01:43.550> minute<00:01:44.200> that

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
you let it sit for a minute that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.960 
you let it sit for a minute that
activates<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.890> battery<00:01:48.700> let<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.790> battery

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
activates the battery let the battery

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.700 
activates the battery let the battery
chill<00:01:50.390> out<00:01:50.510> for<00:01:50.690> a<00:01:50.780> second<00:01:51.140> that's<00:01:51.500> why

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
chill out for a second that's why

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.910 
chill out for a second that's why
lutherans<00:01:52.220> lithium<00:01:52.670> battery<00:01:53.000> does<00:01:53.680> hit<00:01:54.680> back

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
lutherans lithium battery does hit back

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:04.090 
lutherans lithium battery does hit back
again<00:01:59.860> there<00:02:00.860> you<00:02:00.950> go<00:02:01.100> you<00:02:02.030> got<00:02:02.060> full<00:02:03.100> full

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
and you'll see the because the battery

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:33.040 
and you'll see the because the battery
is<00:02:25.580> activated<00:02:26.239> now<00:02:27.280> okay<00:02:28.300> trucks<00:02:29.300> off<00:02:31.959> let<00:02:32.959> the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
is activated now okay trucks off let the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:41.500 
is activated now okay trucks off let the
glow<00:02:33.260> plugs<00:02:33.560> light<00:02:34.269> and<00:02:35.269> then<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.420> go<00:02:37.989> boom<00:02:39.250> okay

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
glow plugs light and then I go boom okay

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.530 
glow plugs light and then I go boom okay
so<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:43.220> know<00:02:43.370> you've<00:02:43.909> got<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.060> three-pound
