00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
of us cuz we played I think that five

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.099 
of us cuz we played I think that five
games<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.399> seven<00:00:59.699> nights<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.660> know<00:01:00.899> when<00:01:01.020> I

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
games and seven nights you know when I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.930

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
was averaging 41 minutes you know I

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.789 
was averaging 41 minutes you know I
don't<00:01:03.090> think<00:01:03.239> I've<00:01:03.390> ever<00:01:03.449> done<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.350> being

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
don't think I've ever done that in being

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.980 
don't think I've ever done that in being
an<00:01:04.890> NBA<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.519> some<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.659> know<00:01:06.689> once

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
an NBA so some of that is you know once

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.109 
an NBA so some of that is you know once
the<00:01:07.110> schedule<00:01:07.409> kind<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.650> balances<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.159> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the schedule kind of balances out you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.520 
the schedule kind of balances out you
know<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.330> get<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.479> couple<00:01:09.869> more<00:01:09.900> days<00:01:10.140> off<00:01:10.380> in

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
know we get a couple more days off in

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.080 
know we get a couple more days off in
between<00:01:10.560> games<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.430> then<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.670> think<00:01:11.880> these<00:01:12.030> are

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
between games and then I think these are

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.580 
between games and then I think these are
hopefully<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.720> back<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.439> come

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
hopefully go back to know and it come

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.810 
hopefully go back to know and it come
through<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.950> stretch<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.610> first

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
through that stretch and be in first

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.760 
through that stretch and be in first
place<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.240> northwest<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.900> mean<00:01:16.200> all

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
place in the northwest I mean all

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.469 
place in the northwest I mean all
everything<00:01:17.369> considered<00:01:17.700> that's<00:01:17.970> happened<00:01:18.330> so

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
everything considered that's happened so

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.120 
everything considered that's happened so
far<00:01:18.509> that's<00:01:18.840> got<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.439> pretty<00:01:19.590> good<00:01:19.710> it's

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
far that's got to be pretty good it's

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.649 
far that's got to be pretty good it's
been<00:01:20.340> overshadowed<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.180> that's<00:01:21.299> pretty<00:01:21.420> good

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
provide something things you can for

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.350 
provide something things you can for
this<00:02:16.890> team<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.520> don't<00:02:17.670> have<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.910> do<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.060> as

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
this team and I don't have to do that as

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.450 
this team and I don't have to do that as
much<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.930> then<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.260> know<00:02:19.380> what<00:02:19.500> Nicholas<00:02:19.890> you

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
much and then you know what Nicholas you

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.710 
much and then you know what Nicholas you
know<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.610> think<00:02:20.730> he's<00:02:20.940> scoring<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.300> Baltimore

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
know I think he's scoring to Baltimore

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.170 
know I think he's scoring to Baltimore
stretching<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.290> defense<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:23.010> we<00:02:23.880> got<00:02:24.030> guys

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
stretching the defense so we got guys

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.030 
stretching the defense so we got guys
who've<00:02:24.450> been<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:25.230> know<00:02:25.350> just<00:02:25.530> continuing<00:02:25.980> to

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
who've been you know just continuing to

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.760 
who've been you know just continuing to
get<00:02:26.160> better<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.790> better<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.570> think<00:02:27.740> we<00:02:28.740> got

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
get better and better and I think we got

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.490 
get better and better and I think we got
to<00:02:28.980> keep<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.250> focus<00:02:29.460> on<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.000> not<00:02:30.780> you

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
to keep the focus on that and not you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.200 
to keep the focus on that and not you
know<00:02:31.530> singling<00:02:31.980> out<00:02:32.100> it's<00:02:32.820> just<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.060> guess

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
know singling out it's just I guess

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.760 
know singling out it's just I guess
individuals<00:02:33.780> for<00:02:33.990> maybe<00:02:34.350> not<00:02:34.500> doing<00:02:34.650> as<00:02:34.740> much

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
individuals for maybe not doing as much

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.350 
individuals for maybe not doing as much
they<00:02:34.950> didn't<00:02:35.220> pass<00:02:35.310> because<00:02:35.550> we<00:02:35.790> necessarily

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
they didn't pass because we necessarily

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.150 
they didn't pass because we necessarily
don't<00:02:36.540> have<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.350> short<00:02:37.500> term<00:02:37.770> you

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
don't have to so in the short term you

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.550 
don't have to so in the short term you
don't<00:02:38.370> foresee<00:02:39.270> any<00:02:39.300> huge<00:02:39.690> changes<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.260> your

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560
