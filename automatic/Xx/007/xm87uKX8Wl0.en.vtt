00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
in a solo PvE skill build and how they

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.650 
in a solo PvE skill build and how they
would<00:00:12.000> handle<00:00:12.300> themselves<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.929> PvE<00:00:13.769> alone<00:00:14.660> but

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
would handle themselves in PvE alone but

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.570 
would handle themselves in PvE alone but
this<00:00:15.960> next<00:00:16.260> one<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.590> going<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.430> about

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
especially their mobility skill and

their arcane power generator the wizard

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.740 
their arcane power generator the wizard
is<00:00:32.070> by<00:00:32.250> far<00:00:32.489> condition<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.180> deal<00:00:33.480> as<00:00:33.719> much

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
is by far condition to deal as much

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.200 
is by far condition to deal as much
damage<00:00:33.960> as<00:00:34.530> possible<00:00:34.590> though<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.520> being<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:36.120> a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.000 
damage as possible though and being in a
group<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> perfect<00:00:37.170> opportunity<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.710> take

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
group is a perfect opportunity to take

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.920 
group is a perfect opportunity to take
advantage<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.700> as<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.600> don't<00:00:39.750> really

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
advantage of that as you don't really

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.930 
advantage of that as you don't really
have<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> worry<00:00:40.260> about<00:00:40.620> enemies<00:00:41.340> making<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
have to worry about enemies making a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.119 
have to worry about enemies making a
beeline<00:00:42.149> straight<00:00:42.329> towards<00:00:42.989> them<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.860> reason

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
beeline straight towards them the reason

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.529 
beeline straight towards them the reason
for<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.579> there<00:00:44.969> will<00:00:45.180> be<00:00:45.210> multiple

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
for this is that there will be multiple

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.459 
for this is that there will be multiple
players<00:00:46.140> within<00:00:46.980> your<00:00:47.340> group<00:00:47.840> we<00:00:48.840> which<00:00:49.200> makes

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
players within your group we which makes

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.979 
players within your group we which makes
it<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.370> are<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.879> only<00:00:51.090> target<00:00:51.480> among

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
it so that you are the only target among

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.930 
it so that you are the only target among
a<00:00:52.020> horde<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.440> enemies<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.399> won't<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.879> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
a horde of enemies so you won't have to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.990 
a horde of enemies so you won't have to
cut<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.660> much<00:00:55.190> that<00:00:56.190> being<00:00:56.430> said<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.850> doesn't

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
cut as much that being said that doesn't

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.910 
cut as much that being said that doesn't
mean<00:00:57.270> you'll<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.809> forgo<00:00:58.199> defensive<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
mean you'll have to forgo defensive and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.400 
mean you'll have to forgo defensive and
utility<00:00:59.430> skills<00:00:59.730> altogether<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:01.320> will

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
utility skills altogether they will

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.650 
utility skills altogether they will
still<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.710> present<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.820> focus<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.510> them

still be present just you focus on them

still be present just you focus on them
less<00:01:03.890> it<00:01:04.890> all<00:01:05.010> boils<00:01:05.159> down<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.640> your<00:01:05.760> role<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.210> a

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
defensive passive skill it gives me

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.950 
defensive passive skill it gives me
increased<00:06:11.400> duration<00:06:11.880> on<00:06:11.970> my<00:06:12.120> armor<00:06:12.480> spell<00:06:12.750> and

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
increased duration on my armor spell and

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
as well as life per second region this

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.110 
as well as life per second region this
is<00:06:16.380> the<00:06:16.500> same<00:06:16.770> as<00:06:17.040> my<00:06:17.310> solo<00:06:18.210> PvE<00:06:18.600> spec<00:06:19.169> but

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
is the same as my solo PvE spec but

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.100 
is the same as my solo PvE spec but
I<00:06:21.290> picked<00:06:22.290> it<00:06:22.470> up<00:06:22.590> only<00:06:23.040> because<00:06:23.190> I<00:06:23.940> might<00:06:24.840> need

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
I picked it up only because I might need

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.250 
I picked it up only because I might need
to<00:06:25.520> what<00:06:26.520> do<00:06:26.580> you<00:06:26.639> say<00:06:26.850> run<00:06:27.330> away<00:06:27.570> from<00:06:27.630> enemies

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
to what do you say run away from enemies

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.120 
to what do you say run away from enemies
yeah<00:06:28.889> so<00:06:29.610> this<00:06:29.910> may<00:06:30.419> be<00:06:30.479> the<00:06:30.810> case<00:06:30.990> it<00:06:31.710> depends

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
yeah so this may be the case it depends

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.129 
yeah so this may be the case it depends
if<00:06:32.220> you<00:06:32.370> have<00:06:32.490> a<00:06:32.520> very<00:06:32.790> solid<00:06:33.000> group<00:06:33.419> that<00:06:33.660> has

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
if you have a very solid group that has

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.230 
if you have a very solid group that has
a<00:06:34.199> tank<00:06:34.590> for<00:06:34.800> example<00:06:35.340> that<00:06:35.520> is<00:06:35.790> where<00:06:36.060> you're

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
a tank for example that is where you're

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.120 
a tank for example that is where you're
very<00:06:36.540> certain<00:06:37.050> will<00:06:37.260> stick<00:06:37.560> close<00:06:37.800> to<00:06:38.040> the

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
very certain will stick close to the

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.920 
very certain will stick close to the
rest<00:06:38.430> of<00:06:38.550> the<00:06:38.669> group<00:06:38.760> you<00:06:39.389> might<00:06:39.570> want<00:06:39.840> to

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
rest of the group you might want to

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.300 
rest of the group you might want to
consider<00:06:40.199> switching<00:06:40.560> it<00:06:40.800> out<00:06:40.889> for<00:06:41.130> something

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
consider switching it out for something

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.370 
consider switching it out for something
else<00:06:41.610> maybe<00:06:42.210> something<00:06:42.750> that<00:06:42.930> can<00:06:43.139> reduce

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
else maybe something that can reduce

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.620 
else maybe something that can reduce
your<00:06:43.590> cooldowns<00:06:44.250> for<00:06:44.669> example<00:06:45.150> by<00:06:45.330> twenty

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
your cooldowns for example by twenty

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.600 
your cooldowns for example by twenty
percent<00:06:45.960> or<00:06:46.199> at<00:06:46.470> least<00:06:46.800> increase<00:06:47.250> your<00:06:47.400> damage

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
percent or at least increase your damage

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.540 
percent or at least increase your damage
but<00:06:48.210> this<00:06:49.139> is<00:06:49.290> all<00:06:49.440> a<00:06:49.470> matter<00:06:49.650> of<00:06:49.800> choice<00:06:50.160> this

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
but this is all a matter of choice this

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.510 
but this is all a matter of choice this
is<00:06:50.760> a<00:06:50.840> very<00:06:51.840> subjective<00:06:52.110> so<00:06:53.070> I'll<00:06:53.250> leave<00:06:53.460> that

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
is a very subjective so I'll leave that

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.870 
is a very subjective so I'll leave that
