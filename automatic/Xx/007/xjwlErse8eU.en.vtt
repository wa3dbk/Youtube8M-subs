00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
actually a double formed case so in

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.530 
actually a double formed case so in
other<00:01:43.110> words<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.759> made<00:01:45.090> into<00:01:45.360> two

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
other words it it's like made into two

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.380 
other words it it's like made into two
halves<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.049> then<00:01:46.140> stuck<00:01:47.100> together<00:01:47.280> I'm<00:01:48.240> not

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
halves and then stuck together I'm not

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.050 
halves and then stuck together I'm not
exactly<00:01:48.630> sure<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:49.200> what<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.430> terms<00:01:50.850> of

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
exactly sure with what so in terms of

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.520 
exactly sure with what so in terms of
longevity<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.659> don't<00:01:51.960> know<00:01:52.020> how<00:01:52.140> long<00:01:52.350> this

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
longevity I don't know how long this

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.800 
longevity I don't know how long this
case<00:01:52.740> would<00:01:52.890> actually<00:01:53.189> last<00:01:53.450> but<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> do<00:01:54.570> think

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
case would actually last but I do think

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.709 
case would actually last but I do think
it<00:01:54.960> will<00:01:55.049> hold<00:01:55.170> up<00:01:55.380> hold<00:01:56.070> up<00:01:56.250> rather<00:01:56.460> well

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
it will hold up hold up rather well

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.690 
it will hold up hold up rather well
there<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.840> no<00:01:58.020> belt<00:01:58.320> clip<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.189> case<00:01:59.430> it

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
there is no belt clip for this case it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.230 
there is no belt clip for this case it
is<00:01:59.759> just<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.180> flat<00:02:00.479> black<00:02:00.869> case<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:03.060> nice

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
is just a flat black case so the nice

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.880 
is just a flat black case so the nice
thing<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.479> because<00:02:03.869> doesn't<00:02:04.229> add<00:02:04.320> much<00:02:04.350> bulk

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
thing is because doesn't add much bulk

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.830 
thing is because doesn't add much bulk
putting<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.700> your<00:02:05.759> pocket<00:02:06.180> was<00:02:06.329> really<00:02:06.540> no<00:02:06.659> big

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
putting in your pocket was really no big

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.419 
putting in your pocket was really no big
deal<00:02:06.990> I've<00:02:07.170> been<00:02:07.200> carrying<00:02:07.560> my<00:02:07.799> back<00:02:07.979> pocket

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
deal I've been carrying my back pocket

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.820 
deal I've been carrying my back pocket
my<00:02:08.580> front<00:02:08.789> pocket<00:02:08.970> without<00:02:09.929> any<00:02:10.170> problem<00:02:10.649> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
my front pocket without any problem and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.589 
my front pocket without any problem and
really<00:02:11.610> doesn't<00:02:11.790> feel<00:02:11.910> like<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> case

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
really doesn't feel like I have the case

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.400 
really doesn't feel like I have the case
on<00:02:12.780> there

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
