way that the fans are today that they

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.100 
way that the fans are today that they
could<00:02:31.820> sit<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.750> actually<00:02:33.200> watch<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.830> 1-hour

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110

could sit and actually watch a 1-hour
classic<00:02:36.110> type<00:02:36.350> of<00:02:36.560> wrestling<00:02:37.010> match<00:02:37.250> or<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:37.790> it

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
classic type of wrestling match or is it

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.750 
classic type of wrestling match or is it
a<00:02:38.000> different<00:02:38.150> audience<00:02:38.720> completely<00:02:39.520> it's<00:02:40.520> a

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
a different audience completely it's a

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.000 
a different audience completely it's a
it's<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.210> different<00:02:41.510> audience<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:42.350> think<00:02:42.740> if<00:02:42.890> it

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
it's a different audience I think if it

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.460 
it's a different audience I think if it
was<00:02:43.190> programmed<00:02:43.630> properly<00:02:44.630> where<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.350> was<00:02:45.440> a

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
was programmed properly where it was a

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.120 
was programmed properly where it was a
build<00:02:45.860> up<00:02:46.070> to<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.310> 30<00:02:47.210> or<00:02:47.360> 40<00:02:47.840> minute<00:02:48.170> you

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
build up to that 30 or 40 minute you

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.280 
build up to that 30 or 40 minute you
know<00:02:49.250> Iron<00:02:49.520> Man<00:02:49.850> match<00:02:50.120> like<00:02:50.450> like<00:02:50.720> Bret<00:02:51.020> Hart

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
know Iron Man match like like Bret Hart

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.080 
know Iron Man match like like Bret Hart
would<00:02:51.470> do<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.890> think<00:02:52.250> if<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.640> was<00:02:52.760> programmed

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
would do I think if it was programmed

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.450 
would do I think if it was programmed
you<00:02:53.840> could<00:02:54.020> get<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.320> into<00:02:54.470> people's<00:02:54.890> mind<00:02:55.220> that

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
you could get it into people's mind that

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.220 
you could get it into people's mind that
they<00:02:55.580> were<00:02:55.640> looking<00:02:55.970> for<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.600> waiting<00:02:56.990> for

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
they were looking for it and waiting for

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.500 
they were looking for it and waiting for
it<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:57.890> would<00:02:58.010> work<00:02:58.220> but<00:02:58.520> not<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.240> just

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
it and it would work but not to just

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.620 
it and it would work but not to just
have<00:02:59.960> one<00:03:00.230> on<00:03:00.410> TV<00:03:00.860> but<00:03:01.580> television<00:03:01.970> moves<00:03:02.390> so
