the first round because the premium on
the<00:00:47.690> position<00:00:47.929> they're<00:00:48.620> just<00:00:48.979> not<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:49.309> good

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
the position they're just not that good

the position they're just not that good
of<00:00:49.879> players<00:00:50.239> now<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.569> belief<00:00:50.929> is<00:00:51.139> if<00:00:51.409> you

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
of players now the belief is if you

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.559 
of players now the belief is if you
think<00:00:51.889> Tannehill<00:00:52.399> is<00:00:52.519> the<00:00:52.670> next<00:00:52.909> best<00:00:53.089> the

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:53.569 
think Tannehill is the next best the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:55.360

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
third best which most draft experts I to

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.340 
third best which most draft experts I to
talk<00:00:56.209> to<00:00:56.389> don't<00:00:56.629> believe<00:00:56.929> they<00:00:57.049> think<00:00:57.260> it

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
talk to don't believe they think it

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.379 
talk to don't believe they think it
might<00:00:57.499> be<00:00:57.530> Kirk<00:00:57.889> Cousins<00:00:58.100> then<00:00:58.789> you<00:00:59.119> want<00:00:59.329> to

00:00:59.379 --> 00:00:59.389 
might be Kirk Cousins then you want to

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:01.059 
might be Kirk Cousins then you want to
take<00:00:59.449> him<00:00:59.719> third<00:01:00.019> but<00:01:00.199> at<00:01:00.289> number<00:01:00.440> four<00:01:00.859> it's

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:01.069 
take him third but at number four it's

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:03.520

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
insane particularly if Trent Richardson

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.110 
insane particularly if Trent Richardson

that long he probably won't because the
premium<00:02:06.860> on<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.040> position<00:02:07.400> but<00:02:07.790> he<00:02:07.940> will<00:02:08.179> be

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
premium on the position but he will be

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.389 
premium on the position but he will be
there<00:02:08.569> at<00:02:08.690> 22<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:09.859> this<00:02:10.069> is<00:02:10.129> the
