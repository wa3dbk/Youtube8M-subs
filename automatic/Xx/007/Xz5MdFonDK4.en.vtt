00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.630 
not in my house I guess that's a it's a
good<00:01:13.350> thing<00:01:13.619> I'd<00:01:14.070> rather<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.430> them<00:01:14.490> out<00:01:14.610> here

in<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.880> grill<00:01:15.119> been<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.020> my<00:01:16.110> house<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.009> will

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
in the grill been in my house but I will

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.050 
in the grill been in my house but I will
put<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.520> back

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
put this back

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.740 
put this back
this<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.600> insulation<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.500> think<00:01:19.770> from<00:01:20.750> inside

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
this is insulation I think from inside

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.539 
this is insulation I think from inside
there<00:01:22.020> obviously<00:01:22.979> there's<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.220> way<00:01:23.369> for

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
there obviously there's a way for

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.469 
there obviously there's a way for
squirrels<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> get<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.119> there<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> think

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
squirrels to get in there I think

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.749 
squirrels to get in there I think
they're<00:01:24.600> taking<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.229> there

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
they're taking it out of there

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.920 
they're taking it out of there

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.760 
this up I guess bud the mom squirrel was
and<00:01:58.710> then<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.829> would<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.219> freaked<00:01:59.520> out<00:01:59.790> oh

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770

okay
it's<00:02:03.420> funny<00:02:03.659> how<00:02:03.810> she<00:02:03.840> knows

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.240 

she<00:02:12.200> probably<00:02:12.349> hears<00:02:12.650> them<00:02:12.800> in<00:02:12.890> there<00:02:13.010> moving

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
she probably hears them in there moving

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:25.520 
she probably hears them in there moving
around

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
