00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
kapha types are also the most likely to

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.930

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so sometimes they'll say who cares about

my diet who cares about my body I
deserve<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.480> eat<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.840> they'll<00:00:46.289> overdo<00:00:47.129> it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
deserve to eat and they'll overdo it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.100 
deserve to eat and they'll overdo it
because<00:00:47.579> they're<00:00:47.760> compensating<00:00:48.629> for<00:00:48.899> not

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
because they're compensating for not

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.959 
because they're compensating for not
being<00:00:49.320> able<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.559> express<00:00:50.010> themselves<00:00:50.640> and

take it out through food so it's very

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.250 
take it out through food so it's very
important<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.180> coffee<00:00:54.420> people<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.989> speak

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
what's on their mind even though that's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.360 
what's on their mind even though that's
something<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.270> difficult<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:57.840> them<00:00:58.370> for

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
something that's difficult for them for

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.090 
something that's difficult for them for
their<00:00:59.520> bodies<00:00:59.910> they<00:01:00.570> are<00:01:00.600> cold<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.590> Bottas

their bodies they are cold like Bottas

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.429 
their bodies they are cold like Bottas
but<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:02.520> separates<00:01:03.030> them<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.660> kava<00:01:04.019> is

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
but what separates them is that kava is

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.340 
but what separates them is that kava is
like<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.159> spring<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.390> moist<00:01:06.689> while<00:01:07.020> Vata

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
like the spring so it's moist while Vata

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.649 
like the spring so it's moist while Vata
is<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> fall<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.549> dry<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.240> coffee

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
is like the fall and is dry so a coffee

in their lives

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.890 
in their lives
and<00:02:12.620> in<00:02:12.890> their<00:02:13.070> diets<00:02:13.520> it<00:02:13.940> can<00:02:14.330> lead<00:02:14.510> towards

and in their diets it can lead towards

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.580 
and in their diets it can lead towards
depression<00:02:16.300> so<00:02:17.300> if<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:17.690> feel<00:02:18.020> like<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.350> have

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.910 
excited as you once used to it's very
important<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.990> get<00:02:27.110> that<00:02:27.200> stimulation

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
important to get that stimulation

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.699 
important to get that stimulation
through<00:02:28.130> foods<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:29.300> a<00:02:29.660> really<00:02:29.930> good<00:02:30.170> way<00:02:30.380> is<00:02:30.680> to

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
through foods so a really good way is to

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.580 
through foods so a really good way is to
incorporate<00:02:31.130> spices<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.180> your<00:02:32.209> meals<00:02:32.690> to

and<00:02:36.200> your<00:02:36.350> mind<00:02:36.380> going<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:38.390> should<00:02:38.420> avoid

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
and your mind going you should avoid

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.650 
and your mind going you should avoid
cold<00:02:39.590> foods<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:40.700> this<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.330> something<00:02:41.630> very

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
cold foods so this is something very

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.470 
cold foods so this is something very
interesting<00:02:42.020> because<00:02:42.560> kaufe<00:02:43.130> people<00:02:43.730> when

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
interesting because kaufe people when

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.090 
interesting because kaufe people when
they're<00:02:44.630> overweight<00:02:45.140> they<00:02:45.380> think<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.830> need<00:02:45.980> to

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
they're overweight they think I need to

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.430 
they're overweight they think I need to
eat<00:02:46.250> salads<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.239> smoothies<00:02:47.630> all<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.230> time

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
eat salads and smoothies all the time

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.930 
eat salads and smoothies all the time
because<00:02:48.770> that's<00:02:48.980> how<00:02:49.220> I'll<00:02:49.370> lose<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.760> weight

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
because that's how I'll lose the weight

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.420 
because that's how I'll lose the weight
but<00:02:50.420> that's<00:02:50.690> going<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.410> make<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.770> more<00:02:52.010> cold

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
but that's going to make you more cold

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.340 
but that's going to make you more cold
and<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:52.910> want<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.270> become<00:02:53.600> warm<00:02:53.900> because<00:02:54.200> your

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
and you want to become warm because your

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.430 
and you want to become warm because your
digestive<00:02:55.100> fire<00:02:55.459> is<00:02:55.820> not<00:02:56.000> strong<00:02:56.450> enough<00:02:56.480> so

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
digestive fire is not strong enough so

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.500 
digestive fire is not strong enough so
it's<00:02:57.650> much<00:02:58.040> better<00:02:58.310> for<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.670> kapha<00:02:58.940> type<00:02:59.300> to

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
it's much better for a kapha type to

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.570 
it's much better for a kapha type to
have<00:02:59.690> steamed<00:03:00.200> vegetables<00:03:00.830> as<00:03:00.980> opposed<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.489> a
