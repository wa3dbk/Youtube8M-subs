00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:13.059
 Good afternoon, I'm David Gann, CEO of D &amp; Y Laboratories. 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:20.059
 We are manufacturer, trademark owner and technology 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.149
 a product called Double Helix Water. 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:30.719
 I often ask myself, "What is Double Helix Water?", What is this water in this small bottle 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:35.090
 and actually there is no short and simple answer to that. 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.000
 Usually people refer to this book, you can find it on Amazon or on the Internet 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.030
 its name is Double Helix Water. 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.660
 The book is a complete description of our work, and I understand that there must be at least a small series 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.850
 simple short videos that explain what Double Helix Water really is. 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.410
 So that's the purpose of these videos. 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.890
 So the first thing we need to understand and define is the point of this water 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.890
 And why double helix. The best answer to this question is - it's about you. 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.920
 Your body, my body, the bodies of people who record this, each body consists of 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.690
 from water. Our bodies consist of about 70% water. Our blood 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.680
 our lungs are about 90% water. So water is the largest component of our body. 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.720
 And that's good to know, given that this is part of the general knowledge. 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.760
 I'm not talking about a sales trick or slogan. I'm talking about the right 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.420
 Understanding the basics of water. 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.380
 Science has for many years considered that water can exist in three forms. liquid, 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.380
 such as a glass of water, ice, solid water, and vapor 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.659
 Water vapor is in the clouds above. 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.659
 These were known forms. 1995 god. my partner in the research of Dr. Shui Yin Lo and me 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.040
 we have come across a very unusual occurrence in the water. 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.470
 We started studying it. There was a microscope at that time 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.590
 finally started entering the commercial market, it is about the Atomic force microscope. 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.020
 We found that we could find particles inside the water and at the beginning we thought 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.730
 that it is the shape of the ice. 1995 god. We published this article in Physics Letters 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.530
 and this was our first published article, and he wrote about it as ice 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.390
 we thought it was ice. 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.390
 Many years later, in 2009, after 10-15 years of research we published this 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.580
 an article that was also published in Physics Letters, in which we said - No, it's not ice, but it's a different form 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.720
 or water phase. 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.879
 It is about solid particles that occur at room temperature, they are very small but exist 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.680
 That paper, we've made it enough to actually see it, direct it to the light 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.430
 and he will ask you - What is this powder on the microscope slider? 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.410
 See it, analyze it, and see that it's about 100 percent water. 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.830
 different form or phase of water. 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.330
 Why is it important? 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:35.330
 To truly understand oneself, and understand how the body is self-reflecting 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.720
 it is necessary to understand the basics, most of us are water 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.720
 So water is important to us to understand how we function as a human body. 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.170
 This water is exclusively water only, there is no pollution in it, no medications, 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.220
 It is not a medicinal product, it is not a medicine, it is not for the purpose of treating or treating the disease. 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.220
 We're talking about water, ultra clean water. 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.220
 If you went to the store and bought a couple of liters of distilled water, 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.560
 compared with this our water, you would see it at least a thousand to ten thousand times cleaner 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.240
 from distilled water. So we're talking about water. 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.610
 These couple of short videos basically have the educational purpose to get to know you 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.819
 with this newly discovered form (phase) of water. 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:39.069
 Thank you.
