want to stuff it too much just like so
and<00:02:43.470> then<00:02:44.030> seal<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.180> by<00:02:45.390> closing<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.989> just<00:02:46.230> like

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
and then seal it by closing it just like

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.090 
and then seal it by closing it just like
that<00:02:47.480> it's<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.540> little<00:02:48.840> bit<00:02:49.019> messy<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.769> takes<00:02:50.010> a

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
that it's a little bit messy it takes a

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.770 
that it's a little bit messy it takes a
little<00:02:50.310> bit<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.670> practice<00:02:51.180> but<00:02:51.420> it's<00:02:51.570> very

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
little bit of practice but it's very

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.140 
little bit of practice but it's very
easy<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.140> do<00:02:52.350> that's<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:53.310> roll<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.760> back<00:02:53.880> into

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
easy to do that's it roll it back into

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.880 
easy to do that's it roll it back into
your<00:02:54.600> ball<00:02:55.519> flatten<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:56.640> out<00:02:56.760> give<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.890> shape

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
your ball flatten it out give it a shape

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:07.770 
your ball flatten it out give it a shape
of<00:02:59.070> like<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.250> tiny<00:02:59.519> patty

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.080 

and<00:03:08.380> it's

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
and it's

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.050 
and it's
pretty<00:03:10.750> much<00:03:10.870> good<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.110> go<00:03:11.730> okay<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:12.790> gone

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
keys and I like using a nonstick skillet

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.270

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
because then you end up using very

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.640 
because then you end up using very
little<00:03:33.370> oil<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:35.019> save<00:03:35.290> on<00:03:35.440> some<00:03:35.650> calories<00:03:36.160> and
