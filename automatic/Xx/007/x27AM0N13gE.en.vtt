 I welcome you warmly 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.350
 my channel 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.250
 I want to show you today like you 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.250
 this slide 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.520
 can design and that's called 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.740
 messi band in german with i would 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.410
 I say wear this hairstyle right 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.689
 often especially if you have one 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.720
 said bad hair day i was in 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.880
 In my case, I make a small one for it 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.010
 pot turn that I show you the show 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.190
 I'll tell you if that works and me 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.720
 itself wearing extensions because of that 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.030
 I have a hairband with my son 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.670
 work and I'll show you how that works 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.729
 happens if that interests you then 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.800
 i can have half blonde hair i 

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:49.650
 wearing extensions my hair are very 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.479
 Stopped I start with the pony 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.210
 the partly more in a strand 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:57.710
 this rove I am sharing again 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.570
 in two single little strands 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.989
 I take the demand stranded and 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.210
 So turn it over, so to speak 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.540
 the back as you can see it will 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.630
 put it over and turn that in again 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.289
 another then I take the full 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.859
 so turn it a little and turn 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.930
 the over it goes on until he closes 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:24.200
 the finer is the finer and the clever and the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.219
 pass makes the strands the same 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.500
 filigree blog of course 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.299
 I have that now just relatively rough 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.549
 and fast made you always see one 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.100
 Just take strands and behind them 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.250
 turn so josef is almost turned 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.219
 Coupled with whatever you call that 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.049
 the longer the pony wants that of course 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.899
 that you get what you are looking for 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.140
 also with a bit of exercise with one 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.880
 Straight ponies, for example, are also available 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.049
 when I've finished filming myself 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.920
 So at the end of the strand I take me 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.590
 then you can see it soon 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.770
 a little bobby pin and stick to me 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.649
 this back is important is that 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.229
 the rippled side to the head shows that 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.200
 Guarantee you a little bit again 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:15.110
 better stop and that is better fixed 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.830
 then I would get my blanket mine 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.420
 case very short and over I have something 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.700
 balea dry shampoo in my hair 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.040
 sprayed that just stood me more 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.200
 in it and the handy ones are for that 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.530
 copy what now just see 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.660
 job with the came to have more stands 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.819
 as well as that uses out 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.769
 hairspray before left in the infobox is 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:42.620
 Schwarzkopf does not leave any residue 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:43.819
 I'll turn my head over and then mine 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.860
 to make my measurable 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.860
 the ends of the small house streaks 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.030
 nice to get up not quite so 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.680
 disgusting as I possibly did 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.900
 with me it was quite fix then the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.190
 Haag around him the hair may not quite 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.750
 go through with me on a few 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.209
 streak through as it actually would have 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.420
 may be then again do I order 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.950
 the only twice upside down the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.519
 Small ends again with bobby pins 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.220
 peg or have the pending ones 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.620
 Cover the scrunchy with the hockey 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.760
 clamping is important is the whole loose 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.530
 So it's not about 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.390
 Neatness is just going to happen 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.760
 loosely pinned and always one 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.709
 little bit to form and stop euro 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.840
 putting hairstyle in shape with something 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:29.690
 hairspray the ends the endzone 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.640
 so now I have a bandana doing that 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.560
 I pull my neck tight 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.690
 Let's keep the two ends tight at the front 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.709
 Forward 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.519
 important to me is that my ears 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.709
 are covered 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.989
 um, too, that my extenders are not 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.370
 so uncovered nexans should not 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.620
 to be seen I think so very much 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.200
 taut first then make a knot 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.730
 I always pull the right side in 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.380
 small movement to the right that is one 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.060
 bit my trick that stops if 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.859
 I would do that with a two pages 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.120
 I think that was not working 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.799
 that's what I would like to do for you, gentlemen 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.810
 nice tight hold then one more 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.340
 small knot and then it is 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.989
 whole already done maybe a few 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.349
 rauszuholen wisps and still cope 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.970
 as well as inhouse spree just as it looks 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.830
 just off 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:15.569
 very beautiful as you can see you can 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.430
 make it neat too 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.859
 that would like more people videos 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.570
 which wanted me therefore gives me 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.030
