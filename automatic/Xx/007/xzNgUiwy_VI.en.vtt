00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.650
 almost for the question for 12 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.050
 He is very handsome and if I am well then 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.710
 you're also pretty we're going to think about 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.580
 we started 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.590
 we started to lend 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.230
 I thought a fast question who is going to 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.900
 win the world what question so 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.000
 difficult a global is difficult for 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.540
 obviously be argentina 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.090
 but good we have confidence in our 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.260
 selection more than thinking but confidence 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:45.010
 we have that sure or not because if I am 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.530
 clear but does not know well that Spain 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.580
 brazil and germany are very strong 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.610
 also if they are good situations 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:58.059
 you have to play them matches can 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.519
 think that the group is a bit easy 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.769
 to move on to the next phase, do not 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.760
 you think it's not easy in a world cup 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.740
 it's not easy 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.930
 imagine that the group phase does not 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.380
 marques goal you want to feel that you can 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.840
 mark yes because it happened to us happened to us 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.720
 happened to us once in beijing in the game 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.479
 clean ripped from holder in the phases 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.479
 no quarter of the end nor a goal and the 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.979
 technician I keep putting of titular and in 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.630
 the semifinal was where I marked the 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.700
 first games and then I finished when 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.649
 goal and it was an opportunity against Brazil 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.770
 happened to me and that's why he was able to say that 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.450
 obviously you have to be calm that 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.310
 at some point it arrived maybe you get 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.820
 the first phases you do much better and 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.880
 after more and more but football is very 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.520
 rare tends in the Argentine selection is 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.659
 the best that does trick with the ball 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.659
 messi di marÃ­a 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:59.550
 and I know you once said that your dream 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.530
 be like month at what level state and what 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.530
 do you think if one day it can be 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.930
 to see I do not dream to be as it is why 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.620
 i
