00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
like to call this one a timed juggle

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.690 
like to call this one a timed juggle
here's<00:01:35.640> why<00:01:35.760> it's<00:01:35.910> a<00:01:35.970> times<00:01:36.210> juggle<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:38.520> run

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
here's why it's a times juggle you run

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.390 
here's why it's a times juggle you run
forward<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.900> try<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.140> hit<00:01:40.320> hit<00:01:41.190> vice

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
forward or if you try to hit hit vice

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.620 
forward or if you try to hit hit vice
right<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:42.000> low<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.300> ground<00:01:42.390> as

right here as low to the ground as
possible<00:01:42.690> it<00:01:43.350> doesn't<00:01:43.890> work<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.310> wish

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.120 

I'll<00:01:49.230> give<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.410> another<00:01:49.440> example<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
I'll give you another example it's a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.390 
I'll give you another example it's a
little<00:01:50.280> more<00:01:50.340> obvious<00:01:52.070> if<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.130> line<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
little more obvious if you line the

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.830 
little more obvious if you line the
fierce<00:01:53.610> uppercut<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.060> Elizabeth<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.720> can

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
fierce uppercut with Elizabeth you can

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.420 
fierce uppercut with Elizabeth you can
do<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> quarter<00:01:55.350> hard<00:01:55.650> punch<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:55.980> the<00:01:56.070> corner

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
do a quarter hard punch in the corner

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.250 
do a quarter hard punch in the corner
because<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.060> full<00:01:57.240> juggle<00:01:57.540> steak<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:58.140> you

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
because of that full juggle steak if you

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.140 
because of that full juggle steak if you
do<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.410> light<00:01:58.560> one<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:01.020> doesn't<00:02:01.350> work<00:02:02.060> even<00:02:03.060> if

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
do the light one it doesn't work even if

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.030 
do the light one it doesn't work even if
you<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.330> a<00:02:03.360> quick<00:02:03.630> one<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.900> doesn't<00:02:04.020> work<00:02:04.229> so

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
you do a quick one it doesn't work so

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.790 
you do a quick one it doesn't work so
the<00:02:05.160> question<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.610> why<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:07.260> reason<00:02:07.290> is

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
the question is why and the reason is

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.430 
the question is why and the reason is
when<00:02:08.040> you<00:02:08.190> hit<00:02:08.310> someone<00:02:08.369> with<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.510> moon<00:02:09.780> they

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
when you hit someone with this moon they

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.990 
when you hit someone with this moon they
are<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.890> juggle<00:02:11.190> state<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.910> hit

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
are in a juggle state and you can hit

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.610 
are in a juggle state and you can hit
them<00:02:12.120> with<00:02:12.270> almost<00:02:12.570> any<00:02:12.840> normal<00:02:13.080> or<00:02:13.320> any<00:02:13.440> move

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
them with almost any normal or any move

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.740 
them with almost any normal or any move
in<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.830> game<00:02:14.010> but<00:02:14.550> only<00:02:14.910> for<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> limited<00:02:15.450> time

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
in the game but only for a limited time

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.390 
in the game but only for a limited time
that's<00:02:16.350> why<00:02:16.470> i<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.770> call<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.040> time<00:02:17.250> to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
that's why i like to call it the time to

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.550 
that's why i like to call it the time to
juggle<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.180> easiest<00:02:18.630> way<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.840> see<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.410> there

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
juggle the easiest way to see that there

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.830 
juggle the easiest way to see that there
is<00:02:19.590> somewhat<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.790> way<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.060> see<00:02:21.390> when<00:02:21.660> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
is somewhat of a way to see when the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.010 
is somewhat of a way to see when the
times<00:02:22.170> juggle<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.620> over<00:02:23.330> if<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.600> look<00:02:24.720> advice

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
times juggle is over if you look advice

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.740 
times juggle is over if you look advice

her feet are at the bottom right you'll

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.150 
her feet are at the bottom right you'll
notice<00:02:29.340> she's<00:02:29.459> gonna<00:02:29.580> start<00:02:29.820> rotating<00:02:30.180> over

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
notice she's gonna start rotating over

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.640 
notice she's gonna start rotating over

them<00:02:43.230> up<00:02:43.550> they<00:02:44.550> rotate<00:02:45.060> until<00:02:45.300> there<00:02:45.989> until

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
them up they rotate until there until

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.690 
them up they rotate until there until
they're<00:02:46.440> almost<00:02:46.620> at<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> vertical<00:02:47.310> angle<00:02:47.580> and

they're almost at a vertical angle and
then<00:02:47.790> they<00:02:47.880> stopped<00:02:48.120> rotating<00:02:48.360> they<00:02:49.050> just

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
then they stopped rotating they just

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.759 
then they stopped rotating they just
stay<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:50.070> entire<00:02:50.310> time<00:02:51.410> okay<00:02:52.410> and

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
stay like that the entire time okay and

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:53.990 
stay like that the entire time okay and
then<00:02:52.890> will<00:02:53.010> stay<00:02:53.160> looking<00:02:53.310> like<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.760> all<00:02:53.970> the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
then will stay looking like that all the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.940 
then will stay looking like that all the
way<00:02:54.150> until<00:02:55.019> they<00:02:55.230> hit<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.410> ground<00:02:55.530> until

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
way until they hit the ground until

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.680 
way until they hit the ground until
they're<00:02:56.220> knocked<00:02:56.370> down<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:57.239> for<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.510> lite

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
they're knocked down so for the lite

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.330 
they're knocked down so for the lite
version<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.290> that<00:03:00.290> is<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.800> very<00:03:02.010> last

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
version of this that is the very last

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.310 
version of this that is the very last
animation<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.269> you<00:03:03.360> see<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.750> couple<00:03:04.080> of

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
animation that you see a couple of

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.380 
animation that you see a couple of
frames<00:03:04.590> after<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.310> last<00:03:05.459> animation<00:03:06.000> begins

frames after the last animation begins

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.110 
frames after the last animation begins
is<00:03:06.690> when<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.620> time's<00:03:07.890> juggle<00:03:08.340> is<00:03:08.489> over<00:03:08.850> and

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
is when the time's juggle is over and

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.370 
is when the time's juggle is over and
there's<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.420> good<00:03:09.540> way<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.750> illustrate<00:03:09.930> this

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
there's a good way to illustrate this

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.080 
there's a good way to illustrate this
with<00:03:10.680> Elizabeth<00:03:11.420> if<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.540> light<00:03:12.720> uppercut

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
with Elizabeth if you light uppercut

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.210 
with Elizabeth if you light uppercut
actually<00:03:15.090> combos<00:03:15.510> into<00:03:15.959> itself<00:03:16.350> because<00:03:17.190> it

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
actually combos into itself because it

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.800 
actually combos into itself because it
recovers<00:03:17.730> quickly<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.120> travels<00:03:18.600> forward

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
recovers quickly and travels forward

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.990 
recovers quickly and travels forward
quickly<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:19.530> if<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.100> do<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.370> light<00:03:20.580> uppercuts

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
quickly so if you do to light uppercuts

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.360 
quickly so if you do to light uppercuts
really<00:03:21.360> fast<00:03:21.660> you'll<00:03:22.290> still<00:03:22.530> catch<00:03:22.800> spice<00:03:23.070> at

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
really fast you'll still catch spice at

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.710 
really fast you'll still catch spice at
just<00:03:24.030> at<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.300> end<00:03:25.220> notice<00:03:26.220> vice<00:03:27.120> has<00:03:27.330> entered

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
just at the end notice vice has entered

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.890 
just at the end notice vice has entered
that<00:03:27.870> full<00:03:28.110> vertical<00:03:28.440> animation<00:03:29.810> but<00:03:30.810> I'm

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
that full vertical animation but I'm

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.390 
that full vertical animation but I'm
still<00:03:31.200> able<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.590> get<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:31.890> second<00:03:32.280> hit

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
still able to get that second hit

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.069 
still able to get that second hit
because<00:03:32.610> it's<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.850> couple<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.239> frames<00:03:33.480> after

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
because it's a couple of frames after

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.390 
because it's a couple of frames after
the<00:03:34.500> last<00:03:34.650> animation<00:03:35.190> has<00:03:35.280> begun<00:03:37.190> that<00:03:38.190> is

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
the last animation has begun that is

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.550 
the last animation has begun that is
when<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.910> time<00:03:39.209> juggle<00:03:39.660> ends<00:03:40.019> if<00:03:40.200> you<00:03:40.290> put

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
when the time juggle ends if you put

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.870 
when the time juggle ends if you put
your<00:03:40.590> opponent<00:03:41.160> into<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.340> juggle<00:03:41.700> state

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
your opponent into a juggle state

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.360 
your opponent into a juggle state
there's<00:03:42.120> only<00:03:42.239> two<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.720> full<00:03:43.200> juggle<00:03:43.560> or<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:43.980> time

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
there's only two a full juggle or a time

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.660 
there's only two a full juggle or a time
to<00:03:44.549> juggle<00:03:44.850> her<00:03:45.750> expr<00:03:46.260> put<00:03:47.100> you<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.310> full<00:03:47.489> vocal

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
to juggle her expr put you a full vocal

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.660 
to juggle her expr put you a full vocal
state<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.090> can<00:03:48.359> walk

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.240 

okay<00:03:53.810> but<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.870> should<00:03:55.200> mention<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.830> there<00:03:56.129> is

okay but I should mention that there is
one<00:03:56.550> other<00:03:56.580> way<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.420> can<00:03:57.540> actually

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
one other way that you can actually

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.540

can set counter hits a first attack here

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.230 
can set counter hits a first attack here
in<00:05:58.770> training<00:05:59.130> mode<00:05:59.160> a<00:05:59.400> counter<00:05:59.790> hit<00:05:59.970> if<00:06:00.120> you're

in training mode a counter hit if you're

in training mode a counter hit if you're

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950
