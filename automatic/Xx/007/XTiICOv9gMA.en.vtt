but he got knocked out in a fight and
third<00:01:00.210> round<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.690> believe<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:02.629> yeah<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:04.619> believe

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
third round I believe and yeah I believe

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.219 
third round I believe and yeah I believe
this<00:01:05.129> will<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> third<00:01:06.090> fight<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.479> nonito

Donaire<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> Philippines<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.570> be

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
Donaire in the Philippines this will be

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.240

the<00:01:09.720> third<00:01:09.990> professional<00:01:10.650> fight<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.890> think

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
the third professional fight I think

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.609 
the third professional fight I think
this<00:01:11.369> will<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.610> his<00:01:11.729> first<00:01:12.030> fight<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.659> more

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.530 
this will be his first fight in more
than<00:01:13.799> 10<00:01:14.100> years<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.000> last<00:01:15.150> time<00:01:15.360> we

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
than 10 years I think the last time we

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.499 
than 10 years I think the last time we
fought<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.380> Philippines<00:01:16.830> was<00:01:17.330> back<00:01:18.330> in

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.960 
fought in the Philippines was back in
2002<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.770> tells<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.250> how<00:01:20.430> long<00:01:20.490> it's
