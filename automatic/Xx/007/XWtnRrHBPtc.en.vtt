don't<00:00:09.179> you<00:00:09.330> just<00:00:09.360> hate<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.929> when<00:00:10.349> that

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
don't you just hate that when that

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.360 
don't you just hate that when that
happens<00:00:10.920> okay<00:00:11.849> working<00:00:12.840> with<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.259> pan<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.309> a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
happens okay working with a pan and a

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.609 
happens okay working with a pan and a
knife<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.910> easy<00:00:15.330> compared<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.139> working<00:00:16.470> with<00:00:16.590> a

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
knife is easy compared to working with a

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.080 
knife is easy compared to working with a
hawk<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.550> trowel

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
hawk and a trowel

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.480 
hawk and a trowel
but<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.840> can<00:00:19.140> get<00:00:19.289> more<00:00:19.529> compound<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.250> wall

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
but I can get more compound on the wall

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.310 
but I can get more compound on the wall
faster<00:00:20.820> with<00:00:21.270> these<00:00:21.480> tools<00:00:21.779> that's<00:00:22.109> why<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
faster with these tools that's why the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.050 
faster with these tools that's why the
pro<00:00:22.619> will<00:00:22.890> always<00:00:23.189> use<00:00:23.369> them<00:00:23.580> as<00:00:23.699> he<00:00:23.820> gets<00:00:23.850> to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
pro will always use them as he gets to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.259 
pro will always use them as he gets to
the<00:00:24.210> wider<00:00:24.480> joints<00:00:24.990> now<00:00:25.859> I've<00:00:26.609> asked<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> pros

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
the wider joints now I've asked the pros

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.419 
the wider joints now I've asked the pros
how<00:00:27.539> do<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.779> do<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.349> not<00:00:28.740> spill<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
how do you do it and not spill it on the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.429 
how do you do it and not spill it on the
floor<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.670> most<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.179> them<00:00:30.300> couldn't<00:00:30.779> tell<00:00:31.230> me

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
floor and most of them couldn't tell me

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.590 
floor and most of them couldn't tell me
so<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.949> studied<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.579> studied<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:33.000> now<00:00:33.420> I'm

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
so I studied it and studied it now I'm

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.270 
so I studied it and studied it now I'm
not<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:33.930> graceful<00:00:34.469> as<00:00:34.530> somebody<00:00:34.890> who<00:00:35.070> does

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
not as graceful as somebody who does

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.100 
not as graceful as somebody who does
this<00:00:35.309> every<00:00:35.880> day<00:00:35.910> all<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> time<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.809> did

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
this every day all the time but I did

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.590 
this every day all the time but I did
finally<00:00:37.530> figure<00:00:37.710> out<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.250> basic<00:00:38.730> principles

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
finally figure out the basic principles

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.760 
finally figure out the basic principles
and<00:00:39.719> let<00:00:39.899> me<00:00:39.989> show<00:00:40.140> them<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.350> you

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
and let me show them to you

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.799 
and let me show them to you
we'll<00:00:41.280> use<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.850> hawk<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.210> trial<00:00:42.420> just<00:00:42.750> like

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
we'll use the hawk and trial just like

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.600 
we'll use the hawk and trial just like
two<00:00:43.320> nice<00:00:44.360> together<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:46.110> clean<00:00:46.350> things<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
two nice together to clean things up to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.010 
two nice together to clean things up to
get<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> middle<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> control

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
get it in the middle to get the control

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.479 
get it in the middle to get the control
of<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:49.379> let<00:00:49.530> me<00:00:49.590> show<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.800> something<00:00:50.280> very

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
of it but let me show you something very

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.580 
of it but let me show you something very
surprising<00:00:50.730> here's<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> key<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.899> success

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
surprising here's the key to success

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.650 
surprising here's the key to success
you're<00:00:53.250> usually<00:00:53.670> afraid<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.149> having<00:00:54.300> anything

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you're usually afraid of having anything

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.630 
you're usually afraid of having anything
spill<00:00:55.260> off<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.739> side<00:00:55.980> that's<00:00:56.370> why<00:00:56.520> I'm

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
spill off the side that's why I'm

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.549 
spill off the side that's why I'm
scraping<00:00:57.239> around<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.600> edge<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.020> getting<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
scraping around the edge and getting it

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.330 
scraping around the edge and getting it
to<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> middle<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.850> look<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:01.340> not

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
to the middle but look what I can do not

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.700 
to the middle but look what I can do not
very<00:01:02.579> long<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.719> actually<00:01:03.899> turn<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.559> all

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
very long but I can actually turn it all

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.770 
very long but I can actually turn it all
the<00:01:04.769> way<00:01:04.979> over<00:01:05.430> without<00:01:05.760> spilling<00:01:06.240> anything

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the way over without spilling anything

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.480 
the way over without spilling anything
and<00:01:06.990> that's<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.500> secret<00:01:07.710> because<00:01:08.189> what<00:01:08.369> we

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and that's the secret because what we

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.490 
and that's the secret because what we
want<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.689> want<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.960> bring<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
want to do is we want to bring the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.370 
want to do is we want to bring the
trowel<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.360> contact<00:01:12.360> or<00:01:12.630> at<00:01:12.900> least<00:01:13.080> half<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
trowel in contact or at least half the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.429 
trowel in contact or at least half the
surface<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:14.520> some<00:01:14.549> compound<00:01:15.299> come<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
surface with some compound come up and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.469 
surface with some compound come up and
we're<00:01:16.979> going<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.130> come<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:17.490> together<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.330> that

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
we're going to come up together so that

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.499 
we're going to come up together so that
I'm<00:01:18.600> actually<00:01:18.720> horizontal<00:01:19.619> before<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:21.030> remove

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
I'm actually horizontal before I remove

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.020 
I'm actually horizontal before I remove
the<00:01:21.840> hawk<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.710> I'm<00:01:22.830> actually<00:01:23.009> scraping<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the hawk so I'm actually scraping the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.120 
the hawk so I'm actually scraping the
hawk<00:01:24.210> down<00:01:24.479> off<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.900> edge<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.799> trowel

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
hawk down off the edge of the trowel

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.770 
hawk down off the edge of the trowel
doesn't<00:01:26.850> look<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.360> because<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.689> goes

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
doesn't look like it because it goes

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.319 
doesn't look like it because it goes
fast<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.350> watch<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.400> get<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.790> we

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
fast but watch this so we get it in we

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.569 
fast but watch this so we get it in we
come<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.930> if<00:01:31.380> I'm<00:01:31.710> squeezing<00:01:32.130> down<00:01:32.549> a

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
come in and if I'm squeezing down a

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.760 
come in and if I'm squeezing down a
little<00:01:32.909> into<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.299> compound<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.290> let<00:01:34.740> me

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
little into the compound here let me

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.530 
little into the compound here let me
just<00:01:34.979> pull<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.220> up<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.520> show<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.180> see<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
just pull it up and show you you see the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.170 
just pull it up and show you you see the
print<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.740> we've<00:01:37.950> got<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.280> high<00:01:38.640> up<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
print so we've got it high up on the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.109 
print so we've got it high up on the
trowel<00:01:39.479> we've<00:01:40.110> got<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.530> lot<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> contacts<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.030> we

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
trowel we've got a lot of contacts so we

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.149 
trowel we've got a lot of contacts so we
get<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.420> contact<00:01:42.960> we're<00:01:43.590> going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> come<00:01:43.979> up

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
get that contact we're going to come up

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.950 
get that contact we're going to come up
like<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.430> now<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> minute<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.390> can't<00:01:45.659> just

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
like this now in a minute I can't just

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.740 
like this now in a minute I can't just
do<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.439> slowly<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.250> come<00:01:47.549> up<00:01:47.750> upside

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
do this slowly so you come up upside

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.590 
do this slowly so you come up upside
down<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.200> there<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.860> now<00:01:50.549> if<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.149> sitting

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
down and there it is now if it's sitting

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.080 
down and there it is now if it's sitting
too<00:01:51.840> far<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.200> front<00:01:52.380> edge<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.430> drop<00:01:53.850> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
too far in the front edge if I drop and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.179 
too far in the front edge if I drop and
go<00:01:54.210> forward<00:01:54.509> watch<00:01:54.780> this

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
go forward watch this

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.459 
go forward watch this
did<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.520> jerk<00:01:56.759> back<00:01:57.020> there<00:01:58.020> went<00:01:58.259> back

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
did you see it jerk back there went back

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.830 
did you see it jerk back there went back
again<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.610> move<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.060> back<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.540> this

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
again so I can move it back with this

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.810 
again so I can move it back with this
little<00:02:01.200> action<00:02:01.320> do<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.649> too<00:02:01.770> much<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.670> get

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
little action do it too much and you get

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.740 
little action do it too much and you get
it<00:02:02.939> down<00:02:03.360> your<00:02:03.630> arm

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
it down your arm

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.180 
it down your arm
so<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:06.900> a<00:02:06.990> balance<00:02:07.410> between<00:02:07.590> all<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:07.950> those

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
so it's a balance between all of those

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.270 
so it's a balance between all of those
things<00:02:08.520> Center<00:02:09.510> it<00:02:09.600> back<00:02:09.810> up<00:02:10.050> find<00:02:11.040> your

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
things Center it back up find your

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.420 
things Center it back up find your
contact<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:11.990> get<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.350> then<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.190> just

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
contact and get it and then we can just

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.330 
contact and get it and then we can just
spin<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.910> around<00:02:15.740> come<00:02:16.740> right<00:02:16.920> off<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.100> edge

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
spin this around come right off the edge

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.000 
spin this around come right off the edge
and<00:02:17.610> get<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.210> you<00:02:18.840> see<00:02:19.080> why<00:02:19.470> did<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.770> go<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
and get it you see why did it go on the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.620 
and get it you see why did it go on the
floor<00:02:20.220> before<00:02:20.700> because<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:21.030> took<00:02:21.090> some<00:02:21.450> like

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
floor before because I took some like

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.350 
floor before because I took some like
this<00:02:21.840> went<00:02:22.560> across<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:23.220> just<00:02:23.610> pushed<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.090> right

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
this went across I just pushed it right

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.050 
this went across I just pushed it right
off<00:02:24.570> thinking<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.650> might<00:02:25.800> come<00:02:26.010> up<00:02:26.190> no<00:02:26.760> we're

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
off thinking it might come up no we're

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.170 
off thinking it might come up no we're
going<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.240> come<00:02:27.450> up<00:02:27.600> contact<00:02:28.700> up<00:02:29.700> like<00:02:30.030> that

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
going to come up contact up like that

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.830 
going to come up contact up like that
and<00:02:30.450> you've<00:02:30.600> got<00:02:30.810> it

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
and you've got it

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.960 
and you've got it
now<00:02:33.840> if<00:02:34.140> you're<00:02:34.470> uncomfortable<00:02:35.100> with<00:02:35.640> drawing

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
now if you're uncomfortable with drawing

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.550 
now if you're uncomfortable with drawing
that<00:02:36.120> there's<00:02:36.390> another<00:02:36.600> technique<00:02:37.140> that's<00:02:37.440> a

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
that there's another technique that's a

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.260 
that there's another technique that's a
little<00:02:37.740> simpler<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.310> won't<00:02:38.490> carry<00:02:38.850> as<00:02:39.090> much

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
little simpler it won't carry as much

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.450 
little simpler it won't carry as much
compound<00:02:39.900> as<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.230> can<00:02:40.410> come<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.070> pull<00:02:41.310> it

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
compound as you can come in and pull it

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.720 
compound as you can come in and pull it
towards<00:02:42.000> yourself<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:43.070> lift<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.250> off<00:02:44.370> before

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
towards yourself and lift it off before

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.090 
towards yourself and lift it off before
you<00:02:45.150> get<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.810> edge<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.260> hawk<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.920> can

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
you get to the edge of the hawk you can

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.680 
you get to the edge of the hawk you can
actually<00:02:47.280> get<00:02:47.520> a<00:02:47.580> fair<00:02:47.910> amount<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.180> compound

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
actually get a fair amount of compound

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.220 
actually get a fair amount of compound
on<00:02:49.020> your<00:02:49.560> trial<00:02:49.830> like<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.840> for<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.870> beginner

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
on your trial like that for a beginner

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.950 
on your trial like that for a beginner
that<00:02:52.380> might<00:02:52.860> be<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.160> easiest<00:02:53.220> way<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.730> start

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
that might be the easiest way to start

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.370 
that might be the easiest way to start
because<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.110> works<00:02:55.410> almost<00:02:55.800> every<00:02:56.490> time

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
because it works almost every time

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.170 
because it works almost every time
without<00:02:58.380> spilling<00:02:58.740> anything<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.670> come<00:02:59.940> in

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
without spilling anything you come in

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.300 
without spilling anything you come in
again<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.900> make<00:03:01.080> contact<00:03:01.560> but<00:03:01.830> I'm<00:03:02.070> going<00:03:02.280> to

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
again you make contact but I'm going to

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.400 
again you make contact but I'm going to
lift<00:03:02.580> off<00:03:02.790> long<00:03:03.390> before<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.840> get<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.290> edge

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
lift off long before I get to the edge

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.220 
lift off long before I get to the edge
and<00:03:04.740> I've<00:03:05.340> got<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.760> fair<00:03:06.120> amount<00:03:06.210> there<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:07.110> be

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
and I've got a fair amount there to be

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.650 
and I've got a fair amount there to be
able<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.410> put<00:03:07.620> on<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:07.830> wall<00:03:08.010> as<00:03:08.250> well<00:03:08.490> a<00:03:08.790> little

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
able to put on the wall as well a little

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.900 
able to put on the wall as well a little
bit<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.840> practice<00:03:10.020> though<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:11.310> can<00:03:11.489> do<00:03:11.670> this

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
bit of practice though you can do this

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.989 
bit of practice though you can do this
like<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.630> pros
