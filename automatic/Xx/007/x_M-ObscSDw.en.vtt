this<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> air<00:01:20.250> which<00:01:20.400> means<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.909> cuts<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
this in the air which means it cuts the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.450 
this in the air which means it cuts the
air<00:01:21.450> better<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.250> hardest

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
air better and it can be the hardest

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.550 
air better and it can be the hardest
pitch<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.000> throw<00:01:24.240> cool<00:01:24.780> velocity<00:01:25.409> wise

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
pitch that you throw cool velocity wise

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.950 
pitch that you throw cool velocity wise
and<00:01:25.830> then<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.850> turn<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.390> side<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and then you turn it on this side and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.810 
okay yeah and then you can call that a
two-seam<00:01:34.860> fastball<00:01:34.890> what's<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.579> supposed

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
two-seam fastball what's that supposed

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.100 
two-seam fastball what's that supposed
to<00:01:35.909> do<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.119> come<00:01:36.299> into<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.570> plate<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> then

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
to do is come into the plate and then

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.870 
to do is come into the plate and then
kind<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.470> run<00:01:37.680> because<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.670> put

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
kind of run because that you put

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.219 
kind of run because that you put

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
not maybe not as hard but you got more

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.770 
not maybe not as hard but you got more
movement<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.030> that's<00:01:45.210> also<00:01:45.420> something

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
movement on it and that's also something

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.450 
movement on it and that's also something
big<00:01:46.049> plus<00:01:46.320> when<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.619> comes<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.860> pitch<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.159> okay

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
big plus when it comes to pitch it okay

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
that's why occurs oh that's cool and

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.900 
that's why occurs oh that's cool and
then<00:02:16.319> slider<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:17.100> kind<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.430> like<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.700> four

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910

move a little bit late and then one more

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.930 
move a little bit late and then one more
is<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> changeup<00:02:51.510> fastballs<00:02:52.170> are<00:02:52.670> your<00:02:53.670> hardest

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
pitch like I said yeah and the key to a

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.340 
pitch like I said yeah and the key to a
changeup<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.570> want<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.810> throw<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.170> like<00:02:58.290> a
