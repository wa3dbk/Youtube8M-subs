00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
gonna win it but it's going to be hard

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.980 
gonna win it but it's going to be hard
when<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.880> play<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.330> us<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.690> my<00:00:39.780> biggest

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:39.990 
when I play for us and my biggest

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.340 
when I play for us and my biggest
moments<00:00:40.470> probably<00:00:40.680> when<00:00:41.580> we<00:00:42.360> haven't<00:00:42.720> lost

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
moments probably when we haven't lost

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.320 
moments probably when we haven't lost
the<00:00:43.500> game<00:00:43.770> or<00:00:44.040> even<00:00:44.520> further<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.060> the<00:00:45.120> next

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
the game or even further to the next

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.350 
the game or even further to the next
season<00:00:45.810> when<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.470> won<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.830> championship<00:00:47.520> at

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
season when we won the championship at

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.390 
season when we won the championship at
the<00:00:48.420> time<00:00:48.720> we<00:00:48.990> didn't<00:00:49.230> realize<00:00:49.620> how<00:00:49.920> good<00:00:50.220> we

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
the time we didn't realize how good we

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.850 
the time we didn't realize how good we
were<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.410> unfortunately<00:00:52.410> we<00:00:52.530> should<00:00:52.710> have

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
were and unfortunately we should have

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.270 
were and unfortunately we should have
won<00:00:53.070> more<00:00:54.030> trophies<00:00:54.350> because<00:00:55.350> by<00:00:55.770> far<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.160> were

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
won more trophies because by far we were

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.660 
won more trophies because by far we were
the<00:00:56.400> best<00:00:56.550> team<00:00:57.380> that<00:00:58.380> sometimes<00:00:59.010> downside<00:00:59.550> in

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the best team that sometimes downside in

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.380 
the best team that sometimes downside in
England<00:01:00.000> because<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.780> FA<00:01:01.110> all<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.470> a<00:01:01.530> sudden

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
England because the FA all of a sudden

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.450 
England because the FA all of a sudden
gets<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.570> consecutive<00:01:04.379> games<00:01:04.650> what<00:01:05.189> happened

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
gets you consecutive games what happened

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.969 
gets you consecutive games what happened
to<00:01:05.549> us<00:01:05.729> at<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> time<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.750> six<00:01:07.170> very<00:01:07.409> hard<00:01:07.679> games

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
to us at the time is six very hard games

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.020 
to us at the time is six very hard games
in<00:01:08.219> 210<00:01:08.609> days<00:01:08.929> and<00:01:09.929> at<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> end<00:01:10.289> we<00:01:10.409> were<00:01:10.530> tired

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
in 210 days and at the end we were tired

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.149 
in 210 days and at the end we were tired
and<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.149> think<00:01:12.179> it's<00:01:12.539> a<00:01:12.719> kind<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.679> reason<00:01:14.070> as

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and I think it's a kind of reason as

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.649 
and I think it's a kind of reason as
well<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.789> the<00:01:14.880> English<00:01:15.119> national<00:01:15.450> team

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
well for the English national team

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.469 
well for the English national team
because<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.289> don't<00:01:16.469> have<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.649> winter<00:01:16.920> break<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
because I don't have a winter break and

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.179 
because I don't have a winter break and
the<00:01:18.479> demands<00:01:18.810> are<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.200> high<00:01:19.469> in<00:01:19.499> England<00:01:19.979> that

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the demands are so high in England that

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.880 
the demands are so high in England that
at<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> end<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> year<00:01:21.350> it's<00:01:22.350> very<00:01:22.469> hard

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
at the end of the year it's very hard

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.800 
at the end of the year it's very hard
for<00:01:23.009> English<00:01:23.399> club<00:01:23.579> teams<00:01:23.880> or<00:01:24.240> for<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
for English club teams or for the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.459 
for English club teams or for the
English<00:01:25.020> national<00:01:25.380> team<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:26.490> perform<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:28.259> an

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
English national team to perform as an

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.310 
English national team to perform as an
agency<00:01:28.590> coach<00:01:29.070> who<00:01:29.729> does<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.539> only<00:01:30.780> inspire

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
agency coach who does not only inspire

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.770 
agency coach who does not only inspire
you<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> pitch<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.399> as<00:01:32.729> well<00:01:32.969> off<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
you on the pitch but as well off the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.109 
you on the pitch but as well off the
pitch<00:01:33.990> you're<00:01:34.710> always<00:01:34.859> getting<00:01:35.249> some<00:01:35.640> great

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
pitch you're always getting some great

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.700 
pitch you're always getting some great
information<00:01:36.420> about<00:01:36.810> some<00:01:37.140> other<00:01:37.289> things<00:01:37.560> in

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
information about some other things in

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.370 
information about some other things in
life<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.299> think<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.420> makes<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.719> great<00:01:39.840> coach<00:01:40.170> as

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
life I think that makes a great coach as

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.830 
life I think that makes a great coach as
well<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.829> was<00:01:41.249> arguing<00:01:41.789> with<00:01:42.119> him<00:01:42.359> quite<00:01:42.630> often

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
well I was arguing with him quite often

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.039 
well I was arguing with him quite often
particularly<00:01:43.710> when<00:01:43.979> he<00:01:44.069> took<00:01:44.249> me<00:01:44.369> out<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.609> gold

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
particularly when he took me out of gold

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.679 
particularly when he took me out of gold
but<00:01:46.049> then<00:01:46.409> after<00:01:46.920> 20<00:01:47.219> minutes<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.689> arguments

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
but then after 20 minutes of arguments

we're coming to place next year's a

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.050 
we're coming to place next year's a
financial<00:02:58.110> firm<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.470> rule<00:02:58.740> so<00:02:59.520> then<00:02:59.760> we<00:02:59.940> will

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
financial firm a rule so then we will

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.680 
financial firm a rule so then we will
see<00:03:00.120> how<00:03:00.750> this<00:03:01.260> rule<00:03:01.590> actually<00:03:02.430> comes<00:03:03.390> into

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
see how this rule actually comes into

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.810 
see how this rule actually comes into
place<00:03:03.930> for<00:03:04.260> clubs<00:03:04.500> like<00:03:04.710> Chelsea<00:03:05.010> main<00:03:05.430> city

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
place for clubs like Chelsea main city

budget<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.550> then<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:12.000> could<00:03:12.210> turn<00:03:12.420> out<00:03:12.600> that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
budget and then it could turn out that

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.930 
budget and then it could turn out that
clubs<00:03:13.170> like<00:03:13.350> Arsenal<00:03:13.860> all<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.370> sudden<00:03:14.730> are

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
the kicking girls and so I'm quite

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
excited to do that I think that in the

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.400 
excited to do that I think that in the
recent<00:03:28.920> years<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:30.120> real<00:03:30.360> football<00:03:30.870> came<00:03:31.140> up

recent years the real football came up

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.940 
recent years the real football came up
and<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:32.970> think<00:03:33.180> it's<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.420> great<00:03:33.630> sport<00:03:33.990> it's

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
and and I think it's a great sport it's

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.010 
and and I think it's a great sport it's
a<00:03:35.160> team<00:03:35.400> sport<00:03:35.430> which<00:03:36.150> always<00:03:36.390> gives<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:36.990> a

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
a team sport which always gives you a

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.080 
a team sport which always gives you a
lot<00:03:37.230> for<00:03:37.440> life<00:03:37.650> with<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.430> money<00:03:38.580> which<00:03:38.940> is

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
lot for life with the money which is

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.060 
lot for life with the money which is
going<00:03:39.240> to<00:03:39.330> be<00:03:39.510> raised<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.930> 9<00:03:40.350> which<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:40.680> about

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
going to be raised to 9 which is about

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.420 
going to be raised to 9 which is about
100,000<00:03:42.060> euros<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.690> think<00:03:43.500> there<00:03:43.710> are<00:03:43.740> so<00:03:44.280> many

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
100,000 euros I think there are so many

100,000 euros I think there are so many
projects<00:03:45.030> which<00:03:45.960> could<00:03:46.230> be<00:03:46.350> realized<00:03:46.800> and
