00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
 O 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.570
 and then guys who are talking about is the joe 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.460
 trunk and I'll do a tutorial and well 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.430
 basic with low is to install a lot 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.619
 of the future if the dance will craft your 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.840
 more people 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.599
 so the first thing to do is to do the 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.930
 download here he will start the 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.860
 download as I have to cancel 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.690
 start 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.559
 first you have to have a mistake right? 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.330
 to open this file here that is only 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.250
 with err to see 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.890
 No, there was no other way. 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.159
 file only one white sheet 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.150
 then he did not like that so when 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:57.320
 you download it will appear it 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.629
 appear here below as well 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.339
 will appear full download you 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.100
 click it it will open so it is if you 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:07.430
 have one in haruna there will be like this 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.310
 absolute move pack you click here no 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.440
 you need to click on it here jatapú a 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.960
 folder points minecraft then you have to 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.310
 Are you going to come here in the menu? 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.930
 start as mac mac book that you have 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.930
 watching I do not know how it is macbook 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.119
 Then you have to find another video to 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.789
 macbook even because this one remembers 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.609
 windows you go here in the start menu 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:38.600
 put here here taking my brother you 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:41.810
 here puts percent date app percent 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.020
 or a way there I appear home a 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.820
 most practical way to do is 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.609
 until late here on the keyboard you will have the 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.890
 windows symbol you even moved to 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.170
 but r is the letter r 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.109
 so it will appear here you already write 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.229
 the same per cent up to atp date 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:03.740
 percent which places yoki go from here 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.280
 the minecraft point folder you will delete 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.590
 This one here will pay for this folder. 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.230
 current here as i already have packwood idea 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.200
 of the future to all that ali treki ford 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.150
 but if you have not you will delete if 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.569
 You do not want to go away anymore or if you already 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.930
 have another pec where you want by 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.200
 example do not want to put off points 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.569
 minecraft you sell 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.300
 slice and dice does create a new folder 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:37.800
 and remember the beauty I will not want to cut 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:42.630
 You come here and drag her 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.090
 drags trash from the folder and ready to whom 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.140
 I did not understand the game right, I said 'you 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.769
 will come here 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.890
 going to vote percentage avp june 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.260
 date percentage will give an enter goes 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.080
 come this way you come here come 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.030
 delete or if you want to save this 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.370
 old minecraft point 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.430
 you come cut creates a new folder in 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.209
 somewhere and glue on that other part that 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.130
 you created 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.630
 but if you want to pay it's easier 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.849
 you turn it off 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.099
 You will not have it any more, it will not go any more. 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:18.209
 have that minecraft point there you come 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:22.190
 Here it takes this point. 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:25.860
 Up and over, the button will drag avaí 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.670
 It will appear and this one will pass here. 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.620
 here 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.900
 and then when you automatically went 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.579
 opened your minecraft will appear will 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.250
 ask lina is if lord barrichello 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.739

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.310

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.489
 You do not think that it will not open 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:12.569
