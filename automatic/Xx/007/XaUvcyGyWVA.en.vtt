00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
us um it was really good um it was a bit

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.800 
us um it was really good um it was a bit
weird<00:00:20.130> but<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.270> most<00:00:21.420> part<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.750> was

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
weird but for the most part it was

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.720 
weird but for the most part it was
really<00:00:22.050> fun<00:00:22.260> actually<00:00:22.949> was<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.340> first<00:00:23.550> time

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
really fun actually was the first time

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.359 
really fun actually was the first time
you've<00:00:24.269> done<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.510> hundred<00:00:25.140> percent<00:00:25.439> fpv<00:00:26.130> flight

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
you've done a hundred percent fpv flight

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.750 
you've done a hundred percent fpv flight
wasn't<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.789> whether<00:00:27.029> launch<00:00:27.560> was<00:00:28.560> fpv<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.369> so

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
wasn't it whether launch was fpv and so

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.939 
wasn't it whether launch was fpv and so
was<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.359> landing<00:00:31.019> from<00:00:31.289> beginning<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> end

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
was the landing from beginning to end

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.630 
was the landing from beginning to end
isn't<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.340> yeah<00:00:33.380> so<00:00:34.380> well<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.860> think<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.250> gave

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
isn't it yeah so well I think we gave

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.100 
isn't it yeah so well I think we gave
him<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.790> little<00:00:35.910> bit<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.180> assistance<00:00:36.630> as<00:00:36.780> far<00:00:36.989> as

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
him a little bit of assistance as far as

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.690 
him a little bit of assistance as far as
guiding<00:00:37.469> him<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> air<00:00:37.980> cuz<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.550> now<00:00:38.670> I

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
guiding him in the air cuz but now I

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.430 
guiding him in the air cuz but now I
always<00:00:39.090> stay<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:42.079> knowing<00:00:43.079> once

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
always stay on this one but knowing once

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.420 
always stay on this one but knowing once
you<00:00:43.500> get<00:00:43.590> used<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:43.920> looks<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.370> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
you get used to what looks like it's a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.310 
you get used to what looks like it's a
different<00:00:45.329> place<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> fly<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.170> kind

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
different place to fly it so it's kind

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.540 
different place to fly it so it's kind
of<00:00:46.379> understandable<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:47.219> good<00:00:47.370> when<00:00:47.520> you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
of understandable it's good when you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.389 
of understandable it's good when you
know<00:00:47.670> what<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.329> looks<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.629> from<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.350> air

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
know what it looks like from the air

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.319 
know what it looks like from the air
that's<00:00:50.399> right<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.730> makes<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.969> big<00:00:51.090> difference

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
that's right that makes a big difference

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.819 
that's right that makes a big difference
so<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:51.539> we've<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> questions<00:00:52.739> I've

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
so what we've one of the questions I've

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.250 
so what we've one of the questions I've
