and<00:01:40.300> do<00:01:40.540> it<00:01:40.570> again<00:01:40.900> so<00:01:41.230> we<00:01:41.500> found<00:01:41.770> that<00:01:41.890> our

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
and do it again so we found that our

recovery product allows us to recover a
lot<00:01:45.370> faster<00:01:45.880> allows<00:01:46.300> our<00:01:46.510> muscles<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.170> heal

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
lot faster allows our muscles to heal

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.230 
lot faster allows our muscles to heal
themselves<00:01:48.040> a<00:01:48.100> lot<00:01:48.220> faster<00:01:48.640> so<00:01:48.820> we're<00:01:48.940> not<00:01:49.090> as

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
themselves a lot faster so we're not as

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
drink is important to me because it

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.090 
drink is important to me because it
keeps<00:02:13.630> me<00:02:13.810> hydrated<00:02:14.260> but<00:02:14.530> I'm<00:02:14.650> also<00:02:14.800> getting

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
that that protein is so essential you

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.900 
that that protein is so essential you
know<00:02:17.410> not<00:02:17.590> only<00:02:17.620> for<00:02:17.980> muscle<00:02:18.220> recovery<00:02:18.250> but<00:02:18.790> as
