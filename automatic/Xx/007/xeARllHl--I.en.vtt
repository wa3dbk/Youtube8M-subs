then like that I can secure it and there

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.899 
then like that I can secure it and there
yeah<00:01:59.909> now<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:01.049> move<00:02:01.950> around<00:02:02.100> go<00:02:02.640> side<00:02:02.880> to

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
yeah now we can move around go side to

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.639 
yeah now we can move around go side to
side<00:02:03.030> for<00:02:03.329> them<00:02:03.509> back<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.840> lot<00:02:04.049> more<00:02:04.200> freely

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
side for them back a lot more freely

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.770 
side for them back a lot more freely
it's<00:02:05.130> like<00:02:05.540> the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
it's like the

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.510 
it's like the
device<00:02:08.710> wheels<00:02:09.070> of<00:02:10.140> Rev<00:02:11.140> device<00:02:11.440> here<00:02:11.800> but

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
device wheels of Rev device here but

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.870 
device wheels of Rev device here but
they<00:02:13.120> actually<00:02:13.240> work<00:02:14.100> similarly<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.610> core

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
they actually work similarly in the core

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.880 
they actually work similarly in the core
instead<00:02:16.570> of<00:02:16.660> having<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.640> wheels<00:02:19.740> they<00:02:20.740> have

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
instead of having the wheels they have

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.430 
instead of having the wheels they have
sort<00:02:21.130> of<00:02:21.220> ball<00:02:21.850> bearings<00:02:22.360> in<00:02:22.600> there<00:02:22.780> provides

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
sort of ball bearings in there provides

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.250 
sort of ball bearings in there provides
a<00:02:23.530> lot<00:02:23.800> less<00:02:24.010> friction<00:02:24.600> it's<00:02:25.600> really<00:02:25.810> great

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
a lot less friction it's really great

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.350 
a lot less friction it's really great

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.260 
got the emblem there with lip dragon on
it<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:29.710> bolts<00:02:30.100> as<00:02:30.910> well<00:02:31.360> as<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:32.290> device<00:02:32.710> horn

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
it the bolts as well as the device horn

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.700 
it the bolts as well as the device horn
which<00:02:34.270> not<00:02:34.600> only<00:02:34.740> provides<00:02:35.740> a<00:02:36.010> little<00:02:36.250> bit<00:02:36.430> of

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
which not only provides a little bit of

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.260 
which not only provides a little bit of
rapid<00:02:38.710> fire<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:41.440> can<00:02:41.590> roll<00:02:41.740> it<00:02:41.770> with<00:02:41.980> one<00:02:42.130> hand

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
rapid fire you can roll it with one hand

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.430 
rapid fire you can roll it with one hand
to<00:02:43.270> shoot<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.750> also<00:02:46.750> has<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.620> ability<00:02:47.950> of

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
to shoot but it also has the ability of

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.470 
to shoot but it also has the ability of
converting<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.530> into<00:02:50.740> Sonic<00:02:51.400> mode<00:02:51.760> now<00:02:52.330> I'm

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
converting it into Sonic mode now I'm

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.340 
converting it into Sonic mode now I'm
not<00:02:52.630> exactly<00:02:53.170> sure<00:02:54.690> precisely<00:02:55.690> how<00:02:56.170> this

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
not exactly sure precisely how this

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.510 
not exactly sure precisely how this
works

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
works

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.430 
works
but<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:57.850> can<00:02:57.970> see<00:02:58.240> in<00:02:58.510> there<00:02:58.840> when<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.290> bring

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
but you can see in there when you bring

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.500 
but you can see in there when you bring
it<00:02:59.590> down<00:02:59.620> it<00:03:00.400> brings<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.820> little<00:03:00.940> bit<00:03:01.060> down<00:03:01.330> and

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
it down it brings a little bit down and

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.750 
it down it brings a little bit down and
I<00:03:01.570> think<00:03:01.810> what<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.050> does<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.890> centers

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
I think what it does is it it centers

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.540 
I think what it does is it it centers
the<00:03:03.970> B<00:03:04.150> Dhamma<00:03:04.450> in<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.959> core<00:03:05.230> as<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:06.370> marble

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
the B Dhamma in the core as the marble

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.260 
the B Dhamma in the core as the marble
falls<00:03:07.030> down<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:08.380> makes<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.370> line<00:03:09.520> of<00:03:09.700> fire<00:03:09.940> a

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
falls down and makes the line of fire a

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.259 
falls down and makes the line of fire a
lot<00:03:10.570> more<00:03:10.860> concise<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:13.420> works<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.560> an<00:03:14.709> extent

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
lot more concise it works to an extent

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.910 
lot more concise it works to an extent
it's<00:03:16.269> not<00:03:17.340> incredibly<00:03:18.540> drastic<00:03:19.709> now<00:03:20.709> being

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
it's not incredibly drastic now being

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.400 
it's not incredibly drastic now being
rapid<00:03:21.220> fire<00:03:21.370> type<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:22.540> want<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.780> shoot<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:23.170> lot

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
rapid fire type you want to shoot a lot

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
rapid fire type you want to shoot a lot
of<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:24.040> dama

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
of the dama

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.840 
of the dama
unfortunately<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:26.860> can<00:03:26.980> only<00:03:27.130> hold<00:03:27.340> two<00:03:27.430> as

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
unfortunately you can only hold two as

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.250 
unfortunately you can only hold two as
is<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:28.360> you're<00:03:28.480> going<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.660> have<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.840> buy<00:03:28.959> some

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
is so you're going to have to buy some

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.340 
is so you're going to have to buy some
tune-up<00:03:29.680> here<00:03:29.860> I<00:03:29.980> have<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.610> cyclone<00:03:31.600> magazine

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
tune-up here I have the cyclone magazine

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.340 
tune-up here I have the cyclone magazine
here<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:33.220> it<00:03:33.550> works<00:03:33.700> just<00:03:34.150> fine<00:03:34.390> with<00:03:34.720> es

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
here and it works just fine with es

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.990 
here and it works just fine with es
b-daman<00:03:35.920> I'm<00:03:36.310> going<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.519> take<00:03:36.640> this<00:03:36.760> bit

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
b-daman I'm going to take this bit

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.580 
b-daman I'm going to take this bit
laptop<00:03:37.630> bit<00:03:37.840> off<00:03:37.959> just<00:03:38.590> because<00:03:39.060> well<00:03:40.590> it

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
laptop bit off just because well it

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.360 
laptop bit off just because well it
endures<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.760> from<00:03:43.090> seeing<00:03:43.530> exactly<00:03:44.530> what's

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
endures you from seeing exactly what's

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.370 
endures you from seeing exactly what's
going<00:03:45.580> on<00:03:45.760> here

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
going on here

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.259 
going on here
so<00:03:47.380> I'll<00:03:47.620> bring<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.070> camera<00:03:48.310> down<00:03:48.610> just<00:03:49.120> a

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
so I'll bring the camera down just a

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.170 
so I'll bring the camera down just a
little<00:03:49.299> more<00:03:49.720> another<00:03:50.709> thing<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:51.519> is<00:03:52.150> a

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
little more another thing that is a

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.320 
little more another thing that is a
problem<00:03:52.660> with<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.040> ESP<00:03:54.040> Daman<00:03:54.280> here<00:03:54.610> is<00:03:54.760> just

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
problem with the ESP Daman here is just

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.199 
problem with the ESP Daman here is just
the<00:03:55.450> fact<00:03:55.690> that<00:03:56.519> they<00:03:57.519> have<00:03:57.610> no<00:03:57.760> back<00:03:57.970> support

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
the fact that they have no back support

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.310 
the fact that they have no back support
so<00:03:58.959> they'll<00:03:59.290> just<00:03:59.320> fall<00:03:59.860> over<00:04:00.700> but<00:04:01.209> firing<00:04:02.019> it

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
so they'll just fall over but firing it

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.250 
so they'll just fall over but firing it
normally<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:06.100> rapid<00:04:06.430> fire<00:04:06.580> is<00:04:07.000> great<00:04:07.360> it's<00:04:08.170> a

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
normally the rapid fire is great it's a

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.699 
normally the rapid fire is great it's a
lot<00:04:08.590> better<00:04:08.860> than<00:04:09.360> Rev<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.870> race<00:04:12.989> so<00:04:13.989> one<00:04:14.530> more

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
lot better than Rev to race so one more

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.379 
lot better than Rev to race so one more
time

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.650 

got<00:04:18.389> great<00:04:19.280> rapid-fire<00:04:20.660> capabilities

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
got great rapid-fire capabilities

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
got great rapid-fire capabilities
they're<00:04:23.000> now<00:04:24.000> converting<00:04:24.720> it<00:04:24.810> into<00:04:25.020> Sonic

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
they're now converting it into Sonic

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.000 
they're now converting it into Sonic
mode<00:04:27.139> normal<00:04:28.139> mode<00:04:28.290> it's<00:04:28.500> supposed<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.860> be<00:04:28.979> a

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
mode normal mode it's supposed to be a

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.150 
mode normal mode it's supposed to be a
little<00:04:29.250> more<00:04:29.370> scattered<00:04:29.930> when<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.320> shoots<00:04:34.160> you

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
little more scattered when it shoots you

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.550 
little more scattered when it shoots you
can<00:04:35.280> see<00:04:35.370> they<00:04:35.490> tend<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.330> sway<00:04:36.780> to<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:37.169> side<00:04:37.530> a

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
can see they tend to sway to the side a

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.180 
can see they tend to sway to the side a
lot<00:04:38.010> more<00:04:38.280> I<00:04:38.490> think<00:04:39.530> just<00:04:40.530> slightly<00:04:41.810> but<00:04:43.190> when

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
lot more I think just slightly but when

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.580 
lot more I think just slightly but when
you<00:04:44.280> bring<00:04:44.520> me<00:04:44.699> horn<00:04:45.000> down<00:04:45.240> it's<00:04:46.199> supposed<00:04:46.500> to

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
you bring me horn down it's supposed to

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.240 
you bring me horn down it's supposed to
make<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:47.040> a<00:04:47.250> bit<00:04:48.090> more<00:04:48.650> accurate<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:50.160> I

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
make it a bit more accurate and I

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.870 
make it a bit more accurate and I
suppose<00:04:50.669> that<00:04:51.150> is<00:04:51.479> true<00:04:51.889> it<00:04:52.889> does<00:04:53.220> make<00:04:53.490> it<00:04:53.669> a

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
suppose that is true it does make it a

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.900 
suppose that is true it does make it a
little<00:04:54.180> more<00:04:55.460> controlled<00:04:58.130> well<00:04:59.130> on<00:04:59.310> do<00:04:59.580> a<00:04:59.610> shot

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
little more controlled well on do a shot

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.279 
little more controlled well on do a shot
from<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.180> front<00:05:00.479> here<00:05:00.750> just<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:02.190> compare

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.390 

probably<00:05:07.289> should<00:05:07.440> show<00:05:07.620> off<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.949> emblem

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
probably should show off the emblem

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.000 
probably should show off the emblem
charge<00:05:08.669> it's<00:05:09.000> not<00:05:09.449> that<00:05:09.990> spectacular<00:05:10.320> you

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
charge it's not that spectacular you

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.310 
charge it's not that spectacular you
just<00:05:11.190> push<00:05:11.340> in<00:05:11.520> on<00:05:11.639> the<00:05:11.669> emblems<00:05:12.270> here<00:05:12.600> and<00:05:12.810> it
