00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
 many times 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.900
 those who are preparers who 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.429
 We spent some time in this sector 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.429
 those who have dared 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.370
 to be able to prepare people to compete 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.080
 we meet 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.080
 with a very usual case 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.510
 people with a great genetics a great 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.990
 predisposition to muscle development 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.340
 athletes 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.340
 with great potential 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.730
 and the phrase is always the same 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.840
 take off your clothes put on your swimsuit 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.910
 in front of the preparer in front of 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:56.140
 friends during the students and say how 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.140
 you see me look 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.210
 The problem is often that 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.470
 Genetics is not everything 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.860
 that bodybuilding 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.490
 you have to understand it from the perspective 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.240
 of optical effect we really are what 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.350
 we are on stage and under 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.350
 effect of the lights 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.369
 we are not 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.040
 or we do not seem what we are 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.270
 that is, one can be very strong and 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.020
 when you go up to the stage not to 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.450
 look like 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.570
 to be a great actor and interpret the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.420
 Strong man paper is sometimes a 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.450
 complicated paper that we call the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.680
 attitude on the competition stage 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.690
 but many times also 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.480
 the extreme definition that point 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.900
 what we call definition endpoint is 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.910
 the one who does not do the one who makes us get 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.340
 win the championships many times not 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.580
 win 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:12.229
 the best-equipped athlete 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.229
 and all this would summarize 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.160
 with the following sentence 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.690
 it can go very wrong 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.130
 you can go wrong you can go out 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:30.180
 regular you can get it right you can 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.960
 get out very well and when we go out of shape 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.960
 exceptional 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.710
 On some occasion it may seem 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.710
 extraordinary 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.550
 and this is what you have to look for 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.460
 always exceptionally 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.940
 so that on some occasion it seems 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.730
 we have extraordinary judges and that 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.220
 day 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.620
 you will win the world championship or the 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.620
 Mr. Universe or the Arnold Classic 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.960
 Y 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.030
 two 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.069
 do not 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.669
 do not
