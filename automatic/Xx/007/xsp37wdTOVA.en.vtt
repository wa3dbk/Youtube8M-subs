I<00:02:14.190> did<00:02:14.460> not<00:02:15.950> contour<00:02:16.950> at<00:02:17.220> all<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.850> I

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
I did not contour at all and I

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.130 
I did not contour at all and I
highlighted<00:02:18.960> only<00:02:19.500> occasionally<00:02:21.590> why<00:02:22.590> uh

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
highlighted only occasionally why uh

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.320 
highlighted only occasionally why uh
laziness<00:02:26.120> but<00:02:27.590> contouring<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.830> think<00:02:29.400> looks<00:02:30.030> a

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
laziness but contouring I think looks a

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.870 
laziness but contouring I think looks a
lot<00:02:31.080> better<00:02:31.410> especially<00:02:31.680> if<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.430> have<00:02:32.640> any

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
lot better especially if you have any

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.720 
lot better especially if you have any
extra<00:02:33.360> weight<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.990> I'm<00:02:34.470> like<00:02:34.800> 15<00:02:35.250> pounds

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
extra weight on you I'm like 15 pounds

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.360 
extra weight on you I'm like 15 pounds
overweight<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.900> can<00:02:37.080> use<00:02:37.350> some<00:02:37.650> contouring

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
overweight so I can use some contouring

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.510 
overweight so I can use some contouring
in<00:02:38.520> my<00:02:38.670> face<00:02:38.910> because<00:02:39.210> it's<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.870> little<00:02:40.740> bit<00:02:41.100> a

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
in my face because it's a little bit a

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.170 
in my face because it's a little bit a
little<00:02:42.360> bit<00:02:42.480> too<00:02:42.870> full<00:02:43.790> trying<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.850> think<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.150> a

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
little bit too full trying to think of a

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.130 
little bit too full trying to think of a
nicest<00:02:45.720> way<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:45.960> put<00:02:46.320> this<00:02:47.000> yeah<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:48.480> if<00:02:49.050> you

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
nicest way to put this yeah so if you

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.960 
nicest way to put this yeah so if you
have<00:02:49.500> any<00:02:49.680> extra<00:02:50.070> weight<00:02:50.280> on<00:02:50.490> you<00:02:50.670> at<00:02:50.820> all<00:02:50.910> that

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
have any extra weight on you at all that

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.720 
have any extra weight on you at all that
contouring<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.050> must<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.730> highlighting

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
contouring is a must and highlighting

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.730 
contouring is a must and highlighting
doesn't<00:02:54.480> make<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:54.810> much<00:02:54.870> bit<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.380> difference

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
doesn't make that much bit of difference

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.920 
doesn't make that much bit of difference
but<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.070> only<00:02:56.280> takes<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.790> second<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.330> do<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.690> so

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
but it only takes a second to do it so

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.740 
but it only takes a second to do it so
why<00:02:58.200> not<00:02:58.640> okay<00:02:59.640> first<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.300> all<00:03:00.420> let's<00:03:00.660> start

with the contouring and I'm gonna use a

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.150 
with the contouring and I'm gonna use a
matte<00:03:05.940> bronzer<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.810> NYC<00:03:09.810> sunny<00:03:10.230> it's

we're gonna go from we're gonna go under

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.220 
we're gonna go from we're gonna go under
our<00:03:53.250> cheekbone<00:03:53.760> now<00:03:54.360> not<00:03:54.690> everybody's

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
our cheekbone now not everybody's

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.270 
our cheekbone now not everybody's
cheekbones<00:03:55.680> are<00:03:55.890> in<00:03:56.040> exactly<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.670> same<00:03:56.700> place

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
cheekbones are in exactly the same place

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.610 
cheekbones are in exactly the same place
for<00:03:59.280> example<00:03:59.370> my<00:04:00.090> husband's<00:04:00.720> cheekbones<00:04:01.260> are

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
for example my husband's cheekbones are

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.180 
for example my husband's cheekbones are
like<00:04:01.680> right<00:04:02.370> under<00:04:02.850> his<00:04:03.120> eyes<00:04:03.890> because<00:04:04.890> he's

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
like right under his eyes because he's

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.300 
like right under his eyes because he's
part<00:04:05.520> Native<00:04:05.850> American<00:04:06.410> so<00:04:07.410> he<00:04:07.680> has<00:04:07.800> really

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
part Native American so he has really

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.780 
part Native American so he has really
high<00:04:08.520> cheekbones<00:04:09.120> so<00:04:09.660> if<00:04:10.050> you<00:04:10.710> can't<00:04:11.040> see<00:04:11.190> your

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
high cheekbones so if you can't see your

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.760 
high cheekbones so if you can't see your
cheekbones<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.780> mean<00:04:13.020> if<00:04:13.140> you<00:04:13.230> can<00:04:13.410> see<00:04:13.650> them

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
cheekbones I mean if you can see them

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.340 
cheekbones I mean if you can see them
great<00:04:14.040> but<00:04:14.580> if<00:04:14.730> you<00:04:14.850> can't<00:04:15.120> see<00:04:15.450> them<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.900> good

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
great but if you can't see them a good

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.420 
great but if you can't see them a good
rule<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.650> thumb<00:04:16.859> is<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.820> place<00:04:18.210> your<00:04:18.239> bronzer

your<00:04:31.920> cheeks<00:04:33.560> see<00:04:34.560> that<00:04:35.330> when<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.360> do<00:04:36.510> that<00:04:36.840> my

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
your cheeks see that when I do that my

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.620 
your cheeks see that when I do that my
cheekbones<00:04:37.830> just<00:04:37.980> pop<00:04:38.400> out<00:04:38.640> a<00:04:38.670> little<00:04:39.180> bit<00:04:39.450> so

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
cheekbones just pop out a little bit so

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.830 
cheekbones just pop out a little bit so
that<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.840> can<00:04:40.020> see<00:04:40.260> where<00:04:40.410> they<00:04:40.620> are<00:04:41.690> so<00:04:42.690> we're

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
that I can see where they are so we're

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.730 
that I can see where they are so we're
just<00:04:42.870> gonna<00:04:43.140> go<00:04:43.410> underneath<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:46.470> we're<00:04:46.620> just

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
just gonna go underneath and we're just

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.890 
just gonna go underneath and we're just
gonna<00:04:46.980> do<00:04:47.310> a<00:04:48.170> line<00:04:49.170> like<00:04:49.530> that<00:04:49.800> okay<00:04:50.580> now<00:04:51.510> we're

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
gonna do a line like that okay now we're

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.900 
gonna do a line like that okay now we're
gonna<00:04:52.020> make<00:04:52.290> small<00:04:52.590> circles<00:04:53.100> and<00:04:53.340> just<00:04:53.370> blend

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
gonna make small circles and just blend

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.670 
gonna make small circles and just blend
it<00:04:54.120> out<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:54.390> we<00:04:54.900> don't<00:04:55.020> have<00:04:55.230> that<00:04:55.440> brown

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
it out so we don't have that brown

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.090 
it out so we don't have that brown
stripe<00:04:56.070> on<00:04:56.280> our<00:04:56.430> face<00:04:57.080> so<00:04:58.080> it<00:04:58.530> doesn't<00:04:58.950> it

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
stripe on our face so it doesn't it

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.070 
stripe on our face so it doesn't it
doesn't<00:04:59.460> matter<00:04:59.610> where<00:04:59.880> you<00:04:59.910> start<00:05:00.090> but<00:05:00.780> just

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
doesn't matter where you start but just

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.870 
doesn't matter where you start but just
just<00:05:01.560> small<00:05:01.980> circles<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:02.880> blend<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:04.880> that's

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
just small circles and blend and that's

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.210 
just small circles and blend and that's
all<00:05:06.210> there<00:05:06.510> is<00:05:06.540> to<00:05:06.960> it<00:05:07.110> for<00:05:07.290> contour<00:05:07.770> so<00:05:08.010> let's

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
all there is to it for contour so let's

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:18.620 
all there is to it for contour so let's
do<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:08.580> other<00:05:08.610> side

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.200 

so<00:05:19.230> just<00:05:19.530> do<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.860> stripe<00:05:20.220> and<00:05:20.460> then<00:05:20.790> small

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
so just do the stripe and then small

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:29.810 
so just do the stripe and then small
circles<00:05:22.340> to<00:05:23.340> blend<00:05:27.410> okay<00:05:28.410> so<00:05:29.100> there's<00:05:29.550> the

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
circles to blend okay so there's the

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.960 
circles to blend okay so there's the
contour<00:05:30.470> then<00:05:31.470> I'm<00:05:31.770> gonna<00:05:31.980> apply<00:05:32.430> my<00:05:32.760> blush

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.130 
your cheekbones from like say the middle
of<00:07:05.760> your<00:07:05.940> eye<00:07:06.500> outward<00:07:07.640> okay<00:07:08.640> and<00:07:09.540> just<00:07:09.870> brush

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.140 
of your eye outward okay and just brush

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.330 
of your eye outward okay and just brush
that<00:07:10.440> across<00:07:12.290> it's<00:07:13.290> easier<00:07:13.680> if<00:07:13.950> you<00:07:14.100> make<00:07:14.310> a

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 
that across it's easier if you make a

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:21.200 
that across it's easier if you make a
little<00:07:14.580> smile<00:07:17.210> okay<00:07:19.700> just<00:07:20.700> put<00:07:20.880> a<00:07:20.910> little<00:07:21.120> more

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.210 
little smile okay just put a little more

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.690 
little smile okay just put a little more
on

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:23.700 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.520 

and<00:07:24.700> you're<00:07:24.850> gonna<00:07:24.970> go<00:07:25.180> right<00:07:25.540> across<00:07:25.780> the<00:07:26.290> top

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.530 
and you're gonna go right across the top

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:32.090 
and you're gonna go right across the top
of<00:07:26.560> your<00:07:26.800> cheekbone<00:07:27.280> and<00:07:27.670> blend<00:07:28.060> it<00:07:28.240> outward

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:32.100 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:37.020 

okay<00:07:33.100> so<00:07:33.550> that's<00:07:34.210> how<00:07:34.510> I<00:07:34.540> do<00:07:34.750> my<00:07:35.640> contour<00:07:36.640> blush

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.030 
okay so that's how I do my contour blush

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.340 
okay so that's how I do my contour blush
and<00:07:37.390> highlighter<00:07:38.020> and<00:07:38.970> I<00:07:39.970> think<00:07:40.900> you<00:07:41.050> know<00:07:41.140> it

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:41.350 
and highlighter and I think you know it

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.230 
and highlighter and I think you know it
only<00:07:41.590> takes<00:07:41.890> a<00:07:42.040> couple<00:07:42.220> minutes<00:07:42.370> but<00:07:42.850> it<00:07:43.000> does

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 
only takes a couple minutes but it does

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.550 
only takes a couple minutes but it does
make<00:07:43.570> a<00:07:43.630> difference<00:07:44.340> I<00:07:45.340> used<00:07:46.210> to<00:07:46.420> just<00:07:46.660> ignore

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:47.560 
make a difference I used to just ignore

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.010 
make a difference I used to just ignore
that<00:07:47.590> part<00:07:48.130> of<00:07:48.370> the<00:07:48.880> face<00:07:49.240> routine<00:07:49.750> or<00:07:49.990> a

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.020 
that part of the face routine or a

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.020 
that part of the face routine or a
foundation<00:07:50.260> routine<00:07:50.950> that<00:07:51.160> most<00:07:51.460> people<00:07:51.820> do

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:52.030 
foundation routine that most people do

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.480 
foundation routine that most people do
but<00:07:52.300> I<00:07:52.570> think<00:07:53.260> it's<00:07:53.410> worth<00:07:53.590> it<00:07:53.800> to<00:07:53.830> just<00:07:54.250> take<00:07:54.460> a

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:54.490 
but I think it's worth it to just take a

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.630 
but I think it's worth it to just take a
couple<00:07:54.730> extra<00:07:55.060> minutes<00:07:55.630> to<00:07:55.720> do<00:07:55.990> that<00:07:56.490> so<00:07:57.490> if

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:57.640 
couple extra minutes to do that so if

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.880 
couple extra minutes to do that so if
you<00:07:57.760> have<00:07:57.880> any<00:07:58.030> comments<00:07:58.510> or<00:07:58.570> questions<00:07:58.890> leave
