00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
that is its swivel your cups and the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.160 
that is its swivel your cups and the
design<00:02:10.709> where<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.129> ear<00:02:11.310> cups<00:02:11.550> go<00:02:12.270> around<00:02:12.720> your

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
design where the ear cups go around your

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.110

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.000 
know how to pronounce that and I just
think<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.640> Astros<00:03:24.150> are<00:03:24.930> superior<00:03:25.500> might

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
a reason why it sounds like it's because

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.160 
a reason why it sounds like it's because
it<00:04:59.820> is<00:04:59.940> a<00:04:59.970> great<00:05:00.240> headset<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:00.720> I<00:05:00.780> have<00:05:00.870> nothing

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
the Astra gaming company so do I think

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.780 
the Astra gaming company so do I think
it's<00:05:06.600> worth<00:05:06.660> of<00:05:06.900> $250<00:05:07.770> in<00:05:07.980> comparison<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.670> some

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
it's worth of $250 in comparison to some

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.490 
it's worth of $250 in comparison to some
other<00:05:08.880> headsets<00:05:09.390> which<00:05:09.780> might<00:05:09.990> be<00:05:10.110> offered<00:05:10.380> at
