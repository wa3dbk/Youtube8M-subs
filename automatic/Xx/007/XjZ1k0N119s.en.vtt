hi everyone and welcome to this tutorial

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.070 
hi everyone and welcome to this tutorial
video<00:00:08.490> in<00:00:08.730> this<00:00:09.179> video<00:00:09.300> I'll<00:00:09.599> be<00:00:09.630> showing<00:00:09.750> you

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
video in this video I'll be showing you

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.530 
video in this video I'll be showing you
how<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.290> draw<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> mountain<00:00:11.190> there's<00:00:12.150> many<00:00:12.330> other

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
how I draw a mountain there's many other

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.240 
how I draw a mountain there's many other
different<00:00:12.630> methods<00:00:13.230> for<00:00:13.440> drawing<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.920> mountain

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
different methods for drawing a mountain

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.939 
different methods for drawing a mountain
so<00:00:14.820> don't<00:00:15.000> take<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.269> as<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.540> only<00:00:15.929> way<00:00:16.170> this

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
so don't take this as the only way this

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.340 
so don't take this as the only way this
is<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.250> way<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.580> I'd<00:00:17.910> go<00:00:18.270> about<00:00:18.390> drawing<00:00:19.109> one

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
is the way that I'd go about drawing one

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.769 
is the way that I'd go about drawing one
start<00:00:20.160> off<00:00:20.310> by<00:00:20.460> drawing<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.820> outlines<00:00:21.119> they

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
start off by drawing the outlines they

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.910 
start off by drawing the outlines they
don't<00:00:21.960> have<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.140> be<00:00:22.199> exactly<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:22.650> this

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
don't have to be exactly like this

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.320 
don't have to be exactly like this
you'll<00:00:23.519> be<00:00:23.609> able<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.850> find<00:00:24.029> some<00:00:24.180> awesome

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
you'll be able to find some awesome

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.390 
you'll be able to find some awesome
reference<00:00:24.840> images<00:00:25.170> online<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:26.099> will<00:00:26.189> help

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
reference images online that will help

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.009

to<00:00:26.699> give<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.000> some<00:00:27.150> ideas<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.750> shapes

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
to give you some ideas for the shapes

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.500 
to give you some ideas for the shapes
I'll<00:00:29.010> also<00:00:29.189> mention<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.000> video<00:00:30.119> I'm

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
I'll also mention this in this video I'm

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.650 
I'll also mention this in this video I'm

LEDs<00:00:36.620> but<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> kind<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.070> pencil<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.399> use

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
LEDs but the kind of pencil you use

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.610 
LEDs but the kind of pencil you use
doesn't<00:00:38.879> really<00:00:39.000> matter<00:00:39.230> whether<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
doesn't really matter whether it's a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.740 
doesn't really matter whether it's a
regular<00:00:41.010> pencil<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> mechanical<00:00:42.149> pencil<00:00:42.360> it

doesn't<00:00:42.989> matter<00:00:43.110> at<00:00:43.260> all<00:00:43.440> as<00:00:44.190> long<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.789> you're

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
doesn't matter at all as long as you're

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.750 
doesn't matter at all as long as you're
comfortable<00:00:45.090> using<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.719> you'll<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.500> fine<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.920> I

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
comfortable using it you'll be fine as I

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.590 
comfortable using it you'll be fine as I
was<00:00:47.850> drawing<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> outlines

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
was drawing the outlines

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.090 
was drawing the outlines
I<00:00:48.690> also<00:00:48.840> marked<00:00:49.230> off<00:00:49.350> some<00:00:49.500> areas<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.950> I'd

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
I also marked off some areas that I'd

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.279 
I also marked off some areas that I'd
like<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.399> add<00:00:50.489> some<00:00:50.670> shading<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.289> it's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
like to add some shading to it's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.900 
like to add some shading to it's
important<00:00:52.770> at<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> beginning<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.550> figure<00:00:53.789> out

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
important at the beginning to figure out

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.420 
important at the beginning to figure out
where<00:00:54.090> your<00:00:54.210> light<00:00:54.390> sources<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.219> case

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
where your light sources so in this case

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.279 
where your light sources so in this case
I<00:00:56.610> had<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> Sun<00:00:57.149> beaming<00:00:57.629> from<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.109> right

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
I had the Sun beaming from the right

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.740 
I had the Sun beaming from the right
side<00:00:58.590> which<00:00:59.370> meant<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.670> all<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.180> left<00:01:00.390> edges

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
side which meant that all the left edges

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.070 
side which meant that all the left edges
of<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.530> mountain<00:01:01.890> would<00:01:02.100> need<00:01:02.550> some<00:01:02.760> shading

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
of the mountain would need some shading

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.119 
of the mountain would need some shading
once<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.199> figured<00:01:04.470> out<00:01:04.530> all<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> outlines

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
once you figured out all the outlines

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.560 
once you figured out all the outlines
for<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.460> drawing<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.119> start<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.450> add

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
for this drawing you can start to add

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.870 
for this drawing you can start to add
some<00:01:06.750> basic<00:01:07.020> shading<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.700> will

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
some basic shading and and this will

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.100 
some basic shading and and this will
start<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.240> give<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> really<00:01:09.689> good<00:01:09.780> idea<00:01:10.080> of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
start to give you a really good idea of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:35.100 
start to give you a really good idea of
how<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.439> drawing<00:01:11.010> will<00:01:11.130> end<00:01:11.310> up<00:01:11.460> looking

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.510 

at<00:01:36.110> this<00:01:36.289> stage<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.829> will<00:01:37.039> already<00:01:37.310> be

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
at this stage it will already be

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.050 
at this stage it will already be
starting<00:01:37.969> to<00:01:38.090> look<00:01:38.240> like<00:01:38.689> a<00:01:38.750> mountain<00:01:39.020> and

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
starting to look like a mountain and

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.010 
starting to look like a mountain and
depending<00:01:41.060> on<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.299> level<00:01:41.479> of<00:01:41.659> detail<00:01:41.990> that

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
depending on the level of detail that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.620 
depending on the level of detail that
you're<00:01:42.259> requiring<00:01:42.880> maybe<00:01:43.880> you'll<00:01:44.299> be<00:01:44.390> able<00:01:44.509> to

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
you're requiring maybe you'll be able to

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.539 
you're requiring maybe you'll be able to
leave<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:44.869> at<00:01:44.960> this<00:01:45.079> stage<00:01:45.229> but<00:01:46.219> if<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:46.429> want

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
leave it at this stage but if you want

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.010 
leave it at this stage but if you want
to<00:01:46.640> carry<00:01:46.759> on<00:01:46.939> adding<00:01:47.179> detail<00:01:47.509> that's<00:01:47.840> what<00:01:47.899> I

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
to carry on adding detail that's what I

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.660 
to carry on adding detail that's what I
did<00:01:48.170> in<00:01:48.289> this<00:01:48.439> drawing<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:49.009> so<00:01:49.399> you<00:01:49.490> got<00:01:49.610> to

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
did in this drawing and so you got to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.950 
did in this drawing and so you got to
think<00:01:49.850> about<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.179> kind<00:01:50.360> of<00:01:50.420> things<00:01:50.630> are<00:01:50.810> on<00:01:50.929> a

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
think about the kind of things are on a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.840 
think about the kind of things are on a
mountain<00:01:51.110> where<00:01:51.710> there's<00:01:52.039> going<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.310> be<00:01:52.399> extra

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
mountain where there's going to be extra

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.450 
mountain where there's going to be extra
ridges<00:01:53.240> they're<00:01:53.390> going<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:53.569> be<00:01:53.659> rocks<00:01:53.929> and<00:01:54.460> and

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
ridges they're going to be rocks and and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.520 
ridges they're going to be rocks and and
depending<00:01:55.729> on<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.270> height<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.200> mountain

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
depending on the height of the mountain

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.910 
depending on the height of the mountain
you<00:01:57.740> might<00:01:57.920> have<00:01:58.210> forests<00:01:59.210> and<00:01:59.360> trees<00:01:59.920> so

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
you might have forests and trees so

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.200 
you might have forests and trees so
start<00:02:01.219> adding<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.579> details<00:02:01.969> as<00:02:02.329> you<00:02:02.439> go<00:02:03.439> along

the shading and the highlights for a
sharp<00:02:11.510> rocky<00:02:11.989> formation<00:02:12.530> it's<00:02:12.829> a<00:02:12.920> good<00:02:13.040> idea

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
sharp rocky formation it's a good idea

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.400 
sharp rocky formation it's a good idea
to<00:02:13.400> have<00:02:13.549> a<00:02:13.730> sharp<00:02:14.120> contrast<00:02:14.390> between<00:02:14.870> your

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
to have a sharp contrast between your

shading<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.519> your<00:02:16.610> highlights<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.180> then<00:02:17.599> for

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
shading and your highlights and then for

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.170 
shading and your highlights and then for
curved<00:02:18.140> rock<00:02:18.620> formations<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.670> just<00:02:19.940> have<00:02:20.150> a

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
curved rock formations you just have a

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.270 
curved rock formations you just have a
smooth<00:02:20.840> transition<00:02:21.290> between<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.920> shading

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
smooth transition between the shading

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.370 
smooth transition between the shading
and<00:02:22.400> highlights<00:02:22.819> so<00:02:23.510> blending<00:02:23.900> between<00:02:24.230> these

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
and highlights so blending between these

and highlights so blending between these
two<00:02:24.590> shading<00:02:24.980> methods<00:02:25.370> could<00:02:25.610> really<00:02:25.849> help<00:02:26.030> to

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
two shading methods could really help to

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.940 
two shading methods could really help to
create<00:02:26.599> the<00:02:26.959> kind<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.260> texture<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.739> you<00:02:27.890> are

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
create the kind of texture that you are

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.800 
create the kind of texture that you are
looking<00:02:28.220> for<00:02:28.400> making<00:02:29.090> sure<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.360> leave<00:02:29.480> the

looking for making sure to leave the
right<00:02:30.319> sides<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.220> mountain<00:02:31.640> completely

white<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:33.019> a<00:02:33.230> really<00:02:33.530> effective<00:02:34.040> way<00:02:34.220> of

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
white is a really effective way of

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.400 
white is a really effective way of
making<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.060> mountain<00:02:35.660> look<00:02:35.840> like<00:02:36.019> it's<00:02:36.170> being

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
making the mountain look like it's being

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.890 
making the mountain look like it's being
hit<00:02:36.739> by<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:36.950> sunlight<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.610> that<00:02:37.900> really

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
hit by the sunlight and that really

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.300 
hit by the sunlight and that really
helps<00:02:39.079> to<00:02:39.139> make<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.560> drawing<00:02:39.920> as<00:02:40.069> a<00:02:40.100> whole

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
helps to make the drawing as a whole

00:02:40.310 --> 00:03:05.380 
helps to make the drawing as a whole
look<00:02:40.579> a<00:02:40.760> lot<00:02:41.060> more<00:02:41.180> 3d

continue<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.510> refine<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.930> details<00:03:07.230> as<00:03:07.440> much

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
continue to refine the details as much

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.380 
continue to refine the details as much
as<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:07.830> want<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.250> if<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.820> want<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.060> add<00:03:09.180> some

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
clouds or some mist you can do that and

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.590 
clouds or some mist you can do that and
it<00:03:11.550> will<00:03:11.640> add<00:03:11.730> really<00:03:11.970> nice<00:03:12.060> effects<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.510> the
