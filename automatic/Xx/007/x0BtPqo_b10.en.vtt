00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.970
 how to create folders how to organize 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.589
 your folders 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.329
 It is extremely important for you to understand the concept of deliveries 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.450
 pastes 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.340
 Let's go 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.510
 in terms of documents in order each in its place 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.540
 we can differentiate 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.620
 music 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.790
 videos 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.190
 leaving everything easy 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.010
 that you find without any difficulty 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.309
 so we're going back 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.220
 lunch 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.870
 windows explorer has already been cremated 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.870
 two last classes we will not 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.780
 we are opening our foreheads 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.320
 first location 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.160
 senate 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.920
 - less than a month but what I said was that she did not miss it 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.100
 small life expectancy 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.580
 - here are documents pictures and music 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.250
 and also in 2011 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.250
 here on the right 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.660
 because 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.399
 last year we commented 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.480
 philippines - no 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.009
 let's collect documents 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.600
 let's open documents 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.690
 so we can be for sale 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.330
 the icon downloaded two children 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.620
 so I think it's a little faster 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.160
 in your place 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.780
 so let's suppose I want to put 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.980
 I commend the documents 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.910
 the exposure of photos that are 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.390
 goalkeeper computer awning a photo but huh 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.240
 important help for a good job at school or 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.390
 Anything else you wanna do 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.620
 besides not having summoned the images or videos click here 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.940
 everything rocking buildings meet 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.940
 stay in the hand to do let's create a folder 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.489
 And how do you create this track here? 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.489
 it's very overhead steps 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.269
 this year the new folder 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.329
 just click on it winner 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.439
 that the trucker 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.729
 automatically appeared here or there 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:25.279
 new folder 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.170
 He already appears with the world. 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.319
 taxed 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.719
 ribbons and blue 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.159
 and it means what? 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.139
 It's just you 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.199
 digital you'll want a good one from that folder 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.599
 so assuming that 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.259
 which is a folder to put 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:42.760
 It was a good time game. 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.249
 Photos 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:45.679
 enter the name 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:46.540
 and now 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.540
 only a squeeze to the 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.309
 see the photos below 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:54.529
 it was preceded by the publishing port 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:56.369
 spread the subject up 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:58.599
 This is because he is organizing 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.909
 in alphabetical order but does not change anything 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.669
 with this simplistic form 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:05.559
 we created very low 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:07.900
 with two clicks the crisis can not be 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.619
 the stage is so little you can be jealous 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:12.779
 of the exact icon of each folder 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.880
 I do not take the risk of staying here and clicking the world 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.039
 already wanting to change 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:19.709
 from the 30th 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.309
 in the blood depletion paste 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:24.819
 such passionate action 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.809
 and when I know that this age group 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.179
 because of that the ceremony 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:32.249
 it is written that her name 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:34.640
 all the way i'm here in the life sector 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.699
 and the sugar cane 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.479
 after documents 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.329
 and open in my folder takes the photo 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.299
 to the appearance of teaching 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.649
 it's written you know what it is that you're using 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:47.429
 on account of this from here 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:48.449
 you 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:49.639
 to april 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:50.949
 he appears in the sixth 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.379
 higher education would return documents 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.700
 it is quite simple the end of the worst documents heating 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.249
 he came back all - as one notices 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:03.099
 I can be here on my part. 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.099
 I'm opening again with the pc was arrested in a prison 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.509
 or double-click 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:11.359
 then the presidency 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.799
 so I can copy and paste 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.379
 here inside the folder 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.569
 what I need 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:20.069
 that way it gets organized 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:23.279
 We hope it will not be that documents 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.189
 all this we all wanted to win 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:27.249
 spread 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:30.389
 this could organize the web that presented a document that 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.080
 have what I'm going to do 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.430
 let's suppose I have is that the three or four comedians 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.889
 I'll create a folder that he 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.159
 I'm going back to the new pool 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.180
 I'm going to do it 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.150
 deaths 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.319
 I was disappointed in documents 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.169
 appeared we belong 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.189
 on account 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.620
 it organizes conformities in alphabetical order 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.520
 and how to put it then 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.729
 this document 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.479
 within this range 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.219
 accompany 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:05.089
 promise to put the mouse of the human being 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:07.809
 in this sense he 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:11.080
 will criticize who to hold I was held 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.480
 and now how to drag it years ago was much better stated 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.590
 who does not take does not have a victory of conquest 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.969
 if life were the document 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.349
 if I put in the pastor adolfo but was mediated by winning is good 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.030
 like it was not enough I can not talk about it 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.699
 You noticed that all of this is from here under the bridge. 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.360
 and now I'll open the purse and documents two lawsuits 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.409
 the goalkeeper 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.569
 what babies 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.909
 so let's suppose you have that 5 6 of the trade does not have to be with 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.879
 they all spread out here 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.919
 if you create a folder 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.249
 exhorts all documents into this range 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:55.249
 facilitates you can not have for example a folder with documents 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.020
 in the house on the street 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.949
 because you buy 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.450
 if the lists 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.290
 accounts 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.990
 if you can a part back called the proposal 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.330
 for 1 to 0 bridge 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.979
 a job working at college 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.710
 works even easier 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.779
 another way to create a folder 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:17.589
 staring using evil yes 

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:18.740
 so how to do 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.580
 in the peaceful space that was here 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.270
 I'm going to right click with the right button 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.270
 will open the window that you will see 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.289
 click below 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.529
 there are many called 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:37.609
 When I stop, teach us girl, then I have to pinch myself. 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:41.389
 so I believe that this marking 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.089
 see you next week 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:44.889
 wrapping up 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:46.569
 have to look 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:47.770
 I will not stay 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.629
 automatically appeared to have wagered 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:53.629
 here is again a game in morumbi 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:59.360
 It was also agreed that it will organize itself according to the need 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.770
 we do not hear here how we can create a document folder 

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:06.309
 I'll stop here. 

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:10.219
 because we're going to do another track in the next hour 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:13.830
 even in the work area if we could organize very legal 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.229
 so do not miss the next to the lake of love an explanation about the fact 

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.710
 about the supposed 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.300
 why you can organize it well 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.949
 your window tasks 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:25.689
 embrace already close to total
