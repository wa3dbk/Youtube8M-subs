00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hey people and welcome to my credit 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.660
 Today I show you how you are 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:15.509
 easy and fast a vintage look for 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:17.250
 can create video after the video 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.960
 portraits with natural light of 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.670
 benjamin jaworski have me many 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.800
 asked how do you have this look 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.439
 Did you get any filter 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.820
 used what exactly did and exactly 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.769
 I'll show you this today 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.420
 I'll show you a way how to 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.579
 can create a vintage look and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.719
 Although with the double premiere the look 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.280
 But you can also do it with each other 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.750
 create a program with the man 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.100
 make color corrections 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.809
 the principle is always that 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 same one pulls the deep so the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.079
 he sounds darker in the blue and the heights 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.879
 So the lighter tones in the yellow that goes 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.370
 at the premiere, for example, super 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.160
 easy and fast with the rgb curves 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.090
 that's what we go into for the effects 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.160
 video effects color correction scroll 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.379
 down a bit and we can already see that 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.359
 rgb curves then we pull ourselves up 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.220
 the clip in the window for the effect 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.390
 attitudes then we go to the rgb 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.060
 Curves then go to the blue curve and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.020
 pull this to about a quarter here 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.710
 down and a quarter down here 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.830
 That's why a quarter was 1234 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.840
 So that's about a quarter of that but you can 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.390
 also vary depending on the picture 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.220
 So you can not universal this 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.659
 Look like every attitude 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.130
 You always have to use that 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:38.490
 adjust a bit again 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.040
 Remove yellow here or add blue 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.530
 maybe give or take away 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.430
 you can do it a bit 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.030
 Stronger and closer together 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.610
 pull 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.149
 that's all I do it 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.310
 mostly always in this frame here 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.140
 Now the look is basically taken 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.000
 more or less finished you can 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.100
 now a little bit for example 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.200
 reduce or add contrasts 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.429
 by turning the alpha curve or the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.440
 master curve here in such a form 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.000
 brings with it the contrast 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.500
 enlarged and that could also be here 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.960
 your creativity 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.700
 it would be a run for example 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.460
 the richness of the s 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.550
 turn pretty strong he is a bit 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.940
 Flau likes to let it down a bit 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:32.610
 just here again shortly before 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.890
 compare before after afterwards before 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.900
 beautiful and fitting, above all, is the look 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.640
 in pictures that have a lot of sun like 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.680
 here, for example, with gegenlicht 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.180
 So filmed in the sun I think so 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.709
 just looks great 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.330
 I can give you the look again 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.920
 another video to show who one 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.290
 my last videos have seen 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.910
 export theme for youtube knows 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.310
 maybe the cutout of her one 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.280
 I played a concert 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.560
 I also give it again the rgb 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.390
 curves go up the effect 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:09.150
 Settings here in yellow pull here 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:17.340
 again in the blue enlarge a bit 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:19.530
 the contrast so now even the 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.060
 picture a bit too money because of that 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.980
 I go here a bit with the 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.530
 get out money and give it one more 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.540
 bit blue a bit better 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.870
 Looks like it already and how 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.959
 horny or what do you say 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.420
 before after before, yes already 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.340
 something I was not as good 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.810
 comes as with such summery 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.299
 to take pictures of the sun 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.340
 if I saw her once we went 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.040
 It's super easy and fast easy 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.250
 those rgb curves the blue curve at the 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.829
 to draw highs in the yellow and in the 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.690
 draw deep into the blue and more or 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.579
 less what it already then you can always 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.950
 still vary a bit in the 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.530
 master curve again the contrast 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.239
 increase or decrease 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.190
 according to your taste if that's you 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.049
 liked the video and helped 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.390
 give a thumbs up 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.549
 subscribed to the channel shared the video 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.239
 all your friends and see you 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.239
 next time 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.000
