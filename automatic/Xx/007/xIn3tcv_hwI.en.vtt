00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.309
 in particular in russia put on the brink 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.519
 survival 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.750
 this is not due to objective reasons 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.299
 how to develop the Internet or something else 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.970
 It is a no nonsense given vennosti 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.730
 officials important but not the only 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.930
 the problem is subscription everyone knows what 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.990
 Russia post there is such a service as 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.109
 subscription including delivery 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.599
 subscriptions to the mailbox on 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.430
 most of the country no one 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.059
 besides Russia mail this service is not 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.320
 renders and since 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.420
 most Russian populated 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.070
 No kiosk items subscription there 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.510
 only alternative channel 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.629
 getting information except from 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.020
 TV this service is considered fast 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.700
 and very and social that is why up 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.800
 last time and and subsidized 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.079
 states how to do everything adequate 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.840
 state in the world is true much more 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.600
 The moment our government allocated mail 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.660
 Russia 3 billion rubles a year 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.150
 in compensation for damages 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.070
 from subscription to subscription delivery 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.600
 editions of these three billions once 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.170
 enough to cover subscription damages 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.750
 all the time lately these subsidies 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.450
 accounted for about half half of 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.619
 costs the less allowed to keep prices 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.750
 at the level of 2008 so essentially this 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.610
 not subsidies mail Russia and benefits 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.159
 readers what is happening now in the fall 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.320
 2013 Minister of Finance Anton 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.650
 the Siluans stated that the budget hole and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:46.740
 it is necessary to abandon every kind 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:49.320
 subsidies to anyone this statement 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.579
 slanova coincided with a scandal related 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.770
 with the post of Russia with the change of leadership 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.530
 Russian mail from the desire of the government 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.729
 make Russian post competitive 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.140
 market enterprises and really 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.000
 it's time to do it but not in 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:09.509
 overnight the government apparently didn't 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.020
 cut in the importance of subscription and one 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.620
 a cut off subsidies 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.840
 in full what it led to 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.120
 First, Korostovo led to a sharp 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.530
 rising subscription prices and secondly to 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.100
 I will break the subscription campaign I will explain 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.880
 more 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.420
 with regard to price increases the price of the signed 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.450
 there is an amount you pay for 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.630
 at the post office for a newspaper or magazine when 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.250
 subscribe to them signed price 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.940
 consists of two parts the first part is 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.050
 Israeli price of a new newspaper on 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.330
 the premiere she is roughly rounding 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.740
 thousand rubles for beneficiaries and 1200 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.560
 rubles for rascals and we do not have this price 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.980
 raise 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.170
 the second part is the price of delivery 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.430
 which is calculated by the tariff in 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.440
 depending on the weight of one instance 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.290
 if earlier a case with a new newspaper she 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.810
 was about 500 rubles now he 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.380
 costs about 900 rubles almost 2 times 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.760
 more 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.760
 what consequence of price increase 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.130
 reduced the number of subscribers 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.459
 reduced circulation quit 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:28.480
 journalists printers and freight forwarders 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.160
 distributors sellers from several 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.840
 hundreds of thousands to a million people 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.100
 different estimates 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:39.520
 but it seems to me more terrible 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:43.270
 consequences this is informational isolation 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.400
 my spit of fatherland it's time to ask 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.160
 Putin's troops to enter the government for 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.610
 infringement of the interests of millions of Russian 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.090
 citizens with regards to the river subscription 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.590
 campaigns 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.060
 private company must be silent with 1 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:01.300
 April in fact she did not rush languages with 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.600
 November 13, when publishers 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.060
 distributors learned that 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.840
 no subsidies november november january 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.070
 February March 5 months not Russian post 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.050
 not the ministry of communications 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.600
 not governments as a whole could not clearly 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.040
 answer what be reforms to 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.690
 subscription campaign started during 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.900
 signed tariffs should have been 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.639
 are announced 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.970
 until the end of January they were volume in 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:29.240
 mid-march so now postage 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.240
 Offices signed directory are 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.080
 or the so -called 100 graph of komi 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.910
 there is no price for delivery and 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.979
 ask to see the operator in 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.889
 electronic catalog or technologists not 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.630
 in general, as I was convinced myself when I came 1 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.389
 April to his department who is in this 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.490
 situation loses in the first slot 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:53.560
 reader devotees read or which 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.850
 lose money later 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.990
 newspapers that lose newspapers magazines 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.010
 who lose 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.220
 readers and circulations it is doubtful that 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.889
 gains from higher prices mail Russia 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.320
 because the price increase is due to 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.289
 reducing the number of people 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.820
 using this service wins as 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:18.470
 always government which 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.810
 redirect 3 negligible for budget 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.270
 for the annual budget of Russia 3 billion 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.770
 rubles some other needs, god forbid that 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:30.080
 these were useless second 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.449
 the problem is with the stalls 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.539
 mask with is associated with urban attempts 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:39.470
 authorities bring our city ​​Volga view 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:41.570
 and replace the old kiosks and poke it 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.430
 for hit on new multifunction 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.060
 what was there and 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:50.060
 . distribution of wireless internet and 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.409
 vending machine and even in the world I 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.020
 look for such a policy of the word bad not 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:56.810
 I will say but the fact is that the old kiosk 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.470
 new workers continue to disappear 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:03.580
 their one-two and miscalculated 3 problems associated with 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.150
 newspaper machines in the subway 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.800
 subway 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:12.919
 doubled the cost of renting places under 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.220
 news machines so the owner of these 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.960
 apparatuses about news machines in their 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.539
 the queue was also forced to increase 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.099
 the cost of renting a cell in these machines 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:25.120
 now the cost of renting a single cell 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:28.090
 makes three thousand 400 rubles but 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.550
 new newspaper for example such cells 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:36.170
 130-140 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:38.870
 therefore, it is far from profitable for us to rent 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:42.860
 cells at this price we stay in 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:44.180
 subway but not the fact that we will be there through 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.090
 several months and not alone we 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.700
 wondered whether to continue 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.740
 hand over a newspaper this 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.680
 attack on print media from all 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:58.370
 parties takes place simultaneously in this 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:02.600
 the biggest problem is Verona 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:05.240
 talking about increasing subscription 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.890
 the cost of renting cells in automats is 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.620
 generally just happened in one day 1 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:12.460
 April but unfortunately it is far from 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.460
 April Fools rally
