00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.740
 welcome to bosh on our 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.890
 virtual pilot area 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.059
 ways we show how important sb is 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.440
 emergency situations on the road 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.379
 sp this is an electronic system 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.150
 dynamic stabilization of the car she 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.300
 actively supports you during 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.100
 critical maneuvers if the car 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.099
 skid or driver loses 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.439
 control instantly turn on sp 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.439
 securely hold the road 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.790
 let's consider 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:45.129
 property yusb in practice cause 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.930
 drift 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:52.690
 why the car loses stability and 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:56.620
 gets a skid modeling 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.970
 experimental way often since childhood 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.839
 car while driving affect 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.360
 different forces 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.149
 axial force when braking acceleration 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.850
 as well as lateral forces arising 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.850
 when cornering or when leaving maneuvers 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.200
 tires as the only point of contact 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.910
 a car with a roadway must 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.910
 transfer these forces to the road 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.110
 if the tire is affected by forces more 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.660
 those that are about us 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.170
 she loses grip car enters 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.170
 zanussi 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.659
 also external factors such as humidity 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.580
 or dirt can significantly reduce 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.460
 tire grip thus increasing 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.310
 dangerous engaged 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.440
 How does the electronic system work? 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.570
 dynamic stabilization car esp 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.250
 and recognize the beginning of a drift and 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.380
 prevents the possibility of it 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.990
 occurrence for this it interferes 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.509
 in the work of the brakes and if necessary in 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.450
 engine operation is and includes 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.330
 following components 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.289
 speed sensor on each wheel 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.300
 angle sensor 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.480
 rotation measuring car around 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.510
 its axis and 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.690
 steering angle sensor 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.430
 registering the intentions of the driver 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.500
 control device calculates by 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.500
 sensor signals when you need to intervene 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.220
 hydraulic unit raising and 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.069
 wheel brake pressure reducer 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.520
 mechanisms 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.180
 but 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.120
 but 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.480
 simulation experimental often 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:45.989
 the way of e s t 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.989
 analysis of what happens during the first maneuver 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.939
 the driver must quickly deviate to the left 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.069
 steering wheel sensor transmits 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:58.250
 This control unit sp. 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.049
 but the rotation angle sensor signals 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.510
 that the car turns 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.000
 not enough and that means he 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.400
 moving straight on the obstacle for a share 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.590
 seconds there is n dramatically slows down the rotation 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.079
 left rear wheel for a short period 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.359
 time it produces the desired 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.760
 opposition so the driver 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.230
 does not lose control 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.389
 what happens when the steering wheel rotates 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.129
 the opposite side of the drift when 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.680
 steering rotation in the opposite direction 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.900
 skidding to keep the car after 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.819
 maneuver on the left lane he can 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.579
 turn over and back 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.459
 the bodywork will go by the nose left twisting 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.799
 the moment to the right is stronger than desired 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.569
 the driver in this case sp slows down 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.629
 left front wheel rotation 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.730
 torque slows down instead of 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:47.680
 to get into a skid thanks to eat n 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.680
 the car remains manageable 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.540
 example of driving along a rural street in 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.360
 everyday life it happens more often 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.730
 than you think you unexpectedly fall into 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:09.280
 a situation that requires quick 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:11.310
 maneuvering consider the situation

 limited review who did not allow

 have a car approaching 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.900
 only a quick maneuver could warn 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.970
 collision 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.900
 due to a sharp turn the car got 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:48.620
