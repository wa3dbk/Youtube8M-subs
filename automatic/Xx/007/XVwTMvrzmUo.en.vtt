it's too clinky sounding you back off
towards<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.880> bridge<00:03:06.240> if<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:06.900> too<00:03:07.110> open

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
towards the bridge if it's too open

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.120 
towards the bridge if it's too open
string<00:03:08.490> sounding<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.980> there's<00:03:10.980> not

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
string sounding like this there's not

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.400 
string sounding like this there's not
enough<00:03:11.190> crunch<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:12.360> need<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.630> choke<00:03:12.960> up<00:03:13.170> on<00:03:13.350> it

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
enough crunch you need to choke up on it

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.690 
enough crunch you need to choke up on it
and<00:03:13.740> go<00:03:13.920> for<00:03:14.190> it's<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.430> neck<00:03:15.140> okay<00:03:16.140> good<00:03:17.130> now

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
and go for it's the neck okay good now

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.780 
and go for it's the neck okay good now
that's<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.750> low<00:03:19.020> string<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:20.100> lower<00:03:20.310> strings

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
that's the low string the lower strings

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.520 
that's the low string the lower strings
are<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.150> little<00:03:21.360> bit<00:03:21.600> more<00:03:21.780> forgiving<00:03:22.350> because

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
are a little bit more forgiving because

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.270 
are a little bit more forgiving because
they're<00:03:22.830> bigger<00:03:23.100> fatter<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.850> vibrate<00:03:24.390> better

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
they're bigger fatter and vibrate better

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.680 
they're bigger fatter and vibrate better
so<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.610> may<00:03:26.940> be<00:03:27.000> able<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.300> get<00:03:27.450> away<00:03:27.570> with

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
so you may be able to get away with

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.510 
so you may be able to get away with
getting<00:03:27.990> a<00:03:28.110> decent<00:03:28.290> crunch<00:03:28.650> sound<00:03:28.890> out<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.220> law

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
getting a decent crunch sound out of law

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.000 
getting a decent crunch sound out of law
restricts<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.300> thinner<00:03:30.630> strings<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.800> higher

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
restricts the thinner strings the higher

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.370 
restricts the thinner strings the higher
strings<00:03:32.400> I'm<00:03:32.700> actually<00:03:33.240> saying<00:03:33.540> higher<00:03:33.840> as<00:03:34.140> I

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
strings I'm actually saying higher as I

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.010 
strings I'm actually saying higher as I
point<00:03:34.680> down<00:03:35.010> these<00:03:35.850> thinner<00:03:36.240> strings<00:03:36.660> are

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
point down these thinner strings are

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.740 
point down these thinner strings are
less<00:03:37.530> forgiving<00:03:38.130> so<00:03:38.640> you're<00:03:39.150> really<00:03:39.390> going<00:03:39.660> to

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
less forgiving so you're really going to

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.080 
less forgiving so you're really going to
have<00:03:39.930> them<00:03:40.170> play<00:03:40.950> with<00:03:41.130> those<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.640> get<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.820> good

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
have them play with those to get a good

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.510 
have them play with those to get a good
mute<00:03:42.720> sound<00:03:43.050> and<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.770> course<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.340> more

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
mute sound and of course that is more

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.190 
mute sound and of course that is more
advanced<00:03:44.880> metal<00:03:45.240> that's<00:03:45.420> more<00:03:45.600> like<00:03:45.750> negative

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
advanced metal that's more like negative

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.900 
advanced metal that's more like negative
so<00:03:46.440> now<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.980> thinner<00:03:47.220> strings<00:03:47.520> are<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.760> little

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
so now the thinner strings are a little

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.220 
so now the thinner strings are a little
harder<00:03:48.300> to<00:03:48.330> pop<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:51.270> lower<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.870> lower

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
harder to pop you the lower the lower

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.070 
harder to pop you the lower the lower
thicker<00:03:52.830> strings<00:03:53.250> are<00:03:53.570> more<00:03:54.570> forgiving

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
thicker strings are more forgiving

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.140 
thicker strings are more forgiving
they're<00:03:55.410> fatter<00:03:55.860> they're<00:03:56.610> thicker<00:03:56.910> they

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
they're fatter they're thicker they

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.600 
they're fatter they're thicker they
vibrate<00:03:57.750> more<00:03:58.020> so<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.709> can<00:03:59.010> actually<00:03:59.040> press

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
vibrate more so you can actually press

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.070 
vibrate more so you can actually press
harder<00:04:00.060> on<00:04:00.209> them<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:00.420> do<00:04:00.570> what<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.900> will

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
harder on them and do what you will

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.690 
harder on them and do what you will
they'll<00:04:01.380> still<00:04:01.620> come<00:04:01.800> on<00:04:01.980> crunch<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.459> warm

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
they'll still come on crunch and warm

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.050 
they'll still come on crunch and warm
but<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:04.050> thinner<00:04:04.320> strings<00:04:04.680> are<00:04:05.040> ones<00:04:05.880> you

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
but the thinner strings are ones you

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.530 
but the thinner strings are ones you
have<00:04:06.270> to<00:04:07.160> really<00:04:08.160> kind<00:04:08.490> of<00:04:08.610> be<00:04:08.880> more<00:04:08.910> sensitive

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
have to really kind of be more sensitive

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.240 
have to really kind of be more sensitive
with<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:10.080> have<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.380> kind<00:04:10.590> of<00:04:10.709> touch<00:04:10.920> them<00:04:11.160> a

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
with you have to kind of touch them a

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.920 
with you have to kind of touch them a
little<00:04:11.280> lighter<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:12.390> have<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:12.750> work<00:04:12.900> with

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
little lighter and you have to work with

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.010 
little lighter and you have to work with
them<00:04:13.380> more<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.730> kind<00:04:14.940> of<00:04:14.970> like<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.120> woman<00:04:15.480> you

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
them more the kind of like a woman you

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.680 
them more the kind of like a woman you
