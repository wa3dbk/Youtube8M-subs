 new video and good this time is 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.190
 another option more than what is installous 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.080
 as we already know that application closed already 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.730
 Many of us know that but right now 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.050
 we are bringing new options for 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.210
 that you can download all your 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.610
 Free apps at this time 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.340
 I bring a totally new application 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.680
 free call earthquakes good this 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.720
 application allows us to download 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.550
 many games many apps 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.280
 totally free for what they are 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.350
 our ios 6 devices also 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.600
 it works I think that at ios5 point I do not know 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.730
 that this application is updated and 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.260
 We can find it by means of a 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.690
 network because right now we're going to show you how 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.820
 install it we will not go into earthquakes and 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.649
 let's show how it works good already 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.390
 we give you click as we can realize 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.130
 the only flaw it has is that it does not 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.290
 we can lay down what is this the 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.729
 device and good as we can 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.539
 see in the bottom part we have the 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.470
 home search options download or 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.140
 downloads 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.820
 we also have to download later and 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.899
 the adjustments the only thing we have to 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.990
 do to look for an application is 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.459
 go to the search icon and 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.959
 automatically write then a 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:33.640
 application that we want as 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:36.720
 for example I have already sent the video 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.720
 of plants verses zombies 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.090
 and good will automatically give a 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.530
 search and how we can realize 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.390
 there is the application the only thing 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.190
 we have to do is touch it and in the 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.530
 part of above we will leave a button 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.660
 green in this part we do not pay attention to 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.820
 let's take the green and then we will give 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.710
 download and how we can find out is 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.930
 the same interface as it was with 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.280
 installous that is very similar and 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.770
 we can download all the applications 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.330
 totally free or apps or whatever 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.340
 we want from the app store and well 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.020
 so this application will work with what 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.270
 which is our device is very 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.220
 simple to use and is very similar to 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.800
 urge we are going to see how we can 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.270
 install on our devices 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.410
 ok well we left what is the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.470
 application the only thing that we have to 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.640
 to do is to go to Syria we wait 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.640
 to load cydia 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.610
 and well, once you have finished 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.680
 to load the only thing we have to do 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.220
 is to add a repository we are going to go 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.130
 to sources edit add and we must 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.960
 add the iphones repository that 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.760
 that will be appearing in this part 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.050
 of the video also work in the 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.300
 description of the video so that what 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.220
 you can find totally free and a 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.960
 Once added we must add source and 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.660
 ready in the part of her I already have it 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.190
 so I'm going to cancel and we're going to give 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.450
 ready here the only thing we have to 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.460
 do now is to go to the part of 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.460
 search and write earthquakes 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.500
 how can we realize and we 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.720
 will be indicating that it is 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.090
 there will be the repo since until the 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.320
 package that we have to install 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.780
 it automatically tells us that it's for ios 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.160
 5 and for ios 6 only that we have 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.110
 to give here in the top part that 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.510
 is to install to me and I seem to modify 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.510
 because I already have it but good people that 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.640
 it's the only way we can add 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.650
 we this application I recommend you a lot 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.390
 iphone repository yacht as 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.160
 It is the one that works the most until 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.660
 moment with what is cydia 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.000
 only the only defect as 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.470
 This can be seen is not 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.120
 we can tilt our device 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.100
 while we are in the inside of the 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.260
 dexeus mos application 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.120
 neither can we know if the 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.010
 applications for ipad for iphone or 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.780
 for ipod touch most of the 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.100
 Applications are cited for the 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.010
 downloads will appear on screen 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.240
 tiny and you will have to apply the double 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.140
 so that it expands into what is the 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.330
 screen of your ipad 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.010
 then I recommend good is a good 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.710
 option if you download them fast enough 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.330
 because it's from external servers and but 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.950
 that is the only defect will not know if it is 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.080
 for your ipad for your iphone or for your 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.610
 ipod touch I recommend it a lot and 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.690
 I also recommend that you watch my video 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.150

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.940
