00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.400
 Welcome to the "League of Legends" feature report 

00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:13.200
 Introduce you 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.858
 Leona is a full-time tank that is good at crashing the front line and absorbing damage. 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.000
 Excellent ability to act so she can quickly support the defeat of the target 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.336
 Dawn Shield gives Leona the next attack and deals additional damage and stuns the target 

00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:35.000
 This skill can reset the CD time, so the best time to use after the attack is completed. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.368
 Eclipse can temporarily strengthen Leona's physical and magic defense 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.089
 Inflicts damage to all nearby enemies after a few seconds 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.600
 Successful damage to the enemy can double the shield time 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.372
 The Sun Sword is a directional skill that deals damage to all enemies on the path. 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.500
 Leona will flash to the enemy behind the last injury 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.121
 Leona’s big name is called the sun wheel 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.850
 The sun wheel slammed in the target area after the suspension 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.000
 Enemies near the center of the enemy within the range of damage and slowdown will be dizzy 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.200
 Leona’s passive skills are the power of the sun. 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.300
 All Leona skills will mark enemy units 

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:18.000
 Our hero will unmark and cause additional damage when attacking. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.059
 First, actively weaken the opponent's blood volume 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.000
 Teammate Magic Gana casts a shadow ban, I will crush the enemy 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.832
 Please pay attention to the skill casting order 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.223
 I enabled the solar eclipse 3 seconds earlier. 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.000
 I used the Xiaoxiao shield to hit Maokai and waited for Magic Ganna to touch the power of Liyang. 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.000
 I immediately waved the Sun Sword and cooperated with the solar eclipse to complete the first kill of our road. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.700
 We are playing against the road 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.500
 I used the dawn shield to block Akali. 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.900
 After the solar eclipse was activated, I found that Magic Gana cast a shadow imprisonment and painful corrosion. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.984
 Considering that her blood is too low, I will stay after the eclipse 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.750
 Found Vladimir struck to retreat immediately 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.000
 I used the sun sword to point to Vladimir and flash back to our tower. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Vladimir, a pool of bleeding red, I will stay away from him to avoid being beaten by the tide of blood. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.700
 I continue to fly back and forth 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.000
 Mao Kai insulted and wanted to kill me under the tower. I used the dawn shield to stun him and he won three kills. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.346
 River battle 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.000
 I used the trick to superimpose the power of the strong sun on Mao Kai, and then use the eclipse to re-use the solar eclipse. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.800
 When the battle took place, I saw Mao Kai blood thin. 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.300
 I blew his half of the blood in order to be the sun wheel, the sun sword, and finally the dawn shield. 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.450
 Then I saw Akali no blood. 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.500
 I broke into her twilight protection, enabled the eclipse to result in her escape on her way. 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.591
 Seeing teammate Anne low blood, I flashed into the enemy 

00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:40.550
 After Xiao Xiaodun stunned Amme, I immediately turned back to defend Vladimir. 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.000
 I should continue to attack Amm. He flashed the sun and escaped. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 I found that I couldn’t catch up with Amme and immediately turned back to the solar eclipse to get rid of Vladimir. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.753
 I am on the road against Vladimir when Izelel gank from behind me 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.500
 I calmly hide in the grass and pull out the sun sword. 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.000
 In the sprint, I waved the dawn shield 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.000
 I was dizzy and fled the front when I flashed behind Izrel. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Annie caught the opponent, I used the sun sword to point to Vladimir, but he hid in the pool of blood red and escaped. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 As soon as he retreats, I am chasing after 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.000
 I first started the dawn shield and hit the sun sword. When I finished, I killed Vladimir under the tower. 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.000
 I immediately went back to participate in the battle, and stunned Mao Kai to thank the extra force of the power of Liyang. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.350
 The sun wheel of St. Mang combines the halo effect of you or your teammates. 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.400
 Anne flashed to pursue Iser Real, making her life and death 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.000
 I then threw out the sun wheel and made him have no chance to escape from death. 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.033
 After the middle road battle, we caught Maokai who was single. 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.000
 After killing him, we turned back and chased the filthy pillar of Akali Lande to delay her departure. 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.119
 Please pay attention to my position: I saw Trund walking in front 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.000
 Jiawen then went to the upper left, behind the temple of Megana. 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.500
 So I went to the right hand side of Akali's light protection. 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.500
 Sure enough, I caught her and she wanted to escape from the dawn of the shield, and we set fire to kill her. 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.791
 We have a battle in the middle 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.915
 I left the front to pursue the most important goal: Vladimir 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.502
 I was going to use the sun wheel St. Mang and later buckled and killed him with the dawn shield. 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.000
 Then immediately chase Mao Kai with props Frost Hammer and Dawn Shield to easily kill 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.641
 We are advancing enemy positions. I want to pursue Amm again with the sun wheel. 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.301
 But I noticed that my teammates didn't keep up, I turned to support Annie. 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.001
 It’s a pity that when the sun was strolling in Akali, Anne was already dead. 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.126
 I walked into Akali's Twilight Protection to cast the eclipse and prepared the Sun Sword to serve her. 

00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:36.501
 She rushed to Magic Gana, my sun sacred sword flashed Amm and then smashed Akali with a dawn shield 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.851
 Then I used the Sun Sword and the Dawn Shield to nail the Yzerel. 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.988
 Then I continued to use the Frost Hammer to attack Adam. 

00:04:50.002 --> 00:04:51.502
 He can't escape without flashing 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.500
 When Trund and I catch up, they kill him with the dawn shield and the sun sword. 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.000
 My runes are pure tanks 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.001
 The mark is magically resistant, and the glyph of the coat of arms is also magic resistance, and the essence increases the health. 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.500
 My talent goes 0/21/9 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.800
 Remember to point out the agility of the defense department with the dodge coat 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.200
 And point out the universal greedy and convenient stacking 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.630
 I will first click on the dawn shield to shorten the CD time of the halo. 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.020
 Then eclipse to improve survival rate 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.500
 Sun Swords to level 2 helps early battle 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.600
 In terms of props, I bought the reborn pendant and the life potion to combine the stone of the sage and buy the boots of Mercury. 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.501
 I found that the Legion's shield is worth buying the support team. 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.578
 Then I used Frost Hammer and Sunfire Cloak to improve damage and group control. 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.500
 In the later period, the rumor of Surya’s Rhapsody Langton or the force of nature will look at the enemy combination. 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.744
 Thank you for watching the presentation of Leona. 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.000
