underrated in order to target your

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.089 
underrated in order to target your
triceps<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:07.919> that<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:09.210> incline<00:00:10.099> close

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099

grip<00:00:11.460> bench<00:00:11.750> press<00:00:13.040> why<00:00:14.040> am<00:00:14.190> i<00:00:14.250> recommending

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
grip bench press why am i recommending

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.150 
grip bench press why am i recommending
this<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.210> why<00:00:15.299> not<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:15.630> do<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> regular<00:00:16.199> close

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
this and why not just do a regular close

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.400 
this and why not just do a regular close
grip<00:00:17.369> bench<00:00:17.430> press<00:00:17.699> on<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> flat<00:00:18.420> surface<00:00:19.020> it's

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
grip bench press on a flat surface it's

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.070 
grip bench press on a flat surface it's
simple<00:00:20.070> for<00:00:20.520> many<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.880> us<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.359> have<00:00:21.660> quite<00:00:22.050> a

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
simple for many of us that have quite a

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.950 
simple for many of us that have quite a
developed<00:00:22.500> chest<00:00:22.830> even<00:00:23.580> on<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> flat<00:00:24.539> bench

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
developed chest even on a flat bench

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.570 
developed chest even on a flat bench
press<00:00:25.140> doing<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.769> close<00:00:26.039> grip<00:00:26.220> bench<00:00:26.279> press

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
press doing a close grip bench press

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.179 
press doing a close grip bench press
will<00:00:27.269> not<00:00:27.480> effectively<00:00:27.990> target<00:00:28.260> triceps<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
will not effectively target triceps and

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.830 
will not effectively target triceps and
this<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.400> because<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.029> angle<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.420> pressing

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
this is because the angle of pressing

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.930 
this is because the angle of pressing
your<00:00:31.050> chest<00:00:31.380> will<00:00:31.590> tend<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> take<00:00:32.160> over<00:00:32.579> by

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
your chest will tend to take over by

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.060 
your chest will tend to take over by
changing<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> angle<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:34.140> an<00:00:34.380> incline<00:00:34.829> and

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
changing the angle to an incline and

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.020 
changing the angle to an incline and
like<00:00:35.610> standard<00:00:36.149> incline<00:00:36.780> bench<00:00:36.960> press

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
like standard incline bench press

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.610 
like standard incline bench press
apparatus<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.600> actually<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.050> rather<00:00:40.230> high

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
apparatus it's actually a rather high

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
incline it's over 45 degrees this throws

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.080 
incline it's over 45 degrees this throws
a<00:00:43.320> lot<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> chest<00:00:44.070> out<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.760> does

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
a lot of the chest out of it it does

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.090 
a lot of the chest out of it it does
involve<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> upper<00:00:45.930> PEC<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.590> anterior

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
involve the upper PEC and the anterior

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.150 
involve the upper PEC and the anterior
deltoid<00:00:47.730> more<00:00:48.090> these<00:00:48.600> are<00:00:48.660> smaller<00:00:49.440> muscles

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
deltoid more these are smaller muscles

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.209 
deltoid more these are smaller muscles
allowing<00:00:50.670> your<00:00:50.910> triceps<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.809> shine<00:00:52.140> or<00:00:52.440> giving

allowing your triceps to shine or giving
them<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.460> chance<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.969> take<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.360> greater<00:00:54.840> load

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
them a chance to take on greater load

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.080 
them a chance to take on greater load
what<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.370> want<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> talk<00:00:56.760> about<00:00:56.879> first

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
what I really want to talk about first

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.119 
what I really want to talk about first
is<00:00:57.300> how<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.350> much<00:00:58.710> like<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
is how to do it so it's much like a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.549 
is how to do it so it's much like a
standard<00:00:59.520> incline<00:01:00.449> bench<00:01:00.629> press<00:01:00.780> except<00:01:01.410> your

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
standard incline bench press except your

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.619 
standard incline bench press except your
grip<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.010> slightly<00:01:02.399> more<00:01:02.699> narrow<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.149> just

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
grip is slightly more narrow it's just

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.630 
grip is slightly more narrow it's just
inside<00:01:04.080> shoulder-width<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.040> see<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> lot<00:01:05.610> of

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
inside shoulder-width I see a lot of

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.980 
inside shoulder-width I see a lot of
guys<00:01:05.820> when<00:01:06.119> they<00:01:06.210> do<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.390> close<00:01:06.720> grip<00:01:06.930> bench

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
guys when they do a close grip bench

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.080 
guys when they do a close grip bench
press<00:01:07.320> their<00:01:07.950> hands<00:01:08.220> are<00:01:08.400> far<00:01:08.670> too<00:01:08.880> narrow

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
press their hands are far too narrow

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.359 
press their hands are far too narrow
that<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> affect<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.010> angle

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
that is going to affect the angle

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.310 
that is going to affect the angle
pressing<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.299> incorrect<00:01:12.990> you'll<00:01:13.140> not

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
pressing and it is incorrect you'll not

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.670 
pressing and it is incorrect you'll not
get<00:01:13.500> optimal<00:01:14.250> power<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.259> what<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.500> showed

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
get optimal power so what I just showed

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.440 
get optimal power so what I just showed
there<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.280> want<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.490> make<00:01:17.549> sure<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.939> retract

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
there you want to make sure you retract

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.300 
there you want to make sure you retract
your<00:01:18.570> shoulder<00:01:18.930> blades<00:01:19.110> up<00:01:19.259> back<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.890> down<00:01:19.979> in

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
your shoulder blades up back and down in

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.190 
your shoulder blades up back and down in
order<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.640> tight<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.840> like<00:01:21.990> that

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
order to get tight but just like that

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.679 
order to get tight but just like that
because<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.159> bench<00:01:23.369> press<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.180> stable

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
because the bench press is the stable

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.719 
because the bench press is the stable
surface<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.560> you're<00:01:25.710> pressing<00:01:25.979> off<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.580> so

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
surface that you're pressing off of so

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.420 
surface that you're pressing off of so
you<00:01:26.790> want<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.299> tight<00:01:27.659> around<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.320> now<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
you want to be tight around it now on to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.730 
you want to be tight around it now on to
the<00:01:29.520> actual<00:01:29.850> pressing<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.840> key<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.710> keep

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the actual pressing the key is to keep

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.340 
the actual pressing the key is to keep
the<00:01:32.040> elbows<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.729> wrists<00:01:33.270> tucked<00:01:33.840> tight<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
pressing in a straight line see how my

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.300 
pressing in a straight line see how my
elbows<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.630> wrists<00:01:36.869> are<00:01:36.960> lined<00:01:37.259> up<00:01:37.439> you'll

elbows and wrists are lined up you'll

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.280 
elbows and wrists are lined up you'll
notice<00:01:38.700> also<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> bring<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.079> bar

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
notice also that I bring the bar

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.499 
notice also that I bring the bar
slightly<00:01:40.740> lower<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.939> order<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.210> keep

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
slightly lower this is in order to keep
