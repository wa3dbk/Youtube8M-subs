putting<00:02:22.519> a<00:02:22.670> stop<00:02:22.849> to<00:02:22.910> their<00:02:23.150> program<00:02:23.569> so

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
putting a stop to their program so

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.729 
putting a stop to their program so
that's<00:02:24.800> what<00:02:24.980> we're<00:02:25.129> all<00:02:25.250> about<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:27.290> let's

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
that's what we're all about so let's

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.009 
that's what we're all about so let's
talk<00:02:27.890> about<00:02:27.950> saturated<00:02:28.910> fat<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.540> dietary

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
talk about saturated fat and dietary

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.170 
talk about saturated fat and dietary
cholesterol<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.819> way<00:02:31.910> it's<00:02:32.060> been

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
cholesterol and the way it's been

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.300 
cholesterol and the way it's been
demonized<00:02:32.690> so<00:02:33.019> both<00:02:33.620> saturated<00:02:34.129> fat<00:02:34.280> and

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
demonized so both saturated fat and

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.520 
demonized so both saturated fat and
dietary<00:02:35.120> cholesterol<00:02:35.330> have<00:02:35.720> actually<00:02:36.080> really

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
dietary cholesterol have actually really

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.949 
dietary cholesterol have actually really
healthy<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:37.819> really<00:02:38.090> necessary<00:02:38.690> part

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
healthy and and a really necessary part

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.570 
healthy and and a really necessary part
of<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.140> diet<00:02:39.349> when<00:02:39.620> used<00:02:39.890> correctly<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.430> when

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
of the diet when used correctly and when

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.699 
of the diet when used correctly and when
used<00:02:40.819> in<00:02:40.940> balance<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:41.629> when<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.470> talk<00:02:42.680> about

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
used in balance so when I talk about

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.800 
used in balance so when I talk about
saturated<00:02:43.310> fat<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.940> Hart<00:02:44.120> Foundation<00:02:44.269> seem

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
saturated fat the Hart Foundation seem

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.360 
saturated fat the Hart Foundation seem
to<00:02:44.930> get<00:02:45.019> from<00:02:45.319> confused<00:02:45.920> when<00:02:46.099> they<00:02:46.130> talk

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
to get from confused when they talk

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.160 
to get from confused when they talk
about<00:02:46.400> these<00:02:46.760> things<00:02:46.819> through<00:02:47.269> they<00:02:47.450> talk

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
about these things through they talk

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.449 
about these things through they talk
about<00:02:48.200> saturated<00:02:48.799> fat<00:02:49.069> and<00:02:49.099> a<00:02:49.280> lot<00:02:49.430> of

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
about saturated fat and a lot of

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.220 
about saturated fat and a lot of
processed<00:02:50.000> foods<00:02:50.299> but<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.540> saturated<00:02:50.959> fat

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
processed foods but the saturated fat

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.839 
processed foods but the saturated fat
I'm<00:02:51.349> talking<00:02:51.769> about<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:52.220> there's<00:02:52.340> also<00:02:52.489> in

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
I'm talking about and there's also in

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.360 
I'm talking about and there's also in
every<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.079> each<00:02:54.290> other<00:02:54.530> saturated<00:02:55.190> fat

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
every that in each other saturated fat

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.180 
every that in each other saturated fat
not<00:02:55.670> on<00:02:55.790> such<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.200> monounsaturated<00:02:57.200> fat<00:02:58.010> and

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
not on such a monounsaturated fat and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.640 
not on such a monounsaturated fat and
polyunsaturated<00:02:58.519> fat<00:02:59.390> so<00:02:59.720> they<00:03:00.290> seem<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.530> have

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
polyunsaturated fat so they seem to have

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.850 
polyunsaturated fat so they seem to have
a<00:03:00.769> very<00:03:01.090> simplistic<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.599> kind<00:03:03.349> of<00:03:03.379> confused

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
a very simplistic and kind of confused

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.830 
a very simplistic and kind of confused
idea<00:03:04.160> about<00:03:04.370> what<00:03:04.579> cetera<00:03:04.970> fer<00:03:05.209> actually<00:03:05.660> is

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
idea about what cetera fer actually is

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.880 
idea about what cetera fer actually is
so<00:03:06.620> when<00:03:07.040> I'm<00:03:07.160> talking<00:03:07.549> about<00:03:07.640> I'm<00:03:08.180> eating

there's<00:03:41.299> been<00:03:41.419> a<00:03:41.480> great<00:03:41.870> deal<00:03:41.930> of<00:03:42.109> research

and then there's also the problem of

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.900 
and then there's also the problem of
trans<00:05:38.690> fats<00:05:39.020> I<00:05:39.260> know<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:40.010> Hart<00:05:40.190> Foundation<00:05:40.340> or

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
trans fats I know the Hart Foundation or

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.450 
trans fats I know the Hart Foundation or
in<00:05:41.150> Australia<00:05:41.630> say<00:05:41.870> that<00:05:42.140> the<00:05:42.710> levels<00:05:43.370> of

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
in Australia say that the levels of

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.700 
in Australia say that the levels of
trans<00:05:43.700> fats<00:05:44.030> in<00:05:44.210> our<00:05:44.510> Marines<00:05:45.080> are<00:05:45.230> very<00:05:45.440> low

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
trans fats in our Marines are very low

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.700 
trans fats in our Marines are very low
but<00:05:46.430> um<00:05:46.670> it<00:05:47.390> has<00:05:47.540> been<00:05:47.720> shown<00:05:47.780> that<00:05:48.110> even<00:05:48.560> just

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
but um it has been shown that even just

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.770 
but um it has been shown that even just
a<00:05:48.920> two<00:05:49.160> percent<00:05:49.520> increase<00:05:49.880> of<00:05:50.060> trans<00:05:50.330> fat<00:05:50.570> in

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
a two percent increase of trans fat in

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.410 
a two percent increase of trans fat in
our<00:05:50.930> diet<00:05:51.230> correlates<00:05:52.160> to<00:05:52.280> twenty<00:05:52.790> three

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
our diet correlates to twenty three

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.330 
our diet correlates to twenty three
percent<00:05:53.600> increase<00:05:54.200> in<00:05:54.440> heart<00:05:54.680> disease<00:05:54.770> so

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
percent increase in heart disease so

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.490 
percent increase in heart disease so
there<00:05:55.820> really<00:05:55.940> are<00:05:56.210> no<00:05:56.240> safe<00:05:56.780> levels<00:05:57.170> of<00:05:57.320> trans

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
there really are no safe levels of trans

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.550 
there really are no safe levels of trans
fats<00:05:57.830> and<00:05:58.220> we<00:05:58.340> really<00:05:58.670> need<00:05:58.880> to<00:05:59.230> you<00:06:00.230> know<00:06:00.320> get
