00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.660 
pitch too much now that we're getting
out<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> open<00:01:52.590> road<00:01:52.920> our<00:01:53.159> speeds<00:01:53.490> are

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
out on the open road our speeds are

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.819 
out on the open road our speeds are
increasing<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.270> little<00:01:54.390> bit<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.320> feel<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
increasing a little bit you feel the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.410 
increasing a little bit you feel the
tightness<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.549> steering<00:01:56.880> wheel<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.240> is

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
tightness of the steering wheel this is

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.450 
tightness of the steering wheel this is
not<00:01:57.600> your<00:01:57.810> own<00:01:57.930> conventional<00:01:58.920> steering<00:01:59.219> wheel

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
not your own conventional steering wheel

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.570 
not your own conventional steering wheel
this<00:01:59.579> thing<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.030> solid<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.259> tight

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
this thing is solid it's tight

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.880 
this thing is solid it's tight
that<00:02:02.850> actually<00:02:03.300> makes<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:03.690> more<00:02:04.020> control<00:02:04.590> as

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that actually makes for more control as

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.640 
that actually makes for more control as
you<00:02:05.280> go<00:02:05.520> faster<00:02:05.850> Nissan<00:02:06.810> has<00:02:06.960> developed<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.470> new

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
you go faster Nissan has developed a new

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.370 
you go faster Nissan has developed a new
system<00:02:08.100> called<00:02:08.310> CVT<00:02:09.119> now<00:02:09.330> CVT<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:09.930> a<00:02:10.050> belt

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
system called CVT now CVT is a belt

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.710 
system called CVT now CVT is a belt
system<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:11.070> not<00:02:11.610> what<00:02:11.820> you<00:02:11.940> normally<00:02:12.540> have

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
system it's not what you normally have

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.960 
system it's not what you normally have
in<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.960> car<00:02:13.200> where<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.410> change<00:02:13.830> gears<00:02:14.310> it's<00:02:14.760> all

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
in a car where you change gears it's all

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.930 
in a car where you change gears it's all
just<00:02:15.150> one<00:02:15.450> smooth<00:02:16.050> transition<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.950> go<00:02:17.280> faster

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
just one smooth transition to go faster

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.560 
just one smooth transition to go faster
so<00:02:18.390> when<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.720> really<00:02:19.020> need<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.380> power<00:02:20.570> it

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
so when you really need that power it

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.110 
so when you really need that power it
really<00:02:22.200> gets<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.680> going<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:23.280> it's<00:02:23.400> extremely

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
really gets you going and it's extremely

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.510 
really gets you going and it's extremely
smooth<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.260> navigation<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.040> very<00:02:26.070> easy<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
smooth the navigation is very easy to

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.430 
smooth the navigation is very easy to
use<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.000> strongly<00:02:27.390> suggest<00:02:27.690> sitting<00:02:28.200> down

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
use but I strongly suggest sitting down

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.860 
use but I strongly suggest sitting down
before<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.310> take<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.640> car<00:02:29.880> out<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.090> learning

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
before you take the car out and learning

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.420 
before you take the car out and learning
it<00:02:30.960> because<00:02:31.320> if<00:02:31.560> you're<00:02:31.710> driving<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.310> trying

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
it because if you're driving and trying

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.890 
it because if you're driving and trying
to<00:02:32.610> learn<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.940> you're<00:02:33.420> never<00:02:33.600> gonna<00:02:33.720> get

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
to learn this you're never gonna get

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.880 
to learn this you're never gonna get
anywhere<00:02:34.110> you're<00:02:34.350> probably<00:02:34.530> getting<00:02:34.800> an

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
anywhere you're probably getting an

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.300 
anywhere you're probably getting an
accident<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.420> AC<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:37.320> radio<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:38.130> nav

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
accident the the AC the radio the nav

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.040 
accident the the AC the radio the nav
it's<00:02:38.610> all<00:02:38.730> gonna<00:02:38.850> take<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.120> little<00:02:39.390> bit<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.570> time

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
it's all gonna take a little bit of time

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.290 
it's all gonna take a little bit of time
don't<00:02:40.380> worry<00:02:40.500> however<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.340> screen<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.910> big

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
don't worry however the screen is big

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.670 
don't worry however the screen is big
and<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.780> navigation<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.320> also<00:02:43.530> on<00:02:43.590> your

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
and the navigation is also on your

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.460 
and the navigation is also on your
speedometer<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:44.660> during<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.750> daytime<00:02:46.200> it's

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
speedometer but during the daytime it's

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.890 
speedometer but during the daytime it's
a<00:02:46.620> little<00:02:47.130> bit<00:02:47.250> glarey<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.760> can't<00:02:48.030> really<00:02:48.270> see

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
a little bit glarey you can't really see

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.960 
a little bit glarey you can't really see
it<00:02:48.930> very<00:02:49.230> well<00:02:49.380> we<00:02:50.370> haven't<00:02:50.520> really<00:02:50.640> played

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
it very well we haven't really played

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.750 
it very well we haven't really played
with<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.240> brightness<00:02:51.630> on<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.900> screen<00:02:52.230> but

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
with the brightness on the screen but

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.100 
with the brightness on the screen but
it's<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.970> little<00:02:54.270> bit<00:02:54.420> iffy<00:02:54.660> that's<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.900> only

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
it's a little bit iffy that's the only

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.390 
it's a little bit iffy that's the only
thing<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.320> have<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.590> say<00:02:55.800> about<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.220> now

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
thing I have to say about this now

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.880 
thing I have to say about this now

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
otherwise this is a very very good

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.199 
otherwise this is a very very good
navigation<00:02:59.490> system

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
navigation system

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.820
