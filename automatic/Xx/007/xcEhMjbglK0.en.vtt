00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 At this year's Christmas season, it is 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.779
 ben still once more in a museum 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.490
 full of lively exhibits 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.170
 lure and let's take the view 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.219
 the german trailer to at night 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.179
 museum 3 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:19.320
 the mysterious gravestone the largest 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.500
 discovery for 3000 years reveals the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.330
 origin of a secret power and leads 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.920
 the greatest heroes of world history 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.349
 a place where you have never been before 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.980
 were so talk to the driver 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.640
 to change 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.079
 kisses my start both these are these 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.239
 something manic happens 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.739
 the sun goes under the blackboard begins 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.660
 to shine and everything comes to life 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.920
 but suddenly yes, yes, we'll meet 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.960
 No, I'm not like that 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.789
 magic at the end something is not right 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.210
 with the blackboard sunrise we are 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.210
 all dead 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.109
 but your biggest adventure is all of you 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.760
 just rely on me 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.180
 We started to go to London and one 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.180
 find solution 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.049
 in america with a clear with 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.360
 silencer with also in ninja 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:20.020
 swords 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:21.280
 so that they are something of next has 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.920
 You also like the position and look 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.920
 keep that none coming in or out 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.580
 ok i believe 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.829
 the landrat to your service president 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.789
 the united states absolutely no 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.789
 I know what that means 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.530
 8th 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.020
 at night in the museum the mysterious 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.020
 grave times where the devil 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.480
 This is never necessary to us here again 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.120
 I must honestly say that now 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.099
 I do not really like the trailer 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.079
 where I do a total in the museum 1 at night 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.640
 and its nice simple family movie 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.840
 The second part was then one 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.640
 get a bit bigger with that 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.590
 smithsonian and everything that goes with it 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.150
 I thought okay I have more figures to 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.769
 I hope that the third brought 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.599
 Threesome it somehow manages here now 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.280
 a bit in America now stab 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.900
 not wanting to exaggerate everything anymore 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.790
 but especially in this trailer I 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.319
 only occasionally funny I hope 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.359
 that this movie just re-opens 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.069
 Family movie sets at Christmas time 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.200
 because at night in the museum 3 brings us 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.659
 Century fox is expected to abate 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.430
 the 18 december 2014 in the german 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.810
 Cinemas and for many it is clear 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.790
 once in quotation marks her bad 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.739
 one of the last times robin williams 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.870
 in front of the camera to see after his 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.030
 tragic dying for many a hero 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.439
 the childhood of one's eyes so much 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.849
 laps and always given the feeling 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.870
 somehow have the good in humans 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.609
 to believe 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.349
 one of the so much depth before the 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.329
 It can be nice here 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.769
 once again as teddy roosevelt alone 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.879
 to see trailer alone because of it 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.500
 I somehow also at night in the museum 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.090
 3 he is such a madman 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.040
 charismatic acting vices here 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.879
 Naturally mentioned on the edge of course 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.319
 important to know 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.940
 this time the whole shift will be 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.500
 the history of storytelling 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.329
 from the united states of america 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.340
 more precisely, Europe is relocating to Europe 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.870
 London for European history 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.760
 of course offers opportunities again 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.560
 completely different audience if 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.090
 it comes to the pure box office result 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.870
 and above all, many characters 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.979
 arouse 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.479
 those with the united states of 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:48.189
 america do not do anything at first 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.989
 Of course it is clear again 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.519
 that especially larry daley played by 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.229
 bentzel a main character on a lot 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.669
 The characters do not hit them that way 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:56.109
 but also like his normal 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.720
 supporter among others also in 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.919
 cowboy shape in miniature mode without it 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.509
 I'm really looking forward to it again 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.009
 to see in front of the camera, it is said 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:04.479
 meet again with old friends new 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.340
 enemies and in the end the question in the room 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.599
 as with the other two also share 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.280
 already can different cultures 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.720
 do not live together somehow 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.409
 of course, a feelgood comedy 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.090
 his 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.500
 from the 18th of december and I am glad 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.630
 just because I am sometimes too 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.070
 just like when comedy is not too rough 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.690
 but are just harmless for the 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.340
 big and small and straight to 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.259
 It's easy at Christmas time 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.729
 is little to say trailer so-so 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.110
 nevertheless I am happy because of this 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.639
 franchise wears for me a bit 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.289
 and I hope he gets better 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.270
 as the second of the already was absacker 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.580
 for the first and therefore as I said 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.080
 I am pleased though the coach so 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.699
 what do you say to the fabric scan the 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.080
 comments because I'm through now 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.759
 wittmann trailer check for the first 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.280
 German trailer at night in the museum 3 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.169
 the mysterious grave times then leave 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.550
 because if this video was made let it 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.780
 stay unless otherwise the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.610
 You know there are still a few left around 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.740
 me around and tomorrow at 15 o'clock of course 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.949
 at the latest a new video until then 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.610
 I hope now we do with it 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.610
 of course on the 3rd
