diagram shows surface wind the
frictional<00:00:53.219> force<00:00:53.430> not<00:00:53.610> only<00:00:53.640> slows<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.510> wind

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
frictional force not only slows the wind

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.350 
frictional force not only slows the wind
but<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.680> also<00:00:55.829> changes<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> direction<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
but it also changes the direction the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.330 
but it also changes the direction the
wind<00:00:57.390> will<00:00:57.719> travel<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.680> here's<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.949> frictional

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
wind will travel so here's a frictional

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.369 
wind will travel so here's a frictional
force<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.850> because<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> friction<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
force and because of the friction the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.210 
force and because of the friction the
wind<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.649> traveling<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.550> direction

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.260

pressure gradient force remember this is

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.820 
pressure gradient force remember this is
determined<00:01:11.670> by<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.900> difference<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.439> high<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
determined by the difference in high and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.350 
determined by the difference in high and
low<00:01:13.860> pressure<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.340> how<00:01:14.490> close<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> isobars

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360

geostrophic<00:01:20.909> winds<00:01:21.270> travel<00:01:21.659> parallel<00:01:22.290> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
geostrophic winds travel parallel to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.800 
geostrophic winds travel parallel to
isobars<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.310> are<00:01:23.909> fastest<00:01:24.479> when<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
isobars and are fastest when the

isobars and are fastest when the
pressure<00:01:25.049> gradient<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.130> highest<00:01:26.490> meaning

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
pressure gradient is the highest meaning

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:35.810 
pressure gradient is the highest meaning
the<00:01:27.420> isobars<00:01:27.900> are<00:01:28.080> very<00:01:28.290> close<00:01:28.590> together<00:01:34.820> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
the isobars are very close together the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.260 
the isobars are very close together the
jet<00:01:36.090> stream<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.900> type<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.259> geostrophic<00:01:37.770> wind

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
jet stream is a type of geostrophic wind

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.340 
jet stream is a type of geostrophic wind
because<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> jet<00:01:39.540> stream<00:01:39.750> occurs<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
because the jet stream occurs in the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.969 
because the jet stream occurs in the
upper<00:01:40.619> levels<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.189> troposphere

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
upper levels of the troposphere

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.160 
upper levels of the troposphere
these<00:01:43.979> winds<00:01:44.280> travel<00:01:44.729> from<00:01:44.970> west<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.630> east<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
these winds travel from west to east and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.560 
these winds travel from west to east and
are<00:01:47.070> usually<00:01:47.220> fastest<00:01:48.030> when<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
are usually fastest when we have the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.700 
are usually fastest when we have the
greatest<00:01:48.780> temperature<00:01:49.290> difference<00:01:49.619> between

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
greatest temperature difference between

greatest temperature difference between
the<00:01:50.040> equator<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.759> poles<00:01:51.570> now<00:01:52.470> this

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the equator and the poles now this

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.319 
the equator and the poles now this
should<00:01:52.740> make<00:01:52.920> sense<00:01:53.189> because<00:01:53.520> temperature<00:01:54.299> is

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
should make sense because temperature is

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.630 
should make sense because temperature is
related<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.869> pressure<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.590> differences<00:01:56.579> in

mind<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.030> should<00:02:00.060> guess<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.380> jet

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
mind you should guess that the jet

mind you should guess that the jet
stream<00:02:01.950> travels<00:02:02.520> fastest<00:02:03.180> during<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> winter

now there's a second subtropical jet

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.140 
now there's a second subtropical jet

the<00:02:33.120> position<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.780> dust<00:02:33.960> stream<00:02:34.170> is

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
the position of the dust stream is

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.260 
the position of the dust stream is
really<00:02:34.710> important<00:02:35.100> especially<00:02:35.250> for<00:02:35.520> us<00:02:35.700> here

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
really important especially for us here

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.780 
really important especially for us here
in<00:02:36.600> Minnesota<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:38.310> here<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:38.910> are<00:02:38.940> in<00:02:39.180> Minnesota

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
in Minnesota so here we are in Minnesota

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.570 
in Minnesota so here we are in Minnesota
the<00:02:41.790> position<00:02:42.300> changes<00:02:42.690> with<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.140> seasons

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
the position changes with the seasons

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.220 
the position changes with the seasons
now<00:02:44.580> here's<00:02:44.850> how<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.150> jet<00:02:45.390> stream<00:02:45.600> impacts<00:02:46.020> us

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
now here's how the jet stream impacts us

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.980 
now here's how the jet stream impacts us
here<00:02:46.740> in<00:02:46.830> Minnesota<00:02:47.270> if<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.450> jet<00:02:48.630> stream<00:02:48.870> is

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
here in Minnesota if the jet stream is

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.930 
here in Minnesota if the jet stream is
located<00:02:49.470> south<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:50.040> Minnesota<00:02:50.490> is<00:02:50.640> going<00:02:50.850> to

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
located south of Minnesota is going to

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.080 
located south of Minnesota is going to
pull<00:02:51.180> down<00:02:51.210> very<00:02:52.100> cold<00:02:53.100> arctic<00:02:53.430> air<00:02:53.970> from

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
pull down very cold arctic air from

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.970 
pull down very cold arctic air from
Canada<00:02:54.420> creating<00:02:55.110> air<00:02:55.290> temperatures<00:02:55.740> that

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
Canada creating air temperatures that

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.360 
Canada creating air temperatures that
are<00:02:56.040> lower<00:02:56.760> than<00:02:57.030> normal<00:02:57.410> so<00:02:58.410> like<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.070> this

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
are lower than normal so like in this

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.370 
are lower than normal so like in this
example<00:02:59.760> right<00:02:59.880> here<00:03:00.360> these<00:03:00.720> guys<00:03:01.020> would<00:03:01.260> be

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
example right here these guys would be

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.720 
example right here these guys would be
experiencing<00:03:02.040> colder<00:03:02.520> than<00:03:02.700> normal

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
experiencing colder than normal

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.280 
experiencing colder than normal
conditions<00:03:05.420> however<00:03:06.420> if<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.720> jet<00:03:06.900> stream<00:03:07.110> is

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
conditions however if the jet stream is

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.620 
conditions however if the jet stream is
north<00:03:07.740> of<00:03:07.920> Minnesota<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.670> will<00:03:08.880> pull<00:03:09.090> up<00:03:09.120> warm

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
north of Minnesota it will pull up warm

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.450 
north of Minnesota it will pull up warm
air<00:03:09.840> from<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.170> Gulf<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.440> Mexico<00:03:10.500> which<00:03:11.430> is

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
air from the Gulf of Mexico which is

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.790 
air from the Gulf of Mexico which is
also<00:03:11.700> very<00:03:11.850> humid<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:13.080> should<00:03:13.290> make<00:03:13.440> our<00:03:13.620> air

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
also very humid this should make our air

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.300 
also very humid this should make our air
temperatures<00:03:14.280> warmer<00:03:15.060> than<00:03:15.570> normal<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.890> here

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
temperatures warmer than normal so here

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.860 
temperatures warmer than normal so here
we<00:03:17.459> have<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.760> warm<00:03:18.060> air<00:03:18.270> from<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.600> Gulf<00:03:18.780> of

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
we have that warm air from the Gulf of

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.810 
we have that warm air from the Gulf of
Mexico<00:03:18.930> being<00:03:19.560> pulled<00:03:19.860> up<00:03:20.040> by<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.280> jet<00:03:20.550> stream

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
Mexico being pulled up by the jet stream

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.300 
Mexico being pulled up by the jet stream
making<00:03:21.480> these<00:03:21.780> areas<00:03:22.170> warmer<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.770> more<00:03:23.250> humid

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
making these areas warmer and more humid

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:32.600 
making these areas warmer and more humid
than<00:03:23.850> normal<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:31.440> jet<00:03:31.620> stream<00:03:31.650> also<00:03:32.130> plays<00:03:32.340> a

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
than normal the jet stream also plays a

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.260 
than normal the jet stream also plays a
role<00:03:33.570> in<00:03:33.600> creating<00:03:34.230> storms<00:03:34.860> now<00:03:35.850> if<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.090> jet

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
role in creating storms now if the jet

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.880 
role in creating storms now if the jet
stream<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.690> very<00:03:36.720> curved<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.620> will<00:03:37.739> help

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
stream is very curved it will help

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.560 
stream is very curved it will help
produce<00:03:38.070> high<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:38.820> low<00:03:38.910> pressure<00:03:39.209> cells

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
produce high and low pressure cells

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.540 
produce high and low pressure cells
which<00:03:39.840> work<00:03:40.080> together<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.680> form<00:03:40.920> storms<00:03:41.340> like

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
which work together to form storms like

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.300 
which work together to form storms like
we've<00:03:41.700> talked<00:03:41.940> about<00:03:42.170> however<00:03:43.170> if<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:44.130> jet

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
we've talked about however if the jet

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.490 
we've talked about however if the jet
stream<00:03:44.489> is<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.670> bit<00:03:44.820> more<00:03:45.060> flat<00:03:45.510> high<00:03:46.320> and

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
stream is a bit more flat high and

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.960 
stream is a bit more flat high and
low-pressure<00:03:46.769> systems<00:03:47.340> are<00:03:47.489> far<00:03:47.700> away<00:03:47.820> from

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
low-pressure systems are far away from

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.449 
low-pressure systems are far away from
each<00:03:48.239> other<00:03:48.480> which<00:03:49.320> creates<00:03:49.709> long<00:03:49.980> stretches

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
each other which creates long stretches

00:03:50.459 --> 00:04:00.040 
each other which creates long stretches
of<00:03:50.640> unchanging<00:03:51.650> usually<00:03:52.650> nice<00:03:52.890> weather

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.550 

finally<00:04:01.280> there's<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.370> link<00:04:02.670> here<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.500> kind<00:04:04.500> of

finally there's a link here that kind of
talks<00:04:05.070> about<00:04:05.220> how<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:06.750> jet<00:04:06.959> stream<00:04:07.200> works<00:04:07.500> I'd

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
talks about how the jet stream works I'd

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.680 
talks about how the jet stream works I'd
highly<00:04:08.340> recommend<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.790> guys<00:04:08.910> taking<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.510> look
