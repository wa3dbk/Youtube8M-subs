00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
to put in the filling so you can see

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.509 
to put in the filling so you can see
it's<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.549> has<00:03:02.849> got<00:03:03.090> all<00:03:03.120> hardened<00:03:04.310> now<00:03:05.310> we<00:03:05.370> are

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
it's it has got all hardened now we are

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.759 
it's it has got all hardened now we are
going<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.880> be<00:03:06.060> filling<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.569> our<00:03:07.200> coconut

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
going to be filling in our coconut

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:15.110 
going to be filling in our coconut
mixture<00:03:08.690> just<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.989> little<00:03:10.290> bit<00:03:13.819> so<00:03:14.819> we<00:03:14.970> have

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
mixture just a little bit so we have

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.630 
mixture just a little bit so we have
filled<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.750> coconut<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.620> center<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.160> now

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
filled the coconut in the center and now

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.819 
filled the coconut in the center and now
we<00:03:17.700> are<00:03:17.940> again<00:03:18.299> going<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.660> top<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:19.049> up<00:03:19.200> with<00:03:19.230> the

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
we are again going to top it up with the

we are again going to top it up with the
melted<00:03:20.250> chocolate

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.500 

so<00:03:27.330> this<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.810> reason<00:03:28.170> why<00:03:28.350> we<00:03:28.940> first<00:03:29.940> make

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
so this is the reason why we first make

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.990 
so this is the reason why we first make
a<00:03:30.720> shell<00:03:31.110> of<00:03:31.380> chocolate<00:03:31.890> wherein<00:03:32.310> they<00:03:32.520> fill<00:03:32.850> a

a shell of chocolate wherein they fill a

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.120 
a shell of chocolate wherein they fill a
little<00:03:33.180> bit<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.690> then<00:03:33.959> we<00:03:34.380> remove<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.830> excess

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
little bit and then we remove the excess

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.120 
little bit and then we remove the excess
and<00:03:35.310> we<00:03:35.459> refrigerate<00:03:35.790> then<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.930> have<00:03:37.200> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
and we refrigerate then you have the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.550 
and we refrigerate then you have the
filling<00:03:38.610> Center<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.240> then<00:03:39.720> chocolate<00:03:40.080> on<00:03:40.440> the

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
filling Center and then chocolate on the

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.920 
filling Center and then chocolate on the
top<00:03:40.940> okay<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.000> now<00:03:42.209> we<00:03:42.270> are<00:03:42.420> going<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.720> just

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
top okay so now we are going to just

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.040 
top okay so now we are going to just
give<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.320> little<00:03:43.500> tap<00:03:44.420> so<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.600> it's<00:03:45.810> all

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
give it a little tap so that it's all

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.440 
give it a little tap so that it's all
given<00:03:46.380> out<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.860> now<00:03:47.670> we<00:03:47.730> are<00:03:47.910> going<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.209> again

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450
