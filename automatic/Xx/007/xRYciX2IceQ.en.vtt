 he has the things to apply only that the 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.160
 People do not want to put the white led 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.060
 then understand we are doing - the 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:37.950
 process you can take without fear is 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:42.460
 with china is a solvent is all this 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.010
 yellow coloration will enable you 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.129

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.350
 only now that the spinning account is then the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.570

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.540

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.789
 it's already yellow 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.409
 Let's be careful, guys, nothing to go by. 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.210
 only to not undo that not 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.090

 position who as you can see 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.920
 we initially used but not 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.670
 looks like led t5 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.440
 however the lighting got a bit 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:10.600
 then we decided to put the 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:15.640
 led tape that let the lighting 100% 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:19.280

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.120

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.120
 led strip
