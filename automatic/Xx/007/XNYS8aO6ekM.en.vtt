the best light armors are in Skyrim now
there's<00:00:15.639> no<00:00:15.820> definite<00:00:16.420> best<00:00:16.750> light<00:00:16.990> armor<00:00:17.410> but

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
there's no definite best light armor but

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.410 
there's no definite best light armor but
depending<00:00:18.220> on<00:00:18.310> what<00:00:18.520> type<00:00:18.730> of<00:00:18.760> character<00:00:19.270> you

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
depending on what type of character you

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.480 
depending on what type of character you
are<00:00:19.449> certain<00:00:20.199> light<00:00:20.410> armors<00:00:20.830> will<00:00:21.100> be<00:00:21.279> better

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
are certain light armors will be better

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.300 
are certain light armors will be better
than<00:00:21.760> others<00:00:22.090> before<00:00:22.810> I<00:00:22.840> begin<00:00:23.199> I<00:00:23.529> think<00:00:23.890> the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
than others before I begin I think the

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.769 
than others before I begin I think the
only<00:00:24.460> reason<00:00:24.670> you<00:00:24.849> should<00:00:25.089> be<00:00:25.240> using<00:00:25.480> light

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
only reason you should be using light

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.159 
only reason you should be using light
armor<00:00:26.170> is<00:00:26.349> if<00:00:26.830> you<00:00:27.070> have<00:00:27.310> a<00:00:27.339> sneak<00:00:28.029> or<00:00:28.330> assassin

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
armor is if you have a sneak or assassin

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.490 
armor is if you have a sneak or assassin
or<00:00:29.380> Archer<00:00:29.800> type<00:00:30.310> of<00:00:30.490> character<00:00:30.910> otherwise<00:00:31.660> if

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
or Archer type of character otherwise if

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.260 
or Archer type of character otherwise if
you<00:00:32.590> have<00:00:32.619> a<00:00:32.710> warrior<00:00:33.130> or<00:00:33.400> a<00:00:33.490> mage<00:00:33.790> you<00:00:34.060> should

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
you have a warrior or a mage you should

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.810 
you have a warrior or a mage you should
be<00:00:34.390> using<00:00:34.540> heavy<00:00:34.900> armor<00:00:35.350> but<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:36.100> light<00:00:36.310> armor

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
be using heavy armor but the light armor

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.210 
be using heavy armor but the light armor
that<00:00:37.270> offers<00:00:38.110> the<00:00:38.260> most<00:00:38.380> protection<00:00:39.010> is

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
that offers the most protection is

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.729 
that offers the most protection is
Dragonscale<00:00:40.059> armor<00:00:40.629> but<00:00:41.289> that<00:00:41.440> doesn't

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
Dragonscale armor but that doesn't

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.500 
Dragonscale armor but that doesn't
necessarily<00:00:41.860> mean<00:00:42.520> that<00:00:42.579> it's<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.270> best

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
necessarily mean that it's the best

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.630 
necessarily mean that it's the best
armor<00:00:44.020> that<00:00:44.170> just<00:00:44.379> means<00:00:44.590> it<00:00:44.920> has<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.309> best

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
armor that just means it has the best

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.420 
armor that just means it has the best
armor<00:00:46.030> rating<00:00:46.180> so<00:00:46.719> one<00:00:47.350> set<00:00:47.590> of<00:00:47.680> armor<00:00:48.039> that<00:00:48.070> I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
armor rating so one set of armor that I

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.849 
armor rating so one set of armor that I
think<00:00:48.730> is<00:00:49.000> really<00:00:49.420> good<00:00:49.600> is<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:50.320> Thieves

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
think is really good is the Thieves

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.580 
think is really good is the Thieves
Guild<00:00:50.980> armor<00:00:51.579> their<00:00:52.359> boots<00:00:52.570> have<00:00:52.899> an

Guild armor their boots have an

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.709 
Guild armor their boots have an
enchantment<00:00:54.070> where<00:00:54.340> pickpocket<00:00:55.030> success<00:00:55.510> is

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.369 
enchantment where pickpocket success is
a<00:00:55.780> 15%<00:00:56.680> better<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.870> later<00:00:58.870> on<00:00:59.050> you<00:00:59.230> have<00:00:59.260> a

a 15% better and later on you have a

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.919 
a 15% better and later on you have a
choice<00:00:59.620> to<00:00:59.679> upgrade<00:01:00.160> them<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:00.399> 25%<00:01:01.149> better<00:01:01.600> and

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
choice to upgrade them to 25% better and

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.369 
choice to upgrade them to 25% better and
the<00:01:02.679> hood<00:01:02.920> ah<00:01:03.190> prices<00:01:04.030> are<00:01:04.120> 10%<00:01:04.750> better<00:01:04.900> but

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
the hood ah prices are 10% better but

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.650 
the hood ah prices are 10% better but
you<00:01:05.680> could<00:01:05.830> find<00:01:05.980> a<00:01:06.310> lot<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.520> items<00:01:06.730> in<00:01:07.150> Skyrim

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
you could find a lot of items in Skyrim

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.080 
you could find a lot of items in Skyrim
with<00:01:07.900> that<00:01:08.050> enchantment<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:09.520> gloves<00:01:09.760> have

with that enchantment the gloves have

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.230 
with that enchantment the gloves have
lock-picking<00:01:10.750> is<00:01:11.110> 15%<00:01:11.980> easier<00:01:12.580> which<00:01:13.060> is

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
lock-picking is 15% easier which is

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.500 
lock-picking is 15% easier which is
pretty<00:01:13.540> useful<00:01:13.720> also<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:14.560> um<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.910> armor<00:01:16.300> is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
pretty useful also and um the armor is

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.920 
pretty useful also and um the armor is
carrying<00:01:17.500> capacity<00:01:18.130> is<00:01:18.370> increased<00:01:19.150> by<00:01:19.390> 20

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
carrying capacity is increased by 20

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.890 
carrying capacity is increased by 20
points<00:01:20.280> that's<00:01:21.280> not<00:01:21.490> really<00:01:21.850> useful<00:01:21.970> and<00:01:22.810> the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
points that's not really useful and the

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.750 
points that's not really useful and the
boots<00:01:23.140> are<00:01:23.530> probably<00:01:23.980> the<00:01:24.130> most<00:01:24.280> useful<00:01:24.550> part

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
boots are probably the most useful part

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.870 
boots are probably the most useful part
out<00:01:25.210> of<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:26.050> Thieves<00:01:26.260> Guild<00:01:26.350> set<00:01:26.800> but<00:01:27.370> on<00:01:27.610> the

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
out of the Thieves Guild set but on the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.240 
out of the Thieves Guild set but on the
PlayStation<00:01:28.450> 3<00:01:28.480> there's<00:01:29.080> a<00:01:29.200> glitch<00:01:29.530> where<00:01:29.920> if

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
PlayStation 3 there's a glitch where if

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.820 
PlayStation 3 there's a glitch where if
you<00:01:30.400> have<00:01:30.610> enchantments<00:01:31.480> on<00:01:31.660> armor<00:01:32.290> where

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
you have enchantments on armor where

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.760 
you have enchantments on armor where
pickpocket<00:01:33.820> success<00:01:34.270> is<00:01:34.540> a<00:01:34.600> certain<00:01:35.410> percent

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
pickpocket success is a certain percent

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.740 
pickpocket success is a certain percent
better<00:01:35.950> it<00:01:36.550> actually<00:01:36.880> makes<00:01:37.090> pickpocket

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
better it actually makes pickpocket

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.040 
better it actually makes pickpocket
success<00:01:38.140> worse<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.820> if<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:40.390> have<00:01:40.480> PlayStation

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
success worse so if you have PlayStation

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.570 
success worse so if you have PlayStation
3<00:01:41.290> I<00:01:41.320> would<00:01:41.770> not<00:01:41.920> recommend<00:01:42.190> that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
3 I would not recommend that

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.030 
3 I would not recommend that
um<00:01:42.760> now<00:01:43.150> another<00:01:43.450> good<00:01:43.660> armor<00:01:43.990> set<00:01:44.260> is<00:01:44.440> the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
um now another good armor set is the

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.950 
um now another good armor set is the
armor<00:01:45.820> you<00:01:45.850> get<00:01:46.120> from<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.600> Dark<00:01:46.780> Brotherhood
