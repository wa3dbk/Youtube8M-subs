00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.170

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.720
 number one the women we remember 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.790

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.090
 we forget nothing nothing absolutely 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.060
 nothing and we remember 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.360
 basically nothing after five minutes 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.189
 of the event was already 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.200
 number two we think different the brain 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.989
 of a woman is full of thousands and thousands 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.850
 of subjects at the same time what they 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.310
 they say what we tell them to follow 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.230
 early let's continue late how are they dressed 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.180

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.860
 ex-boyfriend if we told them that we love them 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.390
 enough if we open the door for you 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.520
 we close the door of the birthday of 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.170
 my mom your mom's partner if we 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.780
 We put the sack that they like if we 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.710
 we agreed on the 17th anniversary today 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.170
 we turn 25 days 3 hours and 4 minutes if 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.040
 they put on their skirts and we did not specify 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.799
 the beautiful and spectacular beautiful 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.049
 what are your legs and if we say a lot 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.520
 that you are mocking instead the 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.930
 a man's brain can only 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.360
 work with a 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.570
 the thing at once and we only have five 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.340
 issues if we are hungry if there is juppÃ© if 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.300
 we have wool at what time the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.360
 party and when to Pancho number 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.520
 three women love to talk and believe 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.229
 that men also if two women 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.950
 that have not been seen in five years of 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:45.060
 Suddenly they find this happens 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:45.060
 my work with luxury details 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.229
 notice that on another day to the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.789
 office of the depressed uses the 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.530
 plastic surgeon and told him I wanted 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.569
 that I would make them bigger and their 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.399
 talk can last hours days nights if 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:05.009
 two men who have not seen each other in five 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.009
 years suddenly find this happens 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:15.730

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.020
 together and then they will play 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.550
 or any other nonsense by the 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.530
 problem is that women like it 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.360
 communicate and to us not what would happen 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.650

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.130

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.850
 house that I will not bother you 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.850

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.690

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.270
 that a woman knows you makes you a 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:10.040
 quick check list to see if you can 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:14.350
 consider marrying you they check a 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.710
 chivalry intelligence the physical 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.810
 wallet 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:22.280
 if you have family value if you are 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:26.140
 nice if they grow up they do not know the door 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.140

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.930
 five heights seven physical in four 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:42.230
 money minus two cars in sympathy two

 practice at zero average 2.3 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.370
 and now we also make a 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.910
 checklist the difference is that we 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.200
 We do not think about getting married and say that 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.200
 the points are less 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.329
 Hello, invite me to your mouth 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.349
 number 5 the women grew up with 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.379
 fairy tales where in the end it 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:16.250
 they marry the prince and live happily 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.250
 forever 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.070
 Well, obviously, nobody told them 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.370

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.979
 friends a chamba and nobody either 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.740
 He said that life in a castle is very 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.020
 boring and there's not much to do like that 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.720
 that if the Cinderella is useless going to 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.530
 finish pulling out his eyes or getting out 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.530
 the prince 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.710
 and you go with your friends to eat boar 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.670
 with permission of who of course I am 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.470
