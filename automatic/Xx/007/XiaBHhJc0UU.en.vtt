00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
what is down there but getting there

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.929 
what is down there but getting there
won't<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.170> easy<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.799> fact<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.400> could<00:01:35.759> take

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
won't be easy in fact it could take

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.260 
won't be easy in fact it could take
weeks<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.600> solve<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.110> problem<00:01:38.270> they're

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
weeks to solve the problem they're

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.730 
weeks to solve the problem they're
currently<00:01:39.509> digging<00:01:39.900> wells<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.500> reduce

currently digging wells to reduce

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.530 
currently digging wells to reduce
pressure<00:01:41.040> around<00:01:41.430> Bertha<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.180> safe<00:01:42.390> for

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
pressure around Bertha so it's safe for

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.510 
pressure around Bertha so it's safe for
crews<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.960> go<00:01:43.079> down<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.320> explore<00:01:43.890> because

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
crews to go down and explore because

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.969 
crews to go down and explore because
Bertha<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.420> deep<00:01:45.689> odds<00:01:45.990> favor<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.619> natural

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
Bertha is so deep odds favor a natural

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.850 
Bertha is so deep odds favor a natural
