00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
this hot pink and that is before I don't

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.890 
this hot pink and that is before I don't
know<00:02:18.890> how<00:02:19.070> he<00:02:19.100> hit<00:02:19.370> pan<00:02:19.610> on<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:20.000> pink<00:02:20.390> on<00:02:20.600> this

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.500 
know how he hit pan on a pink on this
color<00:02:21.200> because<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.590> hardly<00:02:22.010> ever<00:02:22.100> wore<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.450> I

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
color because I hardly ever wore it so I

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.330 
color because I hardly ever wore it so I

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.530 
think maybe more towards when I start
making<00:02:25.460> videos<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:26.390> used<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:26.780> more<00:02:28.150> my<00:02:29.150> next
