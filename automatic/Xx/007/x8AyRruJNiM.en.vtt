00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.549 

so<00:00:10.769> I'm<00:00:10.950> introducing<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:12.000> new<00:00:12.509> way<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:13.019> tune

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
so I'm introducing a new way to tune

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.650 
so I'm introducing a new way to tune
your<00:00:13.799> nitro<00:00:14.219> engine<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:15.269> check<00:00:15.509> its

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
your nitro engine and to check its

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.960 
your nitro engine and to check its
temperature<00:00:15.949> he's<00:00:16.949> introducing<00:00:17.760> this

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
temperature he's introducing this

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.170 
temperature he's introducing this
temperature<00:00:18.600> gun<00:00:18.810> here<00:00:19.490> just<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.880> laser

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
temperature gun here just it's a laser

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.519 
temperature gun here just it's a laser
beam<00:00:21.510> one<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.680> let<00:00:23.279> me<00:00:23.430> show<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.869> the<00:00:24.869> idea<00:00:25.289> is

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
beam one and let me show you the idea is

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.519 
beam one and let me show you the idea is
is<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.490> pull<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.910> trigger<00:00:27.109> point<00:00:28.109> out<00:00:28.380> what

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
is you pull the trigger point out what

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.470 
is you pull the trigger point out what
you<00:00:28.650> want<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> temperature<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.849> then<00:00:30.300> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
you want the temperature of and then a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.939 
you want the temperature of and then a
temperature<00:00:30.960> reading<00:00:31.109> will<00:00:31.410> come<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
temperature reading will come up on the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.069 
temperature reading will come up on the
screen<00:00:33.320> okay<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.620> can<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:35.040> I'm<00:00:36.079> rendering

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
screen okay you can see I'm rendering

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.750 
screen okay you can see I'm rendering
the<00:00:37.200> temperature<00:00:37.710> at<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> end<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.520> you

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the temperature at the end in that you

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.979 
the temperature at the end in that you
can<00:00:38.879> see<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> laser<00:00:39.420> beam<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:41.250> engine<00:00:41.989> and

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
can see the laser beam on the engine and

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.470 
can see the laser beam on the engine and
this<00:00:43.410> one<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:44.010> reading<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.879> temperature<00:00:45.120> of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
this one is reading the temperature of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.889 
this one is reading the temperature of
the<00:00:45.600> engine<00:00:45.750> at<00:00:46.559> zero<00:00:47.160> degrees<00:00:47.850> Celsius

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
the engine at zero degrees Celsius

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.510 
the engine at zero degrees Celsius
boom<00:00:49.379> it's<00:00:49.530> very<00:00:49.710> useful<00:00:50.100> because<00:00:50.280> when

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
boom it's very useful because when

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.520 
boom it's very useful because when
you're<00:00:50.700> out<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.140> check<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
you're out you can just check the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
you're out you can just check the
temperature<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.010> your<00:00:53.100> engine<00:00:53.270> pull<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
temperature of your engine pull the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.569 
temperature of your engine pull the
trigger<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.199> beam<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.649> now<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> car<00:00:56.370> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
trigger the beam is now on the car you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.000 
trigger the beam is now on the car you
can<00:00:56.610> see<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.410> gives<00:00:58.590> me<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
can see and then it gives me the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.009 
can see and then it gives me the
temperature<00:01:00.770> okay<00:01:01.940> very<00:01:02.940> easy<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.510> use<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
temperature okay very easy to use and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.630 
temperature okay very easy to use and
easy<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.619> read<00:01:04.830> system<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:07.580> okay<00:01:08.580> so

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
easy to read system this one okay so

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.000 
easy to read system this one okay so
this<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.180> showing<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.200> how<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.770> works

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
this is showing you how this works

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.890 
this is showing you how this works
basically<00:01:11.670> we've<00:01:11.790> got<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.030> trigger<00:01:12.299> here<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
basically we've got the trigger here and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.690 
basically we've got the trigger here and
I'm<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.560> gonna<00:01:13.799> read<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> temperature<00:01:14.369> of

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
I'm just gonna read the temperature of

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.410 
I'm just gonna read the temperature of
the<00:01:14.820> engine<00:01:16.070> okay<00:01:17.070> now<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.820> see<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the engine okay now you see on the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.120 
the engine okay now you see on the
screen<00:01:19.880> measuring<00:01:20.880> temperature<00:01:21.540> zero<00:01:22.320> one

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
screen measuring temperature zero one

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.520 
screen measuring temperature zero one
zero<00:01:23.430> kind<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.180> thing<00:01:24.360> game<00:01:25.140> four<00:01:25.320> measure

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
zero kind of thing game four measure

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.450 
zero kind of thing game four measure
this<00:01:25.770> from<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.369> forty<00:01:26.820> feet<00:01:27.090> away
