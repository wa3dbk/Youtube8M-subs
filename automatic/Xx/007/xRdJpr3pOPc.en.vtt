00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
what i was saying is true these are the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.120 
what i was saying is true these are the
thermal<00:00:24.210> hacks<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.900> radar<00:00:25.260> as<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.980> can

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
thermal hacks with the radar as you can

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.009 
thermal hacks with the radar as you can
see<00:00:26.310> your<00:00:26.609> screen<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.150> black<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.630> white<00:00:27.720> and

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
see your screen is black and white and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.620 
see your screen is black and white and
up<00:00:28.830> top<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.310> left<00:00:29.670> corner<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.240> can<00:00:30.570> see

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
up top in the left corner you can see

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.690 
up top in the left corner you can see
that<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> radar<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.279> off<00:00:32.489> in

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
that the radar is on and it was off in

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.569 
that the radar is on and it was off in
the<00:00:32.790> settings<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:34.070> basically<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.309> have

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the settings so basically you have

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.229 
the settings so basically you have
thermal<00:00:35.969> vision<00:00:36.200> your<00:00:37.200> radars<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.239> it's

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
thermal vision your radars on and it's

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.580 
thermal vision your radars on and it's
weird<00:00:39.480> because<00:00:39.540> when<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.870> die<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.110> goes<00:00:40.350> back

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
weird because when you die it goes back

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.979 
weird because when you die it goes back
to<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> regular<00:00:40.980> game<00:00:41.399> when<00:00:42.360> i<00:00:42.390> die<00:00:42.510> i<00:00:42.690> don't

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
to a regular game when i die i don't

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.750 
to a regular game when i die i don't
know<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.140> i<00:00:43.230> dot<00:00:43.410> already<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:43.950> when<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.579> die

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
know if i dot already but when you die

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.600 
know if i dot already but when you die
it<00:00:44.820> goes<00:00:45.059> back<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.450> regular<00:00:45.660> game<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.610> it's

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
it goes back to a regular game and it's

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.150 
it goes back to a regular game and it's
kind<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.969> weird<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.680> think<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:49.980> hard

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
kind of weird I think it's kind of hard

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.830 
kind of weird I think it's kind of hard
to<00:00:50.190> play<00:00:50.489> honestly<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.329> don't<00:00:51.390> know<00:00:51.480> how<00:00:51.539> kids
