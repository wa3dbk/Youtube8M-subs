00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.760
 So here, perhaps, the future begins 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.559
 of journalism in the im 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.190
 American state North 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.559
 Carolina 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.650
 The young man who is here at the computer 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.020
 sitting is benjamin bruno he is 26 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.090
 years old and he is currently responding one 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.750
 text that no one has written 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.180
 but a computer we employ 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.789
 us with the automation of articles 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.960
 about sports teams the 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.270
 Summaries of individual players 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.159
 of a particular baseball team 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.809
 each sound quite similar because 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:39.649
 We always look at the same data 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.329
 To fall back on 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.129
 we have each with the same 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.420
 players and their respective ones 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.819
 to do statistics 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.319
 So my job is basically this 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:50.449
 to look through and make sure that 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:52.479
 The whole thing is not too robotic 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.170
 the parliament hears the polished 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.780
 computer-generated texts 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.109
 a little bit on imperative that would be 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.059
 not the company automatic inside supplies 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.170
 fully automatically generated texts in 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.659
 seconds 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.850
 Thousands of reports about the 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.790
 Real estate market for the American 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.810
 broker website song back or 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.040
 automated sports reports for the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.980
 agency bloomberg 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.590
 is the so-called robo journalism 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.870
 become an own car with your own industry 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.750
 insights or competitive narrative 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.060
 science will therefore deliver texts 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.820
 because no one can say that one 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.370
 computer she has written such authors 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.850
 benjamin become auxiliary workers 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.980
 this novel typewriter the 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.870
 kind of journalists should need 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.620
 about certain basic qualifications 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.900
 feature 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.360
 We are looking for a person with analytical 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.460
 understanding the data material understands 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.250
 and how to handle it 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.380
 manipulated and working with it 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.700
 In addition, this person should not be on the 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.860
 exclusive write by 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.420
 We are limited to word documents 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.450
 Instead, usually write 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.370
 tables started automatic insights 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.790
 five years ago with the evaluation of 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.210
 sports results on the page dot 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.490
 com 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.920
 At the beginning only statistics were collected 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.080
 but founder Robbie all soon realized 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.640
 the lyrics need a lot of sports 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.130
 websites to compete 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.989
 and so he decided to use an algorithm 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.830
 develop around them automatically 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.660
 to generate 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.970
 produced in the first season 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.370
 this 40,000 items 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.410
 I think in 20 years we will 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.940
 look back and laugh about it 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.340
 there were ever people at all 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.380
 practicing quantitative writing 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.319
 Computers are just so much better 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.050
 suitable for it so tokio is the hep 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.180
 Continue with auto with insights such a thing 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.390
 as the chief editor of the work of 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.310
 15 employees coordinate the authors 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.350
 text modules have to deliver the text 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.030
 computer then apply to the data 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.830
 can 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.450
 we have different titles on 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.700
 each different scenarios 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.920
 based and different words 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.440
 we use words like 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.569
 hits because they are in a sport context 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.580
 be used this succeeds in the 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.470
 Most sports are but in some 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.900
 not all work together 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.790
 Sport sets as desired if we have this 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.830
 We must join together 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.380
 to be aware of that we start with 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.109
 all sorts of scenarios concerning the 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.480
 the outcome of a game is a victory 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.670
 in the last minute a surprise victory 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.250
 or a balanced game in which it 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.660
 back and forth then we make up 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.730
 basis of a series 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.489
 different types of articles 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.560
 Most computer generated texts 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.380
 says procopio be from people 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.730
 made no different 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.549
 stefan plÃ¶chinger is the chief editor 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.859
 from sueddeutsche.de straight in the 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.989
 fast-paced online journalism 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.630
 many work processes standardized 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.160
 Some things also run automatically 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.709
 thicker service with the agency messages 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.540
 it is one of the standard features 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.430
 but that he is the real one 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.739
 one day's core business 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.109
 outsource algorithms is believed in it 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.120
 blechinger not for news texel 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.829
 and only after short contributions like that 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.420
 somehow still a bearable result 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.080
 But I think that it is not the 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.880
 Journalism really wants the reader 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.440
 good journalists do one 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.510
 difference to such standard 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.820
 journalism in which you write creative texts 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.620
 make you like to read the 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.959
 human creativity is for me 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.120
 what really makes and what typifies 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.310
 I think only creative already has the 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.020
 in the end it's good journalism because auto 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.360
 In salt, you also rent that 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.920
 computer so far only process that 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.350
 can also pay in what 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.480
 can express a rage on 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.700
 field edge about about custom 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.370
 algorithm even if they maybe the 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.290
 Message of the day is the human 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.540
 journalism should be the programs 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.490
 not necessarily replace it but him 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.520
 assist 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.540
 Since he is able to do a lot of the 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.400
 time-consuming and dirty work 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.350
 to do a journalist 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.330
 Namely collecting facts is me 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.340
 opinion that this is our content 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.840
 read such data sets and after 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.030
 can analyze at will 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.870
 Journalists do a lot of hard work 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.730
 is spared 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.920
 In addition, they can even 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.050
 additionally carry out reporting 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.360
 or your opinion and editorial 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.640
 Therefore I think we will add 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.600
 a crowd of journalists 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.970
 spare time 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.200
 still has the human reporter so 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.180
 not quite exhausted 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.190
 But it may be good that he will be in the future 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.480
 very close with his mechanical helper 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.210
 will work together 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.040
 if it goes well then he leaves him more 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.040
 time for intensive research
