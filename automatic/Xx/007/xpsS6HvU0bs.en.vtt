00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.850
 if you follow a pressure of 6 years in zones 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.859
 of change I just said that alliance is a 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.139
 big team and I think all kinds 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.259
 big has to be good from above 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.260
 but everything has a basis 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.839
 I want you to train and prepare 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.119
 to the maximum and to face the two 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.640
 Following competitions is the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.610
 championship and the american 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.700
 we have started strong 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.830
 from the first day and working well 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.510
 working hard I think he 's stuck 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.390
 committed we are doing things 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.950
 well and the teacher has quickly made us 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.830
 know what he wants and we 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.870
 well we are trying to catch language 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.650
 want the idea to respond to that and 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.380
 physically good 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.600
 working to the maximum number that is us 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.640
 demanding but we are understanding and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.440
 we are doing things well 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.870
 main the environment 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:02.289
 the work and grass is hard there 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.690
 try to train and give the best more and 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.790
 they are changing the championship another 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.009
 he has also gone to us we are going to 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.420
 start with everything the environment touches 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.030
 of summer like you say when because 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.560
 ochoa see the classic but we are not going to 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.040
 go out with everything to look for from the 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.659
 principle be hot there is up if 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.090
 we have generating the summer tournament 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.880
 we are going to go out with everything to gain it and there to 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.710
 fight to open the team that the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.510
 hook a good 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.159
 a good series of matches will be 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.909
 fighting up and if you stay there is a 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.150
 resolutive 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.409
 so we are the gods right now 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.590
 we are working like that because 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.479
 we want is to find that alliance where 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.670
 all this year I do not think that the most 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.640
 important is the team every if one 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.970
 comes here is to add and if the technician 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.350
 He chose me and for something I think that 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.650
 when when I have the chance and can 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.750
 demonstrate what I can 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.340
 his father 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:06.390
 and I think we're going to give a good one 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.920
 good image engagements 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.750
 that I would have fixed it that way 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.450
 life had in mind was what 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.370
 I had to do and nothing now 100% 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.750
 concentrated in alliance and the first day 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.020
 in the preseason I will come very 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.310
 well and I hope to be at a good level to 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.750
 the good of the team there are not very good 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.330
 players some competition in all 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.520
 the posts so it's going to be good to be 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.140
 in a good level and the season does not 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.900
 it comes well to everyone presses us and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.739
 always not those mitigating that you have 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.070
 mentioned this also as you 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.660
 they load a little the swollen and the people 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.670
 no and that responsibility we take it 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.440
 we think now that if not 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.690
 we go out learn is not going to be a 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.050
 misfortune is going to be a problem then 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.350
 I think that what's best is not going to come 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.610
 is this forgetting about the past, not thinking 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.590
 a lot in the future day by day 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.600
 training training continues in 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.910
 Uruguay is a very strong football and it has 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:06.080
 touched play against 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:11.150
 big by bullendo of stature 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.780
 I will not say I can not play the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:19.420
 football I think every time I enter the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.420
 court I will give the maximum 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.400
 strong is a very strong provider that 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:37.580
 I think I 'm making the most of it 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:40.010
 and importance is still being prepared 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.209
 if you have to go to the court and demonstrate 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.810
 the first thing but because of what if in 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.600
 love I only know for years is 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.959
 fellow friend be happy that you are 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.970
 back here and I think it comes very 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.960
 well he did not play very well he's playing very 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.080
 well he is a very good player 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.510
 in the house up to two minors here there is no 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.150
 time to think about oneself if there is no 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.410
 to start now in partnership and not do 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.410
 force so that for changes
