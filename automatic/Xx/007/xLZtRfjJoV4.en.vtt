the same sound anyway so now you learn
in<00:05:30.900> two<00:05:31.020> hammers<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:32.370> slides<00:05:32.700> and<00:05:33.150> pull-offs

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
in two hammers the slides and pull-offs

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.400 
in two hammers the slides and pull-offs
now<00:05:34.800> you<00:05:34.860> need<00:05:35.130> to<00:05:35.220> practice<00:05:35.640> things<00:05:35.910> I<00:05:36.210> know
