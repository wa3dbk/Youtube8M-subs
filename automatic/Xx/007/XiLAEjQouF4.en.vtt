year<00:00:28.900> in<00:00:28.990> the<00:00:29.020> playoffs<00:00:29.200> the<00:00:29.590> Seahawks<00:00:30.039> may

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
year in the playoffs the Seahawks may

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.100 
year in the playoffs the Seahawks may
have<00:00:30.610> knocked<00:00:30.789> him<00:00:30.970> down<00:00:31.060> a<00:00:31.270> peg<00:00:31.420> or<00:00:31.720> two<00:00:31.780> but

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
have knocked him down a peg or two but

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.209 
have knocked him down a peg or two but
obviously<00:00:32.439> considered<00:00:32.860> one<00:00:32.949> of<00:00:32.980> the<00:00:33.070> more

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
obviously considered one of the more

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.920 
obviously considered one of the more
brilliant<00:00:33.789> offensive<00:00:34.300> minds<00:00:34.480> in<00:00:34.690> the<00:00:34.750> game

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
brilliant offensive minds in the game

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.960 
brilliant offensive minds in the game
and<00:00:35.440> numbers<00:00:35.739> three<00:00:36.100> and<00:00:36.130> two<00:00:36.460> we<00:00:36.610> have<00:00:36.730> last

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
and numbers three and two we have last

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.490 
and numbers three and two we have last
year's<00:00:37.210> Super<00:00:37.390> Bowl<00:00:37.450> teams<00:00:37.780> Mike<00:00:38.020> McCarthy

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
year's Super Bowl teams Mike McCarthy

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.229 
year's Super Bowl teams Mike McCarthy
with<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:38.710> Packers<00:00:39.070> and<00:00:39.250> Mike<00:00:39.670> Tomlin<00:00:40.149> with

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
with the Packers and Mike Tomlin with

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.060 
with the Packers and Mike Tomlin with
the<00:00:40.329> Steelers<00:00:40.630> I<00:00:41.050> think<00:00:41.320> Tomlin<00:00:41.710> gets<00:00:41.920> the

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
the Steelers I think Tomlin gets the

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.920 
the Steelers I think Tomlin gets the
edge<00:00:42.160> because<00:00:42.430> now<00:00:42.579> bendis<00:00:42.940> two<00:00:43.300> Super<00:00:43.720> Bowls

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
edge because now bendis two Super Bowls

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.630 
edge because now bendis two Super Bowls
but<00:00:44.079> can<00:00:44.890> we<00:00:44.950> make<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.250> argument<00:00:45.399> that

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
but can we make the argument that

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.310 
but can we make the argument that
McCarthy's<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.210> better<00:00:46.329> coach<00:00:46.570> yeah

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
McCarthy's the better coach yeah

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.139 
McCarthy's the better coach yeah
McCarthy<00:00:47.860> kind<00:00:48.070> of<00:00:48.130> had<00:00:48.220> that<00:00:48.250> knock<00:00:48.640> on<00:00:48.670> him

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
McCarthy kind of had that knock on him

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.819 
McCarthy kind of had that knock on him
that<00:00:49.510> he<00:00:49.600> couldn't<00:00:49.809> win<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.079> big<00:00:50.230> game<00:00:50.410> until

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
that he couldn't win the big game until

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.080 
that he couldn't win the big game until
last<00:00:50.980> year<00:00:51.130> and<00:00:51.280> then<00:00:51.370> he<00:00:51.460> won<00:00:51.579> everything

bulked<00:03:08.010> up<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.310> list<00:03:08.520> I<00:03:08.760> know<00:03:08.970> went<00:03:09.570> from<00:03:09.690> one

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
bulked up the list I know went from one

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.600 
bulked up the list I know went from one
of<00:03:10.020> 15<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.620> almost<00:03:11.010> on<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.190> verge<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.520> the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
of 15 to the almost on the verge of the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.980 
of 15 to the almost on the verge of the
playoffs<00:03:11.940> last<00:03:12.150> year<00:03:12.450> you'd<00:03:12.600> have<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.810> think

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
playoffs last year you'd have to think

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.180 
playoffs last year you'd have to think
he<00:03:13.110> could<00:03:13.260> be<00:03:13.290> bumped<00:03:13.650> up<00:03:13.710> on<00:03:13.890> next<00:03:14.130> year's

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
he could be bumped up on next year's

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.590 
he could be bumped up on next year's
yeah<00:03:14.490> you<00:03:14.550> certainly<00:03:14.730> think<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.090> last<00:03:15.360> year<00:03:15.480> at

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
yeah you certainly think so last year at

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
yeah you certainly think so last year at
this<00:03:15.690> time<00:03:15.870> we<00:03:16.050> probably<00:03:16.230> would've<00:03:16.470> been<00:03:16.560> at

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
this time we probably would've been at

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.230 
this time we probably would've been at
the<00:03:16.710> very<00:03:16.860> bottom<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.310> our<00:03:17.460> list<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.940> mean<00:03:18.090> he

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
the very bottom of our list I mean he

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.760 
the very bottom of our list I mean he
was<00:03:18.690> questioned<00:03:19.080> whether<00:03:19.200> he<00:03:19.290> was<00:03:19.470> even<00:03:19.680> going

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
was questioned whether he was even going

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.560 
was questioned whether he was even going
to<00:03:19.830> make<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.100> through<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.370> season<00:03:20.790> next<00:03:21.450> thing

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
to make it through the season next thing

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.880 
to make it through the season next thing

scheme that he runs there at 24 I could

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.620
