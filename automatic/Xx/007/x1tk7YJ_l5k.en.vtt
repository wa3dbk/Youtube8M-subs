00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.520
 Childhood together gives us carefree and dreamy 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.180
 How many days do you spend with the sharing 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.920
 The moments quietly released the dream to heaven 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.020
 I remember how many sad memories I had with me. 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.340
 Fairy childhood knows how to laugh 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.180
 How much sadness you and I have 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.020
 Sweet beloved ones like it is still somewhere 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.160
 Memories, please keep in your heart. 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.260
 Each page with that familiar handwriting 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.240
 With dreams, children have many dreams 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.660
 The row of long phoenix trees in the yard where we carved a heart 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.780
 Why now when far away from each other the tree is so sad. 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.840
 Time if you have a glimpse of the past 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.020
 Remember to message your friends and keep on smiling 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.740
 Leave it tomorrow when the heart hears far away or remembers a dream 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.460
 Dream of innocence, age of students. 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.840
 (A little chatter) 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.320
 (Thanks to Ms Khanh Vy for coming back to this video) 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.200
 (I hope you can finish watching it and won't tell me to steal any copyright because I haven't asked you before, sorry) 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.820
 (Through the song, I hope everyone will support and feel his voice) 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.920
 (This is my first time listening to him sing, after hearing that I really like and admire this voice) 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.260
 (Although I have some misunderstandings and incidents with him, I hope he will ignore all misunderstandings after he finish watching) 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.480
 (Suffering enough then invite everyone to continue listening to this song ^^) 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.040
 (Thank you everyone for your interest) 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.160
 Childhood together gives us carefree and dreamy 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.020
 How many days do you spend with the sharing 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.520
 The moments quietly released the dream to heaven 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.500
 I remember how many sad memories I had with me 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.820
 Childhood wonder how happy and sad (wrong original words) 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.720
 How much sadness you and I have 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.460
 Sweet beloved ones like it is still somewhere 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.620
 Memories, please keep in your heart. 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.700
 Each page with that familiar handwriting 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.820
 With dreams, children have many dreams 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.140
 The row of long phoenix trees in the yard where we carved a heart 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.760
 Why now when far away from each other the tree is so sad
