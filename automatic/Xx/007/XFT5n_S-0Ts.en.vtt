00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.490 
come back and do the exact same thing
and<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> second<00:01:38.400> loop<00:01:38.579> kind<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:40.229> that

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and do a second loop kind of like that

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.469 
and do a second loop kind of like that
you<00:01:41.220> see<00:01:41.400> why<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.549> call<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.060> Mickey<00:01:42.240> Mouse

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
you see why I call it the Mickey Mouse

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.960 
you see why I call it the Mickey Mouse
not<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:43.110> bit<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:44.070> at<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.369> point<00:01:44.700> I'm

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
not a little bit so at this point I'm

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.060 
not a little bit so at this point I'm
gonna<00:01:45.090> say<00:01:45.329> take<00:01:45.630> Mickey's<00:01:46.079> left<00:01:46.470> ear<00:01:46.770> which

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
gonna say take Mickey's left ear which

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.620 
gonna say take Mickey's left ear which
is<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:47.790> here<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.060> my<00:01:48.180> right<00:01:48.390> hand

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
is this one right here in my right hand

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.469 
is this one right here in my right hand
stick<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.680> through<00:01:49.710> his<00:01:50.040> right<00:01:50.369> ear<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.850> then

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
stick it through his right ear and then

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.109 
stick it through his right ear and then
take<00:01:51.750> his<00:01:51.930> tail<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.560> stick<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.759> through

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
take his tail and stick it in through

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.420 
take his tail and stick it in through
the<00:01:55.130> ear<00:01:56.270> that<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.329> stuck<00:01:57.750> through<00:01:58.070> his<00:01:59.070> right

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
the ear that you stuck through his right

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.709 
the ear that you stuck through his right
ear<00:01:59.460> does<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.119> make<00:02:00.270> sense

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
ear does that make sense

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.830 
ear does that make sense
hope<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.290> then<00:02:02.040> take<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.520> hold<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.240> bait<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
hope so then take and hold the bait and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.429 
hope so then take and hold the bait and
the<00:02:04.439> tag<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.790> same<00:02:06.000> hand<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.600> pull<00:02:07.229> up

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
the tag in in the same hand and pull up

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.940 
the tag in in the same hand and pull up
on<00:02:07.649> your<00:02:07.680> running<00:02:08.009> line<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.959> that<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.619> what<00:02:10.920> I

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
on your running line and that is what I

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.870 
on your running line and that is what I
mean<00:02:11.190> by<00:02:11.340> having<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> tag<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.209> stick<00:02:12.629> them

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
mean by having the tag in stick them

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.610 
mean by having the tag in stick them
towards<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.360> bait<00:02:13.540> something<00:02:14.260> like<00:02:14.380> that

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
towards the bait something like that

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.410 
towards the bait something like that
they<00:02:15.400> pulling<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.790> through<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:15.970> water<00:02:16.210> this

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
they pulling it through the water this

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.210 
they pulling it through the water this
way<00:02:16.630> any<00:02:16.990> debris<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.380> happens<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:17.980> get<00:02:18.070> on

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
way any debris that happens to get on

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.910 
way any debris that happens to get on
this<00:02:18.370> line<00:02:18.580> is<00:02:18.940> gonna<00:02:19.570> hopefully<00:02:19.870> not<00:02:20.740> get

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
this line is gonna hopefully not get

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.470 
this line is gonna hopefully not get
caught<00:02:21.130> up<00:02:21.160> on<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.550> tag<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:22.000> since<00:02:22.300> its

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
caught up on that tag in since its

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.630 
caught up on that tag in since its
pointed<00:02:22.750> backwards<00:02:22.930> now<00:02:23.770> what<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.010> loop<00:02:24.400> not

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
pointed backwards now what that loop not

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.760 
pointed backwards now what that loop not
enables<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.420> bait<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.840> do<00:02:25.990> if<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.380> see<00:02:26.590> me

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
enables the bait to do if you see me

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.730 
enables the bait to do if you see me
moving<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.850> line<00:02:28.060> like<00:02:28.330> this<00:02:28.570> that<00:02:29.380> loop

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
moving the line like this that loop

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.910 
moving the line like this that loop
doesn't<00:02:30.610> constrict<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.570> bait<00:02:31.780> in<00:02:32.710> other

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
doesn't constrict the bait in other

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.710 
doesn't constrict the bait in other
words<00:02:33.160> what<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.520> does<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:34.030> lets<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.480> bait

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
words what it does it lets that bait

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.260 
words what it does it lets that bait
hang<00:02:35.080> free<00:02:35.530> on<00:02:35.800> that<00:02:36.190> loop<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:36.760> when<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.060> take

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
hang free on that loop so when you take

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.440 
hang free on that loop so when you take
your<00:02:37.480> rod<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:38.020> twitch<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:39.010> kind<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.820> finessing

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
your rod and twitch it kind of finessing

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.970 
your rod and twitch it kind of finessing
that<00:02:40.600> bait<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.870> little<00:02:41.170> bit<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.470> make<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.770> look

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
that bait a little bit to make it look

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.660 
that bait a little bit to make it look
real<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.120> gonna<00:02:43.510> look<00:02:43.600> more<00:02:44.380> real<00:02:44.680> swimming

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
real it is gonna look more real swimming

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.840 
real it is gonna look more real swimming
free<00:02:46.090> like<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:46.750> rather<00:02:47.410> than<00:02:47.560> pin<00:02:47.980> down<00:02:48.250> to

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
free like this rather than pin down to

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.150 
free like this rather than pin down to
where<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.270> would<00:02:49.360> look<00:02:49.540> unnatural<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.770> that's

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
where it would look unnatural so that's

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.240 
where it would look unnatural so that's
basically<00:02:51.610> why<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.480> use<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:52.690> loop<00:02:52.900> knot

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
basically why I like to use a loop knot

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.680 
basically why I like to use a loop knot
and<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.310> can<00:02:54.400> get<00:02:54.550> out<00:02:54.730> get<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.300> some<00:02:55.450> lazer

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
and you can get out get you some lazer

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.930 
and you can get out get you some lazer
sharp<00:02:55.960> hooks<00:02:56.290> some<00:02:56.740> soft<00:02:56.980> plastics<00:02:57.460> and<00:02:57.850> go

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
sharp hooks some soft plastics and go

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.570 
sharp hooks some soft plastics and go
catch<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.210> some<00:02:58.360> fish
