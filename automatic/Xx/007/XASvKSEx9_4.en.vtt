00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:03.739
 Volkswagen has almost silent mails the US has 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.949
 with his new nose bass director general in one of the brands 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.789
 it looks a lot like the wave 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.789
 of that group of soccer players after ten years the Italian version 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.449
 that volkswagen is a place for these emails alongside the golf cabrio it proves 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.449
 freshen up 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.060
 that construction 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.000
 is unchanged 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.240
 That means that you can go a lot further open business day or alone 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.760
 both stood there 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.210
 they are cards that open up the misery for the 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.940
 currently its kind of like the earth 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.850
 the advantage is 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.819
 that you just stay open with the trunk full of stuff 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:53.080
 after all, that is no longer necessary 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.250
 for the renewed eos 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.090
 Volkswagen has the second generous in its forties this engine available and two 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.160
 liters of diesel 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.120
 in this 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.770
 and tweets this engine with the entire team pk is the topper of the series 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.850
 and this kind of e-mails 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.300
 largely corresponds to that of the wave 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.600
 there are differences but they are small 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.490
 for example, the designers came up with many other ventilation grilles 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.310
 English 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.310
 find the sport about education already in the scirocco 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.920
 with this engine israel says the boy 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.510
 from zero to one hundred it just over seven countries seconds 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.310
 it has to be possible 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.820
 he followed still ran in up to two lands six 30 miles per hour with this one 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.760
 at least dsg bake 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.230
 and keeping him also the switching moments of this tank the dead sea 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.810
 making studies that are so short that you keep getting the gas 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.490
 to kick in 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.410
 if you just join in with the traffic it's a different story 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.770
 but then the gear shifts as quickly as possible by the highest gear and 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.400
 Yes 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.400
 exterminate the other and went on a bit 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.140
 visit the strong motor lesotho doing great that it is quite a bit 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.230
 weight are on the way and you feel it when you bend into it and all of it 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.270
 weight must be one side 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.780
 and then you also notice the chassis is much tuned to could continue that is 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.780
 just a little bit of sportiness but no more than that 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.420
 the driving characteristics of these parents can be summarized as a solid one 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.939
 only when you open the roof do you notice that the disclosure does the judgment begin 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.539
 and then you also notice what the roof contributes to the stiffness of the hand 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:36.019
 Google remains prepared beautifully touch freedom 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.129
 volkswagen has refreshed very tight 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.030
 so here can continue for a while next to the golf cabrio coming in August 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.059
 and for which it has observed on earth for ten years 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.569
 both cars should, in theory, easily coexist 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.199
 after all, a class higher operates 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:54.519
 but in practice we think the English waves into each other's 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.239
 water can sit 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.529
 so it can also be seen how long a new outfit can continue to exist 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:01.839
 next to new golf cabrio
