00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:04.259
 hard work for tv is made possible by van cz 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.040
 and her sister 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.739
 baker did not, however, we discuss all rumors about this new one later 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:20.409
 book about processors 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:24.499
 We start with videos and new video card that prescriptions is the five 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:28.859
 has been 3 my regard his spanish colleague franc has observed term 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.229
 good to start is that they have names like the fir on the previous zealand he 

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.839
 speaks of following the first four 50 GT after me of course 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:40.319
 a lot less exciting crevits 5 5 3 yes and that has our work but the past 

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:44.889
 days to make me believe that I should be more than the pvv and sp ts 

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:46.120
 it also become a bit 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.780
 with these budgets more respectable and I don't even have enough for budget 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.490
 finds a brain scan attractive 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.700
 and now the successor to the gtst is a moderately named mountain grit eriksen a bit 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.020
 strange with nice we have nice heath what he is going on 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.350
 is that is all that works with all those things 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.090
 five hundred indicated that I have seen again is that they are actually the 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.410
 existing chip 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.840
 that is what optimizations have been released, which means that power consumption is somewhat lower 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.170
 so that you simply get a little faster on the clock frequency fields 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.980
 that would first be at the 85 compared to the 84 we saw that at the 5 6 3 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.060
 compared to the four zeist etc 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.210
 and now also not about the chip that is on that site ix55 that is this series a 116 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.100
 and that is so and more or less that the gf106 chip that we know from the gts 4 5 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.970
 is after his interrogation and formatting for his team also lived on this 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.119
 and a sixth time of the next one doing yes and no 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.959
 marketing persons offer their name makes no sense yes I mean I have too 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.049
 the feeling that the markets say people might have more 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.520
 done over the engineers from front marketing person who says that at all 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.680
 to consider all transistors thinking 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.870
 and where possible the Zuiderzee made ao course where needed speed she can best if 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.060
 after all, that was all against aircraft manufacturers, a huge amount 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.370
 plastic gentleman i think we are almost impossible but a pair of shoes 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.370
 geniality the goal post number of cobo transistors 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.429
 This ship are heading that the title that nobody knows the production process 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:18.299
 from tsmc so the factory in thailand were through making it 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.869
 deficit keeps getting better 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:24.119
 so it can be a good thing that a new strike for the new division 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:26.139
 of the ship is indeed the more economical 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:31.299
 and there simply on the call for a higher clock frequency climate policy 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.050
 the bacterium heerema 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.150
 how negotiations will be even less exciting just through martin 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.050
 I think your resignation if you look at the program will increase compared to 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.330
 quite rightly opposed all those with 57 to 70 when they were on shana to celebrate with 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.199
 the theater 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:51.269
 yes but intended this provides this is booked weapon stations in the waterfall road and and 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.299
 a step lower than that that does not sit x5 16 in terms of price also you have to 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.079
 remember that I sit five sessions that you get into this ship with the sewer 84 fever 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.629
 this has the 102nd not to sit in between the deliberations in terms of performance 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.499
 isidoor half 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:09.679
 and now it is officially a bit relative to who had the share 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:13.370
 in Zevenbergen safety katie hoff then it must be said that more than one 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:17.259
 years on the market is just like about five hundred lawsuits in it 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:18.539
 goals 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:22.309
 all these books about the 6 series all in say not yet in the budget segment 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:24.739
 the ces nautical charts bring together a little higher 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.150
 that is but there is still no such thing as he to his heel 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.830
 Innoconcepts does have a job driving them around in the pond 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.189
 cheap or expensive restaurant but at the stops it's the beginning of time 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:36.799
 using kate 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.629
 to the 68 signed 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.779
 And they still stand apart from each other which is a fictional fact that everything with price too 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:44.709
 make that hit x 5 25 days against 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.509
 The people start at around 130 140 euros 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.559
 and but as one is that most manufacturers and the buy directly before 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:55.589
 choose to market the overclocked versions but you still want one 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:57.239
 bit of discussing 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.259
 from jeffrey compete colleagues that she also amply succeeded in this ek 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:02.859
 if you like that you read cards against 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.259
 side by side then there is already a huge difference so yes we can have it here after 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:09.289
 emission that with the citroÃ«n driver 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:14.639
 and the asus with the management in the pool after both primordial still also cards and there 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.639
 his games both legs and mission is mainly wua 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:24.270
 that would be a departure to what is higher than the basic model the oldies put 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.360
 mainly 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.580
 happens to no longer check this 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.580
 and 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.620
 And the ones on the menu are great for a golf course that you have to overclock 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.630
 a bit of thinking that that is standard it is to move under 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.050
 megahertz have a bit of a busy time dealing with contacts 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.270
 car to sink over 1000 meters 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.020
 and we must be cards that would be more expensive than usual 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.249
 shared hd7 five disciplines will start watching Baudouin black 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:55.289
 both were injured the random one behind each other here stood little ones 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.309
 highest 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:57.559
 the typical 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:02.349
 the flight game is a bit older here that safety is 10 not much slower than 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.050
 the 57 7000 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.610
 bit in industry this king i see just one that had a good deal faster 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.779
 n57 a commitment at 1,000 acts 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.079
 the new video card car share 43 shirt 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:21.709
 in a barred road already a son is there who sits there is 25,000 people 

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:24.709
 gradually many more goals to point to it should not be allowed 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:30.169
 I have picked the subway party again 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:31.539
 20 is 33 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.620
 the fnv thereby will be faster with wind and the us compared to twente 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.920
 But it's just an example if you like your if you have all the home markets 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.099
 Belgium runs on one heap of throws 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.270
 and with and that evides now approx 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.349
 8 is roughly 5 percent faster than the ga de jong 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.900
 harry 7 5 6 7 vista is more than 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.659
 often 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.479
 he is a little more than 5 percent more expensive so say it is it then 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.669
 that of the young young which has deposited for a great price 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.689
 performance ratio and shares had to worry about 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:04.919
 very quick follow up of the n57 7 on the market, he can still 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.980
 sit quietly for a while and 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.420
 157 7 percent yes, and there too, the chip red cabbage made good time 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.730
 production costs 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.050
 mother nature increasingly often because that goal that that production process of it 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.020
 always better 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.520
 I can even imagine it ad the shares if it is like it should those prices 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.210
 talking about work from izegem might turn into something strange 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:33.279
 well then finally the two cards of asus mr music scene give themselves to them 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:37.839
 have just bought nothing more about clocked energy that just pits against it 

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:38.960
 Egypt 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.069
 it's a performance i'm fed up with the locks both houses rotation 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.069
 There must have been an upside united in the US 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:50.939
 What is striking is that both drivers are actually almost silent guys 

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:52.449
 almost nothing but that one 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:57.090
 of energy contracts much better according to our measurements center I am going to 4 5 difference 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.990
 between for users as almost 10 degrees 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.800
 it was for that matter I did say that 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.560
 the energy that of these 2 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.419
 the better choices
