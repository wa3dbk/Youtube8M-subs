see<00:01:02.629> so<00:01:03.629> right<00:01:03.809> now<00:01:04.070> it's<00:01:05.070> really<00:01:05.400> useful

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
see so right now it's really useful

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.310 
see so right now it's really useful
since<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.119> don't<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> Raygun<00:01:06.750> crap<00:01:07.140> and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
since you don't have the Raygun crap and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.480 
since you don't have the Raygun crap and
everybody<00:01:07.619> doesn't<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> lot<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.100> ammo<00:01:08.340> so

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
everybody doesn't have a lot of ammo so

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.770 
everybody doesn't have a lot of ammo so
you<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.090> keep<00:01:09.150> doing<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.420> over<00:01:09.659> and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
you can just keep doing this over and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.760 
you can just keep doing this over and
over<00:01:09.930> again<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:12.170> another<00:01:13.170> useful<00:01:13.350> thing<00:01:13.590> this

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
over again and another useful thing this

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.730 
over again and another useful thing this
could<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:15.180> could<00:01:15.390> set<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.560> could

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
could be is that you could set you could

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010 
could be is that you could set you could
out<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.130> thousand<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.880> make<00:01:18.030> Leroy<00:01:18.450> change<00:01:18.780> it

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
out a thousand and make Leroy change it

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.960 
out a thousand and make Leroy change it
and<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.439> could<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.710> nuke<00:01:20.009> or<00:01:20.220> insta-kill<00:01:20.759> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
and it could be a nuke or insta-kill and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.850 
and it could be a nuke or insta-kill and
you<00:01:21.479> could<00:01:21.630> kill<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> last<00:01:22.049> crawler<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.650> wait

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
you could kill the last crawler and wait

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.590 
you could kill the last crawler and wait
to<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> next<00:01:23.490> round<00:01:23.670> start<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> can

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
to the next round start so then you can

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.390 
to the next round start so then you can
pick<00:01:24.780> up<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> nuke<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> insecure<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
pick up the nuke or the insecure so you

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.590 
pick up the nuke or the insecure so you
can<00:01:26.520> get<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> head<00:01:26.820> start<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> next<00:01:27.390> route

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
can get a head start in the next route

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.480 
can get a head start in the next route
that<00:01:28.409> would<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.680> pretty<00:01:28.829> useful<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> high
