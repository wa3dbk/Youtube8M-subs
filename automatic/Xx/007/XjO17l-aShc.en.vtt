continue to make gang

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.350 
continue to make gang
so<00:02:36.140> obviously<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.400> two<00:02:37.610> new<00:02:37.819> credit<00:02:38.060> games

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
so obviously the two new credit games

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.050 
so obviously the two new credit games
are<00:02:38.540> going<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:38.690> come<00:02:38.870> out<00:02:39.050> this<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:40.670> summer

people working at the studio so they're

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.000 
people working at the studio so they're
not<00:03:04.069> gonna<00:03:04.310> have<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.849> big<00:03:05.540> of<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:06.080> budget<00:03:06.830> or

I'm you know sort of a market because
you<00:03:12.080> know<00:03:12.200> we<00:03:12.319> are<00:03:12.350> here<00:03:12.500> in<00:03:12.830> Australia<00:03:13.310> and

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
you know we are here in Australia and

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.199 
you know we are here in Australia and
they<00:03:13.519> are<00:03:13.670> melbourne-based<00:03:14.450> developers<00:03:15.260> so

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
they are melbourne-based developers so

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.590 
they are melbourne-based developers so
if<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:18.140> know<00:03:18.549> people<00:03:19.549> were<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.970> go<00:03:20.120> into<00:03:20.330> the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
if you know people were to go into the

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.979 
if you know people were to go into the
video<00:03:20.750> game<00:03:21.080> industry<00:03:21.340> like<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.549> was<00:03:22.989> probably

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
video game industry like I was probably

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.250 
video game industry like I was probably
thinking<00:03:24.319> about<00:03:25.220> going<00:03:25.459> into<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.390> some<00:03:27.049> sort

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
thinking about going into and some sort

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.759 
thinking about going into and some sort
of<00:03:27.730> programming<00:03:28.730> once<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.569> go<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.049> university

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
of programming once I go to university

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.910 
of programming once I go to university
however<00:03:31.870> that's<00:03:32.870> probably<00:03:33.350> not<00:03:33.620> what<00:03:33.680> I'm

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
however that's probably not what I'm

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.070 
however that's probably not what I'm
gonna<00:03:34.040> be<00:03:34.220> doing<00:03:34.519> anymore<00:03:35.120> because<00:03:35.480> of<00:03:35.989> the

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
gonna be doing anymore because of the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.470 
gonna be doing anymore because of the
fact<00:03:36.290> that<00:03:36.380> there<00:03:36.590> is<00:03:36.620> such<00:03:36.980> little<00:03:37.790> industry

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
fact that there is such little industry

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.979 
fact that there is such little industry
for<00:03:38.870> video<00:03:39.859> games<00:03:39.920> in<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:41.150> know<00:03:41.239> Australia

for video games in you know Australia
and<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.920> might<00:03:43.459> go<00:03:43.640> into<00:03:43.790> software<00:03:44.209> or

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
and I might go into software or

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.490 
and I might go into software or
something<00:03:44.780> but<00:03:46.209> what<00:03:47.209> I'm<00:03:47.480> more<00:03:47.959> concerned

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
something but what I'm more concerned

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.610 
something but what I'm more concerned
about<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.480> how<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.540> company's<00:03:51.140> gonna<00:03:51.290> be<00:03:51.500> able

then<00:04:55.409> you<00:04:55.529> stand<00:04:55.949> up<00:04:56.069> all<00:04:56.249> your<00:04:56.339> little

then you stand up all your little
cricket<00:04:56.819> people<00:04:57.119> and<00:04:57.419> then<00:04:58.020> you'd<00:04:58.110> like<00:04:58.259> roll

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:58.529 
cricket people and then you'd like roll

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:02.719 
cricket people and then you'd like roll
the<00:04:58.949> ball<00:04:59.569> down<00:05:00.680> this<00:05:01.680> big<00:05:01.889> line<00:05:02.189> and<00:05:02.610> then

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
the ball down this big line and then

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.459 
the ball down this big line and then
you'd<00:05:02.939> use<00:05:03.119> the<00:05:03.270> best<00:05:03.539> friend<00:05:03.749> is<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.229> be<00:05:04.259> like

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:04.469 
you'd use the best friend is to be like

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:05.719 
you'd use the best friend is to be like
a<00:05:04.499> little<00:05:04.740> trigger<00:05:05.009> thing<00:05:05.189> to<00:05:05.279> hit<00:05:05.399> it<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.580> don't

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
a little trigger thing to hit it I don't

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.760 
a little trigger thing to hit it I don't
know<00:05:05.789> I<00:05:06.059> can't<00:05:06.749> quite<00:05:06.960> remember<00:05:07.289> what<00:05:07.619> it's

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
know I can't quite remember what it's

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.559 
know I can't quite remember what it's
called<00:05:07.830> but<00:05:08.069> it<00:05:08.189> was<00:05:08.279> like<00:05:08.430> this<00:05:08.969> little<00:05:09.180> real

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 
called but it was like this little real

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:11.929 
called but it was like this little real
like<00:05:09.809> life<00:05:10.469> cricket<00:05:10.919> simulation<00:05:11.669> that<00:05:11.819> you

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:11.939 
like life cricket simulation that you

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:13.369 
like life cricket simulation that you
could<00:05:12.089> set<00:05:12.240> up<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:12.479> it<00:05:12.539> was<00:05:12.599> basically<00:05:13.169> a

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:13.379 
could set up and it was basically a

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.489 
could set up and it was basically a
board<00:05:13.649> game<00:05:14.149> type<00:05:15.149> of<00:05:15.330> thing<00:05:15.539> except<00:05:16.319> it<00:05:16.409> was

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:16.499 
board game type of thing except it was

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:18.469 
board game type of thing except it was
played<00:05:16.649> on<00:05:16.680> like<00:05:16.949> a<00:05:16.979> little<00:05:17.189> green<00:05:17.550> mat<00:05:17.819> so

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
played on like a little green mat so

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.209 
played on like a little green mat so
tabletop<00:05:19.110> crickets<00:05:19.439> very<00:05:19.589> similar<00:05:19.979> to<00:05:20.099> that

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
tabletop crickets very similar to that

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.730 
tabletop crickets very similar to that
in<00:05:21.059> the<00:05:21.270> fact<00:05:22.080> that<00:05:22.169> you<00:05:22.349> plant<00:05:22.620> your

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
in the fact that you plant your

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.379 
in the fact that you plant your
fielder's<00:05:23.159> around<00:05:23.520> everywhere<00:05:23.969> and<00:05:24.240> if<00:05:24.300> it

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
fielder's around everywhere and if it

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.540 
fielder's around everywhere and if it
lands<00:05:24.599> in<00:05:24.779> between<00:05:25.110> their<00:05:25.289> legs<00:05:25.319> you<00:05:26.219> get<00:05:26.399> the

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
lands in between their legs you get the

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.499 
lands in between their legs you get the
catch<00:05:26.729> and<00:05:26.909> they're<00:05:27.029> out<00:05:27.210> um<00:05:27.509> and<00:05:29.360> that<00:05:30.360> is

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
catch and they're out um and that is

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.119 
catch and they're out um and that is
going<00:05:30.749> to<00:05:30.809> be<00:05:30.899> tabletop<00:05:31.499> cricket<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:31.979> other

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:32.129 
going to be tabletop cricket the other

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.299 
going to be tabletop cricket the other
crew<00:05:32.370> game<00:05:32.610> is<00:05:32.789> gonna<00:05:32.909> be<00:05:33.289> probably<00:05:34.309> very

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:35.309 
crew game is gonna be probably very

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:39.230 
crew game is gonna be probably very
similar<00:05:35.430> looking<00:05:36.270> to<00:05:37.279> Ricky<00:05:38.279> Ponting<00:05:38.729> cricket

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
similar looking to Ricky Ponting cricket

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.649 
similar looking to Ricky Ponting cricket
games<00:05:40.129> because<00:05:41.129> really<00:05:41.999> they've<00:05:42.300> been<00:05:42.569> the

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
games because really they've been the

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.949 
games because really they've been the
only<00:05:43.129> cricket<00:05:44.129> games<00:05:44.309> that<00:05:44.490> have<00:05:44.729> done<00:05:45.629> well<00:05:45.930> I

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:45.959 
only cricket games that have done well I

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:49.279 
only cricket games that have done well I
mean<00:05:46.409> they're<00:05:46.709> the<00:05:47.039> last<00:05:47.839> cricket<00:05:48.839> game<00:05:49.020> other

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
mean they're the last cricket game other

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.649 
mean they're the last cricket game other
than<00:05:49.439> that<00:05:49.740> was<00:05:51.529> what's<00:05:52.529> called<00:05:52.620> EA<00:05:52.979> cricket

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
than that was what's called EA cricket

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.199 
than that was what's called EA cricket
2007<00:05:54.659> and<00:05:55.279> I've<00:05:56.279> been<00:05:56.550> playing<00:05:56.789> that<00:05:56.909> over<00:05:57.120> the

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:57.209 
2007 and I've been playing that over the

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:59.589 
2007 and I've been playing that over the
past<00:05:57.240> few<00:05:57.539> days<00:05:57.659> i'm<00:05:57.839> pretty<00:05:58.050> sure<00:05:58.229> that<00:05:58.379> it<00:05:58.499> so

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599 
past few days i'm pretty sure that it so

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.989 
past few days i'm pretty sure that it so
anyway<00:06:00.649> now<00:06:01.649> there's<00:06:02.009> gonna<00:06:02.099> be<00:06:02.279> more<00:06:02.459> cricket

00:06:02.989 --> 00:06:02.999 
anyway now there's gonna be more cricket

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:06.379 
anyway now there's gonna be more cricket
games<00:06:03.300> coming<00:06:03.809> out<00:06:04.019> next<00:06:04.319> year<00:06:04.789> probably<00:06:05.789> not

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
games coming out next year probably not

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.269 
games coming out next year probably not
an<00:06:06.539> AFL<00:06:07.019> game<00:06:07.289> because<00:06:07.589> they<00:06:07.740> haven't<00:06:07.979> said

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:08.279 
an AFL game because they haven't said

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:09.980 
an AFL game because they haven't said
anything<00:06:08.550> to<00:06:08.789> do<00:06:08.939> with<00:06:09.089> that<00:06:09.240> so<00:06:09.479> I<00:06:09.509> would

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
anything to do with that so I would

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.320 
anything to do with that so I would
expect<00:06:10.529> a<00:06:12.229> update<00:06:13.229> roster<00:06:13.740> update<00:06:14.330> probably

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
expect a update roster update probably

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.449 
expect a update roster update probably
to<00:06:15.449> come<00:06:15.719> in<00:06:15.990> around<00:06:16.499> about<00:06:16.939> June<00:06:17.939> or<00:06:18.269> July

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:19.459 
to come in around about June or July

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:25.459 
to come in around about June or July
next<00:06:20.459> year<00:06:20.909> in<00:06:21.180> regards<00:06:22.110> to<00:06:23.719> AFL<00:06:24.719> games<00:06:25.110> and

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:25.469 
next year in regards to AFL games and

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:29.029 
next year in regards to AFL games and
then<00:06:26.189> maybe<00:06:26.729> there<00:06:27.509> will<00:06:27.629> be<00:06:27.689> a<00:06:27.930> new<00:06:28.289> AFL<00:06:28.830> game

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
then maybe there will be a new AFL game

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.509
