and<00:01:56.360> one<00:01:57.360> thing<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.630> want<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> say<00:01:57.899> about<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
and one thing I want to say about the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.350 
and one thing I want to say about the
galaxy<00:01:58.590> s4<00:01:58.860> mini<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.880> screen<00:02:00.210> size

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
galaxy s4 mini is that the screen size

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.789 
galaxy s4 mini is that the screen size
4.3<00:02:01.110> inch<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.409> not<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.490> small<00:02:03.439> it's<00:02:04.439> still

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
4.3 inch is not that small it's still

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.289 
4.3 inch is not that small it's still
bigger<00:02:05.040> than<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.310> iphone<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:06.119> i<00:02:06.149> think

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
bigger than the iphone but i think

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.300 
bigger than the iphone but i think
that's<00:02:06.659> what<00:02:06.810> something's<00:02:07.259> really<00:02:07.799> pushing

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
that's what something's really pushing

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.729 
that's what something's really pushing
they're<00:02:08.459> trying<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.239> take<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:10.379> people

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
they're trying to it take the people

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.650 
they're trying to it take the people
that<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:11.039> an<00:02:11.190> iphone<00:02:11.610> give<00:02:12.150> them<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.420> smaller

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
that have an iphone give them a smaller

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.850 
that have an iphone give them a smaller
screen

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
screen

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.660

still<00:02:14.220> reach<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.970> fairly<00:02:15.480> good<00:02:15.720> specs<00:02:16.110> and

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
still reach a fairly good specs and

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.070 
still reach a fairly good specs and
hopefully<00:02:17.670> get<00:02:17.790> them<00:02:18.000> on<00:02:18.300> board<00:02:18.330> with<00:02:18.900> their
