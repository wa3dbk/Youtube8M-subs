today<00:00:07.769> we're<00:00:07.890> going<00:00:07.979> to<00:00:08.069> think<00:00:08.280> together<00:00:08.580> a

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
today we're going to think together a

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.010 
today we're going to think together a
little<00:00:08.940> bit<00:00:09.120> about<00:00:09.299> the<00:00:09.480> decision<00:00:09.630> making

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.020 
little bit about the decision making

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.220 
little bit about the decision making
process<00:00:10.910> usually<00:00:11.910> most<00:00:12.600> people<00:00:12.660> don't<00:00:12.990> break

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
process usually most people don't break

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.650 
process usually most people don't break
down<00:00:13.440> how<00:00:13.830> they<00:00:14.010> make<00:00:14.219> decisions<00:00:14.389> they<00:00:15.389> just

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
down how they make decisions they just

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.870 
down how they make decisions they just
decide<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.320> wanted<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.010> liked<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.609> seemed

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
decide I wanted it I liked it it seemed

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.450 
decide I wanted it I liked it it seemed
good<00:00:17.970> at<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> time<00:00:18.539> but<00:00:19.320> that's<00:00:20.010> one<00:00:20.279> thing

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
good at the time but that's one thing

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.700 
good at the time but that's one thing
for<00:00:20.490> an<00:00:20.699> individual<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:21.810> for<00:00:22.259> someone<00:00:22.470> who's

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
for an individual but for someone who's

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.409 
for an individual but for someone who's
in<00:00:22.830> charge<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.249> a<00:00:23.310> group<00:00:23.339> someone<00:00:24.029> who<00:00:24.119> has<00:00:24.240> to

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
in charge of a group someone who has to

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.960 
in charge of a group someone who has to
help<00:00:24.570> make<00:00:24.900> decisions<00:00:25.019> for<00:00:25.499> a<00:00:25.560> larger<00:00:26.009> body<00:00:26.249> it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
help make decisions for a larger body it

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.399 
help make decisions for a larger body it
doesn't<00:00:27.329> help<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:27.599> them<00:00:27.749> just<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.109> sort<00:00:28.320> of

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:28.409 
doesn't help for them just to sort of

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:29.779 
doesn't help for them just to sort of
shoot<00:00:28.650> from<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.919> hip<00:00:28.949> well<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.279> thought<00:00:29.609> it

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
shoot from the hip well I thought it

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.729 
shoot from the hip well I thought it
sounded<00:00:29.970> best<00:00:30.359> I'm<00:00:30.929> sorry<00:00:31.199> they<00:00:31.380> didn't<00:00:31.589> like

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
sounded best I'm sorry they didn't like

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.410 
sounded best I'm sorry they didn't like
it<00:00:31.769> I'm<00:00:32.070> sorry<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.489> didn't<00:00:32.669> work<00:00:32.730> I'm<00:00:33.060> sorry<00:00:33.239> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
it I'm sorry it didn't work I'm sorry it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.420 
it I'm sorry it didn't work I'm sorry it
wasted<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:33.810> resources<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.500> group<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.250> all

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
wasted the resources of the group so all

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.860 
wasted the resources of the group so all
this<00:00:35.550> would<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.790> very<00:00:35.970> negative<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.690> when

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
this would be very negative so when

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.779 
this would be very negative so when
you're<00:00:37.260> thinking<00:00:37.470> in<00:00:37.649> terms<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:38.129> someone

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789 
you're thinking in terms of someone

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.130 
you're thinking in terms of someone
who's<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.090> charge<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.570> group<00:00:39.600> needing<00:00:40.050> to

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
who's in charge of a group needing to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
who's in charge of a group needing to
make<00:00:40.289> a<00:00:40.320> decision<00:00:40.789> knowing<00:00:41.789> the<00:00:42.000> following

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
make a decision knowing the following

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.810 
make a decision knowing the following
steps<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:42.899> very<00:00:43.260> helpful<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:44.070> when<00:00:44.699> you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
steps can be very helpful so when you

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.099 
steps can be very helpful so when you
make<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.000> decision<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.539> take<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> information

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
make a decision you take the information

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.410 
make a decision you take the information
that's<00:00:46.829> provided<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.850> opinions<00:00:48.300> of

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
that's provided and the opinions of

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.080 
that's provided and the opinions of
others<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.379> evaluate<00:00:50.010> all<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.699> then

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
others you evaluate all of it and then

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.849 
others you evaluate all of it and then
you<00:00:51.179> decide<00:00:51.329> okay<00:00:52.199> that's<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.440> sort<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
you decide okay that's just sort of a

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:54.439 
you decide okay that's just sort of a
basic<00:00:53.039> overview<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.789> we've<00:00:53.940> broken<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.329> down

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
basic overview but we've broken it down

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.090 
basic overview but we've broken it down
into<00:00:54.510> steps<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:55.260> which<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.500> want<00:00:55.679> to<00:00:55.739> go<00:00:55.859> over

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
into steps here which I want to go over

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.040 
into steps here which I want to go over
briefly<00:00:56.519> so<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> decision-making

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
briefly so in the decision-making

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.660 
briefly so in the decision-making
process<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.829> very<00:00:59.039> first<00:00:59.280> thing<00:00:59.429> you<00:00:59.489> need<00:00:59.640> to

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
process the very first thing you need to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.810 
process the very first thing you need to
do<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.089> define<00:01:00.620> define<00:01:01.620> means<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.550> fully

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
do is define define means to fully

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.880 
do is define define means to fully
investigate<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.749> gain<00:01:04.050> an<00:01:04.199> understanding<00:01:04.350> of

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
investigate and gain an understanding of

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.010 
investigate and gain an understanding of
the<00:01:05.100> problem<00:01:05.610> what<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> issue<00:01:06.660> at<00:01:06.990> hand

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the problem what is the issue at hand

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.960 
the problem what is the issue at hand
what<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> problem<00:01:08.160> what<00:01:08.370> needs<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> be

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
what is the problem what needs to be

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.819 
what is the problem what needs to be
solved<00:01:09.450> if<00:01:09.570> we're<00:01:09.990> pushed<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> point<00:01:10.710> of

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
solved if we're pushed to a point of

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.710 
solved if we're pushed to a point of
making<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.280> decision<00:01:11.579> it<00:01:12.180> means<00:01:12.509> that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
making a decision it means that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.780 
making a decision it means that
something<00:01:13.020> has<00:01:13.259> come<00:01:13.500> up<00:01:13.560> there<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.310> an<00:01:14.579> issue

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
something has come up there is an issue

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.910 
something has come up there is an issue
at<00:01:15.090> hand<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.409> stage<00:01:16.680> we're<00:01:16.890> going

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
at hand and so in this stage we're going

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.410 
at hand and so in this stage we're going
to<00:01:17.070> fully<00:01:17.369> investigate<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.090> we're<00:01:18.240> going<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to fully investigate it we're going to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.450 
to fully investigate it we're going to
gather<00:01:18.600> all<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> information<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.920> so

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
gather all the information we can so

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.940 
gather all the information we can so
that<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.790> can<00:01:20.970> clearly<00:01:21.390> define<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.470> problem

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
that we can clearly define the problem

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.370 
that we can clearly define the problem
or<00:01:23.100> clearly<00:01:23.460> define<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.090> issues<00:01:24.689> at<00:01:24.840> hand<00:01:24.869> so

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
or clearly define the issues at hand so

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.980 
or clearly define the issues at hand so
you<00:01:25.799> begin<00:01:26.100> with<00:01:26.329> investigation<00:01:27.329> gathering

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you begin with investigation gathering

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.020 
you begin with investigation gathering
data<00:01:28.220> defining<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> problem<00:01:29.700> or<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.850> issue

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
data defining the problem or the issue

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.620 
data defining the problem or the issue
at<00:01:30.270> hand

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
at hand

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.830 
at hand
next<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:32.009> need<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.250> identify<00:01:32.720> after<00:01:33.720> you've

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
next you need to identify after you've

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.170 
next you need to identify after you've
defined<00:01:34.170> identify<00:01:34.860> all<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.520> alternatives

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
defined identify all the alternatives

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.230 
defined identify all the alternatives
what<00:01:36.689> are<00:01:36.810> all<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.350> alternative

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
what are all the alternative

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.520 
what are all the alternative
alternatives<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.360> terms<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.750> solution<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.350> the

haven't either but it's a saying that

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:37.680 
haven't either but it's a saying that
there's<00:02:36.760> different<00:02:37.150> ways<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.420> going<00:02:37.510> about

and now we're going to go through the

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.660 
and now we're going to go through the

ludicrous we don't have the ability to

and<00:03:11.319> this<00:03:11.769> is<00:03:11.920> really<00:03:12.099> we're<00:03:12.549> getting<00:03:12.730> out

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
and this is really we're getting out

this<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.209> ridiculous<00:03:13.690> example<00:03:14.140> one

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
very likely so if that's been listed

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.250

fine<00:03:24.819> it's<00:03:25.000> been<00:03:25.150> listed<00:03:25.450> but<00:03:25.569> you<00:03:25.720> evaluate

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
fine it's been listed but you evaluate

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.020 
fine it's been listed but you evaluate
it<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.440> say<00:03:26.620> probably<00:03:27.430> not<00:03:27.609> going<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.849> happen

it and say probably not going to happen

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.940 
it and say probably not going to happen
therefore<00:03:28.660> will<00:03:28.930> exclude<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.799> one
