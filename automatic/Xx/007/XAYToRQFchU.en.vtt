they're hitting poor bits of armor or

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.549 
they're hitting poor bits of armor or
when<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> Conqueror<00:00:54.930> gives<00:00:55.170> himself<00:00:55.289> away

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
when the Conqueror gives himself away

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.090 
when the Conqueror gives himself away
and<00:00:56.059> good<00:00:57.059> damage<00:00:57.420> are<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.629> there

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
and good damage are all there

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.029 
and good damage are all there
I've<00:00:59.100> seen<00:00:59.430> better<00:00:59.609> but<00:00:59.789> took<00:01:00.449> good<00:01:00.600> start<00:01:01.039> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
I've seen better but took good start and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.770 
I've seen better but took good start and
then<00:01:02.219> I've<00:01:02.340> reversed<00:01:02.640> away<00:01:02.969> make<00:01:03.420> sure<00:01:03.449> I'm

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
then I've reversed away make sure I'm

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.030 
then I've reversed away make sure I'm
not<00:01:03.930> taking<00:01:04.260> any<00:01:04.439> shots<00:01:04.680> whilst<00:01:04.890> I'm

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
not taking any shots whilst I'm

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.380 
not taking any shots whilst I'm
reloading<00:01:05.369> fortunately<00:01:06.090> there's<00:01:06.270> no

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
reloading fortunately there's no

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.969 
reloading fortunately there's no
artillery<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> don't<00:01:07.500> need<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.710> get<00:01:07.830> into

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
artillery so I don't need to get into

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.520 
artillery so I don't need to get into
arty<00:01:08.340> cover<00:01:08.659> although<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> do<00:01:09.810> keep<00:01:10.110> reversing

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
arty cover although I do keep reversing

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.810 
arty cover although I do keep reversing
into<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.830> rock<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.280> does<00:01:11.520> get<00:01:11.729> quite

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
into that rock and it does get quite

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.109 
into that rock and it does get quite
annoying<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.920> then<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.250> I'm<00:01:14.670> finishing<00:01:15.000> my

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
annoying and then here I'm finishing my

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.640 
annoying and then here I'm finishing my
reload<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.720> I'll<00:01:15.780> start<00:01:15.960> heading<00:01:16.200> back<00:01:16.229> off<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
reload so I'll start heading back off to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.130 
reload so I'll start heading back off to
look<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:17.070> who<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.549> shoot<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.930> see<00:01:19.110> a

and increasing the chances of a bounce
up<00:04:32.229> here<00:04:32.530> there's<00:04:32.889> a<00:04:32.949> 183<00:04:33.460> round<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:33.759> corner

up here there's a 183 round the corner

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.050 
up here there's a 183 round the corner
and<00:04:34.330> aside<00:04:34.599> to<00:04:34.750> push<00:04:34.930> on<00:04:35.080> him<00:04:35.759> now<00:04:36.759> so<00:04:36.940> much

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
and aside to push on him now so much

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.879 
and aside to push on him now so much
just<00:04:37.270> shot<00:04:37.449> at<00:04:37.569> him<00:04:37.690> he<00:04:37.990> sees<00:04:38.259> me<00:04:38.500> coming<00:04:38.650> at

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
just shot at him he sees me coming at

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.559 
just shot at him he sees me coming at
him<00:04:38.979> and<00:04:39.250> he<00:04:39.430> reverses<00:04:39.819> not<00:04:40.240> wanting<00:04:40.539> to

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
him and he reverses not wanting to

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.270 
him and he reverses not wanting to
because<00:04:40.990> he<00:04:41.110> knows<00:04:41.289> I<00:04:41.470> can<00:04:41.650> want<00:04:41.830> hit<00:04:41.949> kill<00:04:42.130> him

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.089 
because he knows I can want hit kill him
he<00:04:42.520> could<00:04:43.030> bounce<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:43.750> then<00:04:44.620> he<00:04:44.830> reverses

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
he could bounce and then he reverses

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:46.800 
he could bounce and then he reverses
around<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.520> corner<00:04:45.849> I<00:04:46.000> look<00:04:46.180> at<00:04:46.300> me<00:04:46.419> mini-map

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
around the corner I look at me mini-map

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.050 
around the corner I look at me mini-map
I<00:04:47.020> see<00:04:47.349> I've<00:04:47.710> got<00:04:48.250> a<00:04:48.280> teammate<00:04:48.669> going<00:04:48.970> up

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
not going to waste a shot tracking him

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.560 
not going to waste a shot tracking him
