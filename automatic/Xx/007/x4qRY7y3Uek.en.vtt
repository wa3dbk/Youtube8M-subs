00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
that I'm gonna start uploading a little

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.060 
that I'm gonna start uploading a little
more<00:00:41.510> consistent<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:42.260> that<00:00:42.350> you<00:00:42.949> know

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
more consistent and that you know

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.860 
more consistent and that you know
because<00:00:43.729> I<00:00:43.760> didn't<00:00:44.059> upload<00:00:44.299> for<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.629> couple

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
because I didn't upload for a couple

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.600 
because I didn't upload for a couple
days<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.860> I<00:00:46.040> haven't<00:00:46.190> really<00:00:46.430> been

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
days and I haven't really been

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.210 
days and I haven't really been
consistently<00:00:47.120> uploading<00:00:47.510> like<00:00:47.659> a<00:00:47.690> month<00:00:48.019> now

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
consistently uploading like a month now

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.350 
consistently uploading like a month now
which<00:00:49.220> is<00:00:49.369> something<00:00:49.549> that<00:00:49.820> was<00:00:50.030> always

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
which is something that was always

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.310 
which is something that was always
really<00:00:50.690> important<00:00:51.229> to<00:00:51.290> me<00:00:51.409> that<00:00:53.320> consistent

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
really important to me that consistent

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.170 
really important to me that consistent
uploading<00:00:54.769> it's<00:00:54.920> just<00:00:55.100> like<00:00:55.489> legitimately

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
uploading it's just like legitimately

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.369 
uploading it's just like legitimately
something<00:00:56.600> that<00:00:56.720> I<00:00:56.780> really<00:00:56.930> do<00:00:57.140> take

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
something that I really do take

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.530

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
i think is really stupid cuz they do it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.179 
i think is really stupid cuz they do it
so<00:01:31.490> much<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:31.999> a<00:01:32.899> classic<00:01:33.469> example<00:01:33.619> this<00:01:34.130> is

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
so much and a classic example this is

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.539 
so much and a classic example this is
Ronaldinho<00:01:34.909> but<00:01:35.420> um<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:36.770> know<00:01:36.890> I<00:01:37.039> hate<00:01:37.280> when

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
Ronaldinho but um you know I hate when

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.580 
Ronaldinho but um you know I hate when
people<00:01:37.850> do<00:01:37.999> that<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.420> I<00:01:38.570> just<00:01:38.630> did<00:01:39.079> it<00:01:39.200> myself

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
people do that and I just did it myself

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.190 
people do that and I just did it myself
and<00:01:39.920> I<00:01:40.159> feel<00:01:40.189> really<00:01:40.399> stupid<00:01:40.939> because<00:01:41.840> it's

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
and I feel really stupid because it's

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.289 
and I feel really stupid because it's
something<00:01:42.409> that<00:01:42.590> actually<00:01:42.710> does<00:01:43.069> bug<00:01:43.340> me<00:01:43.369> so

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
something that actually does bug me so

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.910 
something that actually does bug me so
I'm<00:01:44.630> not<00:01:44.689> sure<00:01:44.840> if<00:01:44.990> I'm<00:01:45.170> gonna<00:01:45.289> go<00:01:45.469> out<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.619> say

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
I'm not sure if I'm gonna go out and say

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.649 
I'm not sure if I'm gonna go out and say
something<00:01:46.159> like<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:46.549> again<00:01:46.909> just<00:01:47.299> because

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
something like that again just because

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.120 
something like that again just because
you<00:01:48.200> know<00:01:48.319> you<00:01:48.590> never<00:01:48.679> know<00:01:48.890> what's<00:01:49.069> gonna

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
you know you never know what's gonna

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.219 
you know you never know what's gonna
happen<00:01:49.249> even<00:01:49.789> though<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.119> thought<00:01:50.569> in<00:01:50.780> my<00:01:50.929> case

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
happen even though I thought in my case

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.230 
happen even though I thought in my case
that<00:01:51.530> that<00:01:51.740> wouldn't<00:01:52.069> happen<00:01:52.219> to<00:01:52.429> me<00:01:52.549> just
