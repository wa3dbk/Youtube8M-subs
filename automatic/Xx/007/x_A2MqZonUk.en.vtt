00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello people welcome here 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.759
 Walk between the German sales 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.620
 From the market the brand has that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.330
 what other companies have done in the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.880
 music business for decades 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.420
 aspire and in quasi standard too 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.240
 create 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.630
 everywhere widely known and loved 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.600
 is 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 we're talking about the acoustic pick ups here 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.039
 I would like to introduce you to the market today 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.250
 present very special representative 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.960
 namely the pro mac gold for the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.090
 following clips I play a woman 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.579
 Must have single cut acoustic guitar with the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.510
 a 12 53 replacement cards pages 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.510
 Is provided 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.789
 now remember one per mcf of 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.350
 the market once a thrust 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.449
 hamburger speak we have here 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.259
 neat output at little 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.360
 the housing of pick up 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.930
 completely from the front to the back top and 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.020
 below is made of maple the flaw said 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.840
 curley maker and lets this pickup 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.540
 not like a foreign body in acoustics 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.340
 guitars buddy appear but as 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.960
 a natural addition to the guitar 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.299
 he is missing so I uncomfortable 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.550
 but is divided into the wonderful 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.380
 optics of a classical acoustic guitar 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.840
 or a western guitar 1 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.610
 the signal goes through one of the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.670
 marquis himself invented and 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.039
 developed cable that is double 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:47.390
 shielded and offers an incredible 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:50.119
 so good signal conductivity of 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.649
 sound, yes, is still here 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.319
 is transported high quality 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.149
 In the end , animal wants the pick-up 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.800
 break so that a tone can be heard 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.720
 this one is used for this 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.549
 plug it right at the end 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.560
 the special feature is only once 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.149
 is it a song speak freely if you 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.850
 can make him stronger from the length ago 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.799
 without going around here would be too 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.209
 you just have to screw it on 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.570
 and in the long run then varied 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.930
 become 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.360
 we have a lot here at the end 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.570
 high quality jack plug 6.35 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.810
 millimeter and this one is with 24 carat 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:27.670
 gilded again said here 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.920
 optimal conductivity and the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.760
 possibility of doing so high quality and so 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.470
 good as possible on europe or in yours 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.329
 favorite amplifier to transfer 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.450
 and now we want the pick-up 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.970
 about we start with on the website here 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.140
 the thin sides are just the pick-up 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.370
 run under it 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.680
 the beautiful is we do not have to go here 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.150
 down or change sides 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.769
 as with other pickups sometimes the 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.380
 case then we have him now for the first 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.890
 I'll take it in the middle of the soundhole 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.079
 then just pick up the pick up here 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.329
 on the bass side we have here at the 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.480
 sides correspondingly small foam 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.950
 sit and then would need chance plus 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.230
 squeeze and the pickup 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.720
 let go again high and already 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.989
 The pick-up is first installed 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.760
 can then still the sound accordingly 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.160
 to adapt for example 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.620
 we now have more heights here 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.819
 Pick up or do something 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.010
 deeper again and want something 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.650
 have better and then put the 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.620
 bass the bass side a little more here 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.930
 Of course you can also with the 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.709
 the angle of the pick-up 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.680
 experiment with them by giving them to 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.330
 for example, do something weird if 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.930
 For example, we'll beat it here 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.660
 you can see that the bass side of the 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.549
 Pick-ups closer to the game area 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.150
 and at the place where I strike as 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.510
 the higher side so we are here too 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.660
 again like a mini equalizer 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.030
 use 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.530
 just instead of making an extra device we do 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.299
 that directly with the position of the backup 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.380
 important also just make sure that 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.150
 The cable is not here on the sides 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.970
 the pages can be added to that 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.380
 just put something simple and simple 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.030
 that they really do not happen 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.350
 can 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.239
 this is the installation of a pickup 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.889
 and as fast as you can reinboth him 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.889
 he can be removed naturally 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.010
 the promikon the brand is the ideal 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.290
 pickups for all musicians the one 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.050
 authentic lively live sound 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.610
 your akustik instrument need the 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.040
 high quality workmanship 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.410
 appealing optics the optimal signal 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.480
 conductivity and 24k 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.450
 gold-plated plugs make for a 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.920
 unique sound experience so off in the 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.920
 load and check it out
