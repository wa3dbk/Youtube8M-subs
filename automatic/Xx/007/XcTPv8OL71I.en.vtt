their Western Digital one terabyte red
drives<00:00:22.670> so<00:00:23.670> first<00:00:24.330> we'll<00:00:25.109> be<00:00:25.230> seeing<00:00:25.619> how<00:00:26.400> well

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
drives so first we'll be seeing how well

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.109 
drives so first we'll be seeing how well
this<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.090> packed<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.529> Box<00:00:28.769> feels<00:00:29.220> very

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.710 

both<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:43.680> terabyte<00:01:44.130> drives<00:01:44.490> now<00:01:45.270> what<00:01:45.600> I'll

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
both one terabyte drives now what I'll

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.410 
both one terabyte drives now what I'll
be<00:01:45.869> doing<00:01:46.020> eventually<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:47.280> installing<00:01:48.240> them

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
be doing eventually is installing them

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.460 
be doing eventually is installing them
in<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.860> gen8<00:01:50.640> microserver<00:01:51.200> they'll<00:01:52.200> be

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
in the gen8 microserver they'll be

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.160 
in the gen8 microserver they'll be
attached<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.640> spoon<00:01:54.119> doggy<00:01:54.360> plate<00:01:54.810> just

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
attached to the spoon doggy plate just

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.290 
attached to the spoon doggy plate just
like<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.869> attached<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:58.890> side<00:01:59.300> but

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
like this and attached on the side but

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.280 
like this and attached on the side but
before<00:02:00.720> I<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.930> that

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:16.670 

I<00:02:09.229> will<00:02:10.229> be<00:02:10.460> burning<00:02:11.460> in<00:02:11.610> these<00:02:11.850> fries<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:15.680> a

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
I will be burning in these fries and a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.660 
I will be burning in these fries and a
test<00:02:17.310> setup<00:02:21.470> notice<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.620> have<00:02:22.800> my<00:02:22.830> anti-static

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
test setup notice I have my anti-static

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.500 
test setup notice I have my anti-static
strap<00:02:24.240> on

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.590 

okay<00:02:27.959> that's<00:02:28.500> what<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.739> drive<00:02:28.950> looks<00:02:29.250> like

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.220 

then<00:02:35.210> wait<00:02:36.210> in<00:02:36.390> many<00:02:36.540> ways<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.900> looks<00:02:36.930> just

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
then wait in many ways it looks just

00:02:37.230 --> 00:03:09.230 
then wait in many ways it looks just
like<00:02:37.350> an<00:02:37.560> SSD

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.050 

okay<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.980> ready<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.340> insert<00:03:11.700> into<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
okay it's ready to insert into the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.460 
okay it's ready to insert into the
microscope<00:03:12.510> I'll<00:03:12.720> do<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.990> same<00:03:13.170> for<00:03:13.380> the

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
microscope I'll do the same for the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.630 
microscope I'll do the same for the
other<00:03:13.620> one<00:03:13.710> and<00:03:14.630> of<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:16.050> testee<00:03:16.470> nice<00:03:16.650> and

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
other one and of the testee nice and

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.940 
other one and of the testee nice and
then<00:03:17.970> after<00:03:18.390> they've<00:03:19.020> been<00:03:19.140> verify<00:03:19.680> that

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
then after they've been verify that

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.480 
then after they've been verify that
everything<00:03:20.580> is<00:03:20.880> working<00:03:21.030> properly<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:22.490> well

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
everything is working properly and well

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.570 
everything is working properly and well
that<00:03:23.640> will<00:03:23.820> be<00:03:24.000> moving<00:03:24.150> them<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.870> -<00:03:25.050> Jenay

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
that will be moving them to - Jenay

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.690 
that will be moving them to - Jenay
now<00:03:26.580> I<00:03:26.610> put<00:03:27.000> them<00:03:27.240> in<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.510> in<00:03:28.080> 40<00:03:28.680> L<00:03:28.890> mic<00:03:29.250> receiver

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
now I put them in a in 40 L mic receiver

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.780 
now I put them in a in 40 L mic receiver
to<00:03:30.360> stress<00:03:31.140> test<00:03:31.380> them<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.950> also<00:03:32.160> test<00:03:32.640> the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
to stress test them and also test the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.880 
to stress test them and also test the
individual<00:03:33.240> drives<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:34.020> you<00:03:34.470> see<00:03:34.710> the

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
individual drives and you see the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.450
