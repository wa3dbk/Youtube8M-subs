but it's been there kind of um for a
couple<00:01:50.299> of<00:01:50.330> hours<00:01:50.510> already<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.409> it<00:01:51.830> doesn't

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
couple of hours already so it doesn't

oberon the same power is actually not

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.530 
oberon the same power is actually not
too<00:01:59.630> bad<00:01:59.659> um<00:02:00.290> i<00:02:00.860> guess<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.580> stayed<00:02:01.909> for<00:02:02.360> about

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
too bad um i guess it stayed for about

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.640 
too bad um i guess it stayed for about
3-4<00:02:03.530> hours<00:02:04.009> for<00:02:04.220> me<00:02:04.250> without<00:02:04.759> eating<00:02:05.390> so<00:02:06.110> um<00:02:06.409> I

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
3-4 hours for me without eating so um I

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.279 
3-4 hours for me without eating so um I
think<00:02:06.710> that's<00:02:07.070> texting<00:02:07.549> you<00:02:07.610> picked<00:02:07.820> up<00:02:08.000> is

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.290 
comment on you know how this works but I
find<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.160> very<00:03:09.250> interesting<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.910> it's<00:03:10.150> out

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
find it very interesting that it's out

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.780 
find it very interesting that it's out
an<00:03:10.480> eyeliner<00:03:11.080> pen<00:03:11.590> rather<00:03:12.190> than<00:03:12.430> liquid

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
an eyeliner pen rather than liquid

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.490 
an eyeliner pen rather than liquid
eyeliner<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:13.630> we'll<00:03:14.110> see<00:03:14.260> what<00:03:14.410> the

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
eyeliner so we'll see what the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.910 
eyeliner so we'll see what the
difference<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:15.989> next<00:03:16.989> thing<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:17.260> picked<00:03:17.440> up<00:03:17.680> is

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
difference is next thing I picked up is

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.110

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
another eye pencil it is the Kohl pencil

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.740 
another eye pencil it is the Kohl pencil

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
in number 15 this is a lilac kind of

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:35.160 
in number 15 this is a lilac kind of
color<00:03:25.989> I<00:03:32.910> know<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.060> guys<00:03:34.269> can't<00:03:34.690> really<00:03:34.930> see

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
color I know you guys can't really see

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.229 
color I know you guys can't really see
it<00:03:35.200> that<00:03:35.320> world<00:03:35.739> because<00:03:36.190> my<00:03:36.640> light<00:03:36.880> is<00:03:36.910> just

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
it that world because my light is just

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.620 
it that world because my light is just
shining<00:03:37.600> straight<00:03:38.140> onto<00:03:38.950> here<00:03:39.430> when<00:03:40.090> is<00:03:40.330> night

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
shining straight onto here when is night

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.780 
shining straight onto here when is night
time<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.530> can't<00:03:41.890> really<00:03:42.010> do<00:03:42.220> much<00:03:42.250> about<00:03:42.580> the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
time so I can't really do much about the

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.050 
time so I can't really do much about the
lighting<00:03:44.130> but<00:03:45.130> I'm<00:03:45.280> really<00:03:45.610> really<00:03:45.760> keen<00:03:46.030> to

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
lighting but I'm really really keen to

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.810
