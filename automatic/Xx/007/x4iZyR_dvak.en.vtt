00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
gional importance of which I was

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.549 
gional importance of which I was
supposed<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.210> be<00:00:33.329> taking<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.870> finer<00:00:34.290> points

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
supposed to be taking the finer points

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
of down in my notes but I probably

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.049 
of down in my notes but I probably
wasn't<00:00:37.829> because<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.340> was<00:00:38.460> never<00:00:38.550> very<00:00:38.760> good<00:00:38.850> at

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
wasn't because I was never very good at

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.080 
wasn't because I was never very good at
taking<00:00:39.180> notes<00:00:40.160> except<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.430> kindergarten

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
taking notes except for in kindergarten

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.299 
taking notes except for in kindergarten
we<00:00:42.210> had<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> chalkboard<00:00:43.020> or<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.290> blackboard<00:00:43.980> but

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
we had a chalkboard or a blackboard but

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.420 
we had a chalkboard or a blackboard but
it<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.640> actually<00:00:44.820> green<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.600> course<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.530> like

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
it was actually green of course I like

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.940 
it was actually green of course I like
the<00:00:47.670> sound<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.239> when<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:49.559> teacher<00:00:49.770> was

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the sound of when the teacher was

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.500 
the sound of when the teacher was
writing<00:00:50.309> quickly<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> chalkboard<00:00:51.360> is

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
writing quickly on the chalkboard is

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.500 
writing quickly on the chalkboard is
more<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.340> combination<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.730> taps<00:00:54.149> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
more of a combination of taps and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.260 
more of a combination of taps and
scratches<00:00:55.190> it<00:00:56.190> was<00:00:56.370> kind<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.640> soothing<00:00:57.090> but

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
scratches it was kind of soothing but

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.720 
scratches it was kind of soothing but
whenever<00:00:57.570> know<00:00:58.440> whenever<00:00:58.949> she<00:00:59.250> drew<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> long

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
whenever know whenever she drew a long

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.389 
whenever know whenever she drew a long
line<00:01:00.030> there<00:01:00.930> was<00:01:01.020> always<00:01:01.289> potential<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
line there was always potential for a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.170 
line there was always potential for a
sound<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.660> was<00:01:03.780> getting<00:01:04.080> close<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
sound that was getting close to that

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.500 
sound that was getting close to that
dreaded<00:01:06.180> fingernails<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> chalkboard

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
dreaded fingernails on a chalkboard

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.660 
dreaded fingernails on a chalkboard
sound<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.840> was<00:01:09.990> not<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.619> good<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:11.010> lots<00:01:11.549> of

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
sound it was not so good but lots of

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.120 
sound it was not so good but lots of
nice<00:01:11.909> little<00:01:12.270> short<00:01:12.540> short<00:01:13.470> lines<00:01:13.830> being

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
nice little short short lines being

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.030 
nice little short short lines being
drawn<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> chalkboard<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.060> makes<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.540> nice<00:01:15.689> sound

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
drawn a chalkboard it makes a nice sound

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.260 
drawn a chalkboard it makes a nice sound
on<00:01:17.040> whiteboards<00:01:17.490> however<00:01:17.790> there's<00:01:17.970> not<00:01:18.119> much

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
on whiteboards however there's not much

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.570 
on whiteboards however there's not much
sound<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.229> guess<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.920> downside<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
sound but I guess the downside of a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.480 
sound but I guess the downside of a
whiteboard<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.380> that<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.619> markers<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.340> go

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
whiteboard is that the markers can go

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.190 
whiteboard is that the markers can go
dry<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:25.049> remember<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.830> many<00:01:25.979> hours<00:01:26.460> of

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
dry and I remember so many hours of

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.840 
dry and I remember so many hours of
teachers<00:01:28.200> fumbling<00:01:28.619> around<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:29.159> all<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
teachers fumbling around with all the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.730 
teachers fumbling around with all the
markers<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> little<00:01:31.290> rail<00:01:31.500> on

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
markers they have on the little rail on

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.429 
markers they have on the little rail on
the<00:01:31.829> bottom<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.310> whiteboard<00:01:32.520> I'm<00:01:33.439> capping

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
the bottom of the whiteboard I'm capping

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.929 
the bottom of the whiteboard I'm capping
them<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.890> after<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.159> other<00:01:35.280> trying<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.759> write

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
them one after the other trying to write

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.270 
them one after the other trying to write
with<00:01:36.119> them<00:01:36.650> trying<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.740> find<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.220> that

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
with them trying to find the one that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.429 
with them trying to find the one that
still<00:01:38.640> works<00:01:38.880> good<00:01:39.180> enough<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:40.350> know

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
still works good enough for you know

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.499 
still works good enough for you know
them<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.829> write<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> class<00:01:41.790> policy<00:01:42.299> and

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
them to write with a class policy and

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.359 
them to write with a class policy and
finally<00:01:42.840> settling<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.100> out<00:01:44.130> of

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
finally settling on one out of

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.330 
finally settling on one out of
desperation<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.829> still<00:01:47.009> having

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
desperation and then it's still having

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.069 
desperation and then it's still having
that<00:01:47.430> good<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.939> just<00:01:48.180> ended<00:01:48.509> up<00:01:48.659> writing<00:01:48.899> a

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
that good and just ended up writing a

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.130 
that good and just ended up writing a
bunch<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.409> stuff<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.570> you<00:01:51.570> know<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:51.899> like

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
bunch of stuff and you know it's like

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.340 
bunch of stuff and you know it's like
still<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:53.329> not<00:01:54.329> very<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.810> know<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:54.990> can't

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
still just not very you know you can't

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.289 
still just not very you know you can't
really<00:01:55.560> say<00:01:55.770> anything<00:01:55.799> because<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:57.270> a

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
really say anything because it's not a

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.730 
really say anything because it's not a
very<00:01:57.509> good<00:01:57.570> marker<00:01:57.930> because<00:01:58.170> those<00:01:58.320> markers

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
very good marker because those markers

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.980 
very good marker because those markers
go<00:01:59.490> bad<00:01:59.700> easily<00:02:00.149> especially<00:02:00.540> when<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.780> write

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990

chalkboards<00:02:45.459> again<00:02:45.760> I'm<00:02:46.390> not<00:02:46.510> sure<00:02:46.660> why<00:02:46.810> sure

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
chalkboards again I'm not sure why sure

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.369 
chalkboards again I'm not sure why sure
they<00:02:47.170> had<00:02:47.290> their<00:02:47.379> reasons<00:02:47.549> maybe<00:02:49.290> for<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
they had their reasons maybe for the

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.630 
they had their reasons maybe for the
reasons<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.650> just<00:02:50.680> mentioned<00:02:50.890> maybe<00:02:51.310> it's<00:02:51.489> much

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
reasons I just mentioned maybe it's much

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.670 
reasons I just mentioned maybe it's much
cheaper<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.209> easier<00:02:52.329> to<00:02:52.569> just<00:02:52.870> buy<00:02:52.930> chalk<00:02:53.349> and

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
cheaper and easier to just buy chalk and

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.940 
cheaper and easier to just buy chalk and
chalk<00:02:53.829> always<00:02:54.190> works<00:02:55.650> that's<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.799> only

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
chalk always works that's the only

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.069 
chalk always works that's the only
downside<00:02:57.549> to<00:02:57.579> chalkboards<00:02:58.420> is<00:02:58.569> the<00:02:58.720> mess<00:02:58.900> it

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
downside to chalkboards is the mess it

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.440 
downside to chalkboards is the mess it
makes<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.590> how<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.769> board<00:03:00.640> gradually<00:03:01.239> gets

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
makes and how the board gradually gets

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.229 
makes and how the board gradually gets
covered<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.170> thin<00:03:02.409> layer<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:03.010> chalk<00:03:03.790> residue

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
covered in a thin layer of chalk residue

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.699 
covered in a thin layer of chalk residue
but<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:04.569> seemed<00:03:04.780> like<00:03:04.870> at<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.290> end<00:03:05.409> of<00:03:05.530> every

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
but it seemed like at the end of every

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.180 
but it seemed like at the end of every
day<00:03:05.739> in<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.849> college<00:03:07.150> off-hours<00:03:07.810> some

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
day in the college off-hours some

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.180 
day in the college off-hours some

mysterious Benevolent chalk cleaning

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.339 
mysterious Benevolent chalk cleaning

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
group would come around and they

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.210 
group would come around and they

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
probably had some special squeegee

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.099 
probably had some special squeegee
equipment<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:18.970> would<00:03:19.180> clean<00:03:19.569> all<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.810> boards

equipment and would clean all the boards

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.710 
equipment and would clean all the boards
down<00:03:20.349> because<00:03:20.799> I<00:03:20.889> remember<00:03:21.190> I<00:03:21.220> had<00:03:21.430> one<00:03:21.720> class

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
down because I remember I had one class

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.629

first<00:03:23.349> thing<00:03:23.620> in<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.829> morning<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.400> that

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
first thing in the morning and that

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.409 
first thing in the morning and that
chalkboard<00:03:24.940> was<00:03:25.329> always<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:25.870> perfectly<00:03:26.410> green

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
chalkboard was always so perfectly green

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.819 
chalkboard was always so perfectly green
it<00:03:28.419> was<00:03:28.599> kind<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:28.930> satisfying<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.650> see<00:03:29.680> the

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
it was kind of satisfying to see the

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.039 
it was kind of satisfying to see the
teachers<00:03:30.310> chart<00:03:30.609> right<00:03:30.819> on<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.299> guess<00:03:31.720> I

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
teachers chart right on it I guess I

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.229 
teachers chart right on it I guess I
guess<00:03:32.950> in<00:03:33.069> collars<00:03:33.370> are<00:03:33.489> called<00:03:33.669> professors

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
guess in collars are called professors

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.449 
guess in collars are called professors
not<00:03:34.450> teachers<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:35.049> always<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.530> was<00:03:35.919> always<00:03:36.040> uh

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
not teachers that always I was always uh

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.180 
not teachers that always I was always uh
I<00:03:36.669> always<00:03:37.269> threw<00:03:37.510> me<00:03:37.629> off<00:03:37.810> it's<00:03:38.739> a<00:03:38.799> professor

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
I always threw me off it's a professor

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.949 
I always threw me off it's a professor
or<00:03:39.280> not<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.430> teacher<00:03:40.109> yeah<00:03:42.120> anyways<00:03:44.519> yeah

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.309 
drawing with them drawing on a dry erase
board<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.299> little<00:03:49.569> different<00:03:49.900> than<00:03:50.079> drawing

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
board is a little different than drawing

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.439 
board is a little different than drawing
on<00:03:50.410> paper<00:03:50.560> for<00:03:50.919> one<00:03:51.040> thing<00:03:51.310> there's<00:03:52.150> so<00:03:52.329> much

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
on paper for one thing there's so much

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.869 
on paper for one thing there's so much
less<00:03:52.750> it's<00:03:53.620> like<00:03:53.799> a<00:03:53.829> slippery<00:03:54.310> surface<00:03:54.519> you

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
less it's like a slippery surface you

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.759 
less it's like a slippery surface you
