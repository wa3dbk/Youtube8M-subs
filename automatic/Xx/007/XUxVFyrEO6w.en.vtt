00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.650
 when your stadium arrived today and 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:10.790
 I woke up in the morning 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.639
 this weather I remembered the match in 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.449
 Samara 1 almost in the swamp UAH 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.880
 remembered in the matches sale trend said that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.499
 you lost this game 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.129
 that is, it should Kama with remember how 

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:24.219
 they put you there and we lost 

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:26.689
 is it really possible to enter the field 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.390
 need more than five times here 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.539
 With principle the game got the woods 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.950
 remembering what happened in samara 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.490
 and not that fundamentally easy 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.310
 let's say so reminded in a situation that was 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.180
 there 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.700
 today came to Moscow in Samara 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.460
 Team Andrei Kobelev and Viktor 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.500
 fresh take off talked 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500
 with the whistle talked with anri dyes eu 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.370
 he pulls congratulations on the statement sheet he 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.360
 do not sign to congratulate the coach 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.400
 it seemed 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.220
 because they said 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.650
 the game is very hard today 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.150
 but undoubtedly at the end of the first half 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.850
 heard something from something controversial 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.720
 situations 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.860
 such but the isotope minin of the clock that all 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.880
 ponder categories today 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.189
 the replacement itself requested 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.139
 on by itself something that is already in the current 

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:11.890
 season to Tomsk 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.550
 team then look up 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.250
 deservedly won 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.850
 I think yes 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.880
 there was a response to light the first flight was 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.940
 so very 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.210
 could score but yes it is so Palestinian remember 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.369
 in the final stages something was missing 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.480
 you would score the first goal then 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.200
 a couple of similar episodes were noted in 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.610
 a field as unfortunate with something I donâ€™t know 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.360
 somehow it seems like it was still possible 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.960
 there was already something there 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.560
 I do not know what is the maximum year in 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.119
 the ending lacked material new 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.140
 remember said 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.940
 in personal experience 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.180
 shoot down then the second match anchors dalgatov 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.430
 argue and join the argument 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.740
 scorers 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.310
 why not of course Sogdian why not 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.470
 watched those who go upstairs know 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.340
 how much does not depend 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.750
 the match sanaviatsii overwhelmed 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.000
 they have handwriting 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.040
 Movsisyan on Kerzhakov now marvel 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.310
 you 6 when husband overtake night of course 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.830
 so why not brazilian kaka 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.780
 the national team that those who did not argue more 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.589
 will score 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:11.189
 maybe all the same 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.239
 wait for some kind of twitter accident 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.729
 novel shirokov 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.369
 son after every song we have 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:19.070
 of course there won't be 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.890
 mortgage yesterday harassing monotonous 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.139
 would potentially 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.429
 believed the third ball and the third ball 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:26.509
 but again again they have a penalty 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:27.689
 games in a row so 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.629
 on this so accuracy 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.870
 they definitely happened and yut 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.639
 stocks 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.539
 second number dynamo gave after downtrodden 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:36.409
 no ball 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:37.949
 basically 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:41.329
 scored then we could still score there 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.379
 duties on the bright nose 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:45.559
 catalin ball 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.949
 where 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.329
 fits of anger 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.579
 the fact that the river Lolland is often so 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.859
 weather is more honest who no yes no 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:56.339
 football market 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:58.159
 being heavy field on the oscar 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.339
 because of this i think that 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:01.969
 I then through this meat factory 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.349
 feeling first of all for the same kind 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.329
 counter in principle so what they wanted 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.239
 home magnitude elect moments were 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.899
 mts could miss but dangerous attacks 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.389
 man in shift 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.049
 but school 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.489
 so today the fighting character 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.579
 manifest block like without it on 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.489
 central and marussia 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.990
 in the light of the commander 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.269
 figure of questions 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.909
 this year kaunas 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.909
 hard to play 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.689
 that is, it is good to play that played 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.009
 quickly able to distinguish but oh well he 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.419
 said that with a crunch we beat it there 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.069
 in the first minutes 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.939
 basically and send there to 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:40.379
 Penza your 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:41.709
 easier to play 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.079
 not once today missed the second time 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.729
 t in the championship 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:47.179
 we have it too 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:49.519
 I mean, you didn't miss it 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.279
 God forbid that everything goes on so that 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:54.309
 strange but always 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:55.899
 in the first half we acted well 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:58.789
 looking for moments for scoring with us 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:00.779
 we had good combinations 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:03.000
 deservedly scored one ball in the end 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.390
 after the break the others allowed themselves 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.040
 to manifest and williams not in the second half 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.670
 we weren't so good but the most important thing 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.159
 managed to keep the winning score 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.619
 at that time deputies have an option 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:18.619
 i.e. this is a hard win dynamo 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:21.749
 we like to repeat the first half we had 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:23.539
 not one chance to excel and achieve 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.669
 success a little blood but in the second half 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.159
 opponent gave battle had a hard time 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:30.860
 at least 3 points in our piggy bank we put and 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.599
 This is the main result of what pension with 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.869
 party that will say why you do not 

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:37.889
 it turned out to score today 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.710
 I was close to being different but to 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.039
 Unfortunately it was not possible however in his attacks 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.860
 I participated in having given an assist 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.460
 transfer categories to win teams for 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.759
 I'm always more important than the head itself 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:50.680
 about it 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.509
 and not frozen today on the field home stuff 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.360
 was a little cool but for russia such 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.619
 weather is normal
