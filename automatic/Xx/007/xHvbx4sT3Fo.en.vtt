00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.490
 and let's talk about choosing glue this 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.940
 very many interested in the question of how 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.509
 glue 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.879
 aren't there tile stores now very 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.340
 large selection of heat-resistant adhesives of different 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:21.060
 i will bring some here glue diol 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.630
 good see it says that up to 850 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.420
 degrees 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.599
 its heat resistance is well on the stoves such 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.460
 temperature does not happen on the surface here 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.220
 Do I maximize my letter 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.890
 temperature up to 150 degrees outside 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.780
 heated so for 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.370
 glued tiles, I believe that you can 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.370
 use any heat resistant glue 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.050
 there is such a glue of the plates they are also good in 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.489
 super fireplace glue is also heat resistant in it 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.820
 contains reinforcing additives something about 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.609
 remove this very adhesive layer well 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.710
 holding tiles 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:08.700
 most often I use such hercules 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.430
 heat resistant it says that up to 1200 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.790
 Degree heat resistance 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.930
 such a glue that it is very hard when 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.870
 sticking tiles 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.140
 if you put it wrong right away 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.470
 then when moving it will no longer hold 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.980
 it is necessary again and die glue from the tile from 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.680
 ovens 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.340
 reapply and stick me like 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.230
 get out of this situation i mix one 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.600
 to one with other adhesives 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.350
 with the usual on which years is 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.370
 tile on walls using glue bolars 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.610
 standard dollar with base each other 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.160
 glue that come across nearby 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.320
 One-to-one diluted adhesive stores 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.920
 holds tile quite normally 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.470
 heat resistance is enough 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:03.210
 also using used glue 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.310
 strong he is also very hard too 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.190
 diluting one to one but last 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.970
 time we got glue in irkutsk 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.069
 profix it also comes with reinforcement 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.010
 additives 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.409
 not so expensive, he is about 400 rubles 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.200
 the bag is worth not like him 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:24.469
 work it is already ready plastic and 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.739
 you can work with him for about an hour 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:31.489
 setting that is divorced small 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:35.060
 the amount in the tank so that in an hour 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:38.269
 we could work out if in your 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.099
 the stores have no heat resistant glue then 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.370
 you can use this solution for 3 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.650
 sand parts one part cement and 10 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.530
 liters of this solution add 1 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.659
 a pound of salt I also used it for a long time 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.419
 when there was no heat resistant glue 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:57.769
 tile sales pasted such a solution 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:03:00.349
 keeps well the only thing in the most 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.769
 hot place such as above the hob 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:07.189
 stove heating and cooking stoves and above 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.849
 I add asbestos with a fire door or 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.049
 asbestos 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.739
 stew or or soak the sheet 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.010
 asbestos 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:20.060
 own then beating with a mixer and add 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.849
 in glue with asbestos reinforcing 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.139
 additives even better tile keeps but 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.139
 it's the hottest places
