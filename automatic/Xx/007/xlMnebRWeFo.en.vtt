00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.130 
the instructions were very easy and
clear<00:05:10.160> to<00:05:10.310> follow<00:05:10.550> so<00:05:11.330> setup<00:05:11.660> didn't<00:05:11.990> take

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
clear to follow so setup didn't take

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.030 
clear to follow so setup didn't take
long<00:05:12.350> at<00:05:12.410> all

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
long at all

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.219 
long at all
I'm<00:05:13.250> the<00:05:13.520> wireless<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.060> us<00:05:14.210> also<00:05:14.570> fairly<00:05:15.050> easy

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
I'm the wireless to us also fairly easy

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:16.719 
I'm the wireless to us also fairly easy
to<00:05:15.530> connect<00:05:16.010> and<00:05:16.220> I<00:05:16.250> didn't<00:05:16.460> have<00:05:16.550> any

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
to connect and I didn't have any

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.469 
to connect and I didn't have any
problems<00:05:17.240> with<00:05:17.330> that<00:05:17.620> like<00:05:18.620> I<00:05:18.770> said<00:05:18.800> my

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
problems with that like I said my

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.320 
problems with that like I said my
computer<00:05:20.479> does<00:05:20.750> have<00:05:21.229> the<00:05:21.680> lion<00:05:22.550> operating

computer does have the lion operating
system<00:05:23.690> on<00:05:23.840> it<00:05:23.870> so<00:05:24.290> instead<00:05:24.590> of<00:05:24.650> using<00:05:24.919> the

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
disk that came with the printer I did

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.500

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
connection to see if I got it set up

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.409 
connection to see if I got it set up
correctly<00:05:48.470> and<00:05:49.040> to<00:05:49.430> show<00:05:49.610> you<00:05:49.669> guys<00:05:49.880> how<00:05:50.060> fast

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
correctly and to show you guys how fast

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.800 
correctly and to show you guys how fast
the<00:05:51.169> printing<00:05:51.680> is<00:05:51.830> on<00:05:52.099> here<00:05:52.520> pull<00:05:53.419> the<00:05:53.599> head

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
the printing is on here pull the head

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:03.970 
the printing is on here pull the head
and<00:05:54.050> print<00:05:54.590> a<00:05:54.650> document

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.610 

okay<00:06:04.580> and<00:06:05.090> the<00:06:05.540> printer<00:06:05.810> just<00:06:05.960> got<00:06:06.170> it<00:06:06.320> it<00:06:06.440> did

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
okay and the printer just got it it did

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.980 
okay and the printer just got it it did
take<00:06:06.830> a<00:06:06.860> little<00:06:07.100> while<00:06:07.400> to<00:06:07.430> receive<00:06:08.030> it<00:06:08.210> but<00:06:08.870> it

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
take a little while to receive it but it

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.050 
take a little while to receive it but it
is<00:06:09.140> pretty<00:06:09.170> and<00:06:09.560> wirelessly<00:06:10.220> so<00:06:10.580> that's<00:06:10.790> to<00:06:10.970> be

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
is pretty and wirelessly so that's to be

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:17.590 
is pretty and wirelessly so that's to be
expected<00:06:11.320> it<00:06:12.320> is<00:06:12.560> printing<00:06:13.160> fairly<00:06:14.030> quick<00:06:16.600> so

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
expected it is printing fairly quick so

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.530 
expected it is printing fairly quick so
there<00:06:17.840> it<00:06:17.960> is<00:06:18.080> with<00:06:18.560> color<00:06:18.890> and<00:06:19.010> black<00:06:19.550> ink<00:06:19.910> the

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
there it is with color and black ink the

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.970 
there it is with color and black ink the
printing<00:06:20.870> was<00:06:21.020> pretty<00:06:21.290> quick<00:06:21.530> I'll<00:06:21.740> go<00:06:21.890> ahead

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 
printing was pretty quick I'll go ahead

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.640 
printing was pretty quick I'll go ahead
and<00:06:22.310> copy<00:06:22.520> this<00:06:22.730> for<00:06:23.180> you<00:06:23.360> using<00:06:24.170> the<00:06:24.320> color

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
and copy this for you using the color

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:32.950 
and copy this for you using the color
copier<00:06:25.160> to<00:06:25.820> see<00:06:26.060> how<00:06:26.330> good<00:06:26.690> that<00:06:26.750> works<00:06:31.960> okay

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
copier to see how good that works okay

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.050 
copier to see how good that works okay
and<00:06:33.260> you<00:06:33.350> just<00:06:33.530> do<00:06:33.890> I<00:06:34.220> know<00:06:34.400> you<00:06:34.580> can't<00:06:34.850> read

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
and you just do I know you can't read

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.660 
and you just do I know you can't read
that<00:06:35.090> on<00:06:35.360> here<00:06:35.660> but<00:06:35.840> you<00:06:35.960> one<00:06:36.410> color<00:06:36.710> copy<00:06:37.690> and

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
that on here but you one color copy and

00:06:39.670 --> 00:07:01.060 
that on here but you one color copy and
we'll<00:06:40.670> try<00:06:40.940> this

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.300 

okay<00:07:01.910> so<00:07:01.970> it<00:07:02.270> copied<00:07:02.660> perfectly<00:07:02.870> fine<00:07:03.440> um<00:07:04.100> you

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
okay so it copied perfectly fine um you

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.890 
okay so it copied perfectly fine um you
probably<00:07:04.370> never<00:07:04.730> said<00:07:05.030> the<00:07:05.330> printer<00:07:05.630> is<00:07:05.840> a

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900 
probably never said the printer is a

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.170 
probably never said the printer is a
little<00:07:06.560> bit<00:07:06.740> noisy<00:07:06.980> so<00:07:07.550> it's<00:07:07.670> not<00:07:07.790> going<00:07:08.000> to<00:07:08.090> be

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
little bit noisy so it's not going to be

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.510 
little bit noisy so it's not going to be
the<00:07:08.330> quietest<00:07:08.780> printer<00:07:09.170> but<00:07:09.830> it<00:07:09.860> is<00:07:10.130> pretty

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
the quietest printer but it is pretty

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.610 
the quietest printer but it is pretty
quick<00:07:10.850> so<00:07:11.270> overall<00:07:11.690> I<00:07:11.810> would<00:07:11.990> have<00:07:12.320> to<00:07:12.440> say

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 
quick so overall I would have to say

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.830 
quick so overall I would have to say
that<00:07:12.650> this<00:07:12.950> is<00:07:13.190> a<00:07:13.490> pretty<00:07:13.820> decent<00:07:14.060> printer<00:07:14.570> so

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 
that this is a pretty decent printer so

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.260 
that this is a pretty decent printer so
far<00:07:15.140> I'm<00:07:15.860> the<00:07:16.130> instructions<00:07:16.730> to<00:07:16.880> set<00:07:17.060> it<00:07:17.180> up

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.270 
far I'm the instructions to set it up

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.240 
far I'm the instructions to set it up
were<00:07:17.540> very<00:07:17.570> easy<00:07:18.020> to<00:07:18.260> follow<00:07:18.470> and<00:07:18.740> very<00:07:18.920> quick

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.250 
were very easy to follow and very quick

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.490 
were very easy to follow and very quick
I<00:07:19.550> didn't<00:07:20.210> have<00:07:20.330> any<00:07:20.510> problem<00:07:20.960> setting<00:07:21.170> up<00:07:21.380> the

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:21.500 
I didn't have any problem setting up the

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.110 
I didn't have any problem setting up the
wireless<00:07:21.710> connection<00:07:22.310> and<00:07:22.670> that<00:07:22.700> was<00:07:22.910> also

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 
wireless connection and that was also

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.200 
wireless connection and that was also
very<00:07:23.330> easy<00:07:23.930> to<00:07:24.200> do<00:07:24.730> even<00:07:25.730> though<00:07:25.820> I<00:07:25.850> did<00:07:26.060> have

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.210 
very easy to do even though I did have

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.540 
very easy to do even though I did have
to<00:07:26.330> go<00:07:26.480> online<00:07:26.720> to<00:07:27.110> find<00:07:27.200> the<00:07:27.530> driver<00:07:27.800> for<00:07:28.280> the

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.550 
to go online to find the driver for the

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.420 
to go online to find the driver for the
Lian<00:07:28.940> software<00:07:29.600> it<00:07:30.290> was<00:07:30.470> very<00:07:30.770> easy<00:07:31.040> to<00:07:31.190> find

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:31.430 
Lian software it was very easy to find
