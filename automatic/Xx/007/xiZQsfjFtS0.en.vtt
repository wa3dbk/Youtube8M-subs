00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.609 
feet so having an arch stuff like really
intense<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.780> shoe<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.229> not<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> good

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
intense in a shoe that was not a good

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.840 
intense in a shoe that was not a good
example<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:23.130> my<00:01:23.340> hand<00:01:23.520> doesn't<00:01:23.580> arch

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
example because my hand doesn't arch

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.520 
example because my hand doesn't arch
that<00:01:24.060> much<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.780> say<00:01:24.930> having<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
that much you going to say having a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.109 
that much you going to say having a
really<00:01:25.710> intense<00:01:26.070> arch<00:01:26.280> doesn't<00:01:26.700> really<00:01:26.850> work

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
really intense arch doesn't really work

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.730 
really intense arch doesn't really work
for<00:01:27.150> me<00:01:27.390> because<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.930> uncomfortable<00:01:28.560> but

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
for me because it's uncomfortable but

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740 
for me because it's uncomfortable but
this<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.250> pretty<00:01:29.520> flat<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.329> feels<00:01:30.420> really

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
this is pretty flat so it feels really

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.420 
this is pretty flat so it feels really

would have hurt but I think this is good
for<00:02:32.790> now<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:34.020> really<00:02:34.080> pretty<00:02:34.560> rose<00:02:35.010> gold

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
for now so it's really pretty rose gold

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.370 
for now so it's really pretty rose gold
with<00:02:35.640> some<00:02:35.910> simple<00:02:36.180> detailing<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.050> then<00:02:37.170> just

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
with some simple detailing and then just

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.560 
with some simple detailing and then just
a<00:02:37.470> little<00:02:37.710> bit<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.310> diamonds<00:02:38.940> around<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.360> um

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
a little bit the diamonds around it um

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.040 
a little bit the diamonds around it um
so<00:02:40.170> it's<00:02:40.470> pretty<00:02:41.250> much<00:02:41.490> similar<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.910> my<00:02:42.300> target

two<00:07:19.760> times<00:07:19.940> because<00:07:20.210> it's<00:07:20.360> small<00:07:20.570> but<00:07:20.600> the

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140 
two times because it's small but the

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.620 
two times because it's small but the

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:23.630 
medium looked really weird right here

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.060 
medium looked really weird right here
because<00:07:23.900> it<00:07:23.990> was<00:07:24.080> too<00:07:24.290> long<00:07:24.560> so<00:07:24.860> it<00:07:24.919> just

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.070 
because it was too long so it just

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.070 
because it was too long so it just
didn't<00:07:25.250> look<00:07:25.280> like<00:07:25.370> if<00:07:25.610> it<00:07:25.760> well<00:07:25.970> so<00:07:26.570> yeah
