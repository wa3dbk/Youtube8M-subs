00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400

 but I'm back 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.990
 jefferson was with his roe of 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.330
 special thousand subscribers I should have 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.460
 make that special because thanks to me 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.500
 is that we reached that good number the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.779
 truth is that thanks to you for everything 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.539
 Your support in the last four months 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.000
 but good without so much bullshit we go with 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.109
 the news that is very good as well 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.230
 like the personality of rosita méndez 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.329
 wwf the trailer for the new season of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.210
 total reality divas that will be returned to 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.309
 issue as of September 7 the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.290
 video would be one more if it were not for the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.750
 controversy that has been generated on the internet 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.940
 due to the appearance of rose mendes with 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.070
 bare breasts despite being 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.260
 slightly censored by the edition 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:57.660
 some media have come to qualify 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:59.969
 these images as pornographic www in 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.760
 the description will have it is in the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.890
 337 minute there are people inside the wwf 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.290
 that batista will not return to the company 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.420
 full time yes guardians of the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.330
 galaxy continues to reap successes in 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.460
 box office when batista left a few ago 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.890
 months it was agreed that he would return 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.230
 after his promotional appearances 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.290
 for the marvel movie but it seems 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.270
 which ultimately it may not be like the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.950
 batiste future was a theme 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.020
 present behind the scenes of the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.960
 live events this weekend 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.850
 one of the reasons for not returning is that 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.620
 there would be a risk that the winner of the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.320
 this year's edition of the royal rumble 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.390
 could be seriously injured now that 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.729
 his film career begins 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.310
 take off seems more than clear that 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.740
 batista will receive offers to appear 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.250
 in other movies because of the success the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.530
 guardians of the galaxy however this 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.290
 it might not happen if you go back to 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.290
 the full-time rings a bad 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.630
 news for all batista fans 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.090
 at a recent event at los angeles 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.090
 to promote the 2k video game 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.020
 www.supermicro.com the following to what 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.970
 Regarding if you are worried about not 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.850
 be so fashionable when I return to the ring 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.390
 I'm not worried about that I do not 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.060
 worry about those things so I think I do not 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.390
 worries that the fans are not there yes 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.810
 they are will be I am very lucky to 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.310
 to be able to go out there I love wrestling 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.250
 but if the public hates me when 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.010
 come back there will be no problem I will do any 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.950
 another thing about a possible rivalry 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.840
 with brock lesnar brock lesnar is now 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.930
 same over any of the 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.450
 stars of the wwf brock lesnar is al 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.970
 only I want is the fight that I 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.459
 I want to think that that fight will be 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:01.980
 august totally different from what was seen 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:03.090
 in the universe of www is the combat that 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.540
 I want 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.730
 media close to the wwf comment that 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.980
 both triple h and vince mcmahon 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.530
 they agree that they leave ambrosi dolph 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.660
 ziggler said rollins brave today to you 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.120
 román rain are the future of the company 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.400
 it is rumored that above all they have 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.739
 enough hopes put in two ex 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.080
 members of the shield on the one hand 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.660
 would be said rollins that for many is 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.239
 the new gm punk of this generation 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.610
 on the other hand we would find the hand 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.030
 ambrosi since it had been a long time 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.680
 the wwf did not have a character like him and 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.260
 his great resemblance in the quadrilaterals 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.750
 with check roberts and roddy piper them 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.630
 very much like triple hy vince mcmahon 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.329
 that's how it's talked about, though I also think 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.670
 what should be caesar or about 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.980
 similar to cmp I can not say 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.019
 exactly yes because right now it's 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.629
 chupamedia with authority and has not 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.610
 had no good promo let's hope that 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.579
 in the not too distant future start at 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.310
 work alone but be both ambrós 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.069
 he had good charisma techniques what 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.900
 they have all fuck román reigns is very 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.870
 overrated and I do not like that 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.180
 because in the long run it will end up boring and 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.430
 will not let others advance so 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.859
 otherwise he's going to bury him and finally 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.320
 dolph ziggler and everyone knows that is one 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.120
 of my favorite fighters although their 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.000
 future depends on not having again 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.330
 a concussion a while ago the 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.030
 wwdc said that they do not give opportunities to 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.949
 dolph ziggler for its constants 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.229
 concussions but how is this 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.780
 a great talent and people support him 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.840
 they gave another opportunity, I hope that 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.419
 nothing bad will happen good people 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.669
 these were the news of the day if they 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.280
