00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
a mission style look I used five quarter

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.290 
a mission style look I used five quarter
inch<00:00:51.010> deck<00:00:51.309> boards<00:00:51.699> they're<00:00:51.940> a<00:00:51.969> little<00:00:52.210> bit

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300

inch deck boards they're a little bit
thicker<00:00:52.570> than<00:00:52.719> 1<00:00:53.019> by<00:00:53.199> material<00:00:53.679> and<00:00:53.859> a<00:00:54.070> little

they<00:00:56.559> are<00:00:56.589> the<00:00:56.739> perfect<00:00:57.280> in-between

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.170 

I<00:01:02.890> started<00:01:03.890> by<00:01:04.010> sanding<00:01:04.430> them<00:01:04.580> smooth<00:01:04.910> with<00:01:05.150> a

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
I started by sanding them smooth with a

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.770 
I started by sanding them smooth with a
belt<00:01:05.390> sander<00:01:09.670> then<00:01:10.670> cut<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.150> rounded<00:01:11.600> edge

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
belt sander then cut the rounded edge

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.140 
belt sander then cut the rounded edge
and<00:01:12.050> adjusted<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:12.920> saw<00:01:13.190> so<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.610> width<00:01:13.850> would

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
and adjusted the saw so the width would

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.880 
and adjusted the saw so the width would
match<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.660> thickness<00:01:14.900> of<00:01:15.230> the<00:01:15.350> boards<00:01:15.680> in

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
match the thickness of the boards in

out and fasten them together I've

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.050 
out and fasten them together I've
started<00:02:16.380> by<00:02:16.560> clamping<00:02:16.980> straight<00:02:17.520> edge<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.880> one

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
of this first up right so I'm using a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.720 
of this first up right so I'm using a
square<00:02:27.470> just<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.650> make<00:02:28.800> sure<00:02:29.040> we're<00:02:29.250> good<00:02:29.459> and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
square just to make sure we're good and

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.410 
square just to make sure we're good and
we<00:02:30.540> are<00:02:30.720> now<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:32.520> get<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.730> proper<00:02:33.120> spacing

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
we are now to get the proper spacing

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.810 
we are now to get the proper spacing
using<00:02:34.200> just<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.530> piece<00:02:34.800> of<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.040> 3/4<00:02:35.670> inch

using just a piece of that 3/4 inch
thick<00:02:35.940> stock<00:02:36.480> we're<00:02:37.020> going<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.200> use<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:37.440> just

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
thick stock we're going to use this just

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.070 
thick stock we're going to use this just
to<00:02:37.739> roughly<00:02:38.220> spaced<00:02:38.640> out<00:02:38.850> all<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.989> the

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080

uprights don't have to be perfect at
this<00:02:41.580> point<00:02:41.880> when<00:02:42.570> I<00:02:42.630> add<00:02:42.750> some<00:02:42.900> glue<00:02:43.110> later

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
this point when I add some glue later

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.050 
this point when I add some glue later
we're<00:02:44.010> just<00:02:44.160> gonna<00:02:44.250> go<00:02:44.430> ahead<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.670> lay<00:02:44.880> this

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
we're just gonna go ahead and lay this

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.440 
we're just gonna go ahead and lay this
spacer<00:02:45.510> out<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.930> then<00:02:46.769> but<00:02:47.130> each<00:02:47.370> piece<00:02:47.730> up<00:02:48.060> to

spacer out and then but each piece up to

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.840 
spacer out and then but each piece up to
it<00:02:48.680> then<00:02:49.680> we'll<00:02:50.040> get<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.250> stapler<00:02:50.550> out<00:02:50.670> and

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
it then we'll get the stapler out and

00:02:50.850 --> 00:03:15.620 
it then we'll get the stapler out and
staple<00:02:51.180> everything<00:02:51.450> together

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.210 

to<00:03:16.630> attach<00:03:16.960> the<00:03:17.170> stringers<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.710> like<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.100> use

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
to attach the stringers I like to use

time to add the shelves on our finished
piece<00:04:08.139> I<00:04:08.379> used<00:04:08.650> 1<00:04:09.040> by<00:04:09.189> 8<00:04:09.370> pressure<00:04:09.730> treated

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090

you can't find 1 by 8 pressure treated

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.300 
you can't find 1 by 8 pressure treated
just<00:04:16.120> use<00:04:16.329> 1<00:04:16.600> by<00:04:16.630> fours<00:04:17.049> cut<00:04:17.440> them<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.680> 3<00:04:18.070> feet

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
just use 1 by fours cut them to 3 feet

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.800 
just use 1 by fours cut them to 3 feet
long<00:04:18.549> then<00:04:18.850> we're<00:04:18.940> gonna<00:04:19.030> use<00:04:19.120> these<00:04:19.389> for<00:04:19.660> our

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
long then we're gonna use these for our

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.010 
long then we're gonna use these for our
middle<00:04:20.139> and<00:04:20.579> our<00:04:21.579> bottom<00:04:21.940> shelves<00:04:22.210> now<00:04:22.750> our

middle and our bottom shelves now our

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.180 
middle and our bottom shelves now our
top<00:04:23.229> shelf<00:04:23.470> is<00:04:23.560> going<00:04:23.680> to<00:04:23.740> be<00:04:23.830> just<00:04:23.979> a<00:04:24.070> little

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
top shelf is going to be just a little

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.589 
top shelf is going to be just a little
bit<00:04:24.370> narrower<00:04:24.639> so<00:04:25.030> we'll<00:04:25.180> measure<00:04:25.389> for<00:04:25.570> that

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
bit narrower so we'll measure for that

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.900 
bit narrower so we'll measure for that
coming<00:04:25.990> up<00:04:26.110> but<00:04:26.440> use<00:04:26.860> clamps<00:04:27.430> in<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.729> meantime

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
coming up but use clamps in the meantime

on<00:05:08.680> the<00:05:09.040> bottom<00:05:09.370> you<00:05:09.550> can<00:05:09.580> add<00:05:09.820> an<00:05:09.940> extra<00:05:10.300> shelf

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
on the bottom you can add an extra shelf

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.600 
on the bottom you can add an extra shelf
cut<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:11.020> fit<00:05:11.200> between<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.770> ends<00:05:12.130> this<00:05:12.430> will

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
cut to fit between the ends this will

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.340 
cut to fit between the ends this will
provide<00:05:12.940> some<00:05:13.180> extra<00:05:13.660> storage<00:05:13.870> space<00:05:14.080> for

moving side-to-side we're going to add a

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.360 
moving side-to-side we're going to add a
simple<00:05:25.479> brace<00:05:25.840> system<00:05:26.229> to<00:05:26.319> the<00:05:26.410> back<00:05:26.590> we<00:05:27.069> start

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
simple brace system to the back we start

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.100 
simple brace system to the back we start
by<00:05:27.550> measuring<00:05:27.880> and<00:05:28.210> marking<00:05:28.389> the<00:05:28.630> center<00:05:28.990> of

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
by measuring and marking the center of

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.930 
by measuring and marking the center of
the<00:05:29.199> top<00:05:29.410> shelf<00:05:29.740> on<00:05:29.860> the<00:05:29.979> back<00:05:30.190> of<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.490> unit

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.460 

then<00:05:36.940> use<00:05:37.240> a<00:05:37.270> piece<00:05:37.539> of<00:05:37.569> wood<00:05:37.840> cut<00:05:38.169> from<00:05:38.380> the

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
then use a piece of wood cut from the

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.890 
then use a piece of wood cut from the
deck<00:05:38.650> board<00:05:38.889> at<00:05:39.099> a<00:05:39.130> diagonal<00:05:39.610> mark<00:05:40.509> the<00:05:40.660> top

deck board at a diagonal mark the top
and<00:05:41.169> bottom<00:05:41.319> and<00:05:41.680> cut<00:05:42.009> the<00:05:42.160> angles<00:05:44.430> make<00:05:45.430> a

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
and bottom and cut the angles make a

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.460 
and bottom and cut the angles make a
second<00:05:45.970> brace<00:05:46.120> in<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.360> same<00:05:46.599> manner

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.980 

drill<00:05:53.160> pilot<00:05:53.370> holes<00:05:53.580> and<00:05:54.090> install<00:05:54.270> screws<00:05:54.780> to

drill pilot holes and install screws to

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:02.180 
drill pilot holes and install screws to
hold<00:05:55.200> them<00:05:55.350> in<00:05:55.470> place<00:06:00.710> now<00:06:01.710> if<00:06:01.770> you<00:06:01.860> find<00:06:02.040> that

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
hold them in place now if you find that

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.980 
hold them in place now if you find that
the<00:06:02.340> weight<00:06:02.670> of<00:06:02.700> your<00:06:02.940> plants<00:06:03.300> is<00:06:03.420> causing<00:06:03.840> any
