just need to figure something different
out<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.970> think<00:03:57.239> you<00:03:57.360> could<00:03:57.510> go<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.110> quatre<00:03:58.350> pic

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
out I think you could go to a quatre pic

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.680 
out I think you could go to a quatre pic
stage<00:03:58.830> I<00:03:59.100> mean<00:03:59.700> what<00:04:00.060> kind<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.239> cake<00:04:00.570> do<00:04:00.630> you

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
stage I mean what kind of cake do you

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.850 
stage I mean what kind of cake do you
think<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:00.930> should<00:04:01.230> be<00:04:01.320> looking<00:04:01.530> for<00:04:01.590> though

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
think you should be looking for though

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.180 
think you should be looking for though
so<00:04:02.330> this<00:04:03.330> is<00:04:03.360> kind<00:04:03.660> of<00:04:03.690> like<00:04:03.810> when<00:04:04.170> when<00:04:05.040> your

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
so this is kind of like when when your

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.130 
so this is kind of like when when your
foot<00:04:05.370> when<00:04:05.520> I<00:04:05.580> was<00:04:05.760> fighting<00:04:05.940> chic<00:04:06.330> it's<00:04:06.900> kind

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
foot when I was fighting chic it's kind

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.449 
foot when I was fighting chic it's kind
of<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.350> same<00:04:07.470> concept<00:04:08.010> where<00:04:08.160> it's<00:04:08.280> like

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
of the same concept where it's like

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.270 
of the same concept where it's like
personally<00:04:09.209> I<00:04:09.240> can<00:04:09.450> do

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
personally I can do

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.699 
personally I can do
what<00:04:10.430> you<00:04:10.550> can<00:04:10.760> do<00:04:10.850> to<00:04:10.970> rosalina<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:12.530> don't

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
what you can do to rosalina so you don't

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:13.809 
what you can do to rosalina so you don't
want<00:04:12.890> really<00:04:13.040> want<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.280> take<00:04:13.400> her<00:04:13.550> to<00:04:13.670> town

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
want really want to take her to town

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.030 
want really want to take her to town
city<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.450> that's<00:04:14.600> like<00:04:14.840> you're<00:04:15.530> taking<00:04:15.680> some

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
city and that's like you're taking some

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.680 
city and that's like you're taking some
of<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.310> battle<00:04:16.730> battle<00:04:16.970> out<00:04:17.239> of<00:04:17.269> your<00:04:17.540> control

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
of the battle battle out of your control

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.500 
of the battle battle out of your control
so<00:04:18.620> what<00:04:18.829> I<00:04:18.859> would<00:04:19.010> say<00:04:19.310> is<00:04:19.579> go<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:20.209> large

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
so what I would say is go to a large

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.290 
so what I would say is go to a large
stage<00:04:21.370> go<00:04:22.370> to<00:04:22.430> duck<00:04:22.669> hunt<00:04:22.910> go<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.240> battlefield

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300

died but not quite I guess the fact that
smash<00:05:34.580> got<00:05:34.820> wasn't<00:05:35.120> in<00:05:35.210> rage<00:05:35.390> was<00:05:35.570> the<00:05:35.690> only

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
smash got wasn't in rage was the only

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.170 
smash got wasn't in rage was the only
reason<00:05:36.410> he<00:05:36.500> didn't<00:05:36.740> die<00:05:36.830> yeah<00:05:37.280> and<00:05:37.580> there<00:05:38.090> it

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
reason he didn't die yeah and there it

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.540 
reason he didn't die yeah and there it
is<00:05:38.210> he<00:05:38.419> reacts<00:05:38.720> to<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:39.050> neutral<00:05:39.229> air<00:05:39.590> again

smash got able to pull it off with a
character<00:07:05.690> that<00:07:05.810> I<00:07:06.200> believe<00:07:06.620> wins<00:07:06.830> the

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:06.920 
character that I believe wins the

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.130 
character that I believe wins the
matchup<00:07:07.100> so<00:07:07.520> there<00:07:08.210> it<00:07:08.300> is<00:07:08.390> so<00:07:08.600> now<00:07:08.750> we've<00:07:08.930> got

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:09.140 
matchup so there it is so now we've got

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.840 
matchup so there it is so now we've got
a<00:07:10.130> lot<00:07:10.790> and<00:07:11.150> snow
