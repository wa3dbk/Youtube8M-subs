00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.350
 toborg across the map i believe that 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.660
 a bio 1 web does not suspect 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.879
 really from the beginning to the end 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.760
 and really the reaction evolved 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.619
 wrote like such a tunte but 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.360
 clip number two is much better 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.790
 but also have a degree on 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.140

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.820
 good movement can not be there 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.530
 you have to manage first 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.250

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.840
