Becky<00:01:20.400> Farley<00:01:20.970> has<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> theory<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:22.110> start

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
Becky Farley has a theory that we start

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.240 
Becky Farley has a theory that we start
by<00:01:22.619> moving<00:01:23.220> big<00:01:23.990> that's<00:01:24.990> about<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.650> likely<00:01:25.950> as

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
by moving big that's about as likely as

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.020 
by moving big that's about as likely as

it's the message from your brain and it
takes<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.200> mighty<00:01:49.590> effort<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.490> want<00:01:50.820> to
