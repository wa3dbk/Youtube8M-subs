00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:17.340
 for installation in the bath diamond 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.090
 easier and apply already cooked 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.410
 in advance 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.110
 custom made shelves which 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.590
 already pre-dried well 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:32.489
 prepared without any processing 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.930
 material made here we have shelves 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.750
 made of pine 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.680
 I will note from light pine and pine which 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.930
 between 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.500
 annual rings maximum 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.500
 the distance this pine variety is brought to us 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.680
 In general from Siberia and such here 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.960
 light very, very light tone 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.480
 the product is obtained here because of this 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.879
 pines we exactly used here for 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.739
 production of bath shelves it means 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.960
 the tree is very fast warming up fast 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.570
 warming up, that is, it is in itself big 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.200
 mass do not contain dense dense 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.420
 wood 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.689
 gets warm pretty quickly and how 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.060
 say nice to sit like this 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.460
 here we are making a bench out of it 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.020
 yourself then pay attention here are the wolves 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.659
 which we installed in the bath 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.670
 this is already our many years of experience 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:39.030
 these shelves are developed here they are 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:41.250
 made from from boards from boards of 40 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.150
 Vki in general in its pure form is already 40 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.770
 after processing 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.770
 and we buy a board which we have 45 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.409
 millimeters because our processing 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.579
 we take some thickness 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.729
 so here are the shelves we are doing with a gap 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.710
 shelves on the shelf for guys doing a gap 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.490
 so that when 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.960
 to heat the bath so that all together so that all 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.549
 warmed up faster and when here 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.400
 suppress people couples so he is good 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:14.700
 dispersed in the pair room is necessary 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.380
 so that the shelf was a large number 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.989
 There are such cracks so that it does not hinder 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.940
 circulation into this here wave of steam which 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.110
 you fell and immediately the wave went all over 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.590
 the room quickly ran away 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.690
 and if the regiment is deaf then you give it 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.210
 before the nose 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.450
 in the very stick in your pocket and go out and to me 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.060
 and it comes as a walnut and has no effect 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.190
 already here are the tracks that we 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.500
 we apply here we stack 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.510
 tracks of different sizes means like this 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.730
 type of grilles on the floor we install 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.550
 it means they are made of larch 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.270
 here these here and so we do from 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.850
 larches 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:06.820
 from the very couch bananas that can 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:10.420
 lie pride panic and we have for special 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.900
 for special customers we apply and from 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.610
 cedar 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:19.800
 here we have made the bath shelf until 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:23.290
 we have made of cedar and that means them 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.620
 we install for an additional fee 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.760
 already here they are already from the board from the board 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.390
 more massive 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.570
 in general, but they have one minus they 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.299
 warm up longer and pop except for 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.590
 words say nicely on them and 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.769
 we complete with doors 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.220
 before bath we complete our doors 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.890
 own production covered 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.739
 covered doors from the outside and inside of the front 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.360
 layer of moss df means at the request of the customer 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.340
 but you still need to varnish 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.680
 like when you start 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.930
 enjoy baths and standard 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.720
 standard doors 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.060
 we still take the standard doors 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.269
 third-party suppliers have such doors 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:12.070
 they set them fake but they themselves 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:14.709
 show a very bad side of all forces 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.100
 and sweets here these components here 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:23.020
 which we see we see in the markets on 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.720
 markets as well as here's how these 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.840
 his windows like him too they say like 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.360
 they say that they are blind all this for a bath 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.729
 this is complete nonsense how to be i said it 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.249
 In general, the moody's tag is such nonsense 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.169
 use on bath 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.909
 you should not have a blank window 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.859
 well sealed 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:44.659
 well and the vent which 

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:46.309
 you can open it is desirable that 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:49.489
 the vent hole were pinned and behind 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:51.409
 stove means that's what it means that's what 

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:53.329
 his tail and I wanted to carry on to tell 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:56.659
 about these shelves here means regiment 

00:04:53.329 --> 00:04:59.749
 must be done so that if she 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:01.489
 will be fixed attached to the wall by 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:03.049
 its end mom have long been such 

00:05:01.489 --> 00:05:06.529
 bearing capacity thats that's it all 

00:05:03.049 --> 00:05:08.449
 length to the village of the village that fits 5 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:11.029
 men sit down on her now if they sit down 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:14.119
 on this shelf it will be without a central 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.349
 support and she has to stand them here 

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:19.039
 such very basic principles 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:21.349
 construction of bathrooms and bathroom shelves 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.029
 paths from these y lattices too so 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.339
 they should be called such that 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:27.110
 any woman could take them out of the bath 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:28.879
 so that their ruler can 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.809
 listen or just pick up 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:34.699
 elementary clean up to bring such 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:36.619
 most ordinary mail order 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:40.209
 As for components that we 

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:40.209
 use inside our bytes
