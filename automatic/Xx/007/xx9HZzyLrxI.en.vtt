00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 and if the dream of all kid but good 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.260
 It is also the gift that the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.020
 work 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.410
 always they want to go forward to 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.410
 the adversities 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.910
 what advice he always gave me gave me my 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.829
 old and they are giving me fruits that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.419
 you felt when it was offered because I think 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.800
 that I know is that he is feeling as 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.470
 that this presence is strengthening 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.710
 yours in the selection that nobody 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.280
 discuss that you are going to be within 23 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.469
 I'm not always grateful to the group so much 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.329
 my colleagues like as the coach 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.100
 the trust 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.949
 It is not easy to enter a group where 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.630
 where you are almost armed where there is 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.580
 big star 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.230
 and this group for the contribution of the moment 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.810
 beyond that most are boy who 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.450
 I know of juveniles beyond that the 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.360
 coach did not know him I guess he 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.460
 I did not have much seen myself and I 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.070
 He gave me the confidence and I think that thanks 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.739
 to me that I can give 100% and 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.540
 keep me from the outside when you 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.090
 personally you did not go back 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.190
 crazy for wanting to be you were living 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.870
 the times of consuming do yourself in the 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.670
 anderlecht and in his time when he knew 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.310
 that he had to take the insistent step 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.869
 so good he went to a football more 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.750
 most seen and even more than one row 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.210
 greater and that's how you saw it 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.900
 try to put a near goal 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.970
 after 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.640
 from June of last year when it touched me 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.170
 re-quoting the selection 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.180
 try to modify the goal to exit 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.150
 of the market in the next market of 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.160
 summer to pass a league more seen where 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.560
 the technician can follow me and where 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.000
 I can have real competition from 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.700
 what of what the selection what 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.850
 demands the selection after that 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.740
 we aim at the goal of entering the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.110
 next call that were the 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.830
 I think Paraguay's parties do not 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.040
 Colombia but there 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.020
 and after that we aspire to be 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.340
 consolidated from there to November that I was going to 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.400
 be very important to what was the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.260
 group 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.700
 we always try to set goals 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.310
 close was the reality we never wanted 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.690
 go beyond what we were achieving and 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.360
 Now that you are inside you have already 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.890
 started the final stage how are you 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.930
 living especially this first week 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.920
 of training already with a view to the cup 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.170
 world well surely the week more 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.640
 beyond work it was very intense 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.800
 We had a lot of fun we had a nice time 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.630
 moment while being there 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.730
 bolt and we met again between 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.680
 all with the anecdotes the jokes all 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.080
 that which increasingly strengthens the group 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.970
 but good and starting this week starts 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.120
 to run a little bit of the little ribs 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.880
 that between a week is traveled and in 15 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.560
 days would be debuting throughout your 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.350
 career has been part of many groups 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.150
 in teams in youth teams in 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.980
 other kind of selections like the time 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.060
 I live strong as a group 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.040
 after 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.370
 we come half touched in some young people 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.310
 injured and that but it seems to me that the 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.040
 group strength will be able to cope 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.319
 all that and we think that's the most 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.209
 important you see Argentina to be 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.160
 fighting there among the first four 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.800
 today with the team that there is or is a football 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.780
 increasingly competitive, surely 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.300
 it's more competitive but that's the 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.130
 objective the objective raised try 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.650
 get between the four is not going to be 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.330
 nothing easy because we have a group that 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.810
 beyond that is not very showy are 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.670
 hard team but good we trust in the 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.250
 power and potential that we have to know 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.830
 the rivals from bosnia iran and nigeria 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.380
 only to see them and if I deposited I will know 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.810
 apart I have lazio colleagues who 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.989
 so much that they play in nigeria as with 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.610
 you will tell me, we do not have much 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.850
 a lot of material to see we have seen 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.280
 some parties but not so much 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.570
 but good about on the go we're going to 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.330
 go see further that will go in that 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.920
 second game will be analyzed later and 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.690
 the first one already begins to work in 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.920
 base to that another week last week 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.930
 we have worked a bit a part 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.810
 tactical and already this week you start to 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.330
 work more in face in that then I with 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.310
 Iran nigeria match material 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.200
 surely we will work on that day that 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.570
 I already have that it feels to have the 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.070
 leoneses next door playing in the same 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.670
 team 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.680
 we as a player already know what 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.870
 is and if he does not keep shining at times 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.250
 we have training but 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.880
 we enjoyed the characters 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.260
 because sometimes we do not ask the question 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.330
 how is it possible that this boy is 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.520
 number one in the world of what is it 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.070
 so simple that what we enjoy 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.930
 us to see those things and I do not know 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.790
 it happens you must know that you are the same 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.890
 boy that we met the 18 years of 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.490
 get into the scheme that pretends that 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:54.190
 sailing is not difficult very difficult 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.680
 problem the difficulty is the level of 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.990
 the players that is not easy at all 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.870
 the opposite of competing mostly to my 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.490
 put but good as I say it is 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.930
 surely that with patience 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.970
 supporting the ideal that always you 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.890
 play is what is today what 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.120
 important and the one that I have to play is 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.240
 feel supported by the one in the 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.610
 Bank 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.250
 and if he touches the opportunity as he has 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.500
 touched try to answer more than 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.419
 nothing to the team the best way of how 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.319
 candidate besides Argentina 's 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:27.169
 global i 'm strong strong but germany 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:29.630
 Brazil and Spain back I think so 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:33.249
 which are the teams that come with a 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.809
 long work project 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:37.719
 with players who have finished a 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:39.609
 great level then you start to 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:41.949
 take as a candidate of italy over 

00:05:39.609 --> 00:05:43.089
 all thanks above all to win the cup 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.669
 confederations spain is the last 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:48.219
 champion and germany comes comes 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.489
 proving that it is a power 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:50.489
 important 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.680
 beyond all that I trust the hundred 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:58.189
 percent of the 22 companies the 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.139
 I know that we are working well 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:03.350
 trying to correct mistakes that we have 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.120
 had eliminatory 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.650
 but I think we 're going to go well and we're going 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.650
 to be able to be a good cup
