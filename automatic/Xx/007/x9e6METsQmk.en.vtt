00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.449
 Welcome to a new motto review 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.449
 this time it's about gregs lightning 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.010
 acted in a gregs lightning murder 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.760
 It's about a murder of you two new ones 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.189
 adds light sources as well 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.050
 extensions for the industry power 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.430
 Unfortunately, I do not know murder for you 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.099
 really with the involve us 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.539
 different things only sting 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.090
 the things in front of you in vanilla 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.559
 further bring minecraft namely once 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.470
 the south that they left you and 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.390
 once a light what with one stop 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.480
 insulation or not 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.489
 Damming a well is lit only like that 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.260
 as long as you want there are certain 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.510
 things and that's how it works 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.540
 So let's just start 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.780
 with the first, namely the floodlight 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:56.170
 also called quick pity and that's just 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.180
 simply a simple light beckons with 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.860
 which your reacting switches tackle 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.199
 Can it go from the now 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.570
 paints a set 15,000 make up for 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.790
 do we see already I have 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.200
 a little something and if I tried 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.840
 the whole thing you can already see that 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.850
 Light is very intense throughout 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.400
 but you notice more if you are in it 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.200
 a hollowed out room makes out and 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.479
 therefore reflects the a bit more of 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.680
 sensor not so extreme 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.009
 but unfortunately a bit in part 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.270
 you can see it not as me 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.939
 optimal what you always imagines 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.439
 but otherwise quite good 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.479
 power the whole so you need it 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:36.369
 relaxed and you get that so 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.600
 shows the floodlight that is yet to come 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.000
 times at the end 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.759
 in the whole then I once have that 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.170
 Kabarett sorry for that needs her gas nose 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.020
 and also keep the other people here 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.759
 and Gastmahl so imagine you so the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.770
 important thing is once you do that 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.049
 I want to do this here now 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.299
 just 9 weeks for it first time 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.409
 a bucket water we go here 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:01.090
 And we also need calcium for that 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.700
 You can get calcium if you like 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.859
 So make me boni you get 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.530
 by their droppings and therefore bonuses this at 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.020
 me in 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.300
 you can also do that with carol 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.840
 boni cup with two stars therefore burns 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.370
 you get calcium for kabi if so 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.470
 now here a water bucket reinlegt 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.580
 could it ever have water in it and 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.530
 If I am here for example one now 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.650
 Expose and then here a switch to 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.319
 gossip is the whole already 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.610
 so you can already see that is coming 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.290
 a bit off and if that stops 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.510
 is burned off goes the light also keeps 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.850
 yes from the halt at last as a cool thing 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.720
 I have shown that power recipe 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.760
 I have times shows true 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.140
 And yes that's just the thing we too 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.200
 now again very briefly as well as the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.330
 small tunnel around it just us 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.680
 Now just a little bit down and 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.760
 we look at the whole one like if that 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.670
 it looks like if you just give us a look 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.019
 it's not that we can 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.269
 it's easy to become whole easy 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.370
 let's see how it looks like 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.290
 if down here 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.750
 Just let them shine 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.739
 be tickled in any case 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.330
 stronger than other light object I build 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.360
 the times briefly makes there once a 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.560
 small cars so there we are mine 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.750
 just noticed that you 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.269
 These blocks can also arrange for 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.100
 Example as ceiling lamp or stop 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.420
 simply as light, which brushes forward 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.220
 as you can see, it really is 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.510
 very very bright with three pieces i could 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.670
 always say i just want to have one and 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.170
 it's still very bright that cool 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.049
 You can do this whole country too 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.120
 bring in just as a ceiling lamp and 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.350
 then briefly predict and look good 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.239
 but that's just not down to that 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.430
 a bit disturbing wait we have 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.299
 then you can, for example 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.500
 ceiling lamp use what, of course 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.450
 very interesting 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.030
 But now I think says 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.380
 Ceiling lamp you have very cool out clear 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.670
 maybe you can change the texts 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.200
 even if you know it 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.420
 you loosen up and you already have it 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.760
 a cool ceiling lamp that something from me 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.079
 I give the place 3 vision points since I 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.459
 you can find much more 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.560
 get out of this place is already 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:59.170
 really cool so really cool 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.170
 and we are in the next video bye
