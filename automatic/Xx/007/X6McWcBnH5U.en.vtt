he's got some really great arm
articulations<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.200> both<00:01:50.100> these<00:01:50.250> shoulders

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
articulations is both these shoulders

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.190 
articulations is both these shoulders
are<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.259> ball<00:01:52.259> joints<00:01:53.360> basically<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.990> ball

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
are on ball joints basically it's a ball

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.920 
are on ball joints basically it's a ball
joint<00:01:55.470> setup<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.549> atomically<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:57.869> a

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
joint setup and atomically but it's a

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.499 
joint setup and atomically but it's a
swivel<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.619> hinge<00:01:58.890> combine<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.640> allows<00:02:00.299> for

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
swivel and a hinge combine it allows for

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.870 
swivel and a hinge combine it allows for
a<00:02:00.540> ball<00:02:00.750> joint<00:02:00.990> movement<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.399> both<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.640> those

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
a ball joint movement so both of those

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.690 
a ball joint movement so both of those
set<00:02:03.509> up<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:05.009> heads<00:02:05.219> only<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.610> a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
set up like that the heads only on a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.930 
set up like that the heads only on a
swivel<00:02:05.969> which<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.840> pretty<00:02:06.990> cool

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.600 

it<00:02:10.510> doesn't<00:02:10.869> really<00:02:11.020> make<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.470> much

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
it doesn't really make that much

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.560 
it doesn't really make that much

suit<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.050> box<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.530> probably<00:02:14.830> wouldn't<00:02:15.100> go

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
suit this box you probably wouldn't go

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.620 
suit this box you probably wouldn't go
to<00:02:15.280> move<00:02:15.520> your<00:02:15.700> head<00:02:15.820> much<00:02:16.030> either<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:19.240> waist

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
to move your head much either the waist

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.860 
to move your head much either the waist
moves<00:02:20.170> it's<00:02:20.800> on<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.950> swivel<00:02:21.250> as<00:02:21.550> well<00:02:21.790> as<00:02:22.720> you

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
moves it's on a swivel as well as you

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.100 
moves it's on a swivel as well as you
can<00:02:22.990> see<00:02:23.050> on<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.350> back<00:02:23.500> these<00:02:23.800> sort<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:25.110> part

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
can see on the back these sort of part

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.560 
can see on the back these sort of part
of<00:02:26.200> his<00:02:26.290> mechanics<00:02:26.440> on<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.010> back<00:02:27.220> there<00:02:27.570> sort

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
of his mechanics on the back there sort

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.390 
of his mechanics on the back there sort
of<00:02:28.600> encroach<00:02:29.140> on<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.710> lower<00:02:29.920> half<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
of encroach on the lower half of the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.760 
of encroach on the lower half of the
body<00:02:30.490> so<00:02:31.000> when<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.270> when<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.260> got<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.530> twist

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
body so when you when you got to twist

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.340 
body so when you when you got to twist
it<00:02:33.010> they<00:02:33.520> get<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.910> road<00:02:36.990> this<00:02:37.990> is<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.110> bit<00:02:38.260> of

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
it they get in the road this is a bit of

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.900 
it they get in the road this is a bit of
restriction<00:02:38.800> but<00:02:38.920> hey<00:02:39.100> it's<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.580> don't<00:02:39.820> think

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
restriction but hey it's I don't think

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.360 
restriction but hey it's I don't think
it<00:02:40.150> really<00:02:40.560> interferes<00:02:41.560> with<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.950> figure

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
it really interferes with the figure

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.220 
it really interferes with the figure
that<00:02:42.490> March<00:02:42.790> which<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.240> pretty<00:02:43.390> good<00:02:45.780> yeah<00:02:46.780> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
that March which is pretty good yeah the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.950 
that March which is pretty good yeah the
yes<00:02:47.800> I<00:02:47.920> got<00:02:47.950> swivel<00:02:48.280> there<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.180> legs<00:02:49.810> are

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
yes I got swivel there the the legs are

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.810 
yes I got swivel there the the legs are
on<00:02:50.020> a<00:02:50.050> ball-joint<00:02:50.320> well<00:02:51.190> it's<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.430> book<00:02:51.610> like<00:02:51.790> I

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
on a ball-joint well it's a book like I

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.070 
on a ball-joint well it's a book like I
said<00:02:52.060> as<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.210> board<00:02:52.450> Joan<00:02:52.660> but<00:02:52.840> it's<00:02:52.930> really

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
said as a board Joan but it's really

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.030 
said as a board Joan but it's really
just<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.470> swivel<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.130> pivot<00:02:54.520> combined<00:02:55.030> that

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
just a swivel and a pivot combined that

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.260 
just a swivel and a pivot combined that
basically<00:02:57.040> forwards<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.610> motion<00:02:57.910> of<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.090> ball

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
basically forwards the motion of a ball

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.500 
basically forwards the motion of a ball
joint<00:02:59.250> again<00:03:00.250> you're<00:03:00.670> pretty<00:03:00.910> restricted

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
joint again you're pretty restricted

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.690 
joint again you're pretty restricted
only<00:03:01.600> because<00:03:02.080> of<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.920> bulkiness<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.580> the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
only because of the the bulkiness of the

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.050 
only because of the the bulkiness of the
legs<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:06.100> knees<00:03:08.370> same<00:03:09.370> sort<00:03:09.670> of<00:03:09.760> setup

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
legs the knees same sort of setup

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.820 
legs the knees same sort of setup
actually<00:03:10.600> ball<00:03:11.560> joint<00:03:13.110> even<00:03:14.110> though<00:03:14.260> actual

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
actually ball joint even though actual

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.710 
actually ball joint even though actual
anatomically<00:03:17.400> humans<00:03:18.400> don't<00:03:19.090> have<00:03:19.390> ball

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
anatomically humans don't have ball

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.170 
anatomically humans don't have ball
jointed<00:03:20.170> knees<00:03:20.230> but<00:03:21.190> they've<00:03:21.400> set<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.820> up<00:03:21.940> so

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
jointed knees but they've set it up so

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.530 
jointed knees but they've set it up so
it's<00:03:22.360> sort<00:03:22.480> of<00:03:22.660> you<00:03:22.989> get<00:03:23.170> a<00:03:23.200> bit<00:03:23.410> of<00:03:23.440> pronation

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
it's sort of you get a bit of pronation

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.500 
it's sort of you get a bit of pronation
the<00:03:25.540> leg<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.989> feet<00:03:26.620> turn<00:03:26.920> in<00:03:27.100> windsor<00:03:27.580> and

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
the leg the feet turn in windsor and

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.790 
the leg the feet turn in windsor and
yeah<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.690> suppose<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.230> just<00:03:29.260> gives<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.650> extra

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
yeah I suppose it just gives that extra

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.190 
yeah I suppose it just gives that extra
bit<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.250> possibility<00:03:30.940> but<00:03:31.060> hey<00:03:31.239> it<00:03:31.450> so<00:03:31.690> it's

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
bit of possibility but hey it so it's

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.150 
bit of possibility but hey it so it's
good<00:03:33.690> ankles<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:35.050> little<00:03:35.170> bit<00:03:35.470> of<00:03:35.560> movement<00:03:35.709> not

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
good ankles a little bit of movement not

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.530 
good ankles a little bit of movement not
much<00:03:36.570> bulkiness<00:03:37.570> again<00:03:38.050> prevents<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:39.540> I'm

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
much bulkiness again prevents that I'm

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.660 
much bulkiness again prevents that I'm
really<00:03:40.810> happy<00:03:41.110> with<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.950> paintwork<00:03:42.310> that

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
really happy with the the paintwork that

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.780 
really happy with the the paintwork that
darkness<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.360> sort<00:03:43.810> of<00:03:43.840> combined<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:44.800> the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
darkness of sort of combined the the

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.250 
darkness of sort of combined the the
natural<00:03:46.180> color<00:03:46.300> of<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.630> plastic<00:03:47.080> they've

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
natural color of the plastic they've

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.009 
natural color of the plastic they've
used<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:48.550> dye<00:03:48.730> they've<00:03:48.940> added<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:49.540> and

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
used the dye they've added to that and

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.120 
used the dye they've added to that and
they've<00:03:50.980> also<00:03:51.190> put<00:03:51.970> in<00:03:52.800> so<00:03:53.800> it's<00:03:53.980> like<00:03:54.100> a

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
they've also put in so it's like a

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.310 
they've also put in so it's like a
metallic<00:03:54.640> wash<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.480> give<00:03:55.630> him<00:03:55.720> that<00:03:55.870> sort<00:03:56.260> of

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
metallic wash to give him that sort of

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:04.910 
metallic wash to give him that sort of
rustic<00:03:59.250> rusty<00:04:00.250> sort<00:04:00.640> of<00:04:00.730> worn<00:04:01.510> look<00:04:01.780> I<00:04:01.989> suppose

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.560 

one<00:04:05.920> thing<00:04:06.130> I<00:04:06.310> was<00:04:06.430> like<00:04:06.880> pretty<00:04:07.090> happy<00:04:07.450> with

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
one thing I was like pretty happy with

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.190 
one thing I was like pretty happy with
was<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:09.060> know<00:04:10.060> just<00:04:10.269> his<00:04:10.390> feet<00:04:10.600> on<00:04:10.780> his<00:04:10.870> legs<00:04:11.080> are

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
was I know just his feet on his legs are

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.080 
was I know just his feet on his legs are
so<00:04:11.410> I<00:04:11.650> didn't<00:04:12.340> really<00:04:12.400> notice<00:04:12.700> it<00:04:12.850> in<00:04:13.000> the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
so I didn't really notice it in the

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.270 
so I didn't really notice it in the
movie<00:04:13.390> about<00:04:13.570> he's<00:04:13.810> kind<00:04:14.080> of<00:04:14.140> like<00:04:14.230> these<00:04:14.380> like

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
movie about he's kind of like these like

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.940 
movie about he's kind of like these like
belts<00:04:15.790> on<00:04:16.000> e<00:04:16.030> some<00:04:16.480> on<00:04:17.080> the<00:04:17.320> top<00:04:17.500> of<00:04:17.530> his<00:04:17.739> hip

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
belts on e some on the top of his hip

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.039 
belts on e some on the top of his hip
they<00:04:18.130> run<00:04:18.489> down<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.729> his<00:04:19.000> knee<00:04:19.270> on<00:04:19.299> both<00:04:19.720> legs

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
they run down to his knee on both legs

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.850 
they run down to his knee on both legs
and<00:04:20.979> I<00:04:21.070> suppose<00:04:21.400> it's<00:04:21.609> kind<00:04:21.850> of<00:04:21.940> like

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
and I suppose it's kind of like

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.990

anything was going to be flaming out of
his<00:05:05.219> arm<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:05.759> probably<00:05:06.330> being<00:05:06.599> on<00:05:06.750> this<00:05:06.960> side

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
his arm and probably being on this side

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:14.059

there's<00:05:08.159> no<00:05:08.779> sort<00:05:09.779> of<00:05:09.870> gas<00:05:10.620> tank<00:05:12.139> maybe<00:05:13.139> I<00:05:13.469> have

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 
there's no sort of gas tank maybe I have

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.820 
there's no sort of gas tank maybe I have
an<00:05:14.189> idea<00:05:14.479> maybe<00:05:15.479> this<00:05:15.810> feature<00:05:16.199> here<00:05:16.560> should

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
an idea maybe this feature here should

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.649 
an idea maybe this feature here should
have<00:05:16.949> probably<00:05:17.279> been<00:05:17.729> shaped<00:05:18.060> like<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.300> gas

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
have probably been shaped like a gas

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.709 
have probably been shaped like a gas
tank<00:05:19.279> then<00:05:20.279> it<00:05:20.400> would<00:05:20.520> look<00:05:20.639> a<00:05:20.969> little<00:05:21.479> bit

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
tank then it would look a little bit

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.269 
tank then it would look a little bit
more<00:05:21.900> realistic<00:05:22.259> just<00:05:22.650> bite<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:22.889> fact<00:05:23.189> that

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:23.279 
more realistic just bite the fact that

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.930 
more realistic just bite the fact that
looks<00:05:23.520> nothing<00:05:23.759> like<00:05:24.000> a<00:05:24.199> fire<00:05:25.669> apart<00:05:26.669> from<00:05:26.819> the

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
looks nothing like a fire apart from the

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.529 
looks nothing like a fire apart from the
fact<00:05:26.969> it's<00:05:27.330> orange<00:05:27.779> but<00:05:29.000> okay<00:05:30.000> that's<00:05:30.240> cool

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
fact it's orange but okay that's cool

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.149 
fact it's orange but okay that's cool
not<00:05:30.900> a<00:05:30.930> problem<00:05:31.199> but<00:05:31.710> yeah<00:05:31.830> that's<00:05:32.009> probably

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
not a problem but yeah that's probably

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:33.829 
not a problem but yeah that's probably
the<00:05:32.310> only<00:05:32.400> major<00:05:32.729> flaw<00:05:33.150> i<00:05:33.180> found<00:05:33.509> and<00:05:33.690> i<00:05:33.750> was
