00:00:00.479 --> 00:00:06.970
 good guys today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.900
 defeat the chechen leader and good follow 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.389
 tables that I have not presented and capture 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.240
 a trio what appears on the ranch believes 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.680
 how can I see the step as 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.210
 fast 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.670
 and what you have to do is capture it 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.400
 to the team of your environment fight to those of 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.160
 normal type more easily so nothing 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.140
 we capture it but 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.870
 as you see that I was training to be 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.809
 calls look and is training up 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.760
 level 13 and has fast attack counter 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.230
 and that later I also have got me 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.559
 pokemon as a principal at level 12 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.559
 I do not think 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.120
 and nothing is what we have to get 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.430
 at least 12 to 13 the river is worth it 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.710
 and then you're going to buy at least one 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.820
 portion 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.180
 I buy some more to have 53 I go 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.180
 to buy 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.510
 and they had already bought, so let's go to 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.510
 fitness center 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:21.750
 so quick because time is short or 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.750
 fast and we got to be in a 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.700
 Y 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.070
 let's fight against chile let's go 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.350
 start with the backlight on my shop 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.870
 case it's called is called luca and call it 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.910
 OK 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.320
 but it's a gift and what we're going to do 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.330
 It's going to be always use counter 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.140
 because counter is an attack that what 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:48.030
 it is that when it receives the blow 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.730
 the hit luke and he attacks the double or 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.680
 be the father receives double damage like this 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.020
 that you see that now more than another 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.630
 tackle is a critical hit of many 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.850
 they survive but on the counter thanks 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.939
 that critical hit also kills him 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.170
 and therefore did not rise to level 14 a year 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.670
 the one that is learned for the medium and cuban 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.490
 buy with palmer or you go to this 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.410
 gym left but good 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.620
 to have to train so much we call 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.040
 to the bar ezeiza with counter serves us 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:23.330
 now he pulled out for just to 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:26.150
 heal luke so he can get him out later 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.580
 you see from a position and it is born to fan without 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.500
 stress is stoking and then it makes us a 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.810
 placaje landed light kills it 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.100
 let's lose the insurance but good 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.680
 let's count on not doing all three 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.849
 there are some 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.579
 We try to shout at him everything 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.819
 we can with our other pokemon and already 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.609
 we take out 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.720
 luke and we do the counter again you see 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:52.350
 now do tackling 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.990
 and it does not kill me miraculously but with a 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.850
 already weakened counter and that's that easy 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:02.140
 we have spent the first gym and 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:06.160
 we have defeated the earth leader 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:10.959

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.840
