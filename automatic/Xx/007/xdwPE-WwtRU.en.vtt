00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.980

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:00.300
 Here's what the students showed me 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.570
 Which was 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.860
 It is said that this is the movement which adopted the old martial arts 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.480

 It is said that the pass will be faster 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:32.520
 A team with many inexperienced players and small players without physical strength 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:32.520
 Moreover, practice time was limited, it was a fate of seminary 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:41.070
 The speed of the pass and the endurance to run to the end were essential for the phew team 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:52.580
 Yoshino Kono met at such time 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:59.540
 It is a person who studied that tree of old martial arts for 40 years and knew the Japanese body completely 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:03.260
 The eating large teacher thought that it was possible for quick movement of the quick movement to be able to make a quick pass turn

 It is good to be able to move quickly Mr. Kono 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.520
 Shoulder blade wood 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:30.660
 In martial arts, it is very important for you to make quick movements that will not notice your enemies 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.660
 It is said that the scapula makes this movement possible 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.170
 After all it is important to say that the shoulder blade 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:42.310
 How efficiently do you use your body with your arms, not your arms ? 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:50.310
 It is coming Once attire normally not move 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:50.310
 The movement of the scapular bone not only the arm of the force also together is made possible quick movement 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:59.850
 If you can do this movement of martial arts, you can learn a quick pass in a short time 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.960
 Take an ordinary pass and take 1 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:08.800
 In's and out to accumulating your energy 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:11.620
 The previous pass had three actions, 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.299
 Password using the old martial arts 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:20.340
 One of these passes will be taken off in the hard winter when taking one more shot, so 1 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.340
 I'm ready to put out a high pass

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.750
 Because it is convex using muscle-muscle 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.100
 To 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.100
 2 operation was necessary 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.050
 If you use the scapula, you will be able to immediately round off the goal 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.220
 The movement of the scapula leads to the ball turning faster 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:02.940
 Students who have achieved the quick maneuvering in a short period of time wearing the movement of the scapula 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:08.209

 It said running of before the Meiji era of Japanese say the land run 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.500
 It is said that the body does not twist, so it consumes less energy 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:40.920
 It is also said that the Edo period thugs ran 250 kilometers a day with this run 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.330
 I thought that this run would not cause stamina in the second half of the game 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.139
 Shake the arm and use it to drain health 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:07.340
 Less consumption of the numbers ran in the energy not move the upper body 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.340

 It will be stronger if there are many people who do not have much sleep ability. 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:02.330
 I started thinking that it was a strange movement, but when I try it, I'm using it unexpectedly 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.330
