00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.700 
thread right there that just fits right
in<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.909> only<00:02:00.030> takes<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.330> minute<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.630> assemble<00:02:01.590> on

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
in it only takes a minute to assemble on

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.930 
in it only takes a minute to assemble on
it<00:02:01.830> but<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.790> 40<00:02:03.300> gallon<00:02:03.659> setup<00:02:04.080> and

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
it but that is the 40 gallon setup and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.150 
it but that is the 40 gallon setup and
then<00:02:05.940> this<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.330> shows<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.630> 40<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> 80

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
different stands and then so what we

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.949
