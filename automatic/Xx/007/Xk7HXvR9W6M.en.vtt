00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.670 

and<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.340> here's<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:31.930> set<00:01:32.930> up<00:01:33.050> specifically<00:01:33.560> for

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
and so here's a set up specifically for

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.890 
and so here's a set up specifically for
four<00:01:34.010> players<00:01:34.250> or<00:01:34.580> set<00:01:35.120> up<00:01:35.210> for<00:01:35.390> four<00:01:35.600> players

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
four players or set up for four players

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.710 
four players or set up for four players
but<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.470> game<00:01:36.650> can<00:01:36.890> go<00:01:37.010> from<00:01:37.160> two<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.610> six<00:01:37.820> the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
but the game can go from two to six the

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.080 
but the game can go from two to six the
whole<00:01:38.900> mechanism<00:01:39.140> of<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:40.010> game<00:01:40.190> is<00:01:40.490> based<00:01:40.880> on

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
whole mechanism of the game is based on

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.480 
whole mechanism of the game is based on
what<00:01:41.450> we<00:01:41.600> call<00:01:41.780> back<00:01:42.470> building<00:01:45.010> mechanism<00:01:46.010> so

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
what we call back building mechanism so

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.610 
what we call back building mechanism so
what<00:01:46.790> you<00:01:46.940> do<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:47.120> have<00:01:47.390> resources<00:01:47.930> into<00:01:48.530> the

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
what you do you have resources into the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.980 
what you do you have resources into the
game<00:01:48.830> which<00:01:49.370> are<00:01:49.520> these<00:01:49.670> cubes<00:01:50.090> colored<00:01:50.660> cubes

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
game which are these cubes colored cubes

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.770 
game which are these cubes colored cubes
each<00:01:51.230> cube<00:01:52.010> pertains<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.120> certain

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
each cube pertains to a certain

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.190 
each cube pertains to a certain
technology<00:01:54.200> or<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:55.610> certain<00:01:56.150> area<00:01:56.540> so<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.960> red

for instance is for war the green is for
movement<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:01.130> yellow<00:02:01.670> is<00:02:01.700> for<00:02:02.210> economy<00:02:03.220> the

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
movement the yellow is for economy the

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.250 
movement the yellow is for economy the
orange<00:02:04.550> is<00:02:04.670> used<00:02:04.880> for<00:02:05.030> development<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.840> so

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
orange is used for development and so

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.230 
orange is used for development and so
for<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.530> blue<00:02:06.650> for<00:02:06.830> culture<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.400> you<00:02:08.060> have

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
for the blue for culture and you have

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.940 
for the blue for culture and you have
these<00:02:08.450> indicators<00:02:09.050> of<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.470> level<00:02:09.770> of<00:02:09.830> the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
these indicators of the level of the

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.310 
these indicators of the level of the
technology<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.700> what<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.570> do<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.870> start<00:02:12.200> the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
technology and what you do you start the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.400 
technology and what you do you start the
game<00:02:12.350> with<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:13.340> six<00:02:13.610> basic<00:02:14.180> cubes<00:02:14.810> one<00:02:15.170> for

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
game with the six basic cubes one for

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.710 
game with the six basic cubes one for
each<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:15.830> then<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.760> can<00:02:16.910> actually<00:02:17.060> progress

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
each and then you can actually progress

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.100 
each and then you can actually progress
in<00:02:18.200> each<00:02:18.709> field<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.690> increase<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.840> number<00:02:21.080> of

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
in each field and increase the number of

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.650 
in each field and increase the number of
cubes<00:02:21.500> because<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.550> game<00:02:22.730> goes<00:02:23.030> like<00:02:23.209> this<00:02:23.390> we

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
cubes because the game goes like this we

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.810 
cubes because the game goes like this we
start<00:02:23.930> again<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.470> get<00:02:24.800> four<00:02:25.100> cubes<00:02:25.370> out<00:02:25.490> of<00:02:25.700> my

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
start again I get four cubes out of my

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.900 
start again I get four cubes out of my
bag<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.680> then<00:02:27.680> with<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> cubes<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.430> get<00:02:28.670> I

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
bag and then with the cubes I get I

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.400 
bag and then with the cubes I get I
decide<00:02:29.360> what<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.780> do<00:02:31.030> okay<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:32.090> if<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:33.050> want<00:02:33.260> to

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
decide what to do okay so if I want to

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.430 
decide what to do okay so if I want to
improve<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.550> certain<00:02:34.910> area<00:02:35.330> in<00:02:35.810> my<00:02:36.110> play<00:02:36.410> for

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
improve a certain area in my play for

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.440 
improve a certain area in my play for
instance<00:02:37.070> if<00:02:37.130> I<00:02:37.220> want<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.459> dedicate<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.209> war

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
instance if I want to dedicate it to war

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.949 
instance if I want to dedicate it to war
or<00:02:38.780> riding<00:02:39.380> or<00:02:39.950> technology<00:02:40.760> or<00:02:40.790> science<00:02:41.239> all<00:02:41.900> I

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
or riding or technology or science all I

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.410 
or riding or technology or science all I
have<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.290> do<00:02:42.500> is<00:02:42.620> progress<00:02:42.920> in<00:02:43.250> one<00:02:43.430> field<00:02:43.700> get

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
have to do is progress in one field get

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.630 
have to do is progress in one field get
more<00:02:44.720> cubes<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.500> color<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:46.130> put<00:02:46.310> into<00:02:46.550> the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
more cubes of that color to put into the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.150 
more cubes of that color to put into the
bag<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.510> concept<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.050> like<00:02:48.290> deck<00:02:48.739> building

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
bag the concept is like deck building

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.070 
bag the concept is like deck building
except<00:02:49.519> now<00:02:49.640> you're<00:02:49.850> using<00:02:50.269> cubes<00:02:50.810> and

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
except now you're using cubes and

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.190 
except now you're using cubes and
resources<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.130> optimize<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.510> say<00:02:53.660> optimizing

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
resources to optimize you say optimizing

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.380 
resources to optimize you say optimizing
English<00:02:54.410> right<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.739> optimize<00:02:55.190> your<00:02:55.220> strategy

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
English right to optimize your strategy

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.330 
English right to optimize your strategy
and<00:02:57.510> then<00:02:57.960> what<00:02:58.140> are<00:02:58.170> we<00:02:58.260> doing<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.710> in<00:02:59.010> this

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
and then what are we doing in in this

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.920 
and then what are we doing in in this
area<00:02:59.550> everyone<00:02:59.880> starts<00:03:00.300> with<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.540> homeland

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
area everyone starts with the homeland

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.930 
area everyone starts with the homeland
and<00:03:01.620> then<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:01.950> can<00:03:02.130> see<00:03:02.340> cities<00:03:02.610> on<00:03:02.850> the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
and then you can see cities on the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.900 
and then you can see cities on the
homeland<00:03:03.300> city<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.440> have<00:03:04.620> two<00:03:05.220> slots<00:03:05.520> or<00:03:05.700> one

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
homeland city can have two slots or one

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.000 
homeland city can have two slots or one
slot<00:03:06.240> and<00:03:06.510> there's<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.230> power<00:03:07.530> there's<00:03:07.920> a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
slot and there's a power there's a

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.670 
slot and there's a power there's a
benefit<00:03:08.400> beside<00:03:08.790> each<00:03:09.060> city<00:03:09.510> same<00:03:10.380> thing<00:03:10.560> with

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
benefit beside each city same thing with

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.230 
benefit beside each city same thing with
the<00:03:10.770> basic<00:03:11.130> technologies<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.880> have<00:03:11.970> riding

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
the basic technologies you have riding

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.199 
the basic technologies you have riding
war<00:03:13.040> population<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.280> what<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:14.700> do<00:03:14.820> you

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
war population and what you do you

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.480 
war population and what you do you
basically<00:03:15.690> allocate<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.350> cubes<00:03:16.680> here<00:03:17.070> let's

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
basically allocate the cubes here let's

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.260 
basically allocate the cubes here let's
say<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.670> wanna<00:03:18.000> let's<00:03:18.810> say<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.020> want<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:20.270> fight

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
say I wanna let's say I want to fight

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.150 
say I wanna let's say I want to fight
and<00:03:21.600> move<00:03:21.959> this<00:03:22.320> symbol<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.680> for<00:03:22.800> move<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.100> I

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
and move this symbol is for move so I

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.729 
and move this symbol is for move so I
put<00:03:23.340> two<00:03:23.520> cubes<00:03:23.760> here<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.239> activate<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.350> action

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
put two cubes here I activate the action

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.260 
put two cubes here I activate the action
and<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:26.040> play<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.550> action<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.850> have<00:03:26.970> one

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
and I play the action I have one

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.170 
and I play the action I have one
movement<00:03:27.569> point<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.319> one<00:03:28.590> battle<00:03:29.040> okay<00:03:29.730> so

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
movement point and one battle okay so

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.970 
movement point and one battle okay so
you<00:03:30.510> start<00:03:30.780> from<00:03:30.840> your<00:03:31.080> homeland<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.800> can

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
you start from your homeland you can

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.470 
you start from your homeland you can
increase<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.459> population<00:03:32.790> with<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.209> pink

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
increase the population with the pink

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.530 
increase the population with the pink
obviously<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.530> can<00:03:34.739> create<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.250> knew<00:03:36.180> pawns

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
obviously you can create you knew pawns

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.810 
obviously you can create you knew pawns
and<00:03:36.840> then<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.530> can<00:03:37.709> start<00:03:37.920> exploring<00:03:38.430> and

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
and then you can start exploring and

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.310 
and then you can start exploring and
getting<00:03:39.180> in<00:03:39.300> contact<00:03:39.540> with<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.019> alien

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
getting in contact with the alien

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.910 
getting in contact with the alien
population<00:03:40.470> with<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.070> other<00:03:41.190> players<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:42.920> so

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
population with the other players and so

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.580 
population with the other players and so
it's<00:03:44.790> all<00:03:44.970> based<00:03:45.209> on<00:03:45.360> actions<00:03:45.840> one<00:03:46.170> action<00:03:46.440> is

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
it's all based on actions one action is

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.410 
it's all based on actions one action is
either<00:03:46.800> activate<00:03:47.370> one<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.940> actions<00:03:48.300> of

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
either activate one of the actions of

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.840 
either activate one of the actions of
the<00:03:48.540> basic<00:03:48.870> technology<00:03:49.440> or<00:03:49.890> activating<00:03:50.760> a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
the basic technology or activating a

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.759 
the basic technology or activating a
city<00:03:51.060> when<00:03:51.330> you<00:03:51.420> activate<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.900> city<00:03:52.140> the

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
city when you activate the city the

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.770 
city when you activate the city the
point<00:03:53.010> inside<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.370> city<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:54.120> move<00:03:54.360> it<00:03:54.540> and

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
point inside the city you move it and

point inside the city you move it and
you<00:03:54.989> get<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.380> bonus<00:03:55.560> connected<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.340> city

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
you get the bonus connected to the city

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.290 
you get the bonus connected to the city
and<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.910> point<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.420> done<00:03:58.880> you<00:03:59.880> have<00:03:59.970> several

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
and that point is done you have several

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.289 
and that point is done you have several
round<00:04:00.750> around<00:04:01.350> these<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:01.829> draw<00:04:02.310> four<00:04:02.670> cubes<00:04:03.030> and

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
round around these I draw four cubes and

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.870 
round around these I draw four cubes and
I<00:04:03.690> keep<00:04:03.989> playing<00:04:04.739> one<00:04:05.010> action<00:04:05.310> at<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.489> time<00:04:05.700> and

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
I keep playing one action at a time and

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.440 
I keep playing one action at a time and
Tim<00:04:06.030> al<00:04:06.180> I'm<00:04:06.390> done<00:04:06.720> either<00:04:07.370> activating<00:04:08.450> the

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
Tim al I'm done either activating the

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.509 
Tim al I'm done either activating the
basic<00:04:09.810> technologies<00:04:10.350> for<00:04:10.650> activating<00:04:11.040> towns

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
basic technologies for activating towns

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.789 
basic technologies for activating towns
right<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.390> then<00:04:12.989> when<00:04:13.170> everybody<00:04:13.530> is<00:04:13.620> done

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
right and then when everybody is done

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.710 
right and then when everybody is done
with<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.100> rounds<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.640> i<00:04:15.000> have<00:04:15.120> no<00:04:15.299> more<00:04:15.420> cubes

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
with the rounds and i have no more cubes

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.509 
with the rounds and i have no more cubes
to<00:04:15.870> use<00:04:16.019> or<00:04:16.200> no<00:04:16.290> more<00:04:16.440> action<00:04:16.709> here<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.310> draw

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
to use or no more action here you draw

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.159 
to use or no more action here you draw
another<00:04:17.729> four<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.630> keep<00:04:18.810> doing<00:04:19.140> this

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
another four and you keep doing this

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.949 
another four and you keep doing this
until<00:04:19.519> everybody<00:04:20.519> has<00:04:20.729> drawn<00:04:21.180> every<00:04:21.390> cube

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
until everybody has drawn every cube

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.830 
until everybody has drawn every cube
into<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.290> bag<00:04:22.440> now<00:04:23.100> if<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.490> reach<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.300> level<00:04:24.479> four

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
into the bag now if I reach a level four

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.680 
into the bag now if I reach a level four
in<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.200> certain<00:04:25.440> field<00:04:26.130> i<00:04:26.520> can<00:04:26.820> put<00:04:27.210> immunity<00:04:27.660> I

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
in a certain field i can put immunity I

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.230 
in a certain field i can put immunity I
can<00:04:27.930> go<00:04:28.229> down<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.770> take<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.490> cube<00:04:29.910> from<00:04:30.060> the

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
can go down and take a cube from the

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.210 
can go down and take a cube from the
bank<00:04:30.450> put<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:30.840> in<00:04:30.960> my<00:04:31.110> bag<00:04:31.140> and<00:04:31.560> keep<00:04:31.890> playing

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
bank put it in my bag and keep playing

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.719 
bank put it in my bag and keep playing
okay<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:33.180> immediately<00:04:33.600> reuse<00:04:34.169> them<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:35.580> you

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
okay so immediately reuse them and you

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:36.980 
okay so immediately reuse them and you
go<00:04:35.850> like<00:04:35.880> this<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.450> turn<00:04:36.660> is<00:04:36.810> when

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
go like this and a turn is when

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.659 
go like this and a turn is when
everybody<00:04:37.260> is<00:04:37.440> done<00:04:37.650> using<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.130> cubes<00:04:38.430> and

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
everybody is done using the cubes and

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.290 
everybody is done using the cubes and
then<00:04:38.700> you<00:04:39.360> go<00:04:39.479> around<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:41.490> game<00:04:41.729> ends<00:04:42.150> in

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
then you go around and the game ends in

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.100 
then you go around and the game ends in
there<00:04:42.510> are<00:04:42.600> several<00:04:43.250> game-ending<00:04:45.110> situations

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
there are several game-ending situations

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.110 
there are several game-ending situations
in<00:04:46.289> the<00:04:46.380> game<00:04:46.560> for<00:04:46.860> instance<00:04:47.070> I've<00:04:47.310> run<00:04:47.940> out<00:04:47.970> of

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
in the game for instance I've run out of

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.320 
in the game for instance I've run out of
pawns<00:04:48.630> to<00:04:48.810> put<00:04:49.169> onto<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.740> board<00:04:49.979> and<00:04:50.310> or<00:04:50.700> for

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
pawns to put onto the board and or for

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.590 
pawns to put onto the board and or for
instance<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:52.650> can<00:04:52.800> get<00:04:52.950> technologies<00:04:53.600> by

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
instance you can get technologies by

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.040 
instance you can get technologies by
using<00:04:55.530> this<00:04:55.830> action<00:04:56.520> here<00:04:56.700> science<00:04:57.210> okay<00:04:57.840> we

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
using this action here science okay we

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.420 
using this action here science okay we
didn't<00:04:58.200> mention<00:04:58.440> its<00:04:58.560> previous<00:04:58.830> attack

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
didn't mention its previous attack

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.700 
didn't mention its previous attack
of<00:04:59.520> alien<00:04:59.910> technology<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.870> technologies

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
of alien technology and technologies

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.740 
of alien technology and technologies
basic<00:05:02.130> technologies<00:05:02.670> that<00:05:02.820> I<00:05:02.880> can<00:05:03.150> I<00:05:03.450> can

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
basic technologies that I can I can

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.810 
basic technologies that I can I can
discover<00:05:04.140> so<00:05:04.770> you<00:05:04.830> start<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.250> game<00:05:05.280> with<00:05:05.430> four

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
discover so you start the game with four

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.050 
discover so you start the game with four
technologies<00:05:06.780> available<00:05:07.650> for<00:05:08.040> everyone<00:05:08.280> if<00:05:08.790> I

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
technologies available for everyone if I

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.510 
technologies available for everyone if I
develop<00:05:09.510> one<00:05:09.720> science<00:05:10.380> I<00:05:10.590> can<00:05:10.740> get<00:05:10.890> one

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
develop one science I can get one

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.670 
develop one science I can get one
technology<00:05:12.060> card<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:12.540> basically<00:05:13.260> it<00:05:13.500> gives

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
technology card and basically it gives

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.430 
technology card and basically it gives
me<00:05:13.950> more<00:05:14.130> options<00:05:14.430> to<00:05:14.790> use<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.240> cubes<00:05:15.570> okay<00:05:16.290> in

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
me more options to use the cubes okay in

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.860 
me more options to use the cubes okay in
a<00:05:16.500> step<00:05:16.740> different<00:05:17.220> way<00:05:17.400> if<00:05:17.970> I<00:05:18.180> get<00:05:18.240> in<00:05:18.480> control

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
a step different way if I get in control

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.020 
a step different way if I get in control
of<00:05:18.900> one<00:05:19.140> of<00:05:19.230> the<00:05:19.290> central<00:05:19.590> areas<00:05:20.010> I<00:05:20.250> can<00:05:20.880> also

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
of one of the central areas I can also

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.180 
of one of the central areas I can also
develop<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.570> ten<00:05:21.720> alien<00:05:21.870> technology<00:05:22.650> which<00:05:23.040> are

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
develop a ten alien technology which are

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.770 
develop a ten alien technology which are
much<00:05:23.370> more<00:05:23.640> powerful<00:05:24.030> and<00:05:24.360> give<00:05:24.540> you<00:05:24.630> victory

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
much more powerful and give you victory

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.280 
much more powerful and give you victory
points<00:05:25.440> so<00:05:26.250> it's<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:27.360> this<00:05:27.480> development<00:05:28.140> is

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
points so it's and this development is

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.890 
points so it's and this development is
very<00:05:28.500> easy<00:05:28.650> the<00:05:28.890> game<00:05:29.100> flows<00:05:29.550> very<00:05:29.880> fast<00:05:30.660> and

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
very easy the game flows very fast and

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.930 
very easy the game flows very fast and
very<00:05:30.960> rapidly<00:05:31.440> so<00:05:31.740> I<00:05:31.950> do<00:05:32.040> one<00:05:32.280> action<00:05:32.610> into<00:05:32.790> one

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
very rapidly so I do one action into one

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.610 
very rapidly so I do one action into one
action<00:05:33.210> one<00:05:33.390> action<00:05:33.630> one<00:05:33.810> action<00:05:34.110> and<00:05:34.320> it's

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
action one action one action and it's

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.070 
action one action one action and it's
all<00:05:34.770> a<00:05:34.800> matter<00:05:35.010> of<00:05:35.160> allocating<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:36.510> cubes<00:05:36.870> in

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
all a matter of allocating the cubes in

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.050 
all a matter of allocating the cubes in
the<00:05:37.230> right<00:05:37.410> combination<00:05:38.160> in<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:38.400> right<00:05:38.550> combo

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
the right combination in the right combo

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.450 
the right combination in the right combo
the<00:05:39.780> right<00:05:39.990> timing<00:05:40.320> watching<00:05:40.980> want<00:05:41.160> the<00:05:41.340> other

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
the right timing watching want the other

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.280 
the right timing watching want the other
ones<00:05:41.790> are<00:05:41.940> doing<00:05:42.360> and<00:05:42.570> trying<00:05:42.840> to<00:05:42.960> decide

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290
