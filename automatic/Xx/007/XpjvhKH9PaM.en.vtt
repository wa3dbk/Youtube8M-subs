00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.170 
purplish and yeah looks awesome but
anyways<00:00:19.350> own<00:00:19.439> with<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> kraken<00:00:20.220> what<00:00:21.150> i

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
anyways own with the kraken what i

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.240 
anyways own with the kraken what i
usually<00:00:21.300> like<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.600> do<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.840> go<00:00:21.990> 3<00:00:22.320> into<00:00:22.710> vortex

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
usually like to do is go 3 into vortex

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.580 
usually like to do is go 3 into vortex
as<00:00:23.490> my<00:00:23.820> stage<00:00:24.150> one<00:00:24.510> because<00:00:24.869> vortex<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.560> a

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
as my stage one because vortex is a

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.320 
as my stage one because vortex is a
really<00:00:25.920> good<00:00:26.039> way<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> zoning<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> hunters

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
really good way of zoning the hunters

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.089 
really good way of zoning the hunters
away<00:00:27.570> from<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.869> does<00:00:28.050> really<00:00:28.410> good<00:00:28.590> damage

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
away from you does really good damage

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.060 
away from you does really good damage
and<00:00:30.230> when<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.320> pick<00:00:31.470> up<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.619> cooldown

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
and when you pick up that cooldown

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.970 
and when you pick up that cooldown
reduction<00:00:32.719> perk<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.960> really<00:00:34.200> helps<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.559> spam

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
reduction perk it really helps you spam

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.920 
reduction perk it really helps you spam
that<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.460> usually<00:00:35.910> my<00:00:36.270> goal<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:36.750> playing

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
that and usually my goal with playing

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.420 
that and usually my goal with playing
the<00:00:37.020> track<00:00:37.260> or<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.620> cracking<00:00:37.829> with<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.250> bill

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the track or the cracking with this bill

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.280 
the track or the cracking with this bill
is<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.640> also<00:00:38.879> try<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.270> get<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> mammoth<00:00:40.050> bird

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
is to also try to get the mammoth bird

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.650 
is to also try to get the mammoth bird
which<00:00:40.739> gives<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.100> additional<00:00:41.430> cool<00:00:42.420> down

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
which gives you additional cool down

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.819 
which gives you additional cool down
it's<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:42.899> another<00:00:43.079> cooldown<00:00:43.649> reduction

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it's like another cooldown reduction

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.590 
it's like another cooldown reduction
buff<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.309> stacks<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.940> your<00:00:45.059> perks<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.480> you

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
buff that stacks with your perks if you

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.260 
buff that stacks with your perks if you
can<00:00:45.719> get<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.050> early<00:00:46.559> it's<00:00:47.430> pretty<00:00:47.850> insane

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
can get that early it's pretty insane

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.119 
can get that early it's pretty insane
how<00:00:48.420> much<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.050> spam<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.500> vortex<00:00:49.950> but

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
how much you can spam the vortex but

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.590 
how much you can spam the vortex but
it's<00:00:50.250> kind<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.520> unlikely<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.149> because<00:00:51.420> there's

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
it's kind of unlikely to because there's

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.420 
it's kind of unlikely to because there's
so<00:00:51.690> many<00:00:51.750> mammoth<00:00:52.140> birds<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.680> hard<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.010> kind

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
so many mammoth birds it's hard to kind

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.740 
so many mammoth birds it's hard to kind
of<00:00:53.520> isolate<00:00:53.940> where<00:00:54.030> they<00:00:54.180> are<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.420> we'll<00:00:54.570> see

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
of isolate where they are but we'll see

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.450 
of isolate where they are but we'll see
how<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.050> goes<00:00:55.110> alright<00:00:55.980> guys<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.309> we're

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
how this goes alright guys so we're

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.610 
how this goes alright guys so we're
dropped<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.090> let's<00:00:57.420> head<00:00:57.629> south<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> map

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
dropped in let's head south of the map

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.799 
dropped in let's head south of the map
that's<00:00:59.550> what<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> usually<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.300> map<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
that's what I usually do on this map and

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.540 
that's what I usually do on this map and
in<00:01:00.870> fact<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.260> think<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.890> might<00:01:02.039> have<00:01:02.070> gotten<00:01:02.340> this

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
in fact I think I might have gotten this

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.479 
in fact I think I might have gotten this
map<00:01:02.820> last<00:01:03.210> video<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:04.110> well<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.769> know<00:01:05.280> I've

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
map last video as well but I know I've

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.710 
map last video as well but I know I've
tried<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:05.760> three<00:01:06.060> different<00:01:06.210> matches<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.689> I

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
tried like three different matches and I

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.240 
tried like three different matches and I
just<00:01:06.869> keep<00:01:07.080> getting<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.040> know<00:01:08.220> I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
just keep getting this one so you know I

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.980 
just keep getting this one so you know I
yeah<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.909> guess<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> game<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.570> really<00:01:09.810> wants

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
yeah I guess the game just really wants

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.600 
yeah I guess the game just really wants
me<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> play<00:01:10.200> refueling<00:01:10.710> refueling<00:01:11.430> tower

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
me to play refueling refueling tower

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.039 
me to play refueling refueling tower
today<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:11.970> that's<00:01:12.119> we're<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> do<00:01:12.600> that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
today so that's we're going to do that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.810 
today so that's we're going to do that
looks<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.470> an<00:01:13.560> albino<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.490> I'm<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.700> go

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
looks to be an albino so I'm going to go

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.960 
looks to be an albino so I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.299> actually<00:01:15.570> kill<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.170> right<00:01:16.409> away

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
ahead and actually kill this right away

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.100 
ahead and actually kill this right away
because<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.180> will<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> damage<00:01:18.930> buff

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
because this will be the damage buff

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.200 
because this will be the damage buff
which<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.409> huge<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:19.799> me<00:01:20.130> might<00:01:20.850> take<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> little

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
which is huge for me might take a little

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.580 
which is huge for me might take a little
bit<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.390> damage<00:01:21.600> here<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.350> it's

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
bit of damage here but I think it's

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.840 
bit of damage here but I think it's
worth<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> I've<00:01:23.070> almost<00:01:23.189> killed<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.729> can

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
worth it I've almost killed it you can

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.179 
worth it I've almost killed it you can
see<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.000> vortexes<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.170> much<00:01:25.409> damage<00:01:25.680> so

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
see that vortexes is so much damage so

biggest deal in the world it just

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.710 
biggest deal in the world it just
basically<00:02:39.000> puts<00:02:39.480> us<00:02:39.630> on<00:02:39.750> neutral<00:02:40.500> ground<00:02:40.770> like

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
basically puts us on neutral ground like

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.910 
basically puts us on neutral ground like
or<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.780> know<00:02:43.080> what<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.230> mean<00:02:43.260> like<00:02:43.620> because

i'll have the thirty-five percent damage

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.330 
i'll have the thirty-five percent damage
but<00:02:45.570> but<00:02:46.080> they'll<00:02:46.380> have<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:47.010> damage

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
but but they'll have the damage

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.740 
but but they'll have the damage
resistance<00:02:47.850> so<00:02:47.940> just<00:02:48.180> be<00:02:48.270> like<00:02:48.450> kind<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.660> a

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
resistance so just be like kind of a

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.360 
resistance so just be like kind of a
standard<00:02:49.110> match<00:02:49.350> basically<00:02:49.800> if<00:02:49.980> they<00:02:50.160> did

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
standard match basically if they did

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.750 
standard match basically if they did

almost at stage two though there's the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.700 
almost at stage two though there's the
trapper<00:02:56.930> he's<00:02:57.930> gonna<00:02:58.080> probably<00:02:58.350> throw<00:02:58.560> down

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
trapper he's gonna probably throw down

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.740 
trapper he's gonna probably throw down
the<00:02:58.830> trap<00:02:59.040> see<00:02:59.250> if<00:02:59.310> i<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.430> get<00:02:59.520> away<00:02:59.730> do<00:03:00.660> you

the trap see if i can get away do you

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.780 
the trap see if i can get away do you
throw<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.130> huh<00:03:02.130> he<00:03:02.370> didn't<00:03:02.580> throw<00:03:02.760> it

throw it huh he didn't throw it
interesting<00:03:03.330> i<00:03:03.540> thought<00:03:04.110> for<00:03:04.290> sure<00:03:04.320> he<00:03:04.650> was

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
interesting i thought for sure he was

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.080 
interesting i thought for sure he was
gonna<00:03:04.800> throw<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.190> i<00:03:05.250> saved<00:03:05.520> up<00:03:05.700> three

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
gonna throw it i saved up three

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.590 
gonna throw it i saved up three

him<00:03:09.780> out<00:03:09.930> but<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.500> guess<00:03:11.130> he<00:03:11.160> didn't<00:03:11.550> go<00:03:11.670> for<00:03:11.970> it

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
him out but I guess he didn't go for it

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.030 
him out but I guess he didn't go for it
although<00:03:13.110> he<00:03:13.140> had<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.350> pretty<00:03:13.500> good<00:03:13.680> chance<00:03:13.860> of

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
although he had a pretty good chance of

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.950 
although he had a pretty good chance of
trapping<00:03:14.550> me<00:03:14.670> there<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:15.030> I'm<00:03:15.360> very<00:03:15.600> surprised

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
trapping me there to I'm very surprised

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.780 
trapping me there to I'm very surprised
he<00:03:16.110> didn't<00:03:16.320> do<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.590> but<00:03:16.800> whatever<00:03:16.980> we're

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
he didn't do that but whatever we're

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.190 
he didn't do that but whatever we're
just<00:03:17.940> going<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.090> get<00:03:18.270> to<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.750> north<00:03:18.930> side<00:03:19.020> of

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
just going to get to the north side of

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.350 
just going to get to the north side of
the<00:03:19.290> map<00:03:19.500> quickly<00:03:20.190> as<00:03:20.250> we<00:03:20.370> can<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:20.820> evolve

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
the map quickly as we can and evolve

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.240 
the map quickly as we can and evolve
basically<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.110> is<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.440> game<00:03:22.590> plan<00:03:22.890> we<00:03:23.130> got

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
basically that is the game plan we got

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.010 
basically that is the game plan we got
like<00:03:23.460> a<00:03:23.490> lot<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:23.970> distance<00:03:24.240> here<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:24.960> can

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
like a lot of distance here so I can

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.270 
like a lot of distance here so I can
probably<00:03:25.200> just<00:03:25.380> do<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.650> right<00:03:25.800> here<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:26.190> be

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
probably just do it right here to be

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.790 
probably just do it right here to be
perfectly<00:03:26.640> honest<00:03:27.000> be<00:03:27.780> very<00:03:28.170> unlikely<00:03:28.410> they

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
perfectly honest be very unlikely they

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.200 
perfectly honest be very unlikely they
could<00:03:28.950> catch<00:03:29.100> up<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.520> me<00:03:29.610> in<00:03:29.760> time<00:03:29.970> and

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
could catch up to me in time and

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.330 
could catch up to me in time and
actually<00:03:30.510> punish<00:03:30.810> me<00:03:30.960> for<00:03:30.990> this<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:32.130> should<00:03:32.310> we

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
actually punish me for this so should we

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.440 
actually punish me for this so should we
go<00:03:32.460> we're<00:03:32.580> gonna<00:03:32.700> go<00:03:32.790> three<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.180> lightning

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
go we're gonna go three and a lightning

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.270 
go we're gonna go three and a lightning
strike<00:03:33.630> lightning<00:03:34.320> strike<00:03:34.650> does<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.830> crap-ton

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
strike lightning strike does a crap-ton

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.910 
strike lightning strike does a crap-ton
of<00:03:35.460> damage<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.900> it's<00:03:37.320> going<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.470> be<00:03:37.620> our

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
of damage and it's going to be our

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.790 
of damage and it's going to be our
second<00:03:38.580> best<00:03:38.840> arguably<00:03:39.840> could<00:03:39.930> be<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.260> best

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
second best arguably could be the best

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.260 
second best arguably could be the best
skill<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.250> his<00:03:41.400> but<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:41.610> just<00:03:41.910> really<00:03:42.120> like

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
skill of his but I just really like

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.790 
skill of his but I just really like
vortex<00:03:42.660> but<00:03:42.810> three<00:03:42.990> in<00:03:43.050> a<00:03:43.110> vortex<00:03:43.230> three<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.770> a

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
vortex but three in a vortex three and a

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.640 
vortex but three in a vortex three and a
lightning<00:03:44.040> strike<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.460> really<00:03:44.940> powerful<00:03:45.650> that

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
lightning strike is really powerful that

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.720 
lightning strike is really powerful that
is<00:03:46.830> Torvald<00:03:47.430> right<00:03:47.640> there<00:03:49.490> vortex<00:03:50.490> at<00:03:50.640> the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
is Torvald right there vortex at the

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.490 
is Torvald right there vortex at the
tree<00:03:50.850> there's<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.210> trapper<00:03:51.630> I'm<00:03:52.080> gonna<00:03:52.230> go<00:03:52.350> on

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
tree there's a trapper I'm gonna go on

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.930 
tree there's a trapper I'm gonna go on
him<00:03:52.710> he<00:03:52.860> is<00:03:53.040> split<00:03:53.340> up<00:03:53.370> from<00:03:53.490> the<00:03:53.640> group<00:03:53.820> so

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
him he is split up from the group so

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.370 
him he is split up from the group so
even<00:03:54.180> though<00:03:54.270> he<00:03:54.420> trapped<00:03:54.690> me<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.050> can<00:03:55.230> just

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
even though he trapped me in I can just

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.690 
even though he trapped me in I can just
kind<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.250> go<00:03:56.310> on<00:03:56.580> him<00:03:56.730> right<00:03:56.850> here<00:03:58.550> let's<00:03:59.550> do

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
kind of go on him right here let's do

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.380 
kind of go on him right here let's do
our<00:03:59.820> vortex<00:04:00.200> he's<00:04:01.200> almost<00:04:01.440> down<00:04:01.770> and<00:04:02.360> he<00:04:03.360> is

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
our vortex he's almost down and he is

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.040 
our vortex he's almost down and he is
down<00:04:03.750> Travers<00:04:04.200> down<00:04:04.410> I<00:04:05.300> try<00:04:06.300> to<00:04:06.330> zone<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.840> body

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
down Travers down I try to zone the body

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.800 
down Travers down I try to zone the body
here<00:04:07.320> oh<00:04:07.970> yeah<00:04:08.970> there<00:04:09.360> it<00:04:09.420> is<00:04:09.480> right<00:04:09.540> there<00:04:09.690> I

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
was like where's the body we're just

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.949 
was like where's the body we're just
going<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.760> risk<00:04:12.120> going<00:04:12.240> to<00:04:12.360> zone<00:04:12.510> this<00:04:12.720> body

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
going to risk going to zone this body

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.590 
going to risk going to zone this body
here<00:04:13.170> make<00:04:13.590> sure<00:04:13.620> they<00:04:13.890> can't<00:04:14.160> revive<00:04:14.790> they're

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
here make sure they can't revive they're

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.880

going to bore text here kind of push

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.120 
going to bore text here kind of push
them<00:04:17.070> off<00:04:17.250> trapper<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.060> dead<00:04:18.830> I'm<00:04:19.830> going<00:04:19.980> to<00:04:20.040> go

them off trapper is dead I'm going to go

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.680 
them off trapper is dead I'm going to go
on<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.310> assault<00:04:20.580> now<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:20.850> mean<00:04:21.210> he's<00:04:21.359> kind<00:04:21.600> of

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
on the assault now I mean he's kind of

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.750 
on the assault now I mean he's kind of
low<00:04:21.870> he's<00:04:22.560> kind<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.800> lowest<00:04:23.130> usually<00:04:23.580> don't

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
low he's kind of lowest usually don't

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.550 
low he's kind of lowest usually don't
like<00:04:23.850> focusing<00:04:24.210> his<00:04:24.330> soul<00:04:24.570> but<00:04:24.840> he<00:04:25.080> was<00:04:25.200> so<00:04:25.350> low

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
like focusing his soul but he was so low

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.260 
like focusing his soul but he was so low
and<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:25.890> think<00:04:26.100> he

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
and I think he

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.850 
and I think he
already<00:04:26.419> plop<00:04:26.599> this<00:04:26.810> shield<00:04:27.050> we<00:04:27.590> can<00:04:27.710> just

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
already plop this shield we can just

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.540 
already plop this shield we can just
actually<00:04:28.069> go<00:04:28.310> ahead<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:28.789> finish<00:04:29.690> him<00:04:29.810> off

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
actually go ahead and finish him off

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.559 
actually go ahead and finish him off

ragequit<00:05:21.889> so<00:05:22.400> this<00:05:22.610> is<00:05:22.789> looking<00:05:23.150> like<00:05:23.770> well

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
ragequit so this is looking like well

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.809 
ragequit so this is looking like well
it's<00:05:24.860> looking<00:05:25.129> good<00:05:25.250> right<00:05:25.430> now<00:05:25.490> but<00:05:25.729> the

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
it's looking good right now but the

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.809 
it's looking good right now but the
match<00:05:25.969> is<00:05:26.150> not<00:05:26.270> over<00:05:26.330> believe<00:05:26.840> me<00:05:27.639> the<00:05:28.639> match

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:28.819 
match is not over believe me the match

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.339 
match is not over believe me the match
is<00:05:29.030> none<00:05:29.180> of<00:05:29.210> our<00:05:29.360> lost<00:05:29.569> sight<00:05:29.780> of<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:30.020> bucket

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
is none of our lost sight of the bucket

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.870 
is none of our lost sight of the bucket
too<00:05:30.560> so<00:05:31.479> can't<00:05:32.479> necessarily<00:05:32.780> end<00:05:33.380> it<00:05:33.620> and

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
too so can't necessarily end it and

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.580 
too so can't necessarily end it and
actually<00:05:34.880> Lazarus<00:05:35.509> might<00:05:35.810> have<00:05:35.960> revived<00:05:36.349> the

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
actually Lazarus might have revived the

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.249 
actually Lazarus might have revived the

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.110 
own there which was the first mistake so
I<00:06:15.770> was<00:06:15.860> able<00:06:15.949> to<00:06:16.130> just<00:06:16.190> kind<00:06:16.400> of<00:06:16.430> pounce<00:06:16.699> on<00:06:16.909> him

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
I was able to just kind of pounce on him

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.909 
I was able to just kind of pounce on him
take<00:06:17.449> him<00:06:17.659> out<00:06:17.779> of<00:06:17.840> the<00:06:17.900> fight<00:06:18.080> right<00:06:18.289> away<00:06:18.500> the

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
take him out of the fight right away the

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:20.439 
take him out of the fight right away the
assault<00:06:19.250> was<00:06:19.370> kind<00:06:19.610> of<00:06:19.669> caught<00:06:19.819> out<00:06:20.029> to<00:06:20.240> he

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:20.449 
assault was kind of caught out to he

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.749 
assault was kind of caught out to he
popped<00:06:20.870> his<00:06:21.080> shield<00:06:21.380> prematurely<00:06:22.130> so<00:06:22.699> I

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 
popped his shield prematurely so I

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:24.339 
popped his shield prematurely so I
allowed<00:06:22.940> me<00:06:23.090> to<00:06:23.150> take<00:06:23.300> him<00:06:23.539> down<00:06:23.569> and<00:06:24.020> then

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
allowed me to take him down and then

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:25.839 
allowed me to take him down and then
when<00:06:24.469> I<00:06:24.500> saw<00:06:24.710> the<00:06:24.770> Lazarus<00:06:25.250> and<00:06:25.370> killed<00:06:25.610> him

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
when I saw the Lazarus and killed him

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:27.820 
when I saw the Lazarus and killed him
the<00:06:26.449> game<00:06:26.630> was<00:06:26.779> basically<00:06:27.110> over<00:06:27.229> so<00:06:27.590> there's<00:06:27.710> a

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830
