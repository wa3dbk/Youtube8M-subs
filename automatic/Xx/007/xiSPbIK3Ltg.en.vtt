00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.950
 Hello today to your attention 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.720
 I want to introduce 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.360
 tonal fluid from george r can 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.690
 which is called maestro general full 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.700
 his name is maestro hut what spf 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.949
 15 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.080
 why called him and therefore all his 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.240
 texture can see what is 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.019
 glass jar is a pipette because 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.490
 that he is very very liquid in this 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.760
 the tool contains a large number 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.050
 dry oils which is a caring 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.050
 component of this tool 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.879
 now tell you about my impressions of 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.960
 given tonal fluid before 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.000
 show you the texture I will say that by virtue 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.850
 and the presence of fire dry oils like me already 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.340
 said this remedy very much 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.250
 emphasizes desquamation if such 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.320
 there were on my skin I had peeling on 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.559
 that moment when i got this 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.700
 remedy and they were so strong 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.990
 underlined that without makeup looked 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.790
 Much better than second makeup 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.119
 This tool tried my friend 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.360
 which has oily skin and she 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.000
 said about the same 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.530
 like me and we were stressed 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.360
 peeling which at that time she has 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.430
 there were and after some time given 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.729
 tonal fluid and happiness and skin 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.340
 and exposed those areas that she 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.979
 tried to disguise in particular this 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:43.290
 there were enlarged pores there 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.180
 deficiencies and so on also need 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.829
 pay attention to the fact that in team 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.259
 its ease you 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.619
 from this means you will not achieve and total 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:56.219
 masking flaws it is intended 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.860
 in order to say so refresh your 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.520
 complexion keep in mind that given 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.850
 the tool does not hide and is not intended 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.250
 to 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.330
 same said to hide such flaws 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.600
 for acne 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.130
 age spots but it has a very 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.800
 velvety texture 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.959
 if you have beautiful smooth skin without 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.319
 flaws then of course this is your option 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.650
 because she's the first place 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.550
 the veil slightly gives color a healthy color 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.709
 your his 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.350
 even scrutinizing it 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.300
 not at all visible on the face let me show 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.950
 texture by this medium before 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.180
 applying it must be carefully 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.600
 shake open you can see that 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.290
 here such a pump means see very 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.080
 very liquid just like some water pours 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.819
 take a little bit at hand 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.170
 generally very sparingly consumes it 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.170
 need quite a bit 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.340
 here you can see that it is straight slightly 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.200
 a little run down 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:06.239
 yes she is very very liquid we took 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.640
 a little bit and try to shade my 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.459
 tonal fluid in the shade of the second but 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.799
 general shades you have exactly 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.799
 Maestro is a very large number 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:28.329
 here it is barely noticeable such 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:31.930
 It leaves a very light shade 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:35.230
 velvety generally not felt on the skin 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.840
 and again it is not visible and it is very big 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.750
 a plus 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.829
 I think it's great for the summer 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:48.519
 option now you can watch how 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.090
 two hands on this hand have no tonal 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.079
 facilities 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:56.590
 here she is again slightly visible 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:59.409
 shade gives evens but 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.829
 the texture is very velvety very nice 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:06.840
 touch the skin feels like she would 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:09.209
 well-groomed such smoothed skin relief 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.329
 the smell of this tool slightly to slightly 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.879
 creamy meaning it is barely perceptible also 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.349
 Keep in mind that his shelf life is 12 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.440
 months since opening 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:24.570
 well consumed very very minimal 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.570
 you need it quite a bit on all face 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.680
 before applying 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.070
 I recommend putting your own 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.520
 moisturizer do not skip this 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:39.370
 level of care because on moisturizing 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.669
 the cream will lie much better than on the bare 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.860
 face keep that in mind also let's 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.340
 Now I will show you how it looked at all 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.810
 box at this facility 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.470
 here you can see the full name 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:57.010
 again in this bottle is 30 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.260
 milliliters I have a second shade 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.659
 but the maestro's scale is very large 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.770
 the number of shades that differences and 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:09.180
 differs by half tone that is 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:13.199
 everyone will find their shade that's for sure 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.199
 such packaging to 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.550
 and I can also show you how to 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.300
 looks like 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:26.520
 must be changed on the legacy of the probe you are here 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.860
 you can watch yourself with a pipette too 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.110
 all the same this sampler he's in any 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.470
 shade so do not be surprised colors so 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:39.250
 different too by the way glass 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.740
 butterfly little miniature are 3 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.560
 milliliter and here these three milliliters 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.900
 with daily use, enough for 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.430
 week this points here is very big 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.300
 the number of products that is, you need it 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.220
 quite a bit to get this 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.470
 The tool can be a network of lead stores 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.630
 again also in total in other 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.150
 cosmetic stores where represented 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.530
 ruler georgio armani to refine this 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.380
 in advance because it is everywhere 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.300
 presented ask here such here 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.820
 I remember that I showed you earlier 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.290
 can again in any store where 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.650
 presented this line 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.420

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.090

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.350
 more with daily use 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:24.820
 Of course there is a lot of product and 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:26.620
 consumed very economically worth 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.500
 given stress at least i don't 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:33.280
 bought in dvd cost around 3000 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.960
 rubles but constantly taking stock 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.790
 discounts can even be purchased 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:42.910
 cheap shot at a person like 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:45.970
 regular concealer makeup than any 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:50.020
 you are shooting hydrophilic butter jelly 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:52.270
 anything at least on me she 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.760
 keeps it all day unnoticed by 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.130
 me it is a big plus so i have it 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.260
 I use almost every day years on 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:03.010
 our I only his after 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:05.770
 moisturizer so that it does not lie exactly 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.960
 emphasized their peeling not fix 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.660
 powdered in rare cases i can 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.520
 use matting wipes 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.890
 considering the fact that I have combined 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:19.380
 prone to oily skin on me this 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:21.900
 tonal fluid keeps very well 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.410
 the reward for the heat is excellent 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.410
 all day
