this<00:00:02.010> will<00:00:02.190> show<00:00:02.340> you<00:00:02.399> how<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.879> test<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.330> woofer

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
this will show you how to test a woofer

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.590 
this will show you how to test a woofer
with<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.870> 9-volt<00:00:04.230> battery<00:00:04.850> if<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.150> terminals

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
with the 9-volt battery if the terminals

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.030 
with the 9-volt battery if the terminals
of<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.779> speaker<00:00:07.109> are<00:00:07.350> close<00:00:07.620> enough<00:00:07.649> together

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
of the speaker are close enough together

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.390 
of the speaker are close enough together
then<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:09.000> can<00:00:09.150> go<00:00:09.300> ahead<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.719> touch<00:00:09.870> the

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
then you can go ahead and touch the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.499 
then you can go ahead and touch the
battery<00:00:11.400> right<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.820> terminals<00:00:12.269> in<00:00:12.360> this

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
battery right to the terminals in this

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.660 
battery right to the terminals in this
case<00:00:12.750> they're<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.019> little<00:00:13.230> far<00:00:13.559> apart<00:00:13.590> so<00:00:14.130> I've

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
case they're a little far apart so I've

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.640 
case they're a little far apart so I've
come<00:00:14.940> up<00:00:15.000> with<00:00:15.089> this<00:00:15.269> contraption<00:00:15.960> here<00:00:16.199> this

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
come up with this contraption here this

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.680 
come up with this contraption here this
is<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> simple<00:00:17.160> 9-volt<00:00:17.730> battery<00:00:18.060> clip<00:00:18.420> that

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
is a simple 9-volt battery clip that

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.570 
is a simple 9-volt battery clip that
came<00:00:19.050> from<00:00:19.320> RadioShack<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.310> buying<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
came from RadioShack you buying a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740 
came from RadioShack you buying a
package<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:21.029> five<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.270> think

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
package of five I think

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.029 
package of five I think
or<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.289> Rob<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.560> out<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.800> an<00:00:22.890> old

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
or you can Rob it out of an old

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.300 
or you can Rob it out of an old
electronic<00:00:23.760> game<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.869> some<00:00:25.109> sort<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.590> attach

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
electronic game of some sort and attach

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.790 
electronic game of some sort and attach
the<00:00:26.550> alligator<00:00:27.000> clip<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.300> one<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.990> hooked

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the alligator clip to one in and hooked

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.950 
the alligator clip to one in and hooked
it<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.279> negative<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.939> then<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.750> want

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
it up to the negative and then you want

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.229 
it up to the negative and then you want
to<00:00:31.109> just<00:00:31.320> briefly<00:00:31.560> touch<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.340> positive<00:00:33.059> wire

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
to just briefly touch the positive wire

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.190 
to just briefly touch the positive wire
to<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> positive<00:00:34.260> terminal<00:00:35.899> when<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:36.989> do

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
to the positive terminal when you do

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.170 
to the positive terminal when you do
that<00:00:37.410> applying<00:00:38.010> positive<00:00:38.640> voltage<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.090> a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
that applying positive voltage in a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.569 
that applying positive voltage in a
positive<00:00:39.629> terminal<00:00:40.050> will<00:00:40.230> cause<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.860> most

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
positive terminal will cause in most

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.490 
positive terminal will cause in most
cases<00:00:41.969> causing<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.930> woofer<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.350> move

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
cases causing the woofer to move

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.729 
cases causing the woofer to move
outwards<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.590> there<00:00:48.559> now<00:00:49.559> in

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
outwards as you can see there now in

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.430 
outwards as you can see there now in
some<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.100> older<00:00:50.579> JBL<00:00:51.210> woofers<00:00:51.660> when

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
some of the older JBL woofers when

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
some of the older JBL woofers when
applying<00:00:53.070> positive<00:00:53.340> voltage<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
applying positive voltage to the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.680 
applying positive voltage to the
positive<00:00:54.600> terminal<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:56.059> cone<00:00:57.059> will<00:00:57.300> actually

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
positive terminal the cone will actually

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.799 
positive terminal the cone will actually
move<00:00:57.870> inwards<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:59.460> was<00:00:59.670> very<00:01:00.120> confusing<00:01:00.660> for

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
move inwards this was very confusing for

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.229 
move inwards this was very confusing for
a<00:01:01.079> long<00:01:01.350> time<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.250> pro<00:01:02.430> audio<00:01:02.609> world<00:01:03.030> I

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
a long time in the pro audio world I

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.810 
a long time in the pro audio world I
really<00:01:03.780> don't<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.140> why<00:01:04.320> JBL<00:01:04.920> did<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.400> they

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
really don't know why JBL did that they

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.890 
really don't know why JBL did that they
don't<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.510> anymore

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
don't do it anymore

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.530 
don't do it anymore
which<00:01:07.350> actually<00:01:08.310> kind<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.970> adds<00:01:09.180> more

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
which actually kind of adds more

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.890 
which actually kind of adds more
confusion<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.350> an<00:01:10.470> odd<00:01:10.619> way<00:01:10.880> but<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.630> case

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
confusion in an odd way but in that case

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.320 
confusion in an odd way but in that case
it's<00:01:13.350> basically<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.159> simple<00:01:14.549> reverse<00:01:14.970> polarity

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
it's basically a simple reverse polarity

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.780 
it's basically a simple reverse polarity
and<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.960> touched<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.500> touch<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.009> positive

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
and if you touched it touch the positive

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.649 
and if you touched it touch the positive
wire<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> positive<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> older<00:01:20.040> JBL's

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
wire to the positive on the older JBL's

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.270 
wire to the positive on the older JBL's
it<00:01:21.659> will<00:01:21.900> move<00:01:22.049> inwards<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.100> this

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
it will move inwards as in this

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.390 
it will move inwards as in this
demonstration<00:01:26.780> now<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.140> also<00:01:28.400> helpful

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
demonstration now this is also helpful
