 Often the macianer's apple is like that 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.030

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.759
 thing times look if there is an iphone in it 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.770

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.280

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:52.160
 further that she drapes so well behind 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:55.530
 he sees one that was richly rewarded 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:05.700
 the next time plenty of 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:07.709
 freiburg fits that freiburg you have 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.670
 called or are it easy 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.850
 many people had the same idea 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.060
 something 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.200
 I did not say anything came 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.580
 automatically that should be somehow 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.980
 sometimes he is in the air 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.519
 simply that sounds the zeitgeist too 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.860
 takes 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.050
 you do not look I watch 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.640
 I do not want to be unfair 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.320
 and let's just watch the exercise videos 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.550
 and again for the progress 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.900
 set that is you can you now 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.100
 tell everyone if that is true or not 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.570
 can not I do not I want to I 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.760
 Called to look here is this 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.670
 by the way my very first fan cup that 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.950
 will be the special one forever 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.300
 fan button stay because that is already too 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.070
 come to me as it is not yet 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.170
 physically possible 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.580
 In this world I send something to me 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.040
 have indeed my mailbox address 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.050
 mistakenly called where you do 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.850
 not parcels and packages can go 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.150
 I was there before on 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.950
 who-knows-what de informed or good 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.900
 question de i looked at you can 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.080
 send parcels to mailboxes there stood 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.030
 yes you can but you should not so 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.150
 completely trust that too looks 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:14.100
 cool from grief with guitar very suitable 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:17.640
 digital the best thanks for that exactly 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:21.750
 I also find something very stylish if 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.140
 that on oh I have some time ago 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.430
 talked about that yes picks the 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.440
 Smoothness has turned every now and then 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.450
 to go to another universe 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.100
 come back and more well-known 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.130
 I think the color is also suitable 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.479
 very good to find again 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.250
 unlike my black where i am 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.680
 honestly not right now 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.240
 knows where that is , well, otherwise we have 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.590
 I still believe so much paper 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.210
 just the wrapping paper wow cool so we 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.100
 have it the same I have after that too 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.900
 Of course, a few more explanations for 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.750
 you how it continues today on this 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.419
 Anniversary day but we'll do it before 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.690
 the last package on good it is only three 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.520
 So I 'm totally exhausted 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.950
 plaster in garbsen 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.050
 I was totally surprised than me 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.270
 which one post because at first search as three 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.190
 but there were packages if it was still 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.140
 would have been more then we would have 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.479
 probably different days 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.479
 split carefully 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:26.899
 Old Swede hard 

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:28.399
 that was packed very very well so 

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:29.899
 Do you know what is always very embarrassing 

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:32.419
 if you have such a call status and 

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:34.999
 Nobody will send you that and me 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.779
 was original I was at the post today 

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:40.159
 and asked if that arrived 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.909
 then he came directly to the numbers 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.979
 depressed 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.709
 but that I find before 8 Also 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:48.679
 stylish out there is something on it you can 

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:49.729
 Hard to read but it is something oh 

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:55.189
 I know what that is 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:57.559
 maybe you can find something here and 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:06:01.479
 important note game is 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:01.479
 Dishwasher safe that ever good and 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:07.459
 I mean it to heat but me 

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:10.039
 I'm sure that we have still in there 

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:15.379
 earplugs no that's believe it is 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:18.219
 only packing and gummy bears of 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:20.389
 printplanet is that ? 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:22.429
 I do not know what I mean individually 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:25.219
 Well maybe then find out that 

00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:27.379
 I need a cool feeling 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:29.899
 also permanent and still many 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:33.679
 other vouchers and a bill 

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:36.589
 probably you got yourself so even 

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:38.119
 yes yes it is not exactly so but it 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:40.939
 there is no price on it already 

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:42.769
 good is best thanks for that there will be 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:44.869
 I much excited us what was in it 

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:46.339
 is as short a statement as it is now 

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:50.029
 goes on after this little one 

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:51.529
 bescherung for me I looked 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:53.779
 I think so cool 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:55.610
 playlist yes i thought it was 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:57.469
 a nice casual start the we 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.689
 have unpacked here with the gifts 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:01.189
 and what you are expected to do next 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:03.019
 some evolution 

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:05.179
 that means I have a few 

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:07.099
 excerpts taken from the last 100 

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:09.499
 and have them a little bit closer 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:11.419
 packed together that are once 

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:13.249
 a bit so stretch my exercises 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:15.259
 Just finger to see what 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:18.619
 so happens over the days or over the 

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:20.659
 weeks with the fingers how to get used to 

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:23.599
 to unfamiliar movements 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:25.630
 because of me and the second evolution is 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:26.740
 my big get lucky 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.660
 because you can, for example, s.den 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.250
 already recognize that I'm in the 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.710
 started summer and in winter 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.630
 these are little videos 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.330
 they are coming now and they are suitable 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.860
 also very good to share or something 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.950
 glorious to other people a bit 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.420
 Show what it is because they are just beautiful 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:46.210
 in portions for a few minutes 

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.170
 are so that you handle it quite well 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.850
 can 

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.110
 we need a café now you have 

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.120
 I really like the coffee in any case 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.890
 because you also have to be who that belongs 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.180
 now a good day to be hospitable here 

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.250
 he has no choice 

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:00.450
 and we look at each other in time 

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.450
 be both evolution
