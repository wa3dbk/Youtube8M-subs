made my own survival map it uses
equivalent<00:00:17.369> exchange<00:00:17.520> which<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.119> am<00:00:18.180> currently

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
equivalent exchange which I am currently

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.519 
equivalent exchange which I am currently
using<00:00:19.070> but<00:00:20.070> um<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.660> first<00:00:21.869> step<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.170> trying<00:00:22.439> to

using but um the first step is trying to

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.890 
using but um the first step is trying to
make<00:00:22.650> cobblestone<00:00:23.160> cheerio<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.699> no<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.750> has

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
so now with my map it's pretty simple

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.380 
so now with my map it's pretty simple
one<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> get<00:01:59.009> past<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> first<00:01:59.549> part<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.149> just

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
one to get past the first part it's just

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.219 
one to get past the first part it's just
pretty<00:02:00.630> simple<00:02:01.790> you<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.119> need<00:02:03.509> lots<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.930> cop

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
pretty simple you just need lots of cop

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.960 
pretty simple you just need lots of cop
enough<00:02:04.950> kabul<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:06.600> base

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.500 

um<00:02:09.440> it's<00:02:10.440> not<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.740> most<00:02:10.830> effective<00:02:11.210> but<00:02:12.210> it

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
um it's not the most effective but it

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.390 
um it's not the most effective but it
does<00:02:12.780> supply<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.230> with<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.740> cobble<00:02:14.070> as<00:02:14.250> you

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
does supply you with the cobble as you

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.940 
does supply you with the cobble as you
can<00:02:14.520> see<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.660> if<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.870> want<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.110> make<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.380> safer

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
can see but if you want to make it safer

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.010 
can see but if you want to make it safer
especially<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:17.640> like<00:02:18.030> sky<00:02:18.630> block<00:02:18.870> or

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
especially on like sky block or

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.510 
especially on like sky block or
something<00:02:19.260> like<00:02:19.350> this<00:02:19.530> because<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.400> actually

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
something like this because I actually

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.640 
something like this because I actually
feed<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.090> out<00:02:21.300> on<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.750> sky<00:02:22.020> block<00:02:22.230> challenge

feed this out on the sky block challenge
you<00:02:23.100> do<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.520> because<00:02:23.820> then<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.120> can't<00:02:24.300> get

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
you do that because then you can't get

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.810 
you do that because then you can't get
pushed<00:02:24.750> back<00:02:24.980> look<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.190> don't<00:02:26.430> hold<00:02:26.490> shift

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
pushed back look if I don't hold shift

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.060 
pushed back look if I don't hold shift
or<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.540> don't<00:02:27.810> push<00:02:28.380> forward<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:29.280> still<00:02:29.610> comes

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
or I don't push forward it still comes

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.380 
or I don't push forward it still comes
most<00:02:32.070> likely<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.520> water<00:02:32.760> will<00:02:33.000> still<00:02:33.210> push

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
most likely the water will still push

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.020 
most likely the water will still push
the<00:02:33.540> item<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.230> free<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:34.800> free<00:02:35.010> I'm<00:02:35.490> efficient

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the item so free it's free I'm efficient

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.990 
the item so free it's free I'm efficient
and<00:02:36.210> then<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.320> just<00:02:37.440> move<00:02:37.830> up<00:02:38.040> there<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:38.850> it

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
and then I just move up there so it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.410 
and then I just move up there so it
actually<00:02:39.480> looks<00:02:39.930> nicer<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.410> works<00:02:40.710> better

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
actually looks nicer it works better

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.240 
actually looks nicer it works better
other<00:02:42.420> than<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.410> how<00:02:43.740> you<00:02:43.800> make<00:02:44.040> the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
other than that that is how you make the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.730 
other than that that is how you make the
smallest<00:02:44.940> possible<00:02:45.780> cobblestone<00:02:46.709> generator

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
smallest possible cobblestone generator

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.230 
smallest possible cobblestone generator
or<00:02:47.490> minecraft<00:02:47.940> um<00:02:48.980> all<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.370> need<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.580> three

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
or minecraft um all you need is three

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.290 
or minecraft um all you need is three
layers<00:02:53.060> one<00:02:54.060> two<00:02:54.540> three<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.580> then<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:57.090> just

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
layers one two three and then you just

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.590 
layers one two three and then you just
need<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.660> one<00:02:57.930> two<00:02:58.200> three<00:02:58.230> wide<00:02:58.830> as<00:02:59.570> you<00:03:00.570> can

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
need it one two three wide as you can

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.750 
need it one two three wide as you can
see<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:00.900> expanded<00:03:01.740> basically<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:02.610> only

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
see I just expanded basically you only

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.440 
see I just expanded basically you only
need<00:03:03.000> twenty<00:03:03.300> seven<00:03:03.600> blocks<00:03:03.840> at<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.709> star<00:03:05.450> to

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
need twenty seven blocks at the star to

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.290 
need twenty seven blocks at the star to
be<00:03:06.510> able<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.780> do<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.160> um<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.640> did<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:09.030> well

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
be able to do this um I did this well

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.510 
be able to do this um I did this well
trained<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.780> feed<00:03:10.410> this<00:03:10.560> out<00:03:10.800> when<00:03:11.340> you're

trying<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.850> do<00:03:11.940> skyblock<00:03:12.390> survival<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.830> then

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
trying to do skyblock survival and then

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.000 
trying to do skyblock survival and then
once<00:03:15.269> it<00:03:15.420> did<00:03:15.959> that<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.380> wanted<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.830> try

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
once it did that I wanted to try

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.670 
once it did that I wanted to try
Skyblock<00:03:17.610> with<00:03:18.030> equivalent<00:03:18.450> exchange<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:19.620> to

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
Skyblock with equivalent exchange so to

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.070 
Skyblock with equivalent exchange so to
start<00:03:20.100> or<00:03:20.370> make<00:03:20.519> up<00:03:20.640> my<00:03:20.850> channel<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.480> as<00:03:21.959> you

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
start or make up my channel and as you

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.360 
start or make up my channel and as you
can<00:03:22.230> see<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.739> has<00:03:22.920> been<00:03:23.340> my<00:03:23.700> chowder<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:25.370> yeah

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
can see it has been my chowder and yeah

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.090 
can see it has been my chowder and yeah
so<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.720> smallest<00:03:28.230> possible<00:03:28.680> call

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
so this is a smallest possible call

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.000 
so this is a smallest possible call
center<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:30.230> if<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.320> guys<00:03:31.470> are<00:03:31.650> somewhat<00:03:31.860> my
