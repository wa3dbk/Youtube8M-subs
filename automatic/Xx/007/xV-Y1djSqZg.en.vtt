 specialized in auto mechanics and 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.920
 delphi parts will talk a little about 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.600

 always analyzes the important brakes 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.509
 very important of the automobile is the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.299
 that you will ride with the car the oil of 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.159
 brake it rains the water and it you saying 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.869
 marcel some people have difficulties 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.020
 on brake this is an important item of 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.509
 see the matches and the disco we see 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.759
 the timing belt will always have to 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.530
 very important growth for the already 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.090
 you can see if they share people 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.329
 in it a boiling car 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.820
 are among the main items to be 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.520
 be checked the issue of the brake you 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.350
 spoke about the importance of maintaining 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.740
 how much time has the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.960
 mileage is required so that the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.100
 person, look for the workshop 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.509
 check this 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.969
 we recommend the exchange of oil one 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.640
 every year and every 10,000 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.520
 system verification is this is 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.950
 preventive in a container malfunctions none 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.349
 can run quietly 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.920
 in 2000 one year then look at the lady not 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.690
 wait, you need the brake of your 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.060
 the vehicle when descending to a 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.129
 steep descent or when you 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.319
 needs to step on the brake when a 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.900
 vehicle if you cross in front the pds one 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.060
 bicycle an animal for you to check 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.610
 if your child is in mild 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.819
 before presenting problem in the workshop 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.380
 so that problems of accidents do not 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.180
 Come on, you mentioned the timing belt 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.390
 This is very important because a lot of 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.580
 People forget to change forget. 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.920
 check and when it gives trouble in 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.709
 Belt lock motor generally 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.120
 miss this is unfortunately to munch 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.099
 when it breaks you stay on the street in 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.170
 any place you can not dig is new 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.750
 old man he'll let you in the hand 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.390
 We do worries about the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.549
 accompaniment of the car in this case and 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.880
 when you give a certain mileage due 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.739
 is not having you test her 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.730
 always stresses that it has to be 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.760
 with footage 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.890
 then so do not expect to start giving 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.290
 problem to present any 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.410
 give problem and when presenting the 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.040
 problem is sometimes it is total loss of 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.459
 motor 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.760
 usually it 's the name on the head it goes 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.980
 breaks new name and inaccurate of the times 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.540
 applauded the entire engine as 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.540
 Usually runs more or less. 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.700
 it reached a maximum of 10% of the 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.010
 total total amount of each break 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.180
 person so I run to change a 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.750
 thing that costs more or less 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.340
 approximately 50 110 50 60 reais is the 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.280
 cost for you to change a belt 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.840
 and if it happens to the customer or 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.639
 the owner of the vehicle does not 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.579
 more or less how much will it spend 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.269
 problem sure close up 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.130
 one thousand reais 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.859
 Look, it's only worth it, then. 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.190
 preventative costing just 50 reais 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.690
 you trade this important item 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.299
 take them try to always carry your car 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.709

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.900
 higher expenses 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.090
