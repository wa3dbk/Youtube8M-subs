my USB hub while Unruh ting and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.259 
my USB hub while Unruh ting and
basically<00:00:22.140> what<00:00:22.289> happened<00:00:22.619> was<00:00:22.970> during<00:00:23.970> on

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
basically what happened was during on

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.580 
basically what happened was during on
routing<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:25.109> failed<00:00:26.330> so<00:00:27.330> when<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.960> try<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.289> boot

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
routing it failed so when I try to boot

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.580 
routing it failed so when I try to boot
it<00:00:28.740> up<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.490> also<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.630> ran<00:00:30.960> out<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.140> battery

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
it up and also I ran out of battery

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.319 
it up and also I ran out of battery
that's<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.009> worst<00:00:32.219> case<00:00:32.520> if<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.850> fail<00:00:33.120> during

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
that's the worst case if you fail during

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.600 
that's the worst case if you fail during
unmuting<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.739> run<00:00:34.920> out<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.070> battery

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
unmuting and you run out of battery

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.299 
unmuting and you run out of battery
what<00:00:35.940> happens<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.540> can't<00:00:36.899> um<00:00:37.309> really

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
what happens is you can't um really

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.630 
what happens is you can't um really
recharge<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.980> battery<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.460> it

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
recharge this the the battery on it

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.150 
recharge this the the battery on it
unless<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> working<00:00:42.840> ROM<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.559> or

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
unless you have a working ROM on it or

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.369 
unless you have a working ROM on it or
at<00:00:44.280> least<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.820> boots<00:00:45.210> up<00:00:45.420> into<00:00:45.750> boot<00:00:45.989> loop<00:00:46.170> or

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
at least it boots up into boot loop or

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.610 
at least it boots up into boot loop or
whatever<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.789> will<00:00:47.879> work<00:00:48.410> but<00:00:49.410> that's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
whatever then it will work but that's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.319 
whatever then it will work but that's
what<00:00:49.829> happened<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.550> was<00:00:50.730> stuck<00:00:51.149> in

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
what happened and so I was stuck in

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.990 
what happened and so I was stuck in
fastboot<00:00:51.840> failure<00:00:52.649> mode<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.489> almost<00:00:53.730> a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the Motorola factory cable it's very

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.880 
the Motorola factory cable it's very
easy<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.950> make<00:01:14.780> don't<00:01:15.780> mind<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.680> one<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
easy to make don't mind this this one I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.940 
easy to make don't mind this this one I
actually<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.820> started<00:01:18.659> cutting<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.259> wire<00:01:19.470> here

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
actually I started cutting the wire here

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.530 
actually I started cutting the wire here
and<00:01:20.100> then<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.310> was<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.520> oh<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.060> you

and then I was like oh I can just you

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.600 
and then I was like oh I can just you
know<00:01:21.600> worried<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:23.009> don't<00:01:23.189> actually<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
know worried you don't actually have to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.730 
know worried you don't actually have to
cut<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.000> all<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.110> actually

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
cut it all you have to do is actually

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.730 
cut it all you have to do is actually
take<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.909> top<00:01:27.270> part<00:01:27.479> apart<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:28.380> right

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
take the top part apart all right

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.179 
take the top part apart all right
and<00:01:28.939> basically<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.570> very<00:01:30.659> simple<00:01:31.350> hook<00:01:31.979> up

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
and basically it's very simple hook up

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.179 
and basically it's very simple hook up
pin<00:01:32.520> 4<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> pin<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.470> pin<00:01:34.710> 1<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
pin 4 to a pin one this is pin 1 and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.550 
pin 4 to a pin one this is pin 1 and
this<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.909> pin<00:01:36.150> 4<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:36.960> let<00:01:37.110> me<00:01:37.229> give<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
this is pin 4 but let me give you a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.819 
this is pin 4 but let me give you a
close-up<00:01:37.920> look<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.720> actually<00:01:40.020> used<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
close-up look and I actually used a

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.639 
close-up look and I actually used a
samsung<00:01:41.549> om<00:01:42.180> Samsung<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.079> those<00:01:43.229> cables

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
samsung om Samsung one of those cables

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.670 
samsung om Samsung one of those cables
that<00:01:43.979> came<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.399> my<00:01:44.430> uh<00:01:44.840> my<00:01:45.840> samsung<00:01:46.259> cable

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that came with my uh my samsung cable

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.770 
that came with my uh my samsung cable
which<00:01:47.159> has<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.610> pin<00:01:47.820> outs<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.540> really

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
which has the pin outs and it's really

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.660 
which has the pin outs and it's really
easy<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.140> pin<00:01:49.740> 4<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.250> unused<00:01:51.090> um<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:52.549> you<00:01:53.549> know

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
easy so pin 4 is unused um and you know

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.170 
easy so pin 4 is unused um and you know
if<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.329> use<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> micro<00:01:55.439> USB<00:01:55.470> cable<00:01:55.829> try<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.880> find

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
if you use a micro USB cable try to find

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.999 
if you use a micro USB cable try to find
one<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.840> pin<00:01:58.020> outs<00:01:58.200> then<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.770> really

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
one with the pin outs then it's really

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.929 
one with the pin outs then it's really
simple<00:01:59.130> as<00:01:59.729> soldering<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:01.020> pin<00:02:01.200> 4<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.939> then

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
simple as soldering to pin 4 and then

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.050 
simple as soldering to pin 4 and then
pin<00:02:03.689> 1<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.170> right<00:02:04.560> there<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.850> simply

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
pin 1 is right there so I just simply

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.990 
pin 1 is right there so I just simply
took<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.600> wire<00:02:07.280> solder<00:02:08.280> from<00:02:08.670> pin<00:02:08.970> 4<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
took a wire solder from pin 4 to

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.420 
took a wire solder from pin 4 to
in<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.210> and<00:02:12.420> that's<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:14.040> take<00:02:14.250> this

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
in one and that's it and to take this

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.880 
in one and that's it and to take this
off<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:14.700> carefully<00:02:15.360> use<00:02:15.690> one<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.410> those<00:02:16.620> you

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
off just carefully use one of those you

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.680 
off just carefully use one of those you
know<00:02:17.010> Swiss<00:02:17.460> Knights<00:02:17.700> or<00:02:17.940> whatever<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.510> then

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
know Swiss Knights or whatever and then

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.690 
know Swiss Knights or whatever and then
just<00:02:18.930> kind<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.320> work<00:02:19.950> your<00:02:20.010> way<00:02:20.310> in

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
just kind of work your way in

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.400 
just kind of work your way in
actually<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.390> have<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:22.110> other<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
actually I have the the other the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.440 
actually I have the the other the
original<00:02:22.980> cable<00:02:23.340> here<00:02:23.610> what<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.790> did<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.210> I<00:02:24.390> used

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
original cable here what I did is I used

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.680 
original cable here what I did is I used
my<00:02:24.990> um<00:02:25.260> my<00:02:26.300> cheap<00:02:27.300> blade<00:02:27.540> here<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:29.600> there<00:02:30.600> we

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
my um my cheap blade here and there we

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.160 
my um my cheap blade here and there we
go<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:31.890> simply<00:02:32.400> work<00:02:32.760> my<00:02:32.970> way<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.570> try

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
go and I just simply work my way in try

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.590 
go and I just simply work my way in try
to<00:02:34.200> find<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.860> micro<00:02:35.250> USB<00:02:35.280> cable<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:36.210> has<00:02:36.390> one

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
to find a micro USB cable that has one

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.240 
to find a micro USB cable that has one
of<00:02:36.630> these<00:02:36.810> lines<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.560> then<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.830> can<00:02:38.070> just

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
of these lines in it then you can just

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.850 
of these lines in it then you can just
kind<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.550> work<00:02:38.940> your<00:02:39.000> way<00:02:39.300> in<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.660> then<00:02:40.560> take

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
kind of work your way in and then take

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.940 
kind of work your way in and then take
the<00:02:41.040> top<00:02:41.220> off<00:02:41.490> in<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:42.030> bottom<00:02:42.330> off<00:02:42.510> and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
the top off in the bottom off and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.680 
the top off in the bottom off and
basically<00:02:43.950> there's<00:02:44.730> two<00:02:44.820> rubber<00:02:45.240> grommets

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
basically there's two rubber grommets

basically there's two rubber grommets
you<00:02:45.780> can<00:02:45.930> take<00:02:46.110> those<00:02:46.260> off<00:02:46.590> also<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.430> you'll

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
you can take those off also and you'll

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.900 
you can take those off also and you'll
be<00:02:48.150> able<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.420> access<00:02:49.070> these<00:02:50.070> pin<00:02:50.340> numbers<00:02:50.670> here

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
be able to access these pin numbers here

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.750 
be able to access these pin numbers here
and<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:52.050> pin<00:02:52.230> numbers<00:02:52.590> are<00:02:52.860> there<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.550> says

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
and the pin numbers are there it says

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.550 
and the pin numbers are there it says
one<00:02:54.030> right<00:02:54.240> there<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:55.130> pin<00:02:56.130> four<00:02:56.490> also<00:02:57.560> right

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
one right there and pin four also right

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.650 
one right there and pin four also right
there<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:59.010> pin<00:02:59.250> four<00:02:59.490> is<00:02:59.610> unused<00:03:00.150> again<00:03:00.420> and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
there and pin four is unused again and

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.410 
there and pin four is unused again and
this<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.620> uh<00:03:01.650> basically<00:03:02.400> what<00:03:02.730> it's<00:03:02.910> doing<00:03:03.240> is

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
this is uh basically what it's doing is

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.160 
this is uh basically what it's doing is
pin<00:03:03.840> one<00:03:04.080> is<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:05.210> five<00:03:06.210> volts<00:03:06.570> that<00:03:06.780> coming

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
pin one is the five volts that coming

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.500 
pin one is the five volts that coming
from<00:03:07.350> your<00:03:07.530> computer<00:03:07.650> or<00:03:08.040> whatever<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.610> it's

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
from your computer or whatever and it's

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.070 
from your computer or whatever and it's
hooking<00:03:09.960> up<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.350> pin<00:03:11.070> four<00:03:11.460> and<00:03:11.790> how<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.480> all

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
hooking up to pin four and how the all

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.130 
hooking up to pin four and how the all
the<00:03:13.260> droid<00:03:13.530> Motorola<00:03:14.490> Droid<00:03:14.730> Razr<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.780> you

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
the droid Motorola Droid Razr and you

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.990 
the droid Motorola Droid Razr and you
know<00:03:16.230> droid<00:03:16.470> four<00:03:16.710> how<00:03:16.950> they<00:03:17.160> work<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.790> if

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
know droid four how they work is that if

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.410 
know droid four how they work is that if
you<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:19.380> can<00:03:19.530> provide<00:03:19.860> power<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.820> pin<00:03:21.090> four

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
you you can provide power to pin four

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.200 
you you can provide power to pin four
and<00:03:21.690> then<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.770> know<00:03:22.860> during<00:03:23.190> fastboot<00:03:23.760> it

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
and then you know during fastboot it

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.090 
and then you know during fastboot it
will<00:03:24.420> have<00:03:24.690> power<00:03:24.990> instead<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.440> giving<00:03:26.010> you

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
will have power instead of giving you

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.880 
will have power instead of giving you
that<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.640> don't<00:03:27.180> have<00:03:27.270> no<00:03:27.540> power<00:03:27.810> message<00:03:28.350> so

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
that I don't have no power message so

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.250 
that I don't have no power message so
that's<00:03:29.100> what<00:03:29.340> factory<00:03:30.270> Motorola<00:03:30.840> Factory

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
that's what factory Motorola Factory

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.710 
that's what factory Motorola Factory
cable<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.860> very<00:03:32.550> easy<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.090> do<00:03:33.270> it's<00:03:33.570> actually

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
cable is very easy to do it's actually
