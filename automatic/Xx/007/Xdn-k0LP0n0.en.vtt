00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.870
 welcome the interior design course 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.700
 in this lesson we will analyze the light 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.969
 the color of light is design 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:18.930
 chromatic light delimits space forms 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.400
 of an environment and through it that 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.920
 buildings and objects are visible 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.289
 to our eyes with emotional sensations 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.400
 stimuli that illuminate the environment 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.710
 it transmits us it can expand or 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.820
 accentuate the spaces to mediate 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.290
 environments or limit the limits of the light 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.010
 can transform an environment without 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.690
 need to physically mount it the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.670
 distribution of the use the level of 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.940
 lighting are the basis of this 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.940
 process 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.030
 floor lighting allows 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.520
 to highlight the objects and the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.500
 surfaces that are usable while 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.320
 the lighting of the surfaces of the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.329
 side walls enhances vertical limits 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.590
 of the environment and has as its objective 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.010
 configure aesthetically 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.830
 the visual environment to guarantee a 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.020
 wall effect as a whole 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.240
 instead it is necessary to distribute the light in 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.340
 homogeneous way through a level 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.650
 differentiated lighting is 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.600
 It is possible to establish a hierarchical method 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.549
 of perception of space in the relationship 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.720
 between internal and external environments 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.460
 We should consider a few factors 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.560
 too high level of lighting 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.960
 interior is a dark outdoor environment 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.590
 they cause a strong reflection called 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.150
 mirror effect through the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.430
 decreased lighting level 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.659
 inside and the increase in use 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.399
 on the outside 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.200
 it is possible to reduce and objects 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.729
 externals will also be visible again 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.740
 high lighting level of the 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.170
 daylight causes the mirror effect 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.000
 on the glass surface and also in 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.630
 in this case there will be no perception 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.340
 of objects inside per color 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.280
 of light means a color that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.020
 is radiated by a light source e 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.320
 is obtained from the sum of the spectrum of 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.880
 radiated light 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.220
 the type of light color comes 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.440
 defined by hue from saturation e 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.480
 the brilliance determines the color 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.820
 from the wavelength is put into one 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.770
 monochromatic radiation or from 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.560
 dominant wavelength in one 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.650
 polychromatic radiation saturation 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.790
 is the relationship between the luminous flux 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.150
 the dominant monochrome is the flow 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.650
 total is the brilliance l 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.520
 attribute according to which a source 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.440
 the light seems to put more or less light 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.459
 white values ​​are also described 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.050
 of color temperature is color rendering 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.540
 the color temperature of white is 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.400
 articulated in three main white groups 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.850
 warm neutral white and white in the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.800
 a good daylight tone 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.940
 color rendering produces only minimal 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.450
 color differences during 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.450
 the illumination 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.220
 red is the strongest color of light 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.870
 represents the color of fire ed 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.400
 expresses strength releases energy and heat 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.260
 yellow the brightest color of the 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.160
 color range exudes brightness e 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.870
 positivity blue is the color of the sky 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.640
 and belongs to the color category 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.989
 cold that give depth and 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.940
 calm the green the color of vivacity 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.269
 and freshness produces effects 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.269
 calming 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.670
 white is the color of purity e 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.620
 gives the gray effect brightness 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.760
 indifferent and black is synonymous with 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.560
 darkness and negativity the effect of 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.600
 individual colors and their influence 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.640
 emotional can be increased by 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.350
 a chromatic contrast created 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.860
 by the association from the combination of 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:02.910
 two different colors the primary colors from 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.650
 in the strongest contrast the contrast 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.420
 chromatic is weaker for 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.239
 combinations of secondary colors e 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.310
 tertiary 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.850
 There are several types of the contrast 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.310
 simultaneous contrast the context 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.310
 complement the qualitative contrast e 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.810
 the quantitative contrast 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.790
 the effect of simultaneous contrast e 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.830
 caused by the eye if it lingers 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.150
 for a long time on one color and then 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.100
 observe a neutral gray 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.480
 the latter will seem to take the 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.170
 color tone observed 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.230
 previously in the color contrast 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.780
 the pairs of colors that are placed in the 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.640
 wide range of colors form a 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.410
 complementary contrast between a color 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.040
 primary the mixed color obtained 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.720
 from the other two primary colors the 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.140
 qualitative contrast shows the 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.180
 contrast between pure colors and in which the 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.530
 quantitative contrast refers to the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.550
 relationship between the dimensions of the 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.560
 colored surfaces the color helps 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.390
 improve the environments having the 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.900
 ability to transform the look of one 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.820
 space changing the atmosphere this is bound 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.020
 to the strong influence it has on 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:16.060
 psychology and human emotionality la 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.290
 chromatic design places its own 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.360
 origin of the study of the report 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.300
 chromatic of the building with its own 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.720
 natural landscape and urban context 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.820
 in which the rooms of the house are immersed 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.890
 they must be designed with particular 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.420
 attention to the color choices for 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.430
 guarantee a pleasant effect e 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.910
 facilitate the proper conduct of 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.920
 home life activity 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.260
 to do this it is mandatory to evaluate the 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.420
 laws of color their influence on 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:47.320
 human psyche on the nervous system e 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:49.210
 on the emotions it gives rise to is useful 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.830
 keep in mind some tricks for 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.390
 study the chromatic design of the various 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.340
 living spaces 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.740
 analyzing the functions that take place 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.220
 most frequently 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.770
 of them the input is needed to transmit 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.479
 a sense of positivity and welcome e 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.509
 warm tones of the are preferable 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.370
 red of yellow and orange the 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:10.199
 living room represents the core of the 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.259
 home where relationships come into play 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:15.479
 family and the leisure environment of the 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:16.949
 socialization through dialogue in 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.960
 which recreational activities take place 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.520
 more varied 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.590
 the shades that are appropriate for the walls 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.630
 of the living room only yellow and 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.169
 orange for plagued flying in the dialogue e 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.180
 the concentration for the study is 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.039
 preferable use of yellow shades 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.259
 in association with green, purple 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.430
 in blue to stimulate 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.479
 mental exercise 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.520
 reflection and industriousness in the bathrooms 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:43.080
 they are the most private rooms in relation 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.340
 to the topic of body care hygiene 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.860
 of relaxation 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.930
 generally we tend to use shades 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.180
 clear in particular white or 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.490
 blue tones verbs connected to the theme 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.560
 water 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.090
 the double bedrooms yes 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.190
 distinguished by the intimate character e 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.599
 private 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.490
 the most suitable shades to evoke a 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:06.210
 feeling of rest are the blue on 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.380
 violet the color used for 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.090
 children's rooms is strongly 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.159
 related to their emotional sphere e 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.110
 psychological 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:15.330
 finally corridors and stairs to a place 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.669
 of transit must evoke a sense of 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.070
 accessibility and linearity for the purpose of 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:21.570
 facilitate the path for which it is 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.880
 preferable that they be formed a 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.889
 smooth flat surfaces with games 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.400
 chromatic studied in such a way that it does not 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:31.289
 tire the eye to guarantee a 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.750
 excellent color balance inside 

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:35.520
 of domestic environments is preferable 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.830
 the use of more toned floors 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.630
 dark compared to those of the walls is 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.979
 a light colored ceiling to be able to 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:45.139
 give a sense of depth 

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:45.139
 spatial and brighter
