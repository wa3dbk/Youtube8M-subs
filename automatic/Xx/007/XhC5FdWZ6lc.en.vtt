00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
kind of struggle with this is that like

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.360 
kind of struggle with this is that like
my<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.960> never<00:00:58.730> even<00:00:59.930> like<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.620> poof<00:01:01.949> is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
my I can never even like the poof is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.100 
my I can never even like the poof is
never<00:01:02.789> symmetrical<00:01:03.420> for<00:01:03.600> me<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.930> feel

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
never symmetrical for me like I feel

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.870 
never symmetrical for me like I feel
like<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.439> think<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.220> side<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.670> side

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
like I think it's this side or this side

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.450 
like I think it's this side or this side
one<00:01:06.210> side<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.570> lower<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> love<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.220> way<00:01:08.340> it

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
one side is lower so I love the way it

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.670 
one side is lower so I love the way it
looks<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> side<00:01:09.119> profile<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.260> always

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
looks on the side profile but I always

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.399 
looks on the side profile but I always
struggle<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:11.130> how<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.580> looks<00:01:11.790> up<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:12.780> but

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
struggle with how it looks up here but

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.899 
struggle with how it looks up here but
of<00:01:13.530> course<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.100> easy<00:01:14.340> all<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.670> need<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
of course it's so easy all you need to

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.580 
of course it's so easy all you need to
do<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.119> take<00:01:15.330> some<00:01:15.360> bobby<00:01:15.689> pins<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.350> push

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
do is take some bobby pins and like push

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.810 
do is take some bobby pins and like push
it<00:01:16.740> up<00:01:16.860> from<00:01:17.040> where<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.250> needs<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.520> pushed

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
it up from where it needs to be pushed

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.999 
it up from where it needs to be pushed
up<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.270> it'll<00:01:18.900> be<00:01:19.020> completely<00:01:19.560> fine<00:01:19.799> but

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
up and it'll be completely fine but

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.950 
up and it'll be completely fine but
that's<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> hardest<00:01:20.700> part<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.270> I'm<00:01:21.780> pretty

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
that's the hardest part and I'm pretty

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.420 
that's the hardest part and I'm pretty
sure<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.350> still<00:01:22.530> do<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:23.009> curly

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430
