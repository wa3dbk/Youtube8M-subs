00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.920
 to find out what that low-oxygen 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.160
 we raise air with our body 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.290
 an edible room to a height of 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.410
 25,000 feet 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.410
 must 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.000
 No 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.270
 then 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.520
 diamond view 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.320
 good afternoon and welcome and the hyperbaric 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.900
 rooms good we start we go first 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:37.820
 do a complication check start with 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:46.910
 much as is just took his number late 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:53.500
 I teach young people to control 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:58.910
 ok we are going a few thousand kilometers 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:02.480
 i especially think when holding blue bag 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.190
 with the height because at 1830 and that in 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:21.580
 Basically those planes temple so big 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:21.580
 they should see nothing 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.580
 new 20 meters 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.289
 including people and camp for road 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:49.130
 the blue one due to the low love spot 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:51.560
 bag completely on the small turns 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.750
 on that mask on the right 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.459
 taking the right side my can 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.380
 of course to help you with hers 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:02.159
 mother go i am always there for 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.159
 rico 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:19.670
 and later followed by too little 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.050
 oxygen in the air even becomes the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.050
 simple exercises difficult 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.390
 the oxygen content of your matthias blood 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.390
 drops quickly to a dangerous level 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.530
 I even see that reading one 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.400
 button 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.400
 is particularly difficult 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.840
 all right 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.780
 the oxygen level in the blood of 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.829
 mathias fell sharply without intervention 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.829
 his danger to life 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.030
 good old one 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.970
 now 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.970
 for Business 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.360
 i am brian can that power or life 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.360
 and the branch apostles 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.200
 gino also gives me a number 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.200
 simple exercises 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.150
 not around 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.150
 thereby 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:45.300
 and that block box for toddlers 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.669
 resembles too complicated mathematics 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.150
 riddle my three year old daughter can do this 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.150
 much faster 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:18.379
 and even so far away that I am no longer in it 

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:20.509
 am able to use a simple button 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.599
 we switch button that my life can 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.599
 to rescue 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.360
 in marble 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.980
 my days 9 not with that
