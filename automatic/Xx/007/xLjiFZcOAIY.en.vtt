00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.450
 indian glass our tools 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.610
 would be the short cold flat tip and 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.610
 our nylon and we will also use 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.410
 our good design table we are going to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.850
 use our design table as your 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.100
 name indicates it is a table that we 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.170
 helps design without having to arm and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.409
 later to disrupt but the same 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.800
 table we can design our necklace 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.020
 placing 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.410
 our separators the way that what 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.650
 We want to use good then right now 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.530
 we already have our our highs of 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.470
 possible here I'm going to place the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.300
 where I want separators where 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.430
 where I think they are going to see super 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.380
 cute the beginnings with comics 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.890
 indian glass 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.189
 here in the half that is here in this 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.860
 side we have 14 14 resin stones 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.039
 placed in line glass we continue with 3 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.380
 then we continue with the separator and each 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.149
 3 I will place the separator ready 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.460
 so this is the way that I 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.560
 I want to give the necklace and each of the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.990
 portals I will place a fitting 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.909
 this is where we have the option of 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.159
 change if we do not like something if 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.960
 distances of the resins that we have 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.210
 placed we do not like it then we can 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.090
 change it without having to have 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.979
 inserted and it would touch us to not 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.509
 disrupt after good let's start 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.110
 by one of the two extremes 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.769
 we take our nylon with what we put a 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.769
 chin scale 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.370
 we accept eat one of our 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.370
 rings 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.220
 and we return for the Chinese scale 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.770
 These necklaces are very simple 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.290
 make very easy to do rapids of 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.290
 do but we are super cute 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.510
 remember that gold and color 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.340
 salmon are in furor 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.799
 and that all the inputs can 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.379
 find on our website www point 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.799

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.799
 here 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.660
 I already have one end and now if 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.240
 we proceed to do to place all 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.420
 our stones in the order that we have 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.420
 here 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.890
 well we've done the first the 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.040
 first part of our necklace and 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.659
 we continue and as you can see it was like no 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.889
 he was staying on the design board 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:45.750
 we have finished inserting all the 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.879
 all our resins in our nylon 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.829
 then here we check once again 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:54.139
 everything is fine to proceed to 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.139
 close we take the chin scale 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.760
 we eat a ring 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.290
 and we will return 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.849
 we will not have spaces 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.009
 and we close 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:37.539
 we cut the excess nylon 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.350
 our necklace 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.100
 and now we are going to place the charms in the 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.200
 porta days 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.630
 we take the ring remember how 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.190
 we must open the rings one the 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.170
 we throw to one side to the front and 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.140
 the other can be done towards the 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:06.980
 body of us placed in the holder 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:10.180
 I said and we take in this case our pendant 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.180
 big that is the little bell 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.810
 and we close 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.169
 in the same way that we open them 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.169
 we close 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.320
 and 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.919
 well we have our collar 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.590
 we have already placed the charms in each one 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:50.750
 of laptops now what we lack 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.400
 is the brooch then we open one of the 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.400
 rings of one end 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.319
 and we put our brooch 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.979
 ah 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.690
 in this way we already finish remember 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.850
 which are very simple necklaces of 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.170
 but they are very nice what 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.900
 we want you to see also are the 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.030
 combinations that can be made and the 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.830
 fashion that at the moment is hawk or 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.830
 salmon I furor and the golden one that follows 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.630
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.580
 necklace that we made today 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:07.520
 Remember that gold is still fashionable to 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.900
 same as the color salmon and as we see 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.810
