00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
be doing a video on the neutral switch

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.440 
be doing a video on the neutral switch
reason<00:00:11.700> why<00:00:11.820> I'm<00:00:11.880> making<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.269> video

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
reason why I'm making this video

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.169 
reason why I'm making this video
especially<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.259> because<00:00:13.940> we're<00:00:14.940> going<00:00:15.120> to

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
especially is because we're going to

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.880 
especially is because we're going to
eliminate<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.780> neutral<00:00:16.139> switch<00:00:16.379> now<00:00:16.680> what

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
eliminate the neutral switch now what

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.240 
eliminate the neutral switch now what
that<00:00:16.920> does<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.779> bad<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.529> neutral<00:00:19.980> it

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
that does is the bad is in neutral it

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.420 
that does is the bad is in neutral it
takes<00:00:20.670> away<00:00:20.939> from<00:00:20.970> your<00:00:21.390> rev<00:00:22.080> limiter<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
takes away from your rev limiter the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.529 
takes away from your rev limiter the
7500<00:00:24.210> RPM<00:00:24.660> rev<00:00:25.529> limiter<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.330> null<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.359> void

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
7500 RPM rev limiter is null and void

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.960 
7500 RPM rev limiter is null and void
does<00:00:28.170> away<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.279> good<00:00:29.460> thing<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.939> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
does away with it the good thing is a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.840 
does away with it the good thing is a
supposedly<00:00:30.570> easier<00:00:31.019> starts<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.560> whatnot<00:00:31.890> I'm

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
supposedly easier starts and whatnot I'm

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.220 
supposedly easier starts and whatnot I'm
not<00:00:33.149> doing<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.540> for<00:00:33.690> either<00:00:33.780> one<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.079> those

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
not doing it for either one of those

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.889 
not doing it for either one of those
reasons<00:00:34.500> reason<00:00:35.370> why<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.820> am<00:00:36.270> doing<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.719> is

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
reasons reason why I am doing it is

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.569 
reasons reason why I am doing it is
because<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.309> my<00:00:38.340> neutral<00:00:38.790> switch<00:00:39.210> well

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
because here is my neutral switch well

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.400 
because here is my neutral switch well
moving<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.760> bike<00:00:41.879> had<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> water<00:00:43.020> hang<00:00:43.230> in

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
moving the bike had the water hang in

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.330 
moving the bike had the water hang in
stepped<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.610> ripped<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.969> out<00:00:45.120> so

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
stepped on it ripped it out so

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.319 
stepped on it ripped it out so
essentially<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.820> put<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.090> back

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
essentially you can just put this back

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.439 
essentially you can just put this back
in<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.780> you're<00:00:49.350> good<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.559> go<00:00:49.820> but<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.000> wanted<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
in and you're good to go but I wanted to

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.470 
in and you're good to go but I wanted to
make<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.780> little<00:00:51.870> fancier<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:53.420> show<00:00:54.420> you

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
make it a little fancier and show you

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.080 
make it a little fancier and show you
what<00:00:54.600> we're<00:00:54.750> going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.079> here<00:00:55.940> we're<00:00:56.940> going

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
what we're going to do here we're going

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.369 
what we're going to do here we're going

can<00:01:22.140> either<00:01:22.439> leave<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.799> spring<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
can either leave the spring in the

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.440 
can either leave the spring in the
little<00:01:25.799> push<00:01:25.950> rod<00:01:26.189> end<00:01:26.430> take<00:01:26.909> them<00:01:27.060> out<00:01:27.180> I'm

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
little push rod end take them out I'm

little push rod end take them out I'm
choosing<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:27.960> take<00:01:28.229> them<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.790> just<00:01:29.790> because

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
choosing to take them out just because

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.969 
choosing to take them out just because
just<00:01:31.409> using<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> little<00:01:31.740> magnet<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
just using a little magnet here and the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.649 
just using a little magnet here and the
spring<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.340> not<00:01:35.520> wanting<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.030> come<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.210> let<00:01:36.600> me

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
spring is not wanting to come out let me

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.260 
spring is not wanting to come out let me
get<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> little<00:01:37.020> pick

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.789 

again<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.540> leave<00:01:42.690> those<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:42.960> it's

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
again you can leave those in it's

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.670 
again you can leave those in it's
entirely<00:01:44.130> up<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.080> I'm<00:01:46.080> just<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.619> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
take them out there's a spring next

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.639 
take them out there's a spring next
thing<00:01:55.080> we'll<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:57.140> we'll<00:01:58.140> go<00:01:58.200> ahead<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
thing we'll do is we'll go ahead and

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.639 
thing we'll do is we'll go ahead and
install<00:01:58.860> our<00:01:59.420> it<00:02:00.420> goes<00:02:00.690> that<00:02:00.899> way<00:02:00.960> doesn't

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
install our it goes that way doesn't

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.300 
install our it goes that way doesn't
matter<00:02:01.770> which<00:02:01.979> way<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:03.770> actually<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.130> should

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
matter which way but actually you should

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.080 
matter which way but actually you should
apply<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.850> little<00:02:06.030> bit<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.299> grease<00:02:06.540> around<00:02:06.690> the
