00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
see that is that something maybe I

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.359 
see that is that something maybe I
should<00:01:42.240> create<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> second<00:01:42.840> channel<00:01:43.140> 4<00:01:43.369> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
should create a second channel 4 and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.520 
should create a second channel 4 and
would<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.210> maybe<00:01:46.020> some<00:01:46.320> more

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
would you like to see maybe some more

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.050 
would you like to see maybe some more
real-life<00:01:46.770> Clips<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.430> did<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.820> couple

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
real-life Clips like I did for a couple

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.810 
real-life Clips like I did for a couple
of<00:01:48.119> weeks<00:01:48.770> in<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.280> middle<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:50.610> runescape

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
of weeks in the middle of my runescape

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.340 
of weeks in the middle of my runescape
videos<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.540> it'd<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.840> ninety<00:01:52.229> percent

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
videos so it'd be like ninety percent

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.380 
videos so it'd be like ninety percent
runescape<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.070> then<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:53.610> ten<00:01:53.820> percent<00:01:54.149> real

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
runescape and then like ten percent real

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.609 
runescape and then like ten percent real
life<00:01:54.540> clips<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.110> it'd<00:01:55.200> all<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.530> same

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
life clips but it'd all be in the same

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.950 
life clips but it'd all be in the same
video<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.369> basically<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.390> context<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
video so basically the context in the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.420 
video so basically the context in the
goal<00:01:58.200> or<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.469> purpose<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.920> video<00:01:59.070> will<00:01:59.340> be

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
goal or the purpose of the video will be

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.310 
goal or the purpose of the video will be
ruined<00:01:59.610> scape<00:01:59.850> related<00:02:00.270> such<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:01.200> know

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
ruined scape related such as you know

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.539 
ruined scape related such as you know
the<00:02:01.530> amount<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.799> experience<00:02:02.070> I've<00:02:02.369> gained

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
the amount of experience I've gained

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.609

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
during the week or whatever but maybe

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.260 
during the week or whatever but maybe
