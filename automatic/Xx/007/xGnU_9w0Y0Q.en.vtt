00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.780 
this is my personal favorite powder
board<00:00:31.900> because<00:00:32.710> it<00:00:32.800> was<00:00:32.920> designed<00:00:33.040> to<00:00:33.340> be<00:00:33.550> more

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
board because it was designed to be more

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.790 
board because it was designed to be more
of<00:00:34.030> a<00:00:34.060> freestyle<00:00:34.780> board<00:00:34.930> for<00:00:35.560> the<00:00:35.620> powder

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800

environment<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:36.970> see<00:00:37.180> you<00:00:37.270> can<00:00:37.450> set<00:00:37.660> up<00:00:37.690> your

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
environment you see you can set up your

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.630 
environment you see you can set up your
stance<00:00:38.140> more<00:00:38.350> centered<00:00:38.860> like<00:00:39.070> a<00:00:39.100> freestyle

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
stance more centered like a freestyle

deck<00:00:39.850> would<00:00:40.090> so<00:00:40.630> you<00:00:40.690> don't<00:00:40.930> really<00:00:41.080> have<00:00:41.200> to

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
deck would so you don't really have to

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.020 
deck would so you don't really have to
change<00:00:41.620> your<00:00:41.770> riding<00:00:41.980> style<00:00:42.220> the<00:00:42.550> pow

change your riding style the pow

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.670 
change your riding style the pow
you<00:00:43.239> just<00:00:43.420> let<00:00:43.600> the<00:00:43.690> board<00:00:43.900> do<00:00:44.080> the<00:00:44.200> work<00:00:44.380> so

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
you just let the board do the work so

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.280 
you just let the board do the work so

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
Charlie's designed with the big rockered

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.560 
Charlie's designed with the big rockered
pound<00:00:47.590> nose<00:00:47.830> and<00:00:48.130> a<00:00:48.520> zero<00:00:48.850> camber<00:00:49.150> section

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
pound nose and a zero camber section

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.900 
pound nose and a zero camber section
from<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:50.320> front<00:00:50.620> insert<00:00:50.950> pack<00:00:51.190> all<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.820> way

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
from the front insert pack all the way

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.960 
from the front insert pack all the way
through<00:00:52.180> a<00:00:52.239> 20<00:00:52.690> millimeter<00:00:52.930> tapered<00:00:53.530> tail<00:00:53.970> so

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
through a 20 millimeter tapered tail so

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.729 
through a 20 millimeter tapered tail so
that<00:00:55.059> tail<00:00:55.300> just<00:00:55.540> naturally<00:00:56.019> sinks<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.530> nose

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
that tail just naturally sinks the nose

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.500 
that tail just naturally sinks the nose
naturally<00:00:57.190> floats<00:00:57.519> and<00:00:58.089> it<00:00:58.210> makes<00:00:58.390> the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
naturally floats and it makes the

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.869 
naturally floats and it makes the
experience<00:00:58.930> easier<00:00:59.410> and<00:00:59.620> more<00:00:59.739> efficient<00:01:00.220> so

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
experience easier and more efficient so

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.549 
experience easier and more efficient so
really<00:01:01.239> it<00:01:01.300> just<00:01:01.360> allows<00:01:01.720> you<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.050> not<00:01:02.199> get<00:01:02.379> so

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
really it just allows you to not get so

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.380 
really it just allows you to not get so

board<00:01:08.650> we<00:01:09.100> now<00:01:09.250> have<00:01:09.460> a<00:01:09.490> touring<00:01:10.000> core<00:01:10.270> which

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
board we now have a touring core which

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.930 
board we now have a touring core which
