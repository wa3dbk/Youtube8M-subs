00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
mechanics will get to find and of course

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.480 
mechanics will get to find and of course
get<00:00:27.660> out<00:00:27.840> on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> track<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.590> race<00:00:28.800> conditions

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
think that's added pressure do you think

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.770 
think that's added pressure do you think
lots<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.800> people<00:01:46.860> are<00:01:47.070> gonna<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.340> watching<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
lots of people are gonna be watching you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.230 
lots of people are gonna be watching you
yeah<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:49.050> sure<00:01:49.110> there's<00:01:49.890> some<00:01:50.550> pressure<00:01:50.820> but

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
yeah for sure there's some pressure but

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.380 
yeah for sure there's some pressure but
I<00:01:51.420> think<00:01:51.690> because<00:01:52.200> I'm<00:01:52.640> 18<00:01:53.640> years<00:01:53.670> old<00:01:54.060> there's

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
I think because I'm 18 years old there's

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.810 
I think because I'm 18 years old there's
not<00:01:54.840> too<00:01:55.320> much<00:01:55.530> pressure<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.190> my<00:01:56.400> first<00:01:56.670> year

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
not too much pressure in my first year

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.720 
not too much pressure in my first year

the<00:02:24.500> size<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.830> cake<00:02:24.980> doesn't<00:02:25.130> correlate<00:02:25.640> to

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
the size the cake doesn't correlate to

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.559 
the size the cake doesn't correlate to
the<00:02:26.090> age<00:02:26.300> or<00:02:26.660> no<00:02:26.870> no<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.290> course<00:02:27.349> and<00:02:27.849> so<00:02:28.849> it

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
the age or no no of course and so it

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.270 
the age or no no of course and so it
also<00:02:29.750> said<00:02:30.110> hopefully<00:02:30.410> this<00:02:30.769> won't<00:02:30.920> slow<00:02:31.220> you

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
also said hopefully this won't slow you

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.180 
also said hopefully this won't slow you
down<00:02:31.550> SI<00:02:32.239> Barcelona<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.410> didn't<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:33.950> if

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
down SI Barcelona and it didn't so if

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.380 
down SI Barcelona and it didn't so if
anything<00:02:34.459> gave<00:02:34.849> you<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.000> bit<00:02:35.120> more<00:02:35.150> energy

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
anything gave you a bit more energy

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.720 
anything gave you a bit more energy
surely<00:02:36.050> how<00:02:36.290> was<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.890> was<00:02:37.160> good<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.519> test

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
surely how was that it was good the test

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.509 
surely how was that it was good the test
was<00:02:37.880> good<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:38.299> it's<00:02:38.690> kind<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.319> strange<00:02:40.220> adore

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
was good so it's kind of strange adore

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.920 
was good so it's kind of strange adore
the<00:02:40.670> traveling<00:02:41.030> upstairs<00:02:41.420> in<00:02:41.510> Malaysia<00:02:41.780> the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
the traveling upstairs in Malaysia the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.800

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
day before i came to test and you know

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.210 
day before i came to test and you know
with<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:44.989> time<00:02:45.230> zone<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:45.739> jet<00:02:45.890> negative

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
with the time zone and jet negative

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.470 
with the time zone and jet negative
things<00:02:46.400> but<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:46.700> said<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.000> test<00:02:47.209> went<00:02:47.450> really

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
things but I said the test went really

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.809 
things but I said the test went really
well<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.709> I<00:02:48.769> had<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:48.950> couple<00:02:49.130> of<00:02:49.250> success<00:02:49.610> in

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
well so and I had a couple of success in

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.820 
well so and I had a couple of success in
2010<00:02:50.660> when<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:50.840> did<00:02:51.019> that<00:02:51.200> flew<00:02:51.440> from<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.739> other

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
2010 when I did that flew from the other

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.780 
2010 when I did that flew from the other
side<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.190> world<00:02:52.340> so<00:02:52.519> I<00:02:52.549> think<00:02:52.640> maybe

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
side of the world so I think maybe

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.400 
side of the world so I think maybe
that's<00:02:53.150> what<00:02:53.269> I<00:02:53.299> need<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.599> start<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:53.959> is<00:02:54.140> just
