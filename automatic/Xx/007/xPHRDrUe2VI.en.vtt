 galactic 1 450 50 gb free memory 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.079

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.660

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.980

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.050
 To bring stores firefox only

 This time is downloaded at Krems 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.880
 is always different because there is such a lure below 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.800
 small sign on yes and if that 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.880
 normally downloaded then 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:33.330
 you're typing right here on it but me 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.240
 lasts too long so i will be here 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.750
 make a cut or yes do it now 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.460
 just over the files browser 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.710
 because I 've already downloaded that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.590
 I do not have to do that 80 now 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.510
 download it here so there it is 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.740
 let's just click on it up here 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.810
 on the download when that's done 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.370
 if you have no files explorer 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.560
 and click on install you see 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.110
 with me the update installed because I 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.360
 I have it installed then we wait 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.500
 wait under 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.619
 and then wait for it's done on it 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.690
 finished and watch where it is installed 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:17.480
 has been 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:19.490
 this level is there then loads 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.800
 the first time 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.990
 comes as far as I know now 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.040
 first comes the simson screen exactly 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.020
 this and there is still download and no 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.150
 I know what I want here 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.040
 let alone I have that 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.040
 already I have already that 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.010
 tutorial made and etc you table that 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.850
 Everything does not see their origin 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.290
 account on your old springfield 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.020
 I advise you first with your old one 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:54.980
 to make springfield purely so that 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:57.830
 whole city will backup and then exactly 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.090
 and allow yourself to join the song 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.640
 or do you already have your city? 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.230
 is little not make eight times the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.230
 I think it makes sense 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.650
 I think no box says 80 times 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.989
 somehow not start 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.180
 I see her already march so maximum me 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.910
 have already here the par clone 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.510
 unlocked what I also very funny 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.650
 found because earlier it was not around 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.810
 konan stairs and ya got here to stairs 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.000
 As you can see, I already have a bit 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.470
 let's not cheat that you do not have 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.320
 but of course you can do it anyway 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.269
 Buy this is not a thing but she has 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.670
 only 100 had no 0 or 0 here 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:41.090
 80 depending on where the customers stand everything 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.590
 just do not buy now 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.880
 irritate of the 100 is there with you 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:50.540
 not here then we can do that here 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.049
 buy nonsense and then we get too 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.940
 money exactly and the nerds i believe can 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.750
 you do not upgrade as I said there must 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.579
 you look 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.570
 I 'm still with the simpsons 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:04.310
 not procured let alone I have there 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.900
 not so much what you looked at 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.360
 you can do everything you can 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.430
 many do that is such a small yes 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.720
 I would not guess blÃ¶ding game 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.720
 say build your city something like 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.209
 simcity coming soon for android 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.250
 Maybe I will if that 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.500
 can also be pushed if it is 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.120
 she gives because I think there will be 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.060
 many are interested in the graphics 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.240
 good and yes i would say we see 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.240
 us 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.640
 With
