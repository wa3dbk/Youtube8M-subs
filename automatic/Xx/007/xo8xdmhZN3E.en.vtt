unfortunately<00:00:35.610> got<00:00:35.940> one<00:00:36.270> with<00:00:36.559> some<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
unfortunately got one with some of the

unfortunately got one with some of the
horizontal<00:00:38.340> lines<00:00:38.780> so<00:00:40.640> maybe<00:00:41.640> I'll<00:00:41.820> order

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
horizontal lines so maybe I'll order

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.490 
horizontal lines so maybe I'll order
another<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.510> or<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.809> think<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.200> might<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.440> a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
another one or I think you might have a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.260 
another one or I think you might have a
fix<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:43.890> them<00:00:44.160> by<00:00:44.250> adding<00:00:44.520> some<00:00:44.670> capacitors

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270

i've<00:02:44.060> probably<00:02:44.330> switch<00:02:44.720> those<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:46.040> something

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
i've probably switch those to something

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.580 
i've probably switch those to something
that<00:02:46.610> will<00:02:46.819> break<00:02:47.180> in<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.480> case<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.989> a<00:02:48.049> crash<00:02:48.319> so

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
that will break in a case of a crash so

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.729 
that will break in a case of a crash so
the<00:02:48.709> carbon-fiber<00:02:49.220> doesn't<00:02:49.670> break<00:02:50.739> the

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
the carbon-fiber doesn't break the

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.830 
the carbon-fiber doesn't break the
quality<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.280> carbon<00:02:52.670> fiber<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:53.209> far<00:02:53.420> seems<00:02:53.750> to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
quality of carbon fiber so far seems to

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.259 
quality of carbon fiber so far seems to
be<00:02:53.930> holding<00:02:54.230> up<00:02:54.590> i<00:02:54.860> crashed<00:02:55.370> into<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.790> tree<00:02:56.120> the

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
be holding up i crashed into a tree the

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.569 
be holding up i crashed into a tree the
other<00:02:56.390> day<00:02:56.599> and<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:56.870> seems<00:02:57.049> to<00:02:57.230> have<00:02:57.860> held<00:02:58.430> up

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
other day and it seems to have held up

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.949 
other day and it seems to have held up
as<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.790> can<00:02:58.910> see<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.329> can<00:02:59.420> see<00:02:59.569> some<00:02:59.720> leaves

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
as you can see you can see some leaves

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.620 
as you can see you can see some leaves
and<00:03:00.019> stuff<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.380> here<00:03:00.560> but<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:02.299> know<00:03:02.420> for<00:03:02.600> a

and stuff in here but you know for a

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.910 
and stuff in here but you know for a
budget<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.560> hack<00:03:04.220> some<00:03:04.579> mini<00:03:04.790> hexacopter<00:03:05.920> it's

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
budget to hack some mini hexacopter it's

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.120 
budget to hack some mini hexacopter it's
pretty<00:03:07.190> good<00:03:07.430> quite<00:03:08.030> happy<00:03:08.359> with<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.829> it<00:03:09.829> isn't

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
pretty good quite happy with it it isn't

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.900 
pretty good quite happy with it it isn't
gonna<00:03:10.220> have<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.609> blackout<00:03:10.970> quality<00:03:12.310> but<00:03:13.310> hey

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
gonna have the blackout quality but hey

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.770 
gonna have the blackout quality but hey
for<00:03:14.359> an<00:03:15.230> 80<00:03:15.470> or<00:03:15.590> $90<00:03:16.069> frame<00:03:16.519> it's<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:17.389> think<00:03:17.450> in

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
for an 80 or $90 frame it's I think in

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.360 
for an 80 or $90 frame it's I think in
my<00:03:17.930> opinion<00:03:18.290> it's<00:03:18.470> worth<00:03:18.590> checking<00:03:18.980> out<00:03:19.160> at

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
my opinion it's worth checking out at

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.030 
my opinion it's worth checking out at
least<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.910> get<00:03:20.359> you<00:03:20.510> into<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.959> Hobby<00:03:21.170> at<00:03:21.889> least

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
least to get you into the Hobby at least

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.960 
least to get you into the Hobby at least
into<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.370> mini<00:03:22.579> hexes<00:03:23.920> I'm<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:25.280> would<00:03:25.670> like<00:03:25.850> to

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
into the mini hexes I'm I would like to

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.059 
into the mini hexes I'm I would like to
upgrade<00:03:26.120> these<00:03:26.420> motors<00:03:26.870> as<00:03:27.019> well<00:03:27.200> eventually

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069

show you some of the some of the flight

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.569 
show you some of the some of the flight
characteristics<00:03:40.130> on<00:03:40.549> the<00:03:40.810> acceleration<00:03:42.579> and

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
characteristics on the acceleration and

00:03:43.579 --> 00:04:42.910 
characteristics on the acceleration and
how<00:03:43.790> flies

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:05:27.840 

no<00:04:43.490> shortage<00:04:44.030> of<00:04:44.150> power

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:06:23.529 

now<00:05:28.850> there's<00:05:29.030> only<00:05:29.120> a<00:05:29.240> 3/4<00:05:29.930> throttle

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:24.800 

Wow

Wow

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:53.719 
Wow
this<00:06:24.930> thing<00:06:25.110> is<00:06:25.229> fast

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:57.539 

anyways<00:06:54.729> that<00:06:55.449> was<00:06:55.539> a<00:06:55.569> pretty<00:06:55.869> good<00:06:55.959> flight<00:06:56.549> if

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:57.549 
anyways that was a pretty good flight if

00:06:57.549 --> 00:06:59.819 
anyways that was a pretty good flight if
it<00:06:57.699> loaded<00:06:58.029> down<00:06:58.179> I<00:06:58.569> got<00:06:58.839> the<00:06:58.959> bow<00:06:59.110> battery

00:06:59.819 --> 00:06:59.829 
it loaded down I got the bow battery

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:01.350 
it loaded down I got the bow battery
balance<00:07:00.219> so<00:07:00.369> now<00:07:00.489> when<00:07:00.819> I<00:07:00.849> give<00:07:01.059> it<00:07:01.179> full

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
balance so now when I give it full

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.769 
balance so now when I give it full
throttle<00:07:01.389> it<00:07:01.929> goes<00:07:02.049> straight<00:07:02.229> up<00:07:03.629> not<00:07:04.629> too

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:04.779 
throttle it goes straight up not too

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:07.439 
throttle it goes straight up not too
much<00:07:04.959> oscillation<00:07:05.679> coming<00:07:05.979> down<00:07:06.159> quite<00:07:07.149> happy

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:07.449 
much oscillation coming down quite happy

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:10.799 
much oscillation coming down quite happy
with<00:07:07.569> this<00:07:08.459> anyways<00:07:09.459> next<00:07:10.059> hopefully<00:07:10.509> do<00:07:10.779> a
