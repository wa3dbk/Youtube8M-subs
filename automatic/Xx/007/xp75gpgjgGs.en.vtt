00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
had already shown QB power so I kind it

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.049 
had already shown QB power so I kind it
was<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.200> yeah<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.710> don't<00:00:50.579> really<00:00:50.700> feel<00:00:50.820> like

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
was like yeah I don't really feel like

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.850 
was like yeah I don't really feel like
showing<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.719> again<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.500> really

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
showing that again so I just really

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.410 
showing that again so I just really
didn't<00:00:53.129> bother<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> jet<00:00:54.210> heavy

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
didn't bother with the jet heavy

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.400 
didn't bother with the jet heavy
formation<00:00:56.270> but<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> reality<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.109> it

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
formation but the reality is is that it

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.500 
formation but the reality is is that it
still<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> very<00:00:59.489> strong<00:00:59.789> formation<00:01:00.359> now

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
still is a very strong formation now

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.080 
still is a very strong formation now
this<00:01:01.379> year<00:01:01.710> we're<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.280> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.670> take<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> look

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
this year we're not going to take a look

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.320 
this year we're not going to take a look
at<00:01:03.270> QB<00:01:03.660> power<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.170> actually<00:01:04.470> QB<00:01:05.010> blast<00:01:05.430> that

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
at QB power it's actually QB blast that

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.270 
at QB power it's actually QB blast that
is<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> more<00:01:06.869> effective<00:01:07.409> run<00:01:07.650> all<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.070> need<00:01:08.250> to

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
is the more effective run all we need to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.750 
is the more effective run all we need to
do<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.729> slide<00:01:09.689> protect<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.320> left<00:01:10.610> find<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
do is slide protect to the left find the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.840 
do is slide protect to the left find the
hole<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.270> take<00:01:12.479> off<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.869> our<00:01:12.900> quarterback

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
hole and take off with our quarterback

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.609 
hole and take off with our quarterback
just<00:01:14.850> by<00:01:14.970> slide<00:01:15.360> protecting<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> left<00:01:16.350> I

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
just by slide protecting to the left I

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.710 
just by slide protecting to the left I
find<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.310> gives<00:01:17.610> us<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.970> biggest<00:01:18.180> advantage

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
find that gives us the biggest advantage

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.530 
find that gives us the biggest advantage
last<00:01:19.049> year<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.439> QB<00:01:19.860> power<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.490> told<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.420> the

was<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.000> little<00:01:24.630> bit<00:01:24.720> more<00:01:24.869> geared<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.530> run<00:01:25.799> into

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
was a little bit more geared to run into

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.890 
was a little bit more geared to run into
the<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.159> side<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.670> field<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.090> QB<00:01:27.600> blast

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.030 
quarterback in the game I find his
accuracy<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.070> unreal<00:01:59.640> he's<00:02:00.600> also<00:02:00.899> very<00:02:01.170> good

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.510 
they provide I find is its kind of
unmatched<00:02:34.070> compared<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.160> any<00:02:35.340> other

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
unmatched compared to any other

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.330 
unmatched compared to any other
quarterback<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.450> i<00:02:36.570> use<00:02:37.340> carolina

quarterback that i use carolina

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.920 
quarterback that i use carolina

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
heavy I just like some of the personnel

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.060 
heavy I just like some of the personnel
that<00:02:48.570> they<00:02:48.690> have<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:49.380> course<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.770> can<00:02:49.920> use

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
that they have of course you can use

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.120 
that they have of course you can use
whatever<00:02:50.220> team<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.760> is<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:52.130> but

whatever team it is that you like but

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.500 
whatever team it is that you like but
Tennessee<00:02:53.580> Titans<00:02:53.910> are<00:02:54.000> definitely<00:02:54.360> one<00:02:54.480> of

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
Tennessee Titans are definitely one of

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.570 
Tennessee Titans are definitely one of
my<00:02:54.600> favorites<00:02:55.020> another<00:02:55.740> wrinkle<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.250> we<00:02:56.430> can

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
my favorites another wrinkle that we can

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.580 
my favorites another wrinkle that we can
add<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.330> just<00:02:57.630> by<00:02:57.750> motioning<00:02:58.320> one<00:02:58.500> of

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
add to this is just by motioning one of

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.680 
add to this is just by motioning one of
the<00:02:58.650> players<00:02:58.860> in<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.160> backfield<00:02:59.400> either<00:03:00.270> to

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
the players in the backfield either to

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.740 
the players in the backfield either to
the<00:03:00.810> right<00:03:00.840> or<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.380> left<00:03:01.670> but<00:03:02.670> don't<00:03:03.030> try<00:03:03.720> to

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
the right or the left but don't try to

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.320 
the right or the left but don't try to
force<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.709> if<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.160> motion<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.880> guy<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.300> left

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
force it if you motion a guy to the left

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.090 
force it if you motion a guy to the left
don't<00:03:06.780> try<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.110> run<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.650> left<00:03:07.920> just

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
don't try to run to the left just

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.410 
don't try to run to the left just
because<00:03:08.430> that's<00:03:08.580> where<00:03:08.790> your<00:03:08.910> motion<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.270> guy

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
because that's where your motion a guy

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.780 
because that's where your motion a guy
if<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:10.320> hole<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.100> right<00:03:11.280> or<00:03:11.520> whatever

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
if the hole is to the right or whatever

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.730 
if the hole is to the right or whatever
that's<00:03:12.570> where<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.900> need<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.140> go<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.530> hope

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740
