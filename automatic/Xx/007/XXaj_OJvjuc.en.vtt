00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.119 

this<00:00:00.510> chapter<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.960> about<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.350> triangular

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
this chapter is about the triangular

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.370 
this chapter is about the triangular
modifier<00:00:02.909> and<00:00:03.210> since<00:00:03.540> it<00:00:03.689> has<00:00:03.720> only<00:00:04.110> one

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
modifier and since it has only one

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.200 
modifier and since it has only one
setting<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:04.920> guess<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.370> is<00:00:05.460> going<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.790> be<00:00:05.910> a

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
setting I guess this is going to be a

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.620 
setting I guess this is going to be a
really<00:00:06.839> really<00:00:07.080> short<00:00:07.460> tutorial<00:00:08.460> as<00:00:08.670> you<00:00:09.450> can

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
really really short tutorial as you can

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.440 
really really short tutorial as you can
see<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.110> have<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:10.500> torus<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.820> have<00:00:12.030> used

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
see I have this torus and I have used

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.600 
see I have this torus and I have used
the<00:00:12.630> triangular<00:00:13.320> modifier<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.309> and

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
the triangular modifier on it and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.640 
the triangular modifier on it and
nothing's<00:00:15.150> happening<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.440> of

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
nothing's happening and that is of

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.910 
nothing's happening and that is of
course<00:00:16.890> because<00:00:17.400> we<00:00:18.060> don't<00:00:18.869> see<00:00:19.230> whether<00:00:19.680> this

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
course because we don't see whether this

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.460 
course because we don't see whether this
is<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> triangle<00:00:20.640> or<00:00:20.880> quad<00:00:21.510> because<00:00:22.170> they're

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
is a triangle or quad because they're

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.720 
is a triangle or quad because they're
very<00:00:22.560> very<00:00:22.859> irregular

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
very very irregular

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.880 
very very irregular
even<00:00:24.090> if<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.300> turn<00:00:24.359> Beauty<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.350> off<00:00:25.470> that

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
even if I turn Beauty on and off that

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.060 
even if I turn Beauty on and off that
does<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.820> change<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.359> thing<00:00:27.590> which<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.800> quite

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
does not change a thing which is quite

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.220 
does not change a thing which is quite
different<00:00:29.279> with<00:00:29.670> Suzanne<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.869> can<00:00:31.050> see

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
different with Suzanne you can see

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.470 
different with Suzanne you can see
Suzanne<00:00:31.619> has<00:00:31.859> very<00:00:32.160> different<00:00:32.610> face<00:00:32.820> sizes

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
Suzanne has very different face sizes

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.910 
Suzanne has very different face sizes
you<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.690> some<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:35.040> pretty<00:00:35.399> much<00:00:36.120> all

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
you have some that are pretty much all

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.729 
you have some that are pretty much all
rectangles<00:00:37.920> while<00:00:38.790> others<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:40.020> really

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
rectangles while others have really

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.970 
rectangles while others have really
distorted<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:42.350> you<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.500> see<00:00:43.620> those<00:00:43.739> are

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
distorted and you can see those are

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.720 
distorted and you can see those are
really<00:00:44.129> big<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.950> here<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.100> go<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.520> I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
really big and so on and here we go if I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.020 
really big and so on and here we go if I
use<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> triangular<00:00:49.200> modifier<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.280> Suzanne<00:00:50.789> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
use a triangular modifier on Suzanne and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.779 
use a triangular modifier on Suzanne and
I<00:00:51.120> check<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> beauty<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.649> really<00:00:53.340> changes

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
I check the beauty it really changes

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.119 
I check the beauty it really changes
something<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.469> you<00:00:55.469> can<00:00:55.620> see<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.949> lot

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
something and you can see it a lot

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.910 
something and you can see it a lot
better<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.239> subsurf<00:00:57.750> modifier<00:00:57.920> below

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
better with the subsurf modifier below

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.400 
better with the subsurf modifier below
it<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.760> know<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> subsurf<00:01:00.570> modifier<00:01:00.629> doesn't

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
it you know the subsurf modifier doesn't

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.690 
it you know the subsurf modifier doesn't
do<00:01:01.800> well<00:01:02.039> with<00:01:02.100> triangles<00:01:02.879> check<00:01:03.439> beauty<00:01:04.700> then

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
do well with triangles check beauty then

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.320 
do well with triangles check beauty then
you<00:01:05.820> will<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.450> difference<00:01:07.549> anyways<00:01:08.549> you

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
you will see the difference anyways you

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.390 
you will see the difference anyways you
might<00:01:09.360> ask<00:01:09.689> yourself<00:01:09.840> why<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.409> should<00:01:10.740> use<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
might ask yourself why you should use a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.910 
might ask yourself why you should use a
triangular<00:01:12.000> modifier<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.810> mean<00:01:13.020> triangles

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
triangular modifier I mean triangles

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.429 
triangular modifier I mean triangles
break<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.400> edge<00:01:14.670> loops<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.479> they<00:01:15.689> don't<00:01:16.259> work

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
break up edge loops and they don't work

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.520 
break up edge loops and they don't work
well<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:17.189> some<00:01:17.880> other<00:01:18.060> modifiers<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.960> that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
well with some other modifiers and that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.929 
well with some other modifiers and that
is<00:01:19.650> usually<00:01:19.830> for<00:01:20.549> physics<00:01:21.180> or<00:01:21.600> game<00:01:22.470> stuff<00:01:23.280> for

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
is usually for physics or game stuff for

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.870 
is usually for physics or game stuff for
example<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.689> probably<00:01:25.470> largest<00:01:25.950> physics

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
example the probably largest physics

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.810 
example the probably largest physics
simulation<00:01:27.689> program<00:01:28.140> realflow<00:01:28.979> will<00:01:29.579> not

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
simulation program realflow will not

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.300 
simulation program realflow will not
import<00:01:30.270> any<00:01:30.570> mesh<00:01:30.810> unless<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.380> triangulated

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
import any mesh unless it's triangulated

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.760 
import any mesh unless it's triangulated
so<00:01:33.060> there's<00:01:33.240> one<00:01:33.450> use<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.020> let's<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.680> look

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
so there's one use and let's have a look

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.980 
so there's one use and let's have a look
at<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.979> beauty<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.909> beauty<00:01:35.939> subdivide<00:01:36.750> will

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
at that beauty the beauty subdivide will

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.319 
at that beauty the beauty subdivide will
always<00:01:37.350> try<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.650> find<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> shortest<00:01:38.329> diagonal

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
always try to find the shortest diagonal

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.480 
always try to find the shortest diagonal
so<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> explain<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.400> example<00:01:42.950> here<00:01:43.950> this

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
so to explain this for example here this

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.639 
so to explain this for example here this
would<00:01:44.759> be<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.060> longest<00:01:45.570> diagonal<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.439> this

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
would be the longest diagonal and this

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.139 
would be the longest diagonal and this
would<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> shorter<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> beauty

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
would be the shorter so the beauty

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.109 
would be the shorter so the beauty
subdivide<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:49.579> distinguish<00:01:50.579> between<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
subdivide will distinguish between the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.120 
subdivide will distinguish between the
two<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.540> we'll<00:01:51.960> try<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.229> make<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.649> triangles

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
two and we'll try to make the triangles

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.300 
two and we'll try to make the triangles
as<00:01:53.790> regular<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:54.899> possible<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.590> by<00:01:55.710> regular<00:01:56.189> I

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
as regular as possible and by regular I

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.410 
as regular as possible and by regular I
mean<00:01:56.549> as<00:01:56.759> close<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.869> equal<00:01:58.860> edge<00:01:59.729> lengths<00:02:00.149> as

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
mean as close to equal edge lengths as

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.740 
mean as close to equal edge lengths as
possible<00:02:01.079> which<00:02:01.829> results<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.820> bit<00:02:03.240> more

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
possible which results in a bit more

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.410 
possible which results in a bit more
beautiful<00:02:04.290> mesh<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:05.399> still<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:05.820> triangles

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
beautiful mesh but still it's triangles

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.229 
beautiful mesh but still it's triangles
so<00:02:07.320> anyway<00:02:07.530> that's<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.979> no<00:02:08.580> more<00:02:08.610> settings

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
so anyway that's it no more settings

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.839 
so anyway that's it no more settings
this<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.690> probably<00:02:10.289> mainly<00:02:10.590> for<00:02:11.009> exports<00:02:11.670> or

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
this is probably mainly for exports or

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.089
