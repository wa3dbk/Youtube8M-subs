00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.160 

yeah<00:00:06.930> so<00:00:07.109> it's<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.370> it's<00:00:08.370> called<00:00:08.550> clever<00:00:08.849> boy

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
yeah so it's a it's called clever boy

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
yeah so it's a it's called clever boy
but<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.260> best<00:00:10.380> way<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.559> sort<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.830> see<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.070> is

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
but the best way to sort of see it is

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.509 
but the best way to sort of see it is
it's<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.580> small<00:00:11.730> ocean<00:00:12.179> boy<00:00:12.799> so<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.950> sits<00:00:14.280> off

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
it's a small ocean boy so it sits off

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.060 
it's a small ocean boy so it sits off
the<00:00:15.450> coast<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.870> metropolitan<00:00:16.199> beaches<00:00:16.890> and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
the coast of metropolitan beaches and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.790 
the coast of metropolitan beaches and
for<00:00:17.609> example<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.150> has<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> sonar<00:00:19.260> unit<00:00:19.619> which

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
for example and has a sonar unit which

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.849 
for example and has a sonar unit which
sits<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.279> seabed<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:21.410> unit<00:00:22.410> is

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
sits on the seabed that unit is

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.759 
sits on the seabed that unit is
basically<00:00:23.160> scanning<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.910> detect<00:00:24.300> sharks<00:00:24.810> in

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
basically scanning to detect sharks in

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.000 
basically scanning to detect sharks in
the<00:00:25.980> actual<00:00:26.250> boy<00:00:26.400> itself<00:00:26.789> as<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> cpu<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:28.380> some

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the actual boy itself as a cpu and some

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.290 
the actual boy itself as a cpu and some
software<00:00:29.310> that's<00:00:29.550> designed<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:30.060> kind<00:00:30.179> of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
software that's designed to kind of

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.330 
software that's designed to kind of
process<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.289> data<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.740> make<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> clear

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
process that data and make a clear

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.080 
process that data and make a clear
identification<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> within<00:00:34.140> sort<00:00:34.649> of

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
identification so within sort of

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.610 
identification so within sort of
microseconds<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.510> identify<00:00:36.750> if<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
microseconds it can identify if it's a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
microseconds it can identify if it's a
shark<00:00:37.890> or<00:00:38.070> not<00:00:38.190> then<00:00:38.760> send<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.149> message<00:00:39.420> from

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
shark or not then send a message from

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.690 
shark or not then send a message from
the<00:00:39.750> boy<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> satellite<00:00:40.680> network<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
the boy to the satellite network and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.180 
the boy to the satellite network and
then<00:00:42.270> back<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> lifeguard<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.620> basically<00:00:44.040> do

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
then back to a lifeguard to basically do

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.080 
then back to a lifeguard to basically do
something<00:00:44.489> about<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:45.500> one<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> biggest

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
something about it one of the biggest

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.439 
something about it one of the biggest
problems<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.690> supposed<00:00:49.469> shark<00:00:49.739> detection

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
problems with a supposed shark detection

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.910 
problems with a supposed shark detection
and<00:00:51.449> also<00:00:51.690> alerts<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.320> really<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> sort<00:00:52.890> of

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and also alerts is really the sort of

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.959 
and also alerts is really the sort of
kind<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> management<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.550> whether<00:00:53.789> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
kind of management of whether it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.410 
kind of management of whether it
actually<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.870> shark<00:00:55.969> but<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> whole<00:00:57.210> thing

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
actually is a shark but the whole thing

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.720 
actually is a shark but the whole thing
started<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> brief<00:00:58.800> remotest<00:00:59.370> who<00:00:59.550> are

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
started with a brief remotest who are

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.790 
started with a brief remotest who are
the<00:01:00.210> second<00:01:00.539> largest<00:01:00.629> telco<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.350> Australia

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
the second largest telco in Australia

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.880 
the second largest telco in Australia
and<00:01:02.180> where<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.329> simply<00:01:03.570> wanted<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.989> make<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
and where they simply wanted to make the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.920 
and where they simply wanted to make the
intangible<00:01:05.460> tangible<00:01:05.640> which<00:01:06.299> was<00:01:06.450> sorry

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
intangible tangible which was sorry

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.100 
intangible tangible which was sorry
about<00:01:06.960> their<00:01:07.200> network<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:09.450> whole<00:01:09.630> agency

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
about their network and the whole agency

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.620 
about their network and the whole agency
work<00:01:10.320> together<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:11.270> coming<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.570> think

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
work together on coming up with I think

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.910 
work together on coming up with I think
it<00:01:12.810> was<00:01:12.840> something<00:01:13.020> staggering<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.680> about

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it was something staggering like about

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.100 
it was something staggering like about
80<00:01:14.100> ideas<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:15.990> that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
80 ideas and this is the one that

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.200 
80 ideas and this is the one that
roasted<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.470> surface<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.030> working

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
roasted the surface and then working

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.410 
roasted the surface and then working
with<00:01:18.360> Google<00:01:19.250> we<00:01:20.250> helped<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> client<00:01:21.150> sort<00:01:21.360> of

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
with Google we helped the client sort of

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.770 
with Google we helped the client sort of
see<00:01:21.619> how<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.740> could<00:01:22.920> become<00:01:22.979> possible<00:01:23.780> but

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
see how this could become possible but

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.820 
see how this could become possible but
what's<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.110> interesting<00:01:25.229> about<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.710> was

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
what's really interesting about it was

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.780 
what's really interesting about it was
the<00:01:26.009> fact<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.220> there's<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> lot<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.610> risk

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the fact that there's a lot of risk

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.940 
the fact that there's a lot of risk
involved<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> sense<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.290> had<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
involved in the sense of it was had to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.340 
involved in the sense of it was had to
be<00:01:29.100> proven<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.970> lot<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.630> iteration<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
be proven and a lot of iteration and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.560 
be proven and a lot of iteration and
technical<00:01:31.740> testing<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.729> make<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.000> possible<00:01:33.150> so

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
technical testing to make it possible so

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.410 
technical testing to make it possible so
ops<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.500> basically<00:01:34.920> our<00:01:35.280> other<00:01:35.729> champions<00:01:36.270> of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
ops is basically our other champions of

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.630 
ops is basically our other champions of
the<00:01:36.509> whole<00:01:36.630> thing<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.960> mean<00:01:37.079> if<00:01:37.170> any<00:01:37.320> think<00:01:37.640> it's

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the whole thing I mean if any think it's

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.420 
the whole thing I mean if any think it's
not<00:01:38.820> possible<00:01:38.850> without<00:01:39.770> their<00:01:40.770> support<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
not possible without their support and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.030 
not possible without their support and
getting<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.759> done<00:01:41.970> funding<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> research

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
getting this done funding the research

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.249 
getting this done funding the research
funding<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> prototype<00:01:44.750> but<00:01:45.750> ultimately<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
funding the prototype but ultimately the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.649 
funding the prototype but ultimately the
fact<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.590> what<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.549> does<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.149> shows

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
fact that what this does is it shows

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.300 
fact that what this does is it shows
their<00:01:48.899> network<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.409> completely<00:01:49.799> new<00:01:50.070> light

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
their network in a completely new light

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.899 
their network in a completely new light
so<00:01:51.560> with<00:01:52.560> most<00:01:52.740> telcos<00:01:53.159> all<00:01:53.310> around<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> world

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
so with most telcos all around the world

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.389 
so with most telcos all around the world
there's<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.329> there's<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> battle<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.399> supremacy

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
there's a there's a battle for supremacy

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.179 
there's a there's a battle for supremacy
based<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.299> network<00:01:57.600> coverage<00:01:58.140> or<00:01:58.530> many<00:01:59.009> other

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
based on network coverage or many other

Australians have a safer experience with
the<00:02:12.870> beach

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
the beach

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.110 
the beach
the<00:02:14.380> thing<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.590> have<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.740> note<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.130> 85%

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
the thing you have to note is that 85%

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.820 
the thing you have to note is that 85%
of<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.510> population<00:02:16.630> lives<00:02:17.260> within<00:02:17.320> about<00:02:17.530> 20

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
of the population lives within about 20

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.130 
of the population lives within about 20
minutes<00:02:18.070> of<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.190> beach<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:19.810> very<00:02:20.050> much

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
minutes of the beach so it's very much

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.460 
minutes of the beach so it's very much
part<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.500> people's<00:02:20.740> lives<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:22.470> doing

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
something like this allows really Optus

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.550 
something like this allows really Optus

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
to sort of take a higher ground and play

at the heart of the sonar technology the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
circles really provide an opportunity to

a<00:03:02.680> G+<00:03:02.980> product<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.239> it<00:03:04.330> becomes<00:03:04.600> more<00:03:04.840> utility

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
a G+ product so it becomes more utility

and what we love about that is it could

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.390 
and what we love about that is it could
then<00:03:09.400> send<00:03:10.030> messages<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.600> and<00:03:11.080> and

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
then send messages and and and

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.370 
then send messages and and and

to government to councils and that's
really<00:03:16.180> what<00:03:16.420> excites<00:03:16.510> us<00:03:16.840> about<00:03:17.110> using

little bit too late in the process to

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
really try and make sure that digital is

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.789 
really try and make sure that digital is
at<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.060> heart<00:03:31.239> of<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.450> solution<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.080> so<00:03:32.500> this

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
at the heart of the solution and so this

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.190 
at the heart of the solution and so this
has<00:03:33.010> been<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.430> truly<00:03:34.120> transformational<00:03:34.630> way<00:03:35.080> of

has been a truly transformational way of
