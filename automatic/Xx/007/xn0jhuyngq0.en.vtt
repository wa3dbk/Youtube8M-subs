 Good afternoon, I want to tell you today 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:09.150
 about your sharpener which did the same 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:13.180
 material like plastic bearings mean 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.430
 stainless steel glass textol well and so 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:21.100
 Further, all in order means probatov 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.869
 made by hand that is helping me 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:29.730
 my friend who has a drill 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:32.529
 machine to make grooves means 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.559
 vertical base made of two 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.639
 parts bearings inserted as 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:42.370
 above and below to remove 

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:47.769
 the slightest backlash and ensure easy running 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.769
 turning means the rod itself which 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:53.920
 moves are made of stainless 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:01:00.030
 bar means on doesn't have such clamps 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:02.709
 textolite you stone size is relative 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.250
 guide naturally tested 

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:12.190
 barbell matching at different points 1 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.500
 indicators mean back secure 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.210
 using a groove on the guide and 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.710
 such a 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.080
 locking ring that 's locking 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.360
 the little ring stands in the back similarly 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.800
 but so far I've shot so that you can 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.800
 was extract 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:41.050
 manager means the ball itself is made of 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.720
 materials there is such an artificial 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.950
 stone that is used for 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.950
 worktop manufacturing 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:58.479
 countertop furniture manufacturing 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.890
 mean was been glued together 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.479
 here you can see here how layers can be seen 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.520
 a few piece of pieces was from 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.739
 square glued was drilled 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.229
 hole 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:13.549
 means 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.220
 and glued a long nut and then 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:19.370
 processing was carried out in such a ball 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:25.069
 It turned out good so long as this does not 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:31.930
 handle further these all sorts of things too 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.930

 I want to redo this hinge 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.370
 Of course, what they do not like as 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.890
 textolite works when getting into it 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.239
 moisture starts to stick 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.140
 so I will have to take it off and 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:52.640
 redo that is inside i stand 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.180
 magnets there you can see the grooves making and so 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.459
 then everything is twisted securely below 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:06.170
 rizinochky such that resist 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:07.160
 gliding is very stable well 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:16.459
 what else to tell 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:17.569
