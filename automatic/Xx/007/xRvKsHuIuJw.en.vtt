 all we want to have beautiful long 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.809
 nails unfortunately not at all 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.670
 it turns out to grow them 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.270
 I personally do not like to wear long nails 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.039
 as you see it is just not mine but in 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.640
 I can give you some of this video 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.529
 tips on how to grow long nails if 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.590
 you really want this rule and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.410
 protect next time you will 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.450
 clean something in the kitchen wash the dishes 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.420
 dusting rest assured that 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.969
 you wear rubber gloves because 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.610
 that hard chemicals are contained in 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.219
 various home cleaning products can 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.910
 dry your nails accordingly 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.430
 break them accordingly they will not grow 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.000
 so be sure to wear rubber 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.469
 gloves 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.050
 the same applies to cold weather 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.980
 If it's cold outside to be sure 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.840
 what are you wearing a couple of warm and 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.609
 cute gloves or mittens for 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.449
 protect your nails from 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.090
 overdrying 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.670
 Did you know that nails grow faster in 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.970
 warm second 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.140
 and this is clearly not a secret this use 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.810
 vitamins we all know what vitamins 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.600
 very beneficial to our health but how 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.640
 often and who especially think about it 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.860
 probably only we are those who are obsessed with 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.780
 youtube but repetition is the mother of learning 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.369
 enter your diet to the maximum 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.729
 vitamins a and c as well as zinc calcium and 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.500
 protein is the third for those who are very 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.740
 damaged nails on them you need 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.100
 put vitamin e it sells normally in 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.549
 capsules for this you need a needle or 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.560
 pierce the capsule with a toothpick and apply 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.229
 on the nail and on the cuticle around it 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.170
 girls who are addicted to gel 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.630
 manicure knows that vitamin I recommend 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.250
 in order to restore the nail 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.140
 after manicure 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.939
 but even if you have no nails 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.490
 absolutely no manicure 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.009
 vitamin i will greatly help moisturize your 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.610
 nails and give them back their former strength and 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.950
 beauty 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.560
 Fourth and I apply on nails 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.020
 the fixer itself fixers created and 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.240
 sports 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.650
 and from what our own created 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.910
 nails so when they touch 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.060
 molecules intertwine and more simply 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.670
 when they come together the news has become 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.130
 for stronger but unfortunately it is only 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.380
 temporary solution to the problem as when 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.410
 you stop using fixer 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.440
 your nails go back 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.540
 the fifth and last is a massage it can 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.610
 seem weird how is the nail massage 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.860
 honestly if you try 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.400
 massage the cuticle around your 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.980
 the nail 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.840
 blood will flow to the nail and it can 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.400
 make it really stronger the same 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.090
 what happens to the hair 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.930
 if we put on hair let's say 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.770
 mustard 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.220
 or burdock oil that stimulate 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.110
 blood flow 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.390
 hair grows faster the same with 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.610
 nails if blood flow comes to 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.830
 nails cuticle nails will grow 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.050
 faster also in the water tank you can 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.460
 drop a few drops of jojoba oil 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.620
 olive oil or coconut oil 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.959
 put your fingers in there for a few minutes 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.260
 or even for half an hour how much you donâ€™t 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.250
 too lazy to sit and pull wipe dry 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.380
 a little towel 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.870
 and apply and on the second circle you 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.900
 wonder how fast your nails are 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.850
 cuticle will absorb any of this oil hope 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.550
 this video will help grow long 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.200
 nails or make them healthier a whole 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.950
 shoulders see you soon in 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.950
