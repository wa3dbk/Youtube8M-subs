experimenting with some changes in my
video<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.769> noticed<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.820> my<00:00:14.969> last<00:00:15.509> series<00:00:16.020> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
video I noticed in my last series of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.210 
video I noticed in my last series of
serious<00:00:17.070> decline<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:18.080> quality<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.560> video<00:00:19.680> that

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
serious decline in quality of video that

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.109 
serious decline in quality of video that
I<00:00:20.250> was<00:00:20.580> getting<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.119> YouTube<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:23.119> previous

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
I was getting on YouTube and previous

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.970 
I was getting on YouTube and previous
videos<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.779> had<00:00:24.930> been<00:00:25.109> using<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.560> different

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
videos I had been using a different

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.279 
videos I had been using a different
video<00:00:26.220> codec<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.210> I'm<00:00:27.510> returning<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.260> that

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
video codec and I'm returning to that

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.319 
video codec and I'm returning to that
kodak<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:30.080> to<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.470> i<00:00:31.740> get<00:00:32.640> an<00:00:32.850> increase<00:00:33.300> in

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
kodak to to see if i get an increase in

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.720 
kodak to to see if i get an increase in
my<00:00:33.719> quality<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.320> if<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> codec<00:00:35.520> issue

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
my quality and if this is a codec issue

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.190 
my quality and if this is a codec issue
i<00:00:36.149> am<00:00:37.050> also<00:00:37.260> i'm<00:00:38.160> changing<00:00:39.030> over<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> wide

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
i am also i'm changing over to a wide

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.869 
i am also i'm changing over to a wide
screen<00:00:42.350> looking<00:00:43.350> at<00:00:43.500> youtube<00:00:43.879> video

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
screen looking at youtube video

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.819 
screen looking at youtube video
standards<00:00:45.570> they've<00:00:45.809> changed<00:00:46.079> since<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.800> last

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
standards they've changed since the last

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.490 
standards they've changed since the last
time<00:00:47.219> i<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.969> include<00:00:48.390> widescreen<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
time i like to include widescreen and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.580 
time i like to include widescreen and
higher<00:00:49.649> resolutions<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.820> well<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.110> was<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
higher resolutions that well I was a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.380 
higher resolutions that well I was a
little<00:00:52.890> old<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.129> touch<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.000> didn't

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
little old to touch on and didn't

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.189 
little old to touch on and didn't
actually<00:00:54.539> realize<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:56.059> that<00:00:57.059> YouTube<00:00:57.930> had

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
actually realize that that YouTube had

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.459 
actually realize that that YouTube had
increased<00:00:58.739> its<00:00:58.980> resolution<00:00:59.309> by<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.059> much<00:01:00.469> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
increased its resolution by so much the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.850 
increased its resolution by so much the
last<00:01:01.649> time<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.129> checked<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.609> was<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:03.439> very<00:01:04.439> small

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
last time I checked it was a very small

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.149 
last time I checked it was a very small
VHS<00:01:05.760> level<00:01:06.270> resolution<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> video<00:01:07.740> so

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
VHS level resolution for the video so

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.370 
VHS level resolution for the video so
hopefully<00:01:09.119> these<00:01:09.299> changes<00:01:09.869> will<00:01:10.020> see<00:01:10.260> an

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
hopefully these changes will see an

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.859 
hopefully these changes will see an
increase<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.100> quality<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.640> my<00:01:11.939> video<00:01:12.360> from

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
increase in the quality of my video from

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.130 
increase in the quality of my video from
now<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.240> I'll<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.390> watching<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
now on and I'll be watching and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.010 
now on and I'll be watching and
experimenting<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.400> for<00:01:18.150> my<00:01:18.360> future

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
experimenting with that for my future

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.730 
experimenting with that for my future
videos<00:01:20.360> in<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.570> last<00:01:21.750> video<00:01:21.960> we<00:01:22.409> finish

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
videos in the last video we finish

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.270 
videos in the last video we finish
parenting<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:26.509> rigging<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.110> bodies<00:01:28.920> mesh

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
parenting the rigging to the bodies mesh

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.200 
parenting the rigging to the bodies mesh
and<00:01:29.840> now<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.049> time<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.530> look<00:01:31.680> at<00:01:32.210> parenting

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
and now it's time to look at parenting

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.600 
and now it's time to look at parenting
the<00:01:33.420> rigging<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.560> other<00:01:34.710> parts<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the rigging to the other parts of the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.480 
the rigging to the other parts of the
body<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.750> I'll<00:01:37.049> clear<00:01:37.380> my<00:01:37.700> transformation

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
body so I'll clear my transformation

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.490 
body so I'll clear my transformation
choose<00:01:41.490> my<00:01:41.670> rigging<00:01:42.119> put<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.750> into<00:01:43.049> object

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
choose my rigging put it into object

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.870 
choose my rigging put it into object
mode<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:45.530> pick<00:01:46.530> one<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> other<00:01:47.159> objects

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
mode and pick one of the other objects

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.960 
mode and pick one of the other objects
I'll<00:01:48.060> pick<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.540> first<00:01:48.780> layer<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.820> zoom<00:01:50.820> in

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
I'll pick the first layer and zoom in

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.700 
I'll pick the first layer and zoom in
have<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> look<00:01:51.390> at<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> gap<00:01:54.229> so<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.530> looks

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
have a look at what a gap so it looks

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.399 
have a look at what a gap so it looks
like<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.159> teeth<00:01:56.479> so<00:01:57.479> I'll<00:01:57.719> parent<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> teeth

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
like the teeth so I'll parent the teeth

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.399 
like the teeth so I'll parent the teeth
to<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.740> rigging<00:01:59.240> control<00:02:00.240> p<00:02:00.600> make<00:02:00.990> parent

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
to the rigging control p make parent

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.980 
to the rigging control p make parent
armature<00:02:02.009> create<00:02:02.579> vertex<00:02:03.000> groups<00:02:03.390> from<00:02:03.750> 0<00:02:03.930> to

armature create vertex groups from 0 to
eat<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.850> then<00:02:05.850> take<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:07.849> select<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.030> teeth

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
eat and then take the select the teeth

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.890 
eat and then take the select the teeth
and<00:02:09.569> look<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> vertex<00:02:10.619> groups<00:02:11.629> now

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
and look at the vertex groups now

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.140 
and look at the vertex groups now
on<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.349> teeth<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.860> only<00:02:14.280> really<00:02:14.640> need<00:02:14.879> to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
on the teeth I only really need to

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.470 
on the teeth I only really need to
vertex<00:02:15.599> groups<00:02:16.069> for<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.340> placeholder<00:02:18.120> lip

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
vertex groups for the placeholder lip

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.580 
vertex groups for the placeholder lip
bow<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.579> for<00:02:20.579> the<00:02:20.730> jawbone<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.360> none<00:02:22.319> of<00:02:22.470> the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
bow and for the jawbone and none of the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.949 
bow and for the jawbone and none of the
other<00:02:22.739> vertex<00:02:23.280> groups<00:02:23.700> are<00:02:23.909> very<00:02:24.150> relevant<00:02:24.390> to

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
other vertex groups are very relevant to

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.710 
other vertex groups are very relevant to
the<00:02:25.110> teeth<00:02:25.349> so<00:02:26.099> I<00:02:26.129> can<00:02:26.519> erase<00:02:26.819> those<00:02:27.090> or<00:02:27.360> text

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
the teeth so I can erase those or text

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.199 
the teeth so I can erase those or text
groups<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.709> I'm<00:02:29.069> going<00:02:29.159> to<00:02:29.430> race<00:02:29.640> all<00:02:29.849> of<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
groups so I'm going to race all of the

rest<00:05:10.560> of<00:05:10.680> these<00:05:10.830> body<00:05:11.130> parts<00:05:11.280> and<00:05:11.730> how<00:05:11.820> to<00:05:11.880> do

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
rest of these body parts and how to do

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.000 
rest of these body parts and how to do
those<00:05:12.270> so<00:05:12.810> I'll<00:05:12.870> be<00:05:12.990> back<00:05:13.140> in<00:05:13.169> just<00:05:13.470> a<00:05:13.620> moment

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
those so I'll be back in just a moment

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.150 
those so I'll be back in just a moment
with<00:05:14.130> that<00:05:15.050> with<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.230> little<00:05:16.500> less<00:05:16.680> than<00:05:16.710> five

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
with that with the little less than five

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.550 
with that with the little less than five
minutes<00:05:17.460> left<00:05:17.910> I<00:05:18.300> decided<00:05:18.960> that<00:05:19.110> I<00:05:19.350> would<00:05:19.410> go

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
minutes left I decided that I would go

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.110 
minutes left I decided that I would go
ahead<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.010> simply<00:05:20.940> parent<00:05:21.330> these<00:05:21.510> objects<00:05:22.169> to

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
ahead and simply parent these objects to

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.810 
ahead and simply parent these objects to
the<00:05:24.120> rigging<00:05:24.389> and<00:05:24.780> just<00:05:25.410> describe<00:05:25.979> what<00:05:26.639> I've

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
the rigging and just describe what I've

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.540 
the rigging and just describe what I've
done<00:05:27.090> so<00:05:27.840> I<00:05:28.080> parented<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.919> tongue<00:05:29.190> to<00:05:29.520> the

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
done so I parented the tongue to the

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.870 
done so I parented the tongue to the
rigging<00:05:30.440> selected<00:05:31.440> it<00:05:31.620> and<00:05:31.770> deleted<00:05:32.460> all<00:05:32.850> of

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
rigging selected it and deleted all of

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.950 
rigging selected it and deleted all of
the<00:05:33.180> vertex<00:05:33.600> groups<00:05:34.050> except<00:05:34.650> for<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.010> jaw<00:05:35.310> and

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
the vertex groups except for the jaw and

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.409 
the vertex groups except for the jaw and
the<00:05:36.960> neck<00:05:37.200> and<00:05:37.500> I<00:05:38.370> choose<00:05:38.580> the<00:05:38.760> jaw<00:05:39.000> in<00:05:39.270> the

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
the neck and I choose the jaw in the

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.730 
the neck and I choose the jaw in the
neck<00:05:39.660> so<00:05:40.140> that<00:05:40.169> when<00:05:40.440> I<00:05:40.470> rotate<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.940> jaw<00:05:42.240> I<00:05:42.740> get

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
neck so that when I rotate the jaw I get

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.969 
neck so that when I rotate the jaw I get
a<00:05:43.890> motion<00:05:44.130> out<00:05:44.460> of<00:05:44.520> the<00:05:44.850> tongue<00:05:45.169> as<00:05:46.169> well<00:05:46.470> I<00:05:46.680> get

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
a motion out of the tongue as well I get

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.310 
a motion out of the tongue as well I get
a<00:05:47.010> deformation<00:05:47.550> because<00:05:48.390> the<00:05:48.810> neck<00:05:49.050> is

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
a deformation because the neck is

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.610 
a deformation because the neck is
holding<00:05:49.919> a<00:05:50.160> weight<00:05:50.870> across<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:52.229> tongue<00:05:52.440> as

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
holding a weight across the tongue as

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.310 
holding a weight across the tongue as
well<00:05:52.860> and<00:05:53.160> that<00:05:54.060> keeps<00:05:54.300> the<00:05:54.479> tongue<00:05:54.690> moving<00:05:54.990> in

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
well and that keeps the tongue moving in

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.870 
well and that keeps the tongue moving in
conjunction<00:05:55.860> with<00:05:56.039> the<00:05:56.340> mouth<00:05:56.520> properly

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
conjunction with the mouth properly

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.719 
conjunction with the mouth properly
gives<00:05:57.600> it<00:05:57.720> a<00:05:57.840> property<00:05:58.380> formation<00:05:59.070> inside<00:05:59.520> the

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
gives it a property formation inside the

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.450 
gives it a property formation inside the
mouth<00:05:59.910> and<00:06:00.470> below<00:06:01.470> that's<00:06:01.710> not<00:06:01.950> too<00:06:02.160> visible

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
mouth and below that's not too visible

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.300 
mouth and below that's not too visible
it<00:06:03.090> does<00:06:03.330> come<00:06:03.600> into<00:06:03.870> play<00:06:04.110> and<00:06:04.740> in<00:06:04.890> different

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
it does come into play and in different

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:12.740 
it does come into play and in different
poses<00:06:05.490> with<00:06:05.970> the<00:06:06.090> model<00:06:06.479> and<00:06:11.360> then<00:06:12.360> there's

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
poses with the model and then there's

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.159

the ice in the eyes they should be
pretty<00:06:16.350> obvious<00:06:16.500> I<00:06:17.130> deleted<00:06:17.520> all<00:06:17.760> of<00:06:17.820> the

relevant<00:07:44.770> around<00:07:45.220> the<00:07:45.400> neck<00:07:45.670> and<00:07:45.940> in<00:07:46.930> the<00:07:47.080> ears

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.290 
relevant around the neck and in the ears

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:52.410 
relevant around the neck and in the ears
as<00:07:47.650> well<00:07:47.890> when<00:07:48.130> I<00:07:48.250> rotate<00:07:48.670> the<00:07:48.940> jaw<00:07:51.210> in<00:07:52.210> the

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:52.420 
as well when I rotate the jaw in the

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.150 
as well when I rotate the jaw in the
next<00:07:52.720> video<00:07:52.990> I'm<00:07:53.320> going<00:07:53.470> to<00:07:53.560> further<00:07:53.770> talk

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.160 
next video I'm going to further talk

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.790 
next video I'm going to further talk
about<00:07:54.490> these<00:07:54.730> placeholder<00:07:55.720> bones<00:07:55.990> and<00:07:56.380> show

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 
about these placeholder bones and show

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.010 
about these placeholder bones and show
some<00:07:57.040> of<00:07:57.190> the<00:07:57.220> weight<00:07:57.460> values<00:07:58.030> that<00:07:58.630> they

00:07:59.010 --> 00:07:59.020 
some of the weight values that they

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.030 
some of the weight values that they
helped<00:07:59.260> to<00:07:59.970> assign<00:08:00.970> when<00:08:01.710> assigning<00:08:02.710> the

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:03.040 
helped to assign when assigning the

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.390 
helped to assign when assigning the
vertex<00:08:03.520> groups<00:08:03.880> to<00:08:04.270> the<00:08:04.480> model<00:08:04.870> so<00:08:05.830> i<00:08:06.040> will<00:08:06.280> be

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 
vertex groups to the model so i will be

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.450 
vertex groups to the model so i will be
in<00:08:06.490> the<00:08:06.580> next<00:08:06.760> video<00:08:07.180> and<00:08:07.620> until<00:08:08.620> then<00:08:09.100> happy

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:09.460 
in the next video and until then happy

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.970 
in the next video and until then happy
modelling
