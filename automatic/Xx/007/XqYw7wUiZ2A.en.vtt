00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
television using an open bridge quite a

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.630 
television using an open bridge quite a
bit<00:00:40.390> but<00:00:41.320> everybody<00:00:41.710> likes<00:00:41.980> to<00:00:42.100> get<00:00:42.309> to<00:00:42.489> the

bit but everybody likes to get to the

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.820 
bit but everybody likes to get to the
closed<00:00:43.600> bridge<00:00:43.870> I<00:00:43.930> guess<00:00:44.379> it's<00:00:44.559> a<00:00:44.650> more

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830

forefinger and meet the thumb right on
the<00:01:12.610> knuckle<00:01:13.030> it<00:01:13.780> could<00:01:13.960> be<00:01:14.080> slightly

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
the knuckle it could be slightly

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:15.330 
the knuckle it could be slightly
different<00:01:14.560> depending<00:01:14.920> upon<00:01:15.009> your<00:01:15.190> lathe

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
different depending upon your lathe

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.160 
different depending upon your lathe
length<00:01:15.729> of<00:01:15.880> your<00:01:16.000> fingers<00:01:16.330> and<00:01:16.479> so<00:01:16.600> on<00:01:16.720> but

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
length of your fingers and so on but

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.810 
length of your fingers and so on but
basically<00:01:17.680> looks<00:01:17.890> like<00:01:17.979> this<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.520> again<00:01:18.700> you

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
basically looks like this and again you

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.140 
basically looks like this and again you
have<00:01:18.910> a<00:01:18.970> tripod<00:01:19.240> one<00:01:20.140> two<00:01:21.009> three

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
have a tripod one two three

have a tripod one two three
that's<00:01:22.299> your<00:01:22.540> tripod<00:01:22.780> that<00:01:23.620> gives<00:01:23.830> you<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:23.950> lot

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
that's your tripod that gives you a lot

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.250 
that's your tripod that gives you a lot
of<00:01:24.220> strength<00:01:24.580> down<00:01:24.850> there<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.270> once<00:01:25.720> again<00:01:25.900> if

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
of strength down there and once again if

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.320 
of strength down there and once again if
it's<00:01:26.470> done<00:01:26.650> properly<00:01:26.680> you<00:01:27.400> should<00:01:27.970> not<00:01:28.150> be

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
it's done properly you should not be

have to build these bridges yourself

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.490 
have to build these bridges yourself
sometimes<00:02:18.610> using<00:02:18.910> your<00:02:19.030> imagination<00:02:19.750> when

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
sometimes using your imagination when

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.210 
sometimes using your imagination when
you're<00:02:20.650> shooting<00:02:20.890> off<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.489> rail<00:02:23.190> like<00:02:24.190> this

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
you're shooting off the rail like this

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.280 
you're shooting off the rail like this
if<00:02:24.790> you're<00:02:25.060> shooting<00:02:25.330> directly<00:02:25.569> off<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.110> rail

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
if you're shooting directly off the rail

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.479 
if you're shooting directly off the rail
you<00:02:27.250> might<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.700> get<00:02:27.819> back<00:02:28.030> like<00:02:28.270> this

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
you might have to get back like this

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.250 
you might have to get back like this
if<00:02:30.819> you're<00:02:31.329> shooting<00:02:31.480> from<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.930> little<00:02:32.140> bit

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
if you're shooting from a little bit

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.080 
if you're shooting from a little bit
further<00:02:32.590> where<00:02:33.099> it's<00:02:33.219> not<00:02:33.310> quite<00:02:33.519> as<00:02:33.730> much<00:02:33.909> on

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
further where it's not quite as much on

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.839 
further where it's not quite as much on
the<00:02:34.209> rail<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:35.680> is<00:02:35.920> better<00:02:36.129> this<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.519> not<00:02:36.700> as

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
the rail this is better this is not as

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.330 
the rail this is better this is not as
good<00:02:36.939> because<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.540> covers<00:02:37.900> your<00:02:38.799> cover<00:02:39.069> in<00:02:39.219> the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
good because it covers your cover in the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.300 
good because it covers your cover in the
shaft<00:02:39.579> this<00:02:40.540> is<00:02:40.780> better<00:02:41.019> don't<00:02:41.739> ever<00:02:41.980> put<00:02:42.280> your

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
shaft this is better don't ever put your

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.059 
shaft this is better don't ever put your
bridge<00:02:42.609> like<00:02:42.879> this<00:02:43.469> one<00:02:44.469> of<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.650> basic

bridge like this one of the basic

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.849 
bridge like this one of the basic
fundamentals<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.879> playing<00:02:46.420> good<00:02:46.689> pool<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.560> to

fundamentals of playing good pool is to
shoot<00:02:48.129> with<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.790> level<00:02:49.180> cue<00:02:51.810> when<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.840> set<00:02:53.170> up<00:02:53.200> to

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
shoot with a level cue when I set up to

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.059 
shoot with a level cue when I set up to
the<00:02:53.560> ball<00:02:53.739> if<00:02:54.579> I'm<00:02:54.819> right-handed<00:02:55.620> if<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.829> let<00:02:57.040> go

with my right hand the cue should be

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.819

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
resting right on the rail you should

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.190 
resting right on the rail you should
never<00:03:03.010> be<00:03:03.340> up<00:03:03.609> like<00:03:03.909> this<00:03:04.209> unless<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.870> have<00:03:04.900> no
