friends and finally came across this new

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.089 
friends and finally came across this new
technique<00:00:12.960> just<00:00:13.230> by<00:00:13.320> missing<00:00:13.650> around<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.950> bit

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
technique just by missing around a bit

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.950 
technique just by missing around a bit
and<00:00:14.130> seeing<00:00:14.519> what<00:00:14.639> worked<00:00:14.849> now<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.480> don't<00:00:15.750> know

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
and seeing what worked now I don't know

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.150 
and seeing what worked now I don't know
if<00:00:15.990> someone<00:00:16.320> has<00:00:16.410> come<00:00:16.529> up<00:00:16.680> with<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:16.920> trap

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
if someone has come up with this trap

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.470 
if someone has come up with this trap
before<00:00:17.340> but<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.789> haven't<00:00:18.000> seen<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.390> anywhere

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
before but I haven't seen it anywhere

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.090 
before but I haven't seen it anywhere
and<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.900> thought<00:00:19.109> people<00:00:19.260> may<00:00:19.560> want<00:00:19.710> some<00:00:19.949> help

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
and I thought people may want some help

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.529 
and I thought people may want some help
progressing<00:00:20.580> through<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.789> rounds<00:00:21.150> when

playing with three or more people is

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.870 
playing with three or more people is
that<00:00:22.920> seems<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.310> be<00:00:23.340> harder<00:00:23.670> than<00:00:23.699> when

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
that seems to be harder than when

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.029 
that seems to be harder than when
playing<00:00:24.090> solo<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:25.289> gameplay<00:00:25.470> happen<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.920> be

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
go for the power immediately instead I

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.830 
go for the power immediately instead I
like<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.699> clear<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> way<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.329> second<00:01:00.690> ship

and<00:01:00.989> by<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.109> mp40<00:01:01.710> off<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> wall<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.730> has

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
and by the mp40 off the wall this has

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.310 
and by the mp40 off the wall this has
been<00:01:02.969> my<00:01:03.120> favorite<00:01:03.420> gun<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.660> zombie<00:01:03.960> maps<00:01:04.199> that

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
been my favorite gun in zombie maps that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.539 
been my favorite gun in zombie maps that
offer<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.769> because<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.159> offers<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
offer it because it offers you a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.100 
offer it because it offers you a
decent-sized<00:01:06.090> clipping<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.570> very<00:01:06.780> easy<00:01:06.960> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
decent-sized clipping is very easy to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.990 
decent-sized clipping is very easy to
get<00:01:07.260> headshots<00:01:07.470> my<00:01:08.340> suggestion<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.939> to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
get headshots my suggestion is to

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.580 
get headshots my suggestion is to
conserve<00:01:09.390> your<00:01:09.540> ammo<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:09.990> much<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.409> can

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
conserve your ammo as much as you can

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.810 
conserve your ammo as much as you can
just<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.950> case<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.250> don't<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> time<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
just in case you don't have the time to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.280 
just in case you don't have the time to
buy<00:01:12.090> more<00:01:12.270> ammo<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.720> you're<00:01:12.810> stuck<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.170> no

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
buy more ammo and you're stuck in a no

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.530 
buy more ammo and you're stuck in a no

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
mess around in this last clip one of

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.500 
mess around in this last clip one of
them<00:05:32.190> actually<00:05:32.370> fell<00:05:32.699> asleep<00:05:33.000> at<00:05:33.120> his<00:05:33.210> chair

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
them actually fell asleep at his chair

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.300 
them actually fell asleep at his chair
then<00:05:33.930> two<00:05:34.199> more<00:05:34.380> were<00:05:34.560> down<00:05:34.770> then<00:05:34.979> I<00:05:35.070> was<00:05:35.220> the

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
then two more were down then I was the

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.920 
then two more were down then I was the
last<00:05:35.430> one<00:05:35.580> standing<00:05:35.729> and<00:05:36.270> decided<00:05:36.630> to<00:05:36.690> go<00:05:36.810> out

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
last one standing and decided to go out

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.689 
last one standing and decided to go out
shooting<00:05:37.139> my<00:05:37.830> ranking<00:05:38.190> right<00:05:38.340> now<00:05:38.490> in<00:05:38.610> the

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
shooting my ranking right now in the

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.400 
shooting my ranking right now in the
world<00:05:38.880> leader<00:05:39.090> boards<00:05:39.419> is<00:05:39.539> top<00:05:39.750> ten<00:05:39.960> thousand

world leader boards is top ten thousand

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.900 
world leader boards is top ten thousand
