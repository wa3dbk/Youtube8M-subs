00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hi guys, you're going to make the two cheeses. 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.370
 We made it there in the program. 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.319
 food lock the battle 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.820
 a lot of people asked us then we solved 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.550
 of revenue 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.920
 To start with, we need to get some bacon. 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.949
 party in cubs and then we 'll go 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.949
 fry in skillet until very well 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.640
 crunchy order to stay very crispy 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.640
 same 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.560
 and while it's getting here, I'm going 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.450
 explain to you what are the two 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.650
 sandwiches we made there 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:36.800
 the first one was a crisp bacon 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.660
 with gruyÃ©re cheese and tomato jelly 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.540
 Do you want to learn the jelly recipe? 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.360
 tomato just click here it's there 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.300
 on the channel and we'll teach you the blog 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.720
 It was what to say and there is no other recipe 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.239
 it was a recipe for a working cream 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.979
 of bacon and gorgonzola 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.559
 it is actually a gorgonzola cream and 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.629
 merged to see him there we did 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.059
 with mushroom paris today we will use 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.680
 and the shitake and that's what we will 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.190
 need to do with it 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:11.409
 is to take a board and part it in 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.409
 strips and then fry 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.330
 now I'm going to take our bacon here from 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.960
 frying pan and then I'll put him a 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.690
 with quite a lot of same paper towel 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.130
 to be crisp 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.290
 I 'll seize it later. 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.490
 bacon fat to fry mushroom 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.490
 what are we going to wear here? 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.590
 now as we fire melo I wilt 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.960
 I'll get the brie cheese and we'll 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.360
 found and grated 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.969
 It's good to get grated because then he 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.670
 melts faster and gets tastier 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.670
 no sandwich stain 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.400
 sancha 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.370
 ed 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.980
 Now we're going to take the mushroom out and it's 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.870
 this mushroom goes on the second sandwich 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.720
 which is the one with cream impurited from 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.790

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.570
