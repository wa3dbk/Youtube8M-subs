00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.510
 we will 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.750
 you will be on the snow with 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:12.559
 bone from professor nicolas 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:16.070
 i see we have some water powder 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.380
 and dyes in the form of tablets that us 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.820
 would need much shaken special 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.050
 powder is a jump called 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.250
 sodium polyacrylate 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.890
 had an amazing property 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.000
 will absorb themselves and turn it into 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.820
 artificial snow 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.439
 let's do an experiment listening 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.689
 before we start make me one 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.220
 the question is this artificial snow 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.440
 which we now do it 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.940
 theoretically can use become 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.769
 biathlon trance yes definitely 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.960
 since he is in his form he is also 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.440
 contains water it is 95 percent composed 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.609
 out of the water yes of course because our 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.379
 did not run at all at the last championship 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.449
 peace may your snow help them 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.629
 let's see the dollar we are experimenting well 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.019
 Well, I add a small amount 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.079
 powder 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.850
 our bowl even a little more so far on 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.339
 a whole big snowdrift doesn't look like the truth 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.070
 in general, and the bottom is not at all like 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.070
 so 1 glass of water and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.520
 try of course try it worth on 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.690
 the forest is right over here can you 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.640
 it will be better to pour a little water 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.680
 better than you are not galleon nothing 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.120
 afraid that now it's time 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.970
 to conduct an experiment 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.910
 takes a glass and at my command we pour out 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:41.530
 water inside low jump 12 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:45.100
 carefully pour out pour out like this 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.650
 yes it is more likely to write something in flight 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.300
 then of course why is he inside here 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.100
 it can be decomposed by tormenting such 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.770
 burning yes the water was very hot and 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.840
 so nikita ice on the auger he then 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.270
 cool after a while and you can 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.340
 will use it like a regular snow 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.020
 Friends of what the Russian national team lacked 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.479
 poncho world biathlon championships 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.700
 lahti be such snow we would all medals 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.100
 collected exactly and in order to surprise 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.430
 friends can make snow colored 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.190
 colored snow is he so what does well for 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.760
 she began to ask for help too 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.769
 take together add each of 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.380
 cups of two spoons of powder 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:29.430
 time with you on a healthy so put 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.769
 a glass of vodka with powder on our tray 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.650
 I suggest to finish the experiment together 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.370
 Ilya send sports talk 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.420

 I'm right now and make two other glasses 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.400
 the blame 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.400

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.819
 2 also super water now water tint 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.580
 using tablets 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.250
