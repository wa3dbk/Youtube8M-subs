we're gonna start from the crown or

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.529 
we're gonna start from the crown or
governing<00:00:25.529> vessel<00:00:25.560> 20<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:27.180> then<00:00:27.300> we're<00:00:27.420> just

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
governing vessel 20 and then we're just

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.480 
governing vessel 20 and then we're just
all<00:00:27.779> we're<00:00:27.960> doing<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.349> balancing<00:00:28.619> cheat<00:00:29.279> in

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
all we're doing is balancing cheat in

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.830 
all we're doing is balancing cheat in
tech<00:00:29.730> point<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.150> I'm<00:00:30.210> just<00:00:30.359> gonna<00:00:30.510> go<00:00:30.720> over

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
tech point so I'm just gonna go over

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.720 
tech point so I'm just gonna go over
this<00:00:30.990> really<00:00:31.289> briefly<00:00:31.619> because<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.160> this

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
this really briefly because this is this

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.790 
this really briefly because this is this

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
is fairly common knowledge I think about

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.650 
is fairly common knowledge I think about
now<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.250> should<00:00:35.399> be<00:00:35.520> anyway

of these for about a minute we go down
to<00:02:24.030> large<00:02:25.030> intestine<00:02:25.660> 14<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:27.400> that's<00:02:28.180> going

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
to large intestine 14 and that's going

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.370 
to large intestine 14 and that's going
to<00:02:28.510> be<00:02:28.630> generally<00:02:29.260> where<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:31.330> sleeve<00:02:31.660> crease

seventh star but you do I don't know why

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.379 
seventh star but you do I don't know why
seven<00:03:42.400> eight<00:03:42.609> star<00:03:42.879> because<00:03:43.150> it's<00:03:43.269> really

seven eight star because it's really
nice<00:03:43.689> art<00:03:44.019> if<00:03:44.409> you<00:03:44.500> do<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.739> nine<00:03:44.919> star<00:03:45.280> balance

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
nice art if you do the nine star balance

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.080 
nice art if you do the nine star balance
you<00:03:45.760> do<00:03:45.909> both<00:03:47.189> you<00:03:48.189> do<00:03:48.310> both<00:03:48.459> kidney<00:03:48.849> once

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090

after that so if you have a client who's

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.399 
after that so if you have a client who's
laying<00:03:51.489> on<00:03:51.609> the<00:03:51.700> table<00:03:51.879> you<00:03:52.659> can<00:03:52.840> do<00:03:53.019> all<00:03:53.230> these

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
laying on the table you can do all these

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.610 
laying on the table you can do all these
points<00:03:53.620> -<00:03:54.159> the<00:03:54.810> 1230<00:03:55.810> so<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.079> have<00:03:56.349> to<00:03:56.469> flip

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
points - the 1230 so you have to flip

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.349 
points - the 1230 so you have to flip
over<00:03:56.799> for<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.219> unless<00:03:57.879> there's<00:03:58.090> light<00:03:58.209> on

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
over for that unless there's light on

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.300

down then you can get them off
yeah<00:04:02.829> that's<00:04:03.040> you're<00:04:03.189> laying<00:04:03.370> there<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:03.519> again

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
I'll show you the the Hubble balancing

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.309 
I'll show you the the Hubble balancing
thing<00:04:06.750> so<00:04:07.750> there<00:04:07.840> we<00:04:07.900> go

is<00:06:29.089> called<00:06:29.389> balancing<00:06:29.959> creation<00:06:30.739> and<00:06:31.099> it

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:31.519 
is called balancing creation and it

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:33.399 
is called balancing creation and it
bounces<00:06:31.939> the<00:06:32.089> governing<00:06:32.509> and<00:06:32.809> the<00:06:32.929> conceptual

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.409 
bounces the governing and the conceptual

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:35.529 
bounces the governing and the conceptual
tussle<00:06:33.919> meridian<00:06:34.369> what<00:06:35.059> we're<00:06:35.179> going<00:06:35.329> to<00:06:35.360> do

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:35.539 
tussle meridian what we're going to do

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:38.169 
tussle meridian what we're going to do
is<00:06:35.989> remember<00:06:36.259> to<00:06:36.409> double<00:06:36.619> Rams<00:06:37.009> head<00:06:37.309> and

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:38.179 
is remember to double Rams head and

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:39.249 
is remember to double Rams head and
we're<00:06:38.269> going<00:06:38.389> to<00:06:38.449> take<00:06:38.599> the<00:06:38.809> middle<00:06:38.989> finger

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
we're going to take the middle finger

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.859 
we're going to take the middle finger
stick<00:06:39.919> it<00:06:40.039> out<00:06:40.219> and<00:06:41.059> we're<00:06:41.179> going<00:06:41.299> to<00:06:41.329> take<00:06:41.569> one

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:41.869 
stick it out and we're going to take one

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:44.049 
stick it out and we're going to take one
and<00:06:42.139> put<00:06:42.379> it<00:06:42.529> on<00:06:42.679> the<00:06:42.799> crown<00:06:43.099> that<00:06:43.699> governing

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:44.059 
and put it on the crown that governing

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:48.100 
and put it on the crown that governing
vessel<00:06:44.089> 20<00:06:44.719> and<00:06:45.289> find<00:06:45.619> the<00:06:46.309> coccyx<00:06:46.849> bone<00:06:47.110> right

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
vessel 20 and find the coccyx bone right

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.549 
vessel 20 and find the coccyx bone right
there

00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:48.559 
there

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:50.649 
there
and<00:06:48.739> so<00:06:49.099> the<00:06:49.610> coccyx<00:06:49.999> bone<00:06:50.029> we're<00:06:50.329> going<00:06:50.449> to<00:06:50.509> go

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:50.659 
and so the coccyx bone we're going to go

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:55.899 
and so the coccyx bone we're going to go
down<00:06:50.839> to<00:06:53.229> we<00:06:54.229> can<00:06:54.379> use<00:06:54.529> governing<00:06:55.009> vessel<00:06:55.039> 1<00:06:55.639> we

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:55.909 
down to we can use governing vessel 1 we

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:56.949 
down to we can use governing vessel 1 we
just<00:06:55.939> want<00:06:56.239> to<00:06:56.300> balance<00:06:56.419> the<00:06:56.599> governing

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:56.959 
just want to balance the governing

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:59.139 
just want to balance the governing
vessel<00:06:56.989> meridian<00:06:57.649> but<00:06:58.249> it<00:06:58.669> will<00:06:58.909> touch

00:06:59.139 --> 00:06:59.149 
vessel meridian but it will touch

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:01.419 
vessel meridian but it will touch
conceptional<00:06:59.959> vessel<00:07:00.289> meridian<00:07:00.709> one<00:07:00.919> we'll

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:01.429 
conceptional vessel meridian one we'll

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:05.409 
conceptional vessel meridian one we'll
get<00:07:01.550> both<00:07:02.769> channels<00:07:03.769> at<00:07:04.099> one<00:07:04.279> shot<00:07:04.519> and<00:07:05.149> so

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:05.419 
get both channels at one shot and so

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:07.989 
get both channels at one shot and so
we're<00:07:05.899> going<00:07:06.019> to<00:07:06.079> do<00:07:06.669> conceptional<00:07:07.669> vessel

00:07:07.989 --> 00:07:07.999 
we're going to do conceptional vessel

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:10.209 
we're going to do conceptional vessel
one<00:07:08.209> which<00:07:09.050> is<00:07:09.199> just<00:07:09.439> on<00:07:09.589> the<00:07:09.619> other<00:07:09.860> side<00:07:09.979> of

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:10.219 
one which is just on the other side of

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:12.969 
one which is just on the other side of
the<00:07:10.429> anus<00:07:10.759> between<00:07:11.179> the<00:07:11.959> between<00:07:12.709> the

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:12.979 
the anus between the between the

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:14.859 
the anus between the between the
genitals<00:07:13.429> and<00:07:13.610> anus<00:07:13.939> so<00:07:14.389> we're<00:07:14.539> just<00:07:14.569> going<00:07:14.779> to

00:07:14.859 --> 00:07:14.869 
genitals and anus so we're just going to

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:18.159 
genitals and anus so we're just going to
hold<00:07:15.049> it<00:07:15.289> balanced<00:07:16.509> with<00:07:17.509> just<00:07:17.719> both<00:07:17.899> middle

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:18.169 
hold it balanced with just both middle

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:21.759 
hold it balanced with just both middle
fingers<00:07:18.589> do<00:07:19.279> this<00:07:19.489> for<00:07:19.869> about<00:07:20.869> 10<00:07:21.469> to<00:07:21.619> 15

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:21.769 
fingers do this for about 10 to 15

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:24.399 
fingers do this for about 10 to 15
minutes<00:07:22.369> and<00:07:22.999> this<00:07:23.539> will<00:07:23.689> help<00:07:23.809> balance<00:07:24.259> out

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:24.409 
minutes and this will help balance out

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:27.729 
minutes and this will help balance out
the<00:07:24.789> conceptual<00:07:25.789> vessel<00:07:26.209> and<00:07:26.739> governing

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:27.739 
the conceptual vessel and governing

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:30.579 
the conceptual vessel and governing
meridians<00:07:28.869> that's<00:07:29.869> called<00:07:30.079> balancing

00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:30.589 
meridians that's called balancing

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:34.089 
meridians that's called balancing
creation<00:07:31.569> very<00:07:32.569> simple<00:07:32.959> technique<00:07:33.349> very<00:07:33.769> easy
