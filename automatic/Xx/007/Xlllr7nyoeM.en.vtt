00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
put all my little bars back on here and

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.060 
put all my little bars back on here and
I<00:00:48.840> wore<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> pair<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.379> gloves<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:49.860> I'm

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
I wore a pair of gloves because I'm

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.760 
I wore a pair of gloves because I'm
getting<00:00:50.340> tired<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.820> smelling<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.329> gasoline

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
getting tired of smelling like gasoline

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.520 
getting tired of smelling like gasoline
at<00:00:52.770> my<00:00:52.980> choke<00:00:53.250> set<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:54.739> have<00:00:55.739> my<00:00:56.989> my<00:00:57.989> gap<00:00:58.289> is

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
at my choke set I have my my gap is

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.920 
at my choke set I have my my gap is
correct<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.160> between<00:00:59.670> here<00:01:00.600> which<00:01:00.750> is

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
correct I think between here which is

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.569 
correct I think between here which is
three<00:01:01.199> millimeters<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.890> actually<00:01:02.280> looks<00:01:02.489> a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
three millimeters it actually looks a

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.380 
three millimeters it actually looks a
little<00:01:02.699> bit<00:01:02.969> more<00:01:03.270> than<00:01:04.080> three<00:01:04.379> millimeters

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
little bit more than three millimeters

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.620 
little bit more than three millimeters
but<00:01:07.310> I'm<00:01:08.310> good<00:01:08.610> I'm<00:01:08.820> good<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.210> long<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.540> it

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
but I'm good I'm good as long as it

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.270 
but I'm good I'm good as long as it
starts<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:10.110> well<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.619> adjust<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.040> later

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
starts up well we can adjust that later

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.270 
starts up well we can adjust that later
on<00:01:11.540> so<00:01:12.540> let's<00:01:12.750> see<00:01:12.900> what<00:01:13.049> happens<00:01:13.439> here<00:01:16.070> it<00:01:17.070> has

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
on so let's see what happens here it has

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.460 
on so let's see what happens here it has
not<00:01:17.549> been<00:01:17.759> running<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.390> doesn't<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:19.200> any

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
not been running it doesn't have any

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.149 
not been running it doesn't have any
missing<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.600> we'll<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:22.799> ahead<00:01:22.830> and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
missing at all so we'll go ahead and

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.340 
missing at all so we'll go ahead and
turn<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:26.360> if<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.630> hold<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
turn it on and if I can hold this and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:39.480 
turn it on and if I can hold this and
pull<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.890> time<00:01:29.520> go<00:01:29.880> we'll<00:01:30.210> see

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.770 

so<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.730> question<00:01:41.150> of<00:01:41.240> the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.020 

it<00:01:45.290> was<00:01:45.440> just<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:45.799> question<00:01:45.979> of<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.430> plug<00:01:46.640> jet

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
it was just a question of the plug jet

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.539 
it was just a question of the plug jet
and<00:01:47.810> all<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.170> shellac<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:48.920> was<00:01:49.070> stuck<00:01:49.369> in

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
and all the shellac that was stuck in

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.410

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.810 

my<00:01:53.810> gosh<00:01:54.110> it's<00:01:54.350> extremely<00:01:54.980> illiteracy<00:01:55.460> with

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
my gosh it's extremely illiteracy with

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.760 
my gosh it's extremely illiteracy with
pumping<00:01:56.180> out<00:01:56.300> in

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.090 

religious<00:02:04.549> idea

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.630 

while<00:02:08.190> pursuing<00:02:08.520> get<00:02:09.090> anything<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.660> work<00:02:10.640> you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
while pursuing get anything to work you

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.130 
while pursuing get anything to work you
can<00:02:11.760> get<00:02:11.880> something<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.360> plug<00:02:12.600> in<00:02:12.810> there<00:02:13.020> and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140
