new<00:01:10.110> person<00:01:10.380> made<00:01:10.530> three<00:01:10.799> o'clock<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.250> at<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
new person made three o'clock is at a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.429 
new person made three o'clock is at a
reasonable<00:01:12.299> speed<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.689> works<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.080> most<00:01:13.260> of

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
reasonable speed that works with most of

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.219 
reasonable speed that works with most of
the<00:01:13.590> guns<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:14.100> black<00:01:14.640> ops<00:01:14.820> 2<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the guns on black ops 2 so it's just a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.690 
the guns on black ops 2 so it's just a
nice<00:01:16.380> base<00:01:16.650> speed<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.310> don't<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.580> to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
nice base speed so that we don't have to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.539 
nice base speed so that we don't have to
worry<00:01:17.880> about<00:01:18.380> adjusting<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.950> while<00:01:20.130> I'm<00:01:20.280> doing

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
worry about adjusting it while I'm doing

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.830 
worry about adjusting it while I'm doing
this<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:21.270> concentrate<00:01:21.479> on

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
this so I can just concentrate on

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.320 
this so I can just concentrate on
showing<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.470> features<00:01:22.790> ok<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:23.850> just

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
select we got probably English okay so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.350 
select we got probably English okay so
