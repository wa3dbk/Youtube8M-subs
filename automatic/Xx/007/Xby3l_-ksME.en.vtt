choose how many shurikens you've got
which<00:00:24.270> is<00:00:24.390> actually<00:00:24.570> very<00:00:24.720> important<00:00:25.440> you<00:00:25.830> can

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.999 
so for example you can put it on hardest
with<00:00:30.060> like<00:00:30.660> zero<00:00:31.170> shurikens<00:00:31.500> which<00:00:31.859> is

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.920 
with like zero shurikens which is
obviously<00:00:32.250> gonna<00:00:32.369> be<00:00:32.489> evil<00:00:32.850> or<00:00:33.090> easiest<00:00:33.690> with

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
obviously gonna be evil or easiest with

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.900 
obviously gonna be evil or easiest with
Nike<00:00:34.289> which<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.859> to<00:00:34.920> be<00:00:34.980> stupidly<00:00:35.820> easy

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
Nike which is going to be stupidly easy

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.180 
Nike which is going to be stupidly easy

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.930 
you can do a sound test you can also
trigger<00:00:38.610> controls<00:00:39.410> but<00:00:40.410> obviously<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.820> main

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
trigger controls but obviously the main

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.610 
trigger controls but obviously the main

soon<00:01:03.420> enough<00:01:03.660> because<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.989> personally<00:01:04.350> think

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
soon enough because I personally think

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440 
soon enough because I personally think
the<00:01:04.530> fire<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.949> best<00:01:05.219> one<00:01:05.430> now<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.149> always

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the fire was the best one now I always

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.359 
the fire was the best one now I always
thought<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> ACT<00:01:07.289> third<00:01:07.979> game<00:01:08.219> as

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
thought that on the ACT third game as

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.859 
thought that on the ACT third game as
well<00:01:08.520> although<00:01:08.999> obviously<00:01:09.149> this<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.569> actually

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
well although obviously this is actually

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.929 
well although obviously this is actually
the<00:01:09.990> second<00:01:10.499> game<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.159> odd<00:01:11.880> how

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
the second game up like it's odd how

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.160 
the second game up like it's odd how
they'll<00:01:12.299> release<00:01:12.479> them<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.749> the<00:01:12.810> base<00:01:12.959> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
they'll release them on the base a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.389 
they'll release them on the base a
because<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> first<00:01:13.619> game<00:01:13.799> will<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.039> next<00:01:14.219> so

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
because the first game will be next so

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.179 
because the first game will be next so
they've<00:01:14.520> gone<00:01:14.639> backwards<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:16.039> the<00:01:17.039> whole

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
they've gone backwards but the whole

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.129 
they've gone backwards but the whole
point<00:01:17.219> is<00:01:17.520> lock<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.969> in<00:01:18.090> ninja<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.929> go<00:01:19.049> up

there's<00:01:34.049> 24<00:01:34.560> levels<00:01:34.919> butch<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.880> all<00:01:35.999> honesty

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:36.419 
there's 24 levels butch in all honesty

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:37.999 
there's 24 levels butch in all honesty
it's<00:01:36.630> more<00:01:36.899> like<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.289> actually<00:01:37.619> gonna<00:01:37.770> eat

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
it's more like it's actually gonna eat

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.459 
it's more like it's actually gonna eat
rather<00:01:38.429> large<00:01:38.759> levels<00:01:39.179> so<00:01:39.869> at<00:01:40.169> the<00:01:40.289> end<00:01:40.319> of

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
rather large levels so at the end of

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.080 
rather large levels so at the end of
every<00:01:40.679> level<00:01:40.919> basically<00:01:41.099> though<00:01:41.490> you'll<00:01:41.819> get

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
every level basically though you'll get

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.599 
every level basically though you'll get
a<00:01:42.119> fighter<00:01:42.389> boss<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.099> you'll<00:01:44.099> just<00:01:44.279> basically

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
a fighter boss and you'll just basically

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.129 
a fighter boss and you'll just basically
get<00:01:44.789> a<00:01:44.819> wheel<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.090> them<00:01:45.389> and<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.719> learn<00:01:45.959> their

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:46.139 
get a wheel on them and just learn their

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.289 
get a wheel on them and just learn their
secrets<00:01:46.319> and<00:01:46.700> basically<00:01:47.700> figure<00:01:48.060> out<00:01:48.149> how<00:01:48.239> you

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
secrets and basically figure out how you

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.479 
secrets and basically figure out how you
have<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.569> actually<00:01:48.689> kill<00:01:49.020> them<00:01:49.139> but<00:01:49.979> anyway

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:50.489 
have to actually kill them but anyway

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:51.800 
have to actually kill them but anyway

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
you can also get shriek and power box

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.300 
you can also get shriek and power box
which<00:03:36.200> is<00:03:36.320> really<00:03:36.500> cool<00:03:36.739> like<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.130> just

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
which is really cool like it just

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.770 
which is really cool like it just
basically<00:03:37.489> turned<00:03:37.850> into<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.120> kind<00:03:38.270> of<00:03:38.390> variable

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
basically turned into a kind of variable

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.510 
basically turned into a kind of variable
type<00:03:38.959> thing<00:03:39.200> as<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:39.800> also<00:03:40.160> might<00:03:40.370> have

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
type thing as you also might have

puzzle elements like that their way I

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.900 
puzzle elements like that their way I
find<00:03:48.080> out<00:03:48.230> like<00:03:48.530> how<00:03:48.709> activate<00:03:49.280> this<00:03:49.520> area

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
because before it was locked off there's

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.920 
because before it was locked off there's

try<00:04:16.130> again<00:04:16.519> because<00:04:17.150> it's<00:04:17.510> just<00:04:17.780> one<00:04:17.900> of<00:04:17.930> those

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
try again because it's just one of those

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.780 
try again because it's just one of those
things<00:04:18.140> that<00:04:18.530> I<00:04:18.799> don't<00:04:18.890> see<00:04:19.280> why<00:04:19.489> you<00:04:19.549> couldn't

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
things that I don't see why you couldn't

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.170 
things that I don't see why you couldn't
just<00:04:19.970> jump<00:04:20.419> at<00:04:20.570> any<00:04:20.690> point<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:22.370> only<00:04:22.910> reason<00:04:23.030> I

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
just jump at any point the only reason I

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.670 
just jump at any point the only reason I
can<00:04:23.240> really<00:04:23.479> see<00:04:23.720> why<00:04:23.900> is<00:04:23.960> because<00:04:24.350> when<00:04:24.590> you

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
can really see why is because when you

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.320 
can really see why is because when you
do<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.919> double<00:04:25.160> jump<00:04:25.400> you<00:04:25.550> can<00:04:25.700> do<00:04:25.820> that<00:04:26.000> sweet

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
do the double jump you can do that sweet

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.000 
do the double jump you can do that sweet
attack<00:04:26.660> there<00:04:26.900> which<00:04:27.350> allows<00:04:27.620> you<00:04:27.740> to<00:04:27.830> just

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
attack there which allows you to just

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.530 
attack there which allows you to just
basically<00:04:28.190> through<00:04:28.610> a<00:04:28.669> lot<00:04:28.880> of<00:04:28.910> SH<00:04:29.030> ricans<00:04:29.419> at

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
basically through a lot of SH ricans at

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.420 
basically through a lot of SH ricans at
once<00:04:29.720> but<00:04:30.260> even<00:04:30.380> then<00:04:30.710> why<00:04:30.979> can't<00:04:31.250> we<00:04:31.310> just

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
once but even then why can't we just

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.980 
once but even then why can't we just
double<00:04:31.729> jump<00:04:31.910> without<00:04:32.030> doing<00:04:32.479> it<00:04:32.570> why<00:04:32.750> can't

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
double jump without doing it why can't

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.390 
double jump without doing it why can't
that<00:04:33.229> just<00:04:33.470> bit<00:04:33.590> of<00:04:33.710> a<00:04:33.770> ward<00:04:33.979> for<00:04:34.130> getting<00:04:34.340> a

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
that just bit of a ward for getting a

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.909 
that just bit of a ward for getting a
double<00:04:34.640> jump<00:04:34.760> fun<00:04:35.030> effect<00:04:35.270> but<00:04:36.140> anyway<00:04:36.680> that's

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
double jump fun effect but anyway that's

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.440 
double jump fun effect but anyway that's
just<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.220> little<00:04:37.400> bit<00:04:37.520> of<00:04:37.610> a<00:04:37.669> rant<00:04:37.850> of<00:04:38.030> one<00:04:38.300> of

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
just a little bit of a rant of one of

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.450 
just a little bit of a rant of one of
the<00:04:38.540> like<00:04:39.050> minor<00:04:39.530> things<00:04:39.950> that<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.160> think<00:04:40.400> is

wrong<00:04:40.580> with<00:04:40.760> a<00:04:40.790> game<00:04:41.000> because<00:04:41.450> for<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.750> most

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
wrong with a game because for the most

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.780 
wrong with a game because for the most
part<00:04:42.169> I<00:04:42.380> absolutely<00:04:42.830> love<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.190> game<00:04:43.340> I<00:04:43.550> really

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790

but<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.510> only<00:04:49.630> thing<00:04:49.720> really<00:04:49.990> left<00:04:50.290> to<00:04:50.380> do

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
but the only thing really left to do

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.930 
but the only thing really left to do
I'll<00:04:50.680> see<00:04:50.890> or<00:04:50.980> anything<00:04:51.370> like<00:04:51.400> that<00:04:51.520> is<00:04:51.910> just

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
first boss here it can be a bit awkward

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.880 
first boss here it can be a bit awkward
especially<00:04:55.660> if<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:56.200> double<00:04:56.470> jumps<00:04:56.740> are

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890

welcome<00:04:57.340> but<00:04:57.850> it's<00:04:58.720> just<00:04:58.960> one<00:04:59.050> of<00:04:59.110> those

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
welcome but it's just one of those

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.540 
welcome but it's just one of those
