00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello and welcome to sap 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.230
 Today we want to look like yourself 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.170
 The Nexus 9 wrestled into the playing temple 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.910
 two of the trigger 2 and modern combat 5 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.259
 this should be pretty interesting 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.599
 after all , there was not any 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.480
 gaming video to a device with nvidia 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.460
 tegra k1 here on my channel in advance the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.539
 usual i have the nexus of course 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.310
 just rebooted 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.510
 we do not have any running apps and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.289
 the games are not all 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.000
 preinstalled 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.320
 but of course they are in place 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.420
 torrent neither for free or 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.830
 payable and as soon as I am with one 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.329
 I'm gonna finish it, too 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.190
 close again before I make a new one 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.899
 So really start we here 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.520
 get full hardware power to see 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:46.739
 I wish I had a lot of fun 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:49.860
 watch go and start 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.539
 makes temple so ran two what I always 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.890
 still like to take it because it is 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.930
 is interesting to see just in 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.820
 such a thing is still clear in the processor 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.899
 there should be no problems here but 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.739
 There are always times 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.199
 surprises 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.329
 who said this is not the first time 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.220
 We go into the menu before and in the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.979
 settings and set the visual 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.869
 quality on best and then click here 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.030
 directly on play and look like that 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.770
 whole running so graphic looks technically 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.630
 in any case very good and me 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.090
 think you can see right here 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.439
 that everything runs smoothly 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.630
 Of course you can expect it too 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.850
 if we are honest of a so 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.820
 potent tablet or such a potent 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.110
 hardware as we have here but just now 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.340
 In any case, that's all very important 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.670
 nice no problems as I said like 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.200
 told 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.909
 technically there should be no 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.009
 give problems but that's not new 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.780
 this is not at qualcomm processors 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.600
 I always like to have problems though 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.130
 actually very strong are but yes 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.110
 is then less often at the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.909
 hardware more so s.der software in 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.770
 In this case the player has the problem 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.180
 In any case, we do not have that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.009
 everything looks very nice and runs 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.149
 everything very nicely liquid here 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.100
 her then quite good that the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.869
 viewing angle stability for the nexus new 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.460
 really great is there you can 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.840
 do not complain and I think 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.030
 we have to do a lot more here 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.350
 do not look at tempera anymore 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.690
 the test has definitely 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.700
 easily passed and counting 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.900
 with depp 2, I can do that 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.780
 say it now 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.730
 that we are pretty interesting yes 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.409
 also a relatively complicated game but 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.480
 that's not what it's all about today 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.549
 Primary a few words maybe 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.560
 before we start the speakers 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.120
 I like the nexus 9 pretty well 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.470
 especially because of the positioning so 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.069
 here on the left and right on the 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.260
 front 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.299
 because it simply creates a super beautiful 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.250
 stereoklang and you stop at 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.359
 it's just a huge advantage to play 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.519
 much better than when 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.590
 speakers on the bottom or even 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.420
 On the back is because you just 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.700
 not so easily obscured and at the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.260
 Sound straight to you in the direction 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.489
 heures face comes I think that 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260
 explain themselves 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.609
 that looks very good now 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.680
 out and that has a very simple one 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.870
 Reason if we jump in here 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.489
 then we see the graphic details are 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.079
 it was set too high 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.760
 automatically recognized that I have 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.620
 not done that you know so from 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.480
 nvidia processors but there was 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.099
 can really longer now 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.739
 potent nvidia processor more 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.689
 In that sense, I was really there 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.159
 Surprised at first is is easy 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.139
 on the next new so the trigger 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.599
 2 looks clear on the next 9 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.579
 better than another android 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.099
 Tablets I had so far what the 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.150
 Details are always visible 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.440
 I like to call it soja 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.510
 water drops or very fine details 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.180
 now for example yes that is on everyone 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.500
 case again another level what 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.840
 of course, the graphics settings 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.669
 show but still it all works 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.359
 also very nicely liquid here now 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.370
 can see 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.319
 there are the tablets or the 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.669
 Android devices in general quite like 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.829
 this is not the case here 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:47.120
 and looks really very pretty 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.650
 I can repeat it again 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.849
 we play the level to the end 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.459
 I would suggest 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.159
 but as I said top graphics synonymous 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.840
 no performance problems at all and 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.699
 the speakers also make a lot 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.409
 very good impression so far no 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:03.569
 unpleasant heat development because that yes 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.849
 I always have some interests 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.159
 before tempera 2 played here now in the 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.049
 deb jersey 2 there were of course 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.370
 still be nothing or it should be 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.500
 at least not yet 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.139
 Therefore, exceptions always confirm the 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.880
 rule as said the warrior 2 makes 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.620
 I really have so much fun 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.459
 nice on no other android yet 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.469
 seen tablet 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.599
 last but not least now 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.930
 Modern Combat Fifth usually like that 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.120
 always 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.110
 the game where i say yes that has the 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.940
 highest requirements 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.949
 the most beautiful graphics but in the case 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.110
 The trigger two really looks up here 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.789
 the nexus 9 is better than modern combat 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.740
 5 I can already anticipate that much 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.139
 he still owns, too 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.310
 always very interesting yes, I just 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.710
 just to see if it is 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.479
 Any problems are 9.5 I say 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.639
 now one is yes is well known for 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.669
 his bugs at the beginning at 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.630
 Market launch of the new iphones 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.729
 I still remember the sky in 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.960
 venice flickered so weirdly 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.810
 Let's see if this is here now 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.250
 But that's the way it is now, let's start 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.440
 a graphic is really here too 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.470
 nice but as I said in the warrior 2 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.630
 even a little tick better though 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.669
 It will definitely be everything 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.240
 as if it would run very smoothly me 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:14.220
 of course, should go forward and 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.060
 then two that are there already turn again 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.440
 have to believe 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:22.830
 the colleague, of course, and then too 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.419
 still here and that 's it but you 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.180
 See that everything is very smooth 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:29.400
 and also the graphic looks great 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.380
 But I do not say better than that 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.539
 now on some other android 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.150
 In any case tablet must be so fair 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:38.460
 also be 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.380
 and now we go up here and 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.930
 then help the cult colleagues 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.010
 after apologies please that is 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.510
 Of course, no problem at all 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.960
 I will look interesting now 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.760
 we look at the sky 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.820
 but the draws here from all ok 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.780
 the bug does not seem here at nexus 9 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.460
 to be present 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:03.169
 and there come the next ones 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.169
 and there had to be a fight again 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.030
 and this one does not last long 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.710
 survived chance forward I am always 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.590
 again not very nice scenery here 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.789
 that is always happy to come here 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.740
 but also here on the big display 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:19.169
 obviously much better than the 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.300
 The whole smartphone is always goodbye 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.570
 if you play with a tray and it 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.130
 running everything was very nice liquid 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.930
 I'm a bit skeptical of modern at the beginning 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.590
 combat five but you do not have to 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.180
 to worry 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.639
 maybe a few words to go to 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.600
 heat development in the area around the 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.670
 Camera in the upper end 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.010
 the back will be the nexus 9 now 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.180
 noticeably warmer but that is really 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.400
 not bad I have that, of course 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.250
 also in the previously tested before 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.760
 and played a bit longer so 20 30 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.740
 minutes 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.960
 There were no problems at all 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.330
 So there's really no need to worry 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.950
 I think I'll do that 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.840
 but it just gets a little warmer 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.700
 I think we have a lot more to do 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.140
 Do not even look at what 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.610
 can conclusively say how to 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.710
 of course, it is also expected 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.750
 the nexus new super in gaming leaves 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.060
 especially the graphics at the trigger 2 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.260
 is really impressive he people that 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.000
