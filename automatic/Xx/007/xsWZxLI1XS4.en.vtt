00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.510
 hello girls that as good as you'll see in 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.830
 the title of the video is a video that 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.290
 have had a lot lately 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.750
 instagram since I uploaded the photo of this 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.099
 bag that you have already seen in another 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.230
 video that you sometimes saw earlier 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.150
 because I'm giving a lot of videos the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.460
 same day and good this bag of the 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.769
 web page look book store and I leave you the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.869
 direct link to the web page 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.939
 and specifically to this bag in case 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.439
 interesting and the truth that quality is 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.960
 super good but I'm not going to entertain 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.390
 in that because she talked about it in the 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.640
 another video so I go directly to 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.270
 theme of the video that is what is 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.340
 I have inside 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.780
 in thirty less serious I was wearing in my 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.180
 bag for the university yes that you 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.530
 more interested in this video or better than this 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.540
 information if you want to see what it is that 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.400
 I carry in my normal bag to go out 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.730
 normal any day without being to the 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.920
 university because it remains to know the good the 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.100
 bag has several zippers like 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.990
 you can see and where I keep the pint what 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.380
 Main is everything is in the zipper 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:02.050
 in the middle and there I take everything and I'll go 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.830
 teaching good I carry a bottle of 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.840
 water as is logical because 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.820
 I always have a lot to do and if not 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.610
 I wear something like that, I spend it, I go to the machine 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.960
 if it's anywhere a cafeteria and 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.960
 I buy water 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.539
 after he took the wallet my portfolio is 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.679
 from here of michael kors and nothing like that 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:27.040
 truth that I have it super full of 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:29.770
 ticket papers and everything 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.580
 then I find here a lip 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:38.910
 pulled east from astor and is number one 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.910
 it was held on 09.09 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.250
 there is your interest in this color 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.850
 pink from here 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.360
 then he brought this purse 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.979
 here that is of secret victory and in it 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.750
 I took the little bit of makeup 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.400
 good is the avian was wearing it loose 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.740
 because someday if I touched something something 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.100
 he put in fast but what I always carry 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.140
 It is a mirror 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.390
 a corrector that in this case is 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.830
 kiko because for me it is very important 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.380
 zone of the ojera or if you get some 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.030
 granite so you do not have to carry base or 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.640
 any other corrector that you have to 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.530
 use brush as this one here it is 02 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.190
 from kiko as I said and has a 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.100
 texture such that 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.200
 after I take antibacterial that this already 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.200
 I'm running out as you see is that I 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.550
 is super little and a baby lips that in 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.690
 this case is the new ones that came out 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.690
 is the tone 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.580
 after my calendar arrived it 's super 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.350
 important to me since not only 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.150
 the agenda of the university but where 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.520
 I point everything any important appointment 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.540
 anything I have to do everything 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.730
 good as you will see around here I also have 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.280
 paper is a discount that I have of 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.129
 sephora this since led to change a 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.109
 practically everything together with an order 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:03.819
 of everything a bit and as you will see is that 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:06.370
 he wrote down all of them I write a lot and I 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.549
 love having everything super decorated and not 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.549
 he 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.959
 then I like to take the case 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.730
 because it does not start much because here 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.989
 I have all the colors and everything for 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.569
 describe my agenda since I like it 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.400
 bring a pen nothing else so I take 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.620
 my case that weighs me almost nothing and 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.590
 this is of simple victories and blurred and 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.150
 I already have all the essentials and also with 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.190
 one that you see because you never know and 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.190
 I can save something important 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.480
 then for the time that it does too 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.130
 already or umbrella but I do not have it here 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.370
 because it is not wet no longer that of 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:46.150
 rain and good this one here is these are 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.530

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.900

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.870
 on the mobile in the computer then if 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.160
 I'm not going to write anymore, you can put 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.980
 this part here becomes a 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.050
