00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.839
 so and in this video I show you 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.480
 Now as you stitch was right 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.429
 can cross without a help load 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.360
 to use 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.180
 there are two again 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.550
 different species to the right 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.040
 scratch once with two right ones 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.250
 Knitted stitches and once with a 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.750
 right and left mesh and with 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.410
 I always show you these symbols 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.619
 in my strict writings go to the 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.719
 quite simply we knit again 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.899
 up to the point at the crossed 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.899
 becomes 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:44.620
 now we have to front the second stitch 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.320
 pretty knit this one which we like so 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.329
 little bit as normal 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.239
 right knit from left to right in 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.870
 the mesh purely grab the thread 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.969
 and pull that through next 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.519
 the thread backwards for now want 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.519
 we knit the first stitch right 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.920
 so and now you can see the second one 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.660
 mesh lies to the right before the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.910
 first mesh and both are right 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:18.910
 Knitted I show again so the 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.970
 second only a bit on those of 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.700
 right to left a sting thread 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.040
 grab and pull through and as 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.010
 Next knit the first stitch right 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.910
 but the thread must be there to the back 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.790
 the first stitch through a sting thread 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.470
 and slide everything from the left nail 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.380
 to let 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.730
 that was the right-right crossing and 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.270
 Now we are still on the left 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:51.820
 crossing it makes this even easier 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:58.600
 knit just like the second stitch 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:01.090
 right knitted and now 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.270
 just the first stitch left for that 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.420
 Can stay the thread where he is 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.000
 left through and both from the left 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.159
 slide left needle 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.730
 there lies the mesh crossed on the right 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:18.239
 and there's the left and me behind 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:25.409
 show it again 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:31.689
 knit the second stitch on the front right 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:41.579
 and the first stitch on the front left 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:41.579
 knit and that was a lot of fun with it
