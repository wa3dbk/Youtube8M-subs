like how you expected it to worked out

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.930 
like how you expected it to worked out
this<00:00:31.720> but<00:00:32.380> there<00:00:32.710> are<00:00:32.740> a<00:00:32.830> few<00:00:33.220> features<00:00:33.550> I

let's<00:00:35.830> talk<00:00:36.040> about<00:00:36.100> its<00:00:36.489> pricing<00:00:37.270> it<00:00:37.480> isn't

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
let's talk about its pricing it isn't

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.810 
let's talk about its pricing it isn't
really<00:00:38.230> that<00:00:38.260> pricey<00:00:38.710> it's<00:00:39.100> actually<00:00:39.430> pretty

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
really that pricey it's actually pretty

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.960 
really that pricey it's actually pretty
reasonable<00:00:40.150> so<00:00:41.140> there<00:00:41.410> isn't<00:00:41.650> any<00:00:42.160> reason<00:00:42.520> not

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
reasonable so there isn't any reason not

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.299 
reasonable so there isn't any reason not
to<00:00:43.030> get<00:00:43.330> this<00:00:43.570> wireless<00:00:44.050> mouse<00:00:44.320> so<00:00:44.860> second<00:00:45.220> of

curves and a soft rubber grip on this

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.560 
curves and a soft rubber grip on this
side<00:00:54.460> which<00:00:54.700> is<00:00:54.850> pretty<00:00:55.120> awesome

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
side which is pretty awesome

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.350 
side which is pretty awesome
it<00:00:55.720> supports<00:00:56.500> for<00:00:56.800> your<00:00:56.830> hand<00:00:57.310> and<00:00:57.550> even

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740 
though you're working really hard you

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.650 
though you're working really hard you
know<00:00:59.890> you<00:01:00.579> don't<00:01:00.790> really<00:01:00.880> get<00:01:01.060> tired<00:01:01.420> that

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
know you don't really get tired that

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
know that grip shape right there so it's

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.910 
know that grip shape right there so it's
practically<00:01:07.540> life<00:01:07.810> it's<00:01:08.080> pretty<00:01:08.350> long<00:01:08.650> well

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
practically life it's pretty long well

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.190 
practically life it's pretty long well
this<00:01:09.190> actually<00:01:09.670> depends<00:01:10.090> on<00:01:10.300> you<00:01:10.780> know<00:01:10.930> how

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
this actually depends on you know how

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.130 
this actually depends on you know how
often<00:01:11.560> you<00:01:11.860> actually<00:01:12.070> use<00:01:12.580> it<00:01:12.820> but<00:01:13.420> it

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
often you actually use it but it

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.960 
often you actually use it but it
actually<00:01:14.170> says<00:01:14.800> here<00:01:15.160> that<00:01:15.190> it<00:01:15.580> can<00:01:15.790> actually

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
actually says here that it can actually

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.990 
actually says here that it can actually
last<00:01:16.420> up<00:01:16.690> to<00:01:17.020> 18<00:01:17.530> months<00:01:17.770> well<00:01:18.430> you<00:01:18.580> know<00:01:18.729> just

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
last up to 18 months well you know just

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.150 
last up to 18 months well you know just
be<00:01:19.180> sure<00:01:19.390> to<00:01:19.540> actually<00:01:19.690> off<00:01:20.050> it<00:01:20.290> after<00:01:20.830> using

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
be sure to actually off it after using

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.779 
be sure to actually off it after using
your<00:01:21.550> wireless<00:01:22.479> mouse<00:01:22.780> so<00:01:23.679> of<00:01:23.800> course<00:01:24.009> BM<00:01:24.340> 280

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
your wireless mouse so of course BM 280

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.540 
your wireless mouse so of course BM 280
also<00:01:25.210> has<00:01:25.509> this<00:01:25.869> next<00:01:26.350> generation<00:01:26.560> logitech

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
also has this next generation logitech

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.270 
also has this next generation logitech
advanced<00:01:28.000> optical<00:01:28.600> tracking<00:01:28.990> sensor<00:01:29.679> which

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
advanced optical tracking sensor which

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.430 
advanced optical tracking sensor which
actually<00:01:30.789> performs<00:01:31.479> better<00:01:31.750> than<00:01:31.929> other

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
actually performs better than other

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.639 
actually performs better than other
optical<00:01:33.039> sensors<00:01:33.580> in<00:01:33.850> terms<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.690> accuracy<00:01:35.500> and

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
optical sensors in terms of accuracy and

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.949 
optical sensors in terms of accuracy and
efficiency<00:01:36.160> and<00:01:36.819> of<00:01:37.119> course<00:01:37.390> last<00:01:37.660> but<00:01:37.840> not

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:37.959 
efficiency and of course last but not

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:40.410 
efficiency and of course last but not
least<00:01:38.259> the<00:01:38.740> tiny<00:01:39.039> nano<00:01:39.369> receiver<00:01:40.000> which

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
least the tiny nano receiver which

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.370 
least the tiny nano receiver which
particularly<00:01:42.300> disappears<00:01:43.300> in<00:01:43.539> a<00:01:43.750> computer's

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
particularly disappears in a computer's

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.040 
particularly disappears in a computer's
USB<00:01:44.649> port<00:01:45.009> or<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:46.119> can<00:01:46.270> actually<00:01:46.450> store<00:01:46.990> it

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
USB port or you can actually store it

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.680 
USB port or you can actually store it
inside<00:01:47.649> your<00:01:47.830> mouth<00:01:48.130> when<00:01:48.940> you<00:01:49.209> know<00:01:49.330> maybe

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
inside your mouth when you know maybe

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.749 
inside your mouth when you know maybe
you're<00:01:49.959> traveling<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.619> stuff<00:01:50.890> like<00:01:51.039> that<00:01:51.280> but

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
you're traveling and stuff like that but

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.940 
you're traveling and stuff like that but
most<00:01:51.970> of<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.209> time<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.899> don't<00:01:53.229> actually<00:01:53.530> need

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
most of the time you don't actually need

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.550 
most of the time you don't actually need
to<00:01:54.009> plug<00:01:54.459> it<00:01:54.580> out<00:01:54.670> from<00:01:55.000> your<00:01:55.030> computer<00:01:55.750> yeah

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
to plug it out from your computer yeah

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.199 
to plug it out from your computer yeah
so<00:01:56.830> it's<00:01:57.130> pretty<00:01:57.369> cool<00:01:57.580> you<00:01:57.700> could<00:01:57.819> just<00:01:58.030> put

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
so it's pretty cool you could just put

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:00.029 
so it's pretty cool you could just put
it<00:01:58.300> in<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.600> whole<00:01:58.780> time<00:01:59.050> you<00:01:59.289> know<00:01:59.380> just<00:01:59.890> leave

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
it in the whole time you know just leave
