00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:18.130
 I'm 26 years old, the doctor said I had 16 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.050
 years skating 7 for several I do not know about 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.060
 I suddenly bought my tattoo machine 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.919
 and I started to practice and after I liked it 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.529
 much as I've always liked to draw 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.910
 I like to touch people and see that 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.179
 people bring tattoos that I've done 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.790
 and I took 3 almost 4 years is acting and 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.070
 Well , it was a good idea to put 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.760
 someone from the team is that in that of 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.670
 art and that then they gave me the idea 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.860
 behind trying to design a backpack 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.330
 for back to school 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.890
 they gave me the backpack and it's white 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:53.650
 so my idea was to try to demonstrate 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.320
 or to translate how to take the steps to 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.060
 tattoo or idea from the front was 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.040
 be a template with which they are made 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.370
 the tattoos that is a paper is called 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.800
 geographical then mark the drawings 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.360
 who wanted and wanted to spend how 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.120
 they go to the skin to 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.890
 as with an alcohol base the design 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.860
 it was like skateboarding and shorts because they go like 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.890
 from the hand of fans too and I put him 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.800
 skateboards or the little symbol of the table 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.000
 balance with the material that is made 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.250
 the sandpaper is sandpaper and back 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.440
 I bought some pieces of synthetic leather and 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.180
 I started tattooing there something there is a 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.540
 sugar skull so that like a little 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.520
 more Mexican the thing that I did as a 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.100
 leg shape and that was on top 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.410
 from a table and I put you draw a 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.930
 tennis that is vance and laces that 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.790
 it's like 3ds somehow things like that 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.470
 As I made my backpack I invite you to 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.810
 they say their own voice pack for back to 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.530
