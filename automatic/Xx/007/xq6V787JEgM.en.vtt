00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:17.320
 Hello Hairspray first buck PC points Haubold which avoid the HTC 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.320
 Incredible s in size comparison with the Lexus 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.289
 and the Blackberry Bold 9700 show 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.380
 Once lakers-ass freeze that is the HTC Incredible s 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.740
 that has become the nexus 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.300
 and in doing so come seven inches of screen the Incredible s has one 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.280
 4-inch screen 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.280
 and here the Blackberry Bold 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.170
 that has no idea islands screen work 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.200
 we pack the whole time of the size pulls is already so 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.320
 The Incredible s is clearly the largest of them that Mappus were then 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.900
 Blackberry Bold 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.130
 to SKH if you look at that not much bigger than the Nexus One what 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.970
 Previous year 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.300
 as tall as the HTC Desire 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.210
 under the condition that one puts on the side 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.000
 then you will see 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.510
 that the Incredible s and that Mark were about the same size 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.040
 So the same thickness and the Patt Neuburg keep the kicker 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.500
 while comparing the suffrage for the courses 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.620
 where are the two times yes took over 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.550
 and seeing both 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.700
 that is not so much difference is a dear directly above each other 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.030
 lie 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.510
 they are the kickers 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.110
 Karmasin can take on the medigreif group in the same way 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.030
 at least that's almost the same 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.030
 although the Incredible s ever has this huggel 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.490
 that is 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.970
 this wide 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.720
 up to as high as the Nexus One the whole device 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 and that makes it very pleasant to hold because you can stop 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.420
 from here it is just there 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.729
 so Dulig the Lommersumer handheld feels very very bitter 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.570
 as an example once again wanted to show who is not great on puls4 great 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.630
 I've got bigger than significant intone 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.159
 Plug and all that she has been from the Lexus 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.569
 which will monitor this bag 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.429
 fits the Incredible s 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:18.799
 April Stedten chairs got out 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.079
 for the Nexus One as well 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.819
 so of the dimensions can be very much different so there would be no 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.819
 Concerned that Lausanne is getting too big 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:34.959
 had the video celebrated but everyone or John Leahy products-up at www also BT 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:35.849
 Group the coffee market
