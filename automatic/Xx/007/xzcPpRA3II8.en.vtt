suppose<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.189> terms<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.030> you're<00:01:42.180> decent<00:01:42.390> a

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
suppose in terms of if you're decent a

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:43.819 
suppose in terms of if you're decent a
train<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.930> doesn't<00:01:43.170> really<00:01:43.259> make<00:01:43.439> all<00:01:43.680> that

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
train that doesn't really make all that

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.679 
train that doesn't really make all that
much<00:01:44.070> difference<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:45.060> anyways<00:01:45.359> into<00:01:45.600> this

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
much difference but anyways into this

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.749 
much difference but anyways into this

actually I did have a more shots and
shots<00:02:17.880> on<00:02:18.090> target<00:02:18.120> but<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.840> think<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.410> did<00:02:19.590> show

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
shots on target but I think I did show

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.290 
shots on target but I think I did show
his<00:02:19.980> two<00:02:20.220> shots<00:02:20.490> for<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.820> fact<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.150> they

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
his two shots for the fact that they

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.940 
his two shots for the fact that they
were<00:02:21.360> probably<00:02:21.630> at<00:02:21.960> to<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.320> best<00:02:22.500> chance<00:02:22.740> in

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
were probably at to the best chance in

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.040 
were probably at to the best chance in
the<00:02:23.040> game<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.490> I'm<00:02:23.940> not<00:02:24.120> unfair<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.570> don't<00:02:24.900> make

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
the game and I'm not unfair I don't make

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.720

many<00:03:42.030> shots<00:03:42.330> I<00:03:42.540> suppose<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.900> had<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.260> we<00:03:44.040> move

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
many shots I suppose I had and we move

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.830 
many shots I suppose I had and we move
up<00:03:44.490> and<00:03:44.790> we're<00:03:44.910> guaranteed<00:03:45.360> not<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.630> get

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
up and we're guaranteed not to get
