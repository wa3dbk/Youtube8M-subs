00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.090
 Hello everyone decided 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.090
 video review 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.170
 replacement mouse logitech lx 3 years that I 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.390
 five served faithfully but since 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:27.279
 I have to constantly carry a laptop 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:30.849
 myself that long receiver me just 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.339
 tired of it constantly taking out puts on 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:37.650
 place to hide seek and therefore was 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:40.739
 Decided to replace your mouse 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:45.400
 started looking from modern now 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.940
 I regret a bit that I hurried into something 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.890
 Basically it is good 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.470
 why chose it you liked the idea 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:59.760
 touch screen integration with windows 8 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.989
 I liked the design very much in principle 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.140
 logitech i always had mice 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:10.210
 keyboards and of course small 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:14.290
 the receiver on the manufacturer’s website is certified 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.509
 what's from two batteries 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.090
 who were going to be included 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:26.110
 work over the years principle has passed 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:29.760
 six months working and not thinking sits well 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.310
 that there is every chance but also on my lx3 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.950
 Well enough battery for at least six months and then 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.680
 and more 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.540
 there it has its own pluses and minuses 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:45.230
 the pluses are sensory 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.700
 very interesting comfortable pleasant feeling 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.310
 it is written on the website that this is glass it is 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.590
 not glass is plastic small 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.140
 therefore choose Siviri again I repeat that 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.140
 can be hidden in this nest 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:06.300
 here and calmly carry the mouse 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.290
 go here it works on all surfaces 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:15.360
 both on glass and gloss 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:21.390
 on the mirror everywhere does not work much 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.880
 light weight is quite good when connected 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.850
 together with downloading drivers 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.900
 download utility logitech which 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.690
 allows you to monitor 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:39.120
 Mice fully customize any movement 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.060
 any touch by clicking the mouse 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.060
 but I'm not in front of the island standard 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.080
 the value i just reconfigured to this 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.360
 the key was the start button windows 8 and 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.750
 this key did 20 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.470
 average wheel pressure on ordinary 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.350
 mice as you can see 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.780
 for six months of use is very good as 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.930
 would have polished 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.360
 the surface where the fingers are pressed more often 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.790
 all though she mail x3 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.590
 over five years of use even if not 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.540
 above almost nothing erased here 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.440
 see for yourself Maratov pepper 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.989
 so over time I lowered it so much 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.240
 noticeably 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.820
 someone's rubberized tank 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.950
 difficult to pick out any thread from there 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.600
 and it's hard to clean 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.370
 well, as if not dirty well, clean, I washed 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.630
 just somehow changed my color and not 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:49.410
 I know change to standard though 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:52.650
 sometime but in principle browser 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.060
 chrome installs the extension along with 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.330
 drivers that allows you to do 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.320
 smooth scrolling on sites without it 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.390
 that's enough of this resolution 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:06.900
 movement and the page is rewound the most 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:10.260
 bottom is a big minus then even here 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.420
 established expansion were conic 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.550
 we squander down smoothly and turns 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.239
 even after you tore your 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.130
 finger from the touchpad two or three 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.290
 seconds you can not press the control keys 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.740
 and match if you hit you think what 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:29.760
 you want to zoom the page 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.590
 This is also inconvenient as well. 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.720
 principle 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.360
 interesting experiment but I don’t think that 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:43.680
 someday I'll take touchpads 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:48.950
 here all subscribe for now 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.950
 likes comment good luck
