 pass this shape that are all 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.230
 Talking about your power church is not there. 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.800
 where it is had it 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.130
 the accompaniment before when Fabiano 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.640

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.680
 say that I started to do a lot more 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.450
 exercise is to eat healthy during 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.180
 week and when it arrives at the end of the week 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.490
 I allow myself the queen of twitter 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.400
 you have twitter followers when 2 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.020
 millions just like I do not know 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.270
 It's exactly the name I have not seen in a long time. 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.880
 but I know it has gone from 2 to 2 already 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.920
 million which is more annoying on twitter 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.580
 for you when a message speaking in 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.180
 me 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.550
 go on this business and boring day knows 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.320
 I do not think anyone is forced to follow 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.580
 no one on the internet and when he sent a 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.830
 behind the other and leaves a series of 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.600
 2007 was with ours when it is not 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.550
 but even throwing these times at 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.140
 love message right sends message 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.440
 software ambition 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.520
 This is too annoying, I like this one. 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.820
 exchange is this quick information 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.940
 the good mood of people the speed and 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.010
 wit you on the internet you have to 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.370
 have yes to z 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.610
 otherwise you can not believe much you know 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.260
 that you are changing people's lives 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.860
 or there are people who think that's great 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.860
 Is not that what this is wrong with there? 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.750
 now and another can not either 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.040
 is there just for you want to spread the word 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.720
 your job when you are someone 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.970
 known 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.400
 I entered with a physical person I 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.209
 I think it worked out well on twitter so 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.769
 bomb 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.810
 Do you think sometimes they rolled a 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.760
 little your kind of privacy 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.650
 with you as if it were your friends to give you 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.640
 a shaken one so I guess not just there 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.980
 Because of twitter, this is mine. 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.609
 My personality I'm a speaker I 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.099
 I'm accessible so I guess it does 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:08.299
 with which people have more of this 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:10.459
 freedom see it syntactic season us 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.760
 tv shows she does not know then 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:18.260
 I do not think I see it there, because it's clear 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.900
 I 'm your friend Nelson, cool person but 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.389
 do not always see you know I know one 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.669
 meets a side of me that me a bit 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.290
 people see the man when he sells 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.840
 tackle was boring 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.579
 I already saw very annoying you have today. 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.379
 I'll be very happy if she did not speak 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.680
 You do not need rest 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.750

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.060
 things to people who know this beautiful 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.069
 Never help me, there's no such problem. 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.569
 thing of the type one has to be beautiful 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.269
 It's 15 and on tv. 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.919
 but there is inconvenience and inconvenience 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.690
 any place right? 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.519
 I was even complaining about something else 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.530
 it was not even kind of wanted 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.650
 inconvenient but it's because the guys 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.189
 Intermediate edu

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.829
 nervous to record the first scenes 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.750
 of novel than for external novela a 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:22.509
 people 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.970
 The teacher became so good the teacher. 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:44.130
 fernando the lieutenant fernanda page 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:47.169
 We know veterinarians and they are 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.930
 strong like this 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.870
 but at the same time good friend good people 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.020
 In real life, the strip is at work. 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.479
 precisely to show if this difference 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.539

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:06.910
 preparation you also do as a horse and 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:11.460
 clothes like export do not know what was 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:14.069
 It's difficult, I took time riding class. 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.050
 nice 60 this intimacy with the animal 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:20.400
 even if not necessarily my 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.560
 character is there she goes missing the same has 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.639
 character of murilo rosa and of wheat 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.669

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.699
 teaching 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.650

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.270
 who had another was on top of the horse 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.550

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.870
 in love with me that she did not speak 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.229

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.860
 there are few and I left doing so brazil 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.830

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.300
 meat waves people used to be milan p ta 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:02.780
 coming from me 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.780
