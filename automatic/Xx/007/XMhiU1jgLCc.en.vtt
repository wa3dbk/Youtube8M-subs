the<00:00:14.550> engine<00:00:14.790> from<00:00:15.030> stalling<00:00:15.680> or<00:00:16.680> if<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:16.980> go<00:00:17.160> to

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
the engine from stalling or if you go to

the engine from stalling or if you go to
if<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.000> had<00:00:18.120> a<00:00:18.150> stoplight<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.930> go<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.140> turn<00:00:19.410> on

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
if you had a stoplight you go to turn on

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.080 
if you had a stoplight you go to turn on
your<00:00:19.770> air<00:00:19.920> conditioning<00:00:20.340> system<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:21.030> the

engine runs really rough and starts to
stall<00:00:23.070> out<00:00:23.340> there<00:00:24.240> could<00:00:24.450> be<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.600> few<00:00:25.170> things

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
stall out there could be a few things

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.230 
stall out there could be a few things
causing<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.360> I'll<00:00:28.140> try<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.410> point<00:00:29.400> some

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
causing that and I'll try to point some

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.399 
causing that and I'll try to point some
of<00:00:30.270> the<00:00:32.420> most<00:00:33.420> common<00:00:34.350> culprits<00:00:34.859> here<00:00:35.929> on<00:00:36.929> this

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:37.409 
of the most common culprits here on this

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:41.180 
of the most common culprits here on this
truck<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.039> truck<00:00:38.219> has<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.530> 351<00:00:40.530> Windsor<00:00:40.979> v8

truck this truck has the 351 Windsor v8

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.239 
truck this truck has the 351 Windsor v8
engine<00:00:41.870> which<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.899> laid<00:00:43.229> out<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.440> lot<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:43.979> the

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:44.249 
engine which is laid out a lot like the

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:49.009 
engine which is laid out a lot like the
Ford<00:00:44.760> 5<00:00:45.059> liter<00:00:45.359> the<00:00:45.569> 302<00:00:45.929> and<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.940> 460<00:00:48.749> would

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
Ford 5 liter the 302 and the 460 would

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.520 
Ford 5 liter the 302 and the 460 would
have<00:00:49.229> the<00:00:49.710> throttle<00:00:50.489> body<00:00:50.609> and<00:00:51.030> everything<00:00:51.530> I

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
have the throttle body and everything I

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.610 
have the throttle body and everything I
believe<00:00:53.370> toward<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.999> middle<00:00:54.299> and<00:00:54.499> toward<00:00:55.499> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
believe toward the middle and toward the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.149 
believe toward the middle and toward the
back<00:00:56.809> but<00:00:57.809> when<00:00:58.049> that<00:00:58.139> problem<00:00:58.530> happens<00:00:58.949> one

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159 
back but when that problem happens one

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.759 
back but when that problem happens one
of<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> first<00:00:59.489> things<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.999> look<00:01:00.149> for<00:01:00.479> is<00:01:00.769> this

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
of the first things to look for is this

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.860 
of the first things to look for is this
idle<00:01:02.190> air<00:01:02.339> control<00:01:02.370> valve<00:01:02.760> right<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.389> what

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
idle air control valve right here what

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.899 
idle air control valve right here what
this<00:01:04.019> does<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.710> bypasses<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> throttle

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
this does is it bypasses the throttle

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.630 
this does is it bypasses the throttle
plates<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.500> helps<00:01:07.500> maintain<00:01:07.710> an<00:01:08.189> engine<00:01:08.490> oil

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
plates and helps maintain an engine oil

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.600 
plates and helps maintain an engine oil
and<00:01:08.969> one<00:01:09.780> thing<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.079> can<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.710> check<00:01:11.219> out<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and one thing you can do to check out to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.639 
and one thing you can do to check out to
see<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:11.969> the<00:01:12.210> culprit<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.500> have

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
see if this is the culprit is to have

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.849 
see if this is the culprit is to have
the<00:01:13.829> engine<00:01:14.100> running<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:15.210> will<00:01:15.360> run<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
the engine running if it will run and

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:18.560 
the engine running if it will run and
pull<00:01:16.859> off<00:01:17.039> this<00:01:17.280> connector<00:01:17.820> when<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.390> pull

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
pull off this connector when you pull

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.440 
pull off this connector when you pull
the<00:01:18.689> connector<00:01:18.930> off<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:20.070> engine<00:01:20.430> either<00:01:21.149> will

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
the connector off the engine either will

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.410 
the connector off the engine either will
die<00:01:21.689> out<00:01:21.719> completely<00:01:22.350> or<00:01:22.740> run<00:01:23.549> very<00:01:23.969> slow<00:01:24.359> to

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
die out completely or run very slow to

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.469 
die out completely or run very slow to
the<00:01:24.630> point<00:01:24.899> where<00:01:25.079> almost<00:01:25.320> will<00:01:25.770> done<00:01:26.479> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the point where almost will done and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.370 
the point where almost will done and
I've<00:01:27.750> got<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.909> mouth<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.270> did<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.929> did<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.109> valve

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
I've got a mouth I did I did the valve

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.380 
I've got a mouth I did I did the valve
on<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.740> truck<00:01:32.039> actually<00:01:32.250> back<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.880> October

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
on this truck actually back in October

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.700 
on this truck actually back in October
last<00:01:33.649> year<00:01:35.630> here's<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.719> box<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.170> came<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:38.600> and

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
last year here's a box that came in and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.639 
last year here's a box that came in and
here's<00:01:40.710> what<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.159> valve<00:01:41.399> looks<00:01:41.729> like<00:01:42.649> comes

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
here's what that valve looks like comes

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.060 
here's what that valve looks like comes
with<00:01:43.859> a<00:01:43.890> new<00:01:44.070> gasket<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.759> everything<00:01:46.520> and

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
with a new gasket and everything and

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.469 
with a new gasket and everything and
this<00:01:50.070> valve<00:01:50.369> actually<00:01:50.789> ended<00:01:51.119> up<00:01:51.210> failing

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
this valve actually ended up failing

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.480 
this valve actually ended up failing
electrically<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.409> got<00:01:52.530> high<00:01:52.740> resistance<00:01:53.369> in

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
electrically it's got high resistance in

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.749 
electrically it's got high resistance in
the<00:01:53.609> contact<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:55.320> corrals<00:01:55.740> inside<00:01:56.340> burns

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
the contact so the corrals inside burns

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.779 
the contact so the corrals inside burns
up<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.890> starting<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.249> rain

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
up and it's starting to rain

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.319 
up and it's starting to rain
put<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.479> back<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.670> that's<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.969> first<00:02:03.179> thing

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
put that back so that's the first thing

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.730 
put that back so that's the first thing
I<00:02:03.450> would<00:02:03.509> look<00:02:03.749> for<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.229> idle<00:02:04.649> air

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
I would look for is that idle air

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.319 
I would look for is that idle air
control<00:02:04.770> valve<00:02:05.130> right<00:02:05.640> there<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:06.149> either

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
control valve right there it's either

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.040 
control valve right there it's either
dirty<00:02:06.689> inside<00:02:07.190> or<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.810> work<00:02:09.810> failed

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
dirty inside or the work failed

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.020 
dirty inside or the work failed
electrically<00:02:10.680> these<00:02:10.950> are<00:02:11.160> about<00:02:11.340> anywhere

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
electrically these are about anywhere

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.660 
electrically these are about anywhere
between<00:02:12.090> 35<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.080> 75<00:02:13.860> dollars

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
between 35 and 75 dollars

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
position and that's been leaning out

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.160 
position and that's been leaning out
your<00:02:29.520> mixture<00:02:29.820> too<00:02:30.060> much<00:02:30.330> causing<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.020> run

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
your mixture too much causing it to run

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.580 
your mixture too much causing it to run
really<00:02:31.380> bad<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.890> maybe<00:02:32.280> stall<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:34.260> will

really bad and maybe stall and that will

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.890 
really bad and maybe stall and that will
usually<00:02:34.620> set<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.400> code<00:02:35.700> because<00:02:36.510> they'll<00:02:36.720> keep

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
usually set a code because they'll keep

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.330 
usually set a code because they'll keep
the<00:02:37.140> sensor<00:02:37.650> off<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.160> its<00:02:38.310> seat<00:02:40.070> but<00:02:41.070> if<00:02:41.190> not

the sensor off of its seat but if not
what<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:41.910> do<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.510> can<00:02:42.660> pull<00:02:42.900> the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
what you can do is you can pull the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.360 
what you can do is you can pull the
vacuum<00:02:43.440> line<00:02:43.650> off<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:44.040> here

vacuum line off of here

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.790 
vacuum line off of here
and<00:02:44.660> then<00:02:45.660> tap<00:02:45.930> into<00:02:46.350> one<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.650> other

and then tap into one of the other

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.970 
and then tap into one of the other
vacuum<00:02:47.220> lines<00:02:47.459> back<00:02:47.790> there<00:02:48.530> there<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.740> good

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
vacuum lines back there there is a good

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.380 
vacuum lines back there there is a good
one<00:02:50.130> right<00:02:50.310> there<00:02:50.370> that's<00:02:50.850> not<00:02:51.030> even<00:02:51.240> being

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
one right there that's not even being

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.020 
one right there that's not even being
used<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:52.100> with<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.220> engine<00:02:53.489> running<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.910> can

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
used and with the engine running you can

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.600 
used and with the engine running you can
apply<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.630> vacuum<00:02:55.080> hose<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.620> valve<00:02:55.800> real

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
apply that vacuum hose to the valve real

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.390 
apply that vacuum hose to the valve real
quick<00:02:57.020> it<00:02:58.020> will<00:02:58.140> cause<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.560> valve<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.070> go<00:02:59.190> up

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
quick it will cause that valve to go up

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.610 
quick it will cause that valve to go up
and<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.390> should<00:03:00.570> hear<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> change<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
and you should hear a change in the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.800 
and you should hear a change in the
engine<00:03:01.890> idle<00:03:02.040> speed<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:03.420> will<00:03:03.540> let<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.780> know

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
engine idle speed that will let you know

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.470 
engine idle speed that will let you know
if<00:03:04.050> that<00:03:04.140> EGR<00:03:04.530> valve<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:05.100> functioning<00:03:05.970> or<00:03:06.090> not

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
if that EGR valve is functioning or not

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.210 
if that EGR valve is functioning or not
and<00:03:07.280> speaking<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.370> vacuum<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:10.530> could<00:03:10.830> also<00:03:11.010> be

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
and speaking of vacuum it could also be

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.150 
and speaking of vacuum it could also be
plain<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.000> simple<00:03:12.330> an<00:03:13.080> old<00:03:13.290> fashioned<00:03:13.709> vacuum

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
plain and simple an old fashioned vacuum

vacuum lines here tend to dry out and

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.289 
vacuum lines here tend to dry out and
they<00:03:21.720> will<00:03:21.900> crack<00:03:23.030> especially<00:03:24.030> if<00:03:24.180> you're

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
they will crack especially if you're

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.699 
they will crack especially if you're
working<00:03:24.480> on<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.110> go<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.290> move<00:03:25.560> it

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
working on it and you go to move it

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:33.940 
working on it and you go to move it
around<00:03:28.580> that<00:03:29.580> happened<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.239> me<00:03:31.790> right<00:03:32.790> there

around that happened to me right there
you<00:03:34.950> can<00:03:35.100> see<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.340> splice<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.030> two<00:03:36.150> hoses

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
you can see I splice the two hoses

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.259 
you can see I splice the two hoses
together<00:03:36.989> with<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.489> piece<00:03:38.489> of<00:03:38.549> wiper<00:03:38.970> hose

have this rig I just have a piece of

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.150 
have this rig I just have a piece of

vacuum<00:03:53.430> line<00:03:53.790> right<00:03:54.090> there<00:03:54.299> because<00:03:54.660> these

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
vacuum line right there because these

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.530 
vacuum line right there because these
lines<00:03:55.290> they<00:03:55.590> get<00:03:55.769> really<00:03:56.130> brittle<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:57.330> are

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
lines they get really brittle and are

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.020 
lines they get really brittle and are
easy<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.890> crack<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.489> you<00:03:59.610> get<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.760> vacuum

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
easy to the crack and you get a vacuum

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.890 
easy to the crack and you get a vacuum
leak<00:04:00.450> or<00:04:01.160> whatever<00:04:02.160> sensor<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.760> feeds<00:04:03.120> loses

you can take this vacuum source off and

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.960 
you can take this vacuum source off and
also<00:04:22.680> listen<00:04:23.010> for<00:04:23.039> a<00:04:23.250> change<00:04:23.580> in<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.849> engine

poked in the right place that they're

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.250 
poked in the right place that they're
not<00:04:30.120> cracked<00:04:31.730> and<00:04:33.650> check<00:04:34.650> your<00:04:34.800> EGR<00:04:35.100> valve<00:04:35.520> as

well as the idle air control valve and
if<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:40.890> do<00:04:41.070> those<00:04:41.250> things<00:04:42.140> more<00:04:43.140> than<00:04:43.320> likely

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
if you do those things more than likely

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.740 
if you do those things more than likely
you<00:04:44.250> will<00:04:44.370> have<00:04:44.430> gotten<00:04:44.880> to<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.180> source<00:04:45.540> of

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
you will have gotten to the source of

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.000 
you will have gotten to the source of
your<00:04:45.840> problem<00:04:46.050> it<00:04:46.380> will<00:04:46.470> take<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.650> little<00:04:46.920> bit

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
your problem it will take a little bit

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.950 
your problem it will take a little bit
of<00:04:47.100> time<00:04:47.280> especially<00:04:47.610> what<00:04:48.450> I<00:04:48.480> would<00:04:48.660> do<00:04:48.750> is<00:04:48.870> I

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
of time especially what I would do is I

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.540 
of time especially what I would do is I
would<00:04:48.990> start<00:04:49.350> with<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.620> vacuum<00:04:49.980> lines<00:04:50.190> first

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
would start with the vacuum lines first

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.280 
would start with the vacuum lines first
because<00:04:50.790> that's<00:04:50.880> basically<00:04:51.390> free<00:04:51.780> if<00:04:52.170> you

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
because that's basically free if you

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.380 
because that's basically free if you
find<00:04:52.500> out<00:04:52.680> that<00:04:52.830> this<00:04:52.950> vacuum<00:04:53.400> leak<00:04:53.610> you<00:04:54.240> just

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
find out that this vacuum leak you just

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.080 
find out that this vacuum leak you just
buy<00:04:54.540> yourself<00:04:54.690> a<00:04:55.020> cheap<00:04:55.280> length<00:04:56.280> of<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.520> washer

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
buy yourself a cheap length of a washer

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.580 
buy yourself a cheap length of a washer
hose<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.570> fix<00:04:57.780> it<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:57.990> you're<00:04:58.110> done

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
hose and fix it and you're done

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.530 
hose and fix it and you're done
I<00:04:58.620> would<00:04:59.430> do<00:04:59.520> that<00:04:59.760> before<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.150> would<00:05:00.270> invest

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
I would do that before I would invest

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.370 
I would do that before I would invest
any<00:05:00.810> money<00:05:01.020> in<00:05:01.170> a<00:05:01.290> iock<00:05:01.920> valve<00:05:02.220> or<00:05:03.380> anything

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
any money in a iock valve or anything

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.480 
any money in a iock valve or anything
like<00:05:04.740> that<00:05:04.770> because<00:05:05.040> they<00:05:05.220> are<00:05:05.250> about

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
like that because they are about

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.550 
like that because they are about
seventy-five<00:05:06.150> dollars<00:05:06.390> at<00:05:06.840> least<00:05:06.870> in<00:05:07.200> my<00:05:07.350> area

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
seventy-five dollars at least in my area

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.190 
seventy-five dollars at least in my area
they<00:05:07.830> are<00:05:07.860> so<00:05:08.760> just<00:05:08.940> kind<00:05:09.120> of<00:05:09.150> start<00:05:09.450> simple

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
they are so just kind of start simple

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.860 
they are so just kind of start simple
and<00:05:10.440> work<00:05:11.310> your<00:05:11.490> way<00:05:11.610> up<00:05:11.640> toward<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.360> more

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
and work your way up toward the more

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.200 
and work your way up toward the more
expensive<00:05:13.200> parts<00:05:13.830> but<00:05:14.520> they're<00:05:14.670> very<00:05:14.790> easy<00:05:15.060> to

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
expensive parts but they're very easy to

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.970 
expensive parts but they're very easy to
check<00:05:15.420> just<00:05:15.480> take<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:15.960> connector<00:05:16.230> off<00:05:16.560> look
