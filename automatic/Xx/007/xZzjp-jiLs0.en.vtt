00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
even better if you can actually get the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.249 
even better if you can actually get the
thing<00:00:21.470> to<00:00:21.800> stop<00:00:22.040> rattling<00:00:22.960> but<00:00:23.960> the<00:00:24.050> low<00:00:24.200> you

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259

idea is to get it sound like a piano and
not<00:00:28.550> really<00:00:28.880> to<00:00:29.000> play<00:00:29.210> it<00:00:29.330> like<00:00:29.359> a<00:00:29.480> six<00:00:29.810> string

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
not really to play it like a six string

normal<00:00:31.279> tuning<00:00:31.760> for<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:31.910> 12<00:00:32.180> string<00:00:32.330> means<00:00:33.140> the

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
normal tuning for a 12 string means the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.280 
normal tuning for a 12 string means the
top<00:00:33.470> two<00:00:33.620> strings<00:00:33.680> are<00:00:34.070> in<00:00:34.160> unison<00:00:35.019> the<00:00:36.019> next

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
top two strings are in unison the next

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.130 
top two strings are in unison the next
two<00:00:36.470> three<00:00:37.460> innocent<00:00:37.760> and<00:00:38.150> everything<00:00:39.019> else

two three innocent and everything else

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.750

is<00:00:39.350> optics

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.790 

and<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.910> other<00:00:47.030> is<00:00:47.390> is<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:47.930> get<00:00:48.110> two<00:00:48.500> strings

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
and the other is is to get two strings

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.060 
and the other is is to get two strings
to<00:00:49.040> sound<00:00:49.280> as<00:00:49.430> one<00:00:49.610> not<00:00:50.000> like<00:00:50.239> this<00:00:50.950> but<00:00:51.950> like

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
to sound as one not like this but like

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:02.349 
to sound as one not like this but like
this<00:00:53.949> when<00:00:54.949> you<00:00:55.070> pick<00:00:55.309> it

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.429 

try<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.480> get<00:01:03.600> both<00:01:03.749> of<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.019> strings<00:01:04.320> that

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
try and get both of the strings that

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.700 
try and get both of the strings that
you're<00:01:04.589> playing<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.040> sound<00:01:05.280> as<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:06.710> never

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
who I return and a half or even

who I return and a half or even
sometimes<00:01:12.479> two<00:01:12.750> times<00:01:13.080> down<00:01:13.409> from<00:01:13.740> concert<00:01:14.250> so

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
sometimes two times down from concert so

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.820 
sometimes two times down from concert so
they're<00:01:15.299> quite<00:01:15.450> low<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> big<00:01:16.590> meaty

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
they're quite low I like the big meaty

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.620 
they're quite low I like the big meaty
sound<00:01:17.310> they<00:01:17.490> give<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> bass<00:01:18.270> strings

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
sound they give you on the bass strings

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.940 
sound they give you on the bass strings
and<00:01:18.840> quite<00:01:19.799> often<00:01:20.039> I<00:01:21.000> don't<00:01:21.420> really<00:01:22.049> use<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.920> E

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and quite often I don't really use the E

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.180 
and quite often I don't really use the E
string<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.490> lot<00:01:23.640> what<00:01:23.789> I<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.509> drop<00:01:24.780> it

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
and he ought to you

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.539 
and he ought to you
so<00:01:35.659> I<00:01:35.690> can<00:01:35.930> play<00:01:36.110> these<00:01:36.350> shapes<00:01:36.680> with<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.250> root

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
so I can play these shapes with a root

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.250 
so I can play these shapes with a root
of<00:01:37.729> D<00:01:37.909> on<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.180> base<00:01:38.330> so<00:01:38.690> I'm<00:01:38.750> getting<00:01:38.930> a<00:01:39.080> nice

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
of D on the base so I'm getting a nice

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.910 
of D on the base so I'm getting a nice
big<00:01:39.710> fat<00:01:40.070> sound<00:01:40.490> on<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.820> bottom<00:01:41.090> end<00:01:44.920> just
