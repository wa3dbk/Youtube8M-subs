00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
stuff here directly at computex for

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.790 
stuff here directly at computex for
example<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.370> V<00:00:34.660> 2120<00:00:35.660> it's<00:00:36.140> a<00:00:36.230> new<00:00:36.410> v<00:00:36.559> series

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800

where<00:00:58.399> the<00:00:58.550> USB<00:00:58.879> 3<00:00:59.260> okay<00:01:00.260> moving<00:01:00.559> on<00:01:00.739> then<00:01:00.949> to

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
where the USB 3 okay moving on then to

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.169 
where the USB 3 okay moving on then to
the<00:01:01.160> next<00:01:01.399> case<00:01:01.579> we've<00:01:01.820> got<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.750> v10<00:01:03.230> 22b<00:01:04.179> 1020

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:05.179 
the next case we've got the v10 22b 1020

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:09.279 
the next case we've got the v10 22b 1020
so<00:01:05.509> little<00:01:06.320> brother<00:01:06.860> after<00:01:07.929> 2120<00:01:08.929> so<00:01:09.170> it's

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
so little brother after 2120 so it's

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.350 
so little brother after 2120 so it's
also<00:01:09.410> coming<00:01:09.740> out<00:01:09.860> now<00:01:10.520> as<00:01:10.580> you<00:01:10.670> can<00:01:10.880> see<00:01:10.940> also

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
also coming out now as you can see also

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.200 
also coming out now as you can see also
the<00:01:11.539> new<00:01:11.660> to<00:01:11.869> less<00:01:12.190> features<00:01:13.190> integrated<00:01:13.610> and

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
the new to less features integrated and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.270 
the new to less features integrated and
the<00:01:14.539> two<00:01:15.110> nights<00:01:15.319> handle<00:01:15.619> on<00:01:15.740> top<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:16.160> can

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
the two nights handle on top so you can

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.210 
the two nights handle on top so you can
move<00:01:17.179> it<00:01:17.330> easily<00:01:17.450> around<00:01:17.959> a<00:01:18.170> very<00:01:19.009> fetching

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
move it easily around a very fetching

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.749 
move it easily around a very fetching
color<00:01:19.550> as<00:01:19.670> well<00:01:20.319> we've<00:01:21.319> also<00:01:21.500> got<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:22.190> new

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
color as well we've also got a new

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.770 
color as well we've also got a new
variant<00:01:23.119> on<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.509> q<00:01:24.020> 11<00:01:24.349> yes<00:01:25.009> mini-itx<00:01:25.660> we<00:01:26.660> have

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
variant on the q 11 yes mini-itx we have

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.020 
variant on the q 11 yes mini-itx we have
news<00:01:27.020> here<00:01:27.200> is<00:01:27.319> a<00:01:27.349> QE<00:01:27.770> 11<00:01:28.160> basically<00:01:28.789> a<00:01:28.819> little

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
news here is a QE 11 basically a little

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.900 
news here is a QE 11 basically a little
bit<00:01:29.149> taller<00:01:29.179> than<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.840> Q<00:01:30.080> 07<00:01:30.890> allowing<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:31.729> to

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
bit taller than the Q 07 allowing you to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.790 
bit taller than the Q 07 allowing you to
put<00:01:32.060> some<00:01:32.209> graphic<00:01:32.509> cards<00:01:32.750> in<00:01:32.869> there<00:01:33.080> also

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
put some graphic cards in there also

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.960 
put some graphic cards in there also
interesting<00:01:34.190> is<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.369> new<00:01:35.179> pearl<00:01:35.539> white<00:01:36.229> color

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
interesting is a new pearl white color

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.309 
interesting is a new pearl white color
and<00:01:37.970> if<00:01:38.149> we<00:01:38.330> have<00:01:38.569> a<00:01:38.599> sneaky<00:01:38.899> peek<00:01:39.050> over<00:01:39.200> the

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
and if we have a sneaky peek over the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.949 
and if we have a sneaky peek over the
top<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.590> this<00:01:39.890> monitor<00:01:40.580> here<00:01:40.610> there's<00:01:41.239> another

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
top of this monitor here there's another

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.870 
top of this monitor here there's another
addition<00:01:42.349> to<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.590> q<00:01:42.800> series<00:01:43.280> which<00:01:43.429> is<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.670> q

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
addition to the q series which is the q

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.880 
addition to the q series which is the q
09<00:01:44.360> yes<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.470> q<00:01:45.679> 09<00:01:46.009> small<00:01:46.729> they<00:01:46.880> had<00:01:47.000> some<00:01:47.179> visa

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
09 yes the q 09 small they had some visa

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.309 
09 yes the q 09 small they had some visa
mounting<00:01:48.890> point<00:01:49.840> mounting<00:01:50.840> brackets<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:51.259> you

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
mounting point mounting brackets so you

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.639 
mounting point mounting brackets so you
can<00:01:51.560> mount<00:01:52.369> it<00:01:52.580> behind<00:01:52.940> your<00:01:53.060> monitor<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:54.590> you

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
can mount it behind your monitor so you

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.070 
can mount it behind your monitor so you
have<00:01:54.830> a<00:01:54.890> nice<00:01:55.819> little<00:01:56.000> system<00:01:56.539> you<00:01:56.869> can

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
have a nice little system you can

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.169 
have a nice little system you can
integrate<00:01:57.379> easily<00:01:57.770> that's<00:01:58.580> it's<00:01:58.819> a<00:01:58.849> decent

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
integrate easily that's it's a decent

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.790 
integrate easily that's it's a decent
size<00:01:59.209> of<00:01:59.509> case<00:01:59.720> so<00:01:59.929> you<00:02:00.020> can<00:02:00.140> put<00:02:00.289> quite<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.590> bit

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
size of case so you can put quite a bit

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.639 
size of case so you can put quite a bit
in<00:02:00.830> there<00:02:00.979> in<00:02:01.129> a<00:02:01.190> mini<00:02:01.340> ITX<00:02:01.670> case<00:02:01.989> exactly<00:02:02.989> can

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
in there in a mini ITX case exactly can

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.660 
in there in a mini ITX case exactly can
make<00:02:04.039> a<00:02:04.069> nice<00:02:04.280> mini<00:02:04.489> ITX<00:02:04.759> system<00:02:05.119> yeah

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
make a nice mini ITX system yeah

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.719 
make a nice mini ITX system yeah
ok<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.509> moving<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.350> way<00:02:07.590> we've<00:02:07.799> got<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.190> part

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
ok so moving this way we've got a part

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.309 
ok so moving this way we've got a part
