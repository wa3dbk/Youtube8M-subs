00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 in the triangle farm the municipality of 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.549
 steps in mines general 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.859
 a rural producer bet on some 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.050
 techniques of dairy cattle management that 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.240
 are giving good results 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.040
 the animals of the soloing breed are 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.139
 created in a combination between the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.230
 modern confinement system free 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.380
 stall and pasture irrigated by summer 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.820
 girl is very tall not even there for the dispensation 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.369
 the silage the course 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.630
 It's just rationing and of course your 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.090
 the silage does not enter the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.920
 daily care routine starts from 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.059
 the first moments of life of the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.640
 animals 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.550
 let's make mistakes and come here 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.360
 to say normal money put 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.160
 two days two liters in the morning and two in the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.829
 late up to 60 days two liters 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.250
 after the last ten days there you have 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.609
 a book just right there right 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.890
 the reason from the Dico inácio already has 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.920
 reason 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.430
 then thereafter discharging so with 70 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.189
 80 kilograms 70 days after delivery and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.770
 that separate ration in ii their ration and 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.990
 silage when they are confined 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.970
 animals complement the feeding with 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.310
 silage and cottonseed 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.040
 but the main source of energy comes from 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.320
 grassland is one of the secrets of 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.509
 productivity a large area of 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.689
 property was divided into 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.490
 According to the number of animals here 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.470
 our planted area of ​​the eight states 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.810
 divided into four modules 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:47.159
 Each module is 26 small and is a 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.470
 picket for each day 44 cows né 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.020
 the cap is monitored during all 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.750
 seasons of the year in winter the forage 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.360
 Mombasa shares space with two other 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.969
 species that help protect the soil and 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.920
 offers a good part of the food 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:07.229
 milk cows we have the vein 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.470
 She is a little deviant, right? 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.410
 is that we have the ryegrass it is a 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.800
 way a bit bright 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:21.370
 and in this one is the mombaça the grass more of 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.349
 summer was however it also produces 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.750
 a little in winter 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.000
 the step is composed of the forage 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.850
 mombaça all year round the farm 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.390
 winter plantation in which 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.910
 uses oats and ryegrass to irrigate 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.330
 step is carried out by means of a 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.000
 central pivot the 18 hectares that make up 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:47.380
 the pasture are divided into four modules 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.470
 and each module subdivided into 26 pickets 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.350
 the cycle of the grass is of 26 days the soil 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.380
 receives chemical fertilization and also 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:00.190
 organic matter to manure is collected there 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:05.019
 in the sheds and played every time the cattle 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.940
 leaves like pasture as the picket is more 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.170
 or less equal to that of the biochemist 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.930
 every time I eat the grass is thrown the fertilizer 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:22.540
 organic is about 600 to go by 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:24.910
 small bill and 800 square meters 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.790
 irrigation of the grass is strictly 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.090
 controlled in dry season it is 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:36.579
 made more than once a day and time 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:40.720
 always at nine-thirty at night leagues 96 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:45.280
 up to six in the morning because the price has 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.780
 70% discount night and night leads to 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.060
 advantage of vaporization being lower 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:57.069
 better use it to take a walk 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.350
 of 7 hours and a half and plays the is 4 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.329
 millimeters to make it easier for 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.630
 animals to pickets, the producer also 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:08.350
 invested in paving the tracks in 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.440
 several places I went that they all 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.790
 time of the year they have to reset land 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.250
 gravel 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.310
 as here my land has no land and 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.000
 nor gravel we opted for paving 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.690
 I did not have a helmet problem working 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.060
 very well 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.880
 mechanical milking is done twice 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.400
 according to the producer the investment 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.030
 the cost of production and was worth 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.060
 feather 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.090
 it was worth it because then you're done 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.480
 decreasing costs né 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.280
 rotate the pickets and 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.160
 silage in the body 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:50.280
 this reduces costs is in the 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.280
 moment is 78 cents per liter 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 huh
