three dimensional wine bottle that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.880 
three dimensional wine bottle that
requires<00:00:23.130> me<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.880> use<00:00:24.240> an<00:00:24.449> 8<00:00:24.660> millimeter<00:00:25.340> ml

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.220 
sort of thing
and<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.870> need<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:41.030> have<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> depth<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.570> cut<00:00:42.809> up<00:00:42.989> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
and I need to have a depth of cut up to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.110 
and I need to have a depth of cut up to
40<00:00:43.739> millimeters<00:00:45.710> unfortunately<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:47.340> quite

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
40 millimeters unfortunately it's quite

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.910 
40 millimeters unfortunately it's quite

and<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.730> only<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.329> cutting<00:00:51.800> face<00:00:52.800> here

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
and not only that the cutting face here

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.430 
and not only that the cutting face here
is<00:00:53.780> is<00:00:54.780> only<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.410> 12<00:00:56.309> millimeters<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.989> not

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
is is only about 12 millimeters and not

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.349 
is is only about 12 millimeters and not
only<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:59.370> addition<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.059> should<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
only that in addition to that should I

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.660 
only that in addition to that should I
say<00:01:00.620> although<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.890> eight<00:01:02.039> millimeters

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
say although this is eight millimeters

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.170 
say although this is eight millimeters
here<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.870> nine<00:01:04.229> millimeters<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
here this is nine millimeters here so

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.500 
here this is nine millimeters here so
the<00:01:06.810> cutting<00:01:07.080> face<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.979> actually<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.850> smaller

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the cutting face is actually a smaller

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.440 
the cutting face is actually a smaller
diameter<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.320> what<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> shank<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.119> can't

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
diameter to what the shank is so I can't

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.609 
diameter to what the shank is so I can't
even<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:13.560> hang<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.220> up<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.619> have

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
even just hang on to it up here and have

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.679 
even just hang on to it up here and have
it<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.009> protrude<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.180> still<00:01:18.450> wouldn't

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
it to protrude in it it still wouldn't

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.730 
it to protrude in it it still wouldn't
make<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> distance<00:01:19.320> anyway<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:21.470> don't<00:01:22.470> have

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
make the distance anyway so I don't have

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.630 
make the distance anyway so I don't have
an<00:01:22.950> extended<00:01:23.520> 8<00:01:23.700> millimeter<00:01:24.590> end<00:01:25.590> mills<00:01:26.159> so

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
an extended 8 millimeter end mills so

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.280 
an extended 8 millimeter end mills so
we're<00:01:27.060> going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> make<00:01:27.689> one<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:31.020> make

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
we're going to make one and we do make

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.289 
we're going to make one and we do make
one<00:01:31.350> other<00:01:31.920> firm

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
one other firm

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.399 
one other firm
an<00:01:34.229> old<00:01:34.469> steel<00:01:35.179> cutting<00:01:36.179> drill<00:01:36.869> there<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
an old steel cutting drill there is a

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.130 
an old steel cutting drill there is a
difference<00:01:37.890> between<00:01:37.979> steel<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.729> wood<00:01:39.079> if<00:01:40.079> you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
difference between steel and wood if you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.289 
difference between steel and wood if you
notice<00:01:40.710> here<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:42.409> swirls<00:01:43.409> around<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.909> drill

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
notice here the swirls around this drill

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.340 
notice here the swirls around this drill
which<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> metal<00:01:46.289> cutting<00:01:46.469> drill<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.270> much

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
which is a metal cutting drill is much

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.429 
which is a metal cutting drill is much
should<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.439> say<00:01:49.679> finer<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> wood

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
should we say finer and this is a wood

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.559 
should we say finer and this is a wood
cutting<00:01:52.890> drill<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.810> swirls<00:01:55.140> are<00:01:55.469> much

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
cutting drill and the swirls are much

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:03.469 
cutting drill and the swirls are much
should<00:01:57.569> we<00:01:57.659> say<00:01:59.060> wider<00:02:00.319> so<00:02:01.319> this<00:02:02.189> drill<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
should we say wider so this drill is a

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.249 
should we say wider so this drill is a
tougher<00:02:04.380> drill<00:02:04.709> than<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.229> so<00:02:07.229> I

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
tougher drill than what this one is so I

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.650 
tougher drill than what this one is so I
can<00:02:07.530> put<00:02:07.679> more<00:02:07.890> sideways<00:02:08.759> load<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.420> this

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
can put more sideways load on this

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.569 
can put more sideways load on this
obviously<00:02:10.649> these<00:02:11.160> are<00:02:11.340> not<00:02:11.610> really<00:02:12.000> meant<00:02:12.420> for

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
obviously these are not really meant for

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.030 
obviously these are not really meant for
sideways<00:02:14.579> cuts<00:02:15.030> you're<00:02:15.269> supposed<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.630> use

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
sideways cuts you're supposed to use

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.569 
sideways cuts you're supposed to use
slop<00:02:17.040> drills<00:02:17.400> or<00:02:17.730> n<00:02:18.150> Mills<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.280> what<00:02:20.459> I'm

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
slop drills or n Mills but so what I'm

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.809 
slop drills or n Mills but so what I'm
going<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.819> do<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:22.310> I'm<00:02:23.310> going<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.519> cut<00:02:23.700> this

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
going to do is I'm going to cut this

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.960 
going to do is I'm going to cut this
drill<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.299> half<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.950> I'm<00:02:26.310> going<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.640> have<00:02:26.819> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
drill in half so I'm going to have the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.440 
drill in half so I'm going to have the
whole<00:02:27.150> shank<00:02:27.780> up<00:02:28.110> into<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.890> chuck<00:02:29.329> but<00:02:30.329> I'm

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
whole shank up into the chuck but I'm

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.130 
whole shank up into the chuck but I'm
going<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.660> have<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.260> 45<00:02:32.010> mil<00:02:32.959> protruding<00:02:33.959> out

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
going to have a 45 mil protruding out

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.229 
going to have a 45 mil protruding out
and<00:02:35.780> it's<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.930> much<00:02:37.110> better<00:02:37.410> type<00:02:37.859> drill<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.970> be

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
and it's a much better type drill to be

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.539 
and it's a much better type drill to be
able<00:02:39.329> to<00:02:39.510> do<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:39.930> with<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.130> are<00:02:41.280> only

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
able to do this with and we are only

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.990 
able to do this with and we are only
cutting<00:02:41.850> wood<00:02:42.180> after<00:02:42.389> all<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.700> I'll<00:02:44.700> show<00:02:44.940> you

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
cutting wood after all so I'll show you

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.449 
cutting wood after all so I'll show you
how<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.239> do<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.709> so<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.829> smacked<00:02:47.069> off<00:02:47.250> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
how to do that so it smacked off the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.400 
how to do that so it smacked off the
length<00:02:47.639> where<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:47.910> want<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.299> cut<00:02:48.569> so<00:02:49.079> now<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.260> got

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
length where I want to cut so now I got

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.569 
length where I want to cut so now I got
to<00:02:49.500> do<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:50.100> striker<00:02:50.609> cut<00:02:50.819> as<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:55.579> okay

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
to do it the striker cut as I can okay

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.879 
to do it the striker cut as I can okay
you'll<00:02:56.760> notice<00:02:57.209> now<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.810> it's<00:02:57.989> cut<00:02:58.769> off

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
you'll notice now that it's cut off

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.059 
you'll notice now that it's cut off
pretty<00:02:59.220> pretty<00:02:59.910> square<00:03:00.450> there<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:01.680> now<00:03:01.859> what<00:03:02.040> I

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
pretty pretty square there so now what I

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.780 
pretty pretty square there so now what I
have<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.459> do<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.940> relieve<00:03:03.389> the<00:03:03.660> back<00:03:03.900> edge<00:03:04.200> of

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
have to do is relieve the back edge of

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.309 
have to do is relieve the back edge of
the<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.060> cutting<00:03:06.269> surface<00:03:06.599> in<00:03:06.989> other<00:03:07.079> words

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
the the cutting surface in other words

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.370 
the the cutting surface in other words
just<00:03:08.040> take<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.400> down<00:03:08.579> a<00:03:08.639> little<00:03:08.819> bit<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.389> this

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
just take it down a little bit so this

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.110 
just take it down a little bit so this
part<00:03:10.739> or<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.430> edge<00:03:11.670> here<00:03:13.549> actually<00:03:14.549> does<00:03:14.910> the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
part or this edge here actually does the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.670 
part or this edge here actually does the
cut<00:03:15.329> in<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:16.709> back<00:03:17.160> edge<00:03:17.430> here<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.680> free

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
cut in and this back edge here is free

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:34.130 
cut in and this back edge here is free
from<00:03:19.919> the<00:03:20.130> material<00:03:20.250> so

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.650 

okay<00:03:34.830> that's<00:03:35.040> one<00:03:35.280> side<00:03:35.580> done<00:03:35.970> what<00:03:36.570> I'm

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
okay that's one side done what I'm

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.070 
okay that's one side done what I'm
trying<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:36.990> do<00:03:37.200> here<00:03:37.620> is<00:03:37.850> if<00:03:38.850> you<00:03:38.970> notice<00:03:39.180> this

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
trying to do here is if you notice this

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.730 
trying to do here is if you notice this
area<00:03:40.530> here<00:03:40.800> this<00:03:40.980> back<00:03:41.280> edge<00:03:41.550> is<00:03:42.320> lower<00:03:43.320> than

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
area here this back edge is lower than

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.320 
area here this back edge is lower than
what<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.010> front<00:03:44.280> edge<00:03:44.460> is<00:03:44.700> there<00:03:44.910> that's<00:03:45.150> the

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
what the front edge is there that's the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.870 
what the front edge is there that's the
cutting<00:03:45.660> edge<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.280> this<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.490> trailing

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
cutting edge and this is the trailing

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.840 
cutting edge and this is the trailing
edge<00:03:48.210> so<00:03:48.600> this<00:03:49.260> surface<00:03:49.800> here<00:03:50.070> and<00:03:50.370> all<00:03:50.700> the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
edge so this surface here and all the

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.380 
edge so this surface here and all the
way<00:03:50.940> across<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.680> center<00:03:52.920> is<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:54.060> actual

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
way across to the center is the actual

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.370 
way across to the center is the actual
cutting<00:03:54.900> edge<00:03:56.570> so<00:03:57.570> now<00:03:57.750> all<00:03:57.930> I'm<00:03:58.080> going<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.230> do

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
cutting edge so now all I'm going to do

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.370 
cutting edge so now all I'm going to do
is<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.650> same<00:03:58.860> on<00:03:59.460> the<00:03:59.640> other<00:03:59.820> side<00:04:00.110> okay<00:04:01.110> so<00:04:01.140> if

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
is the same on the other side okay so if

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.460 
is the same on the other side okay so if
you<00:04:01.500> don't<00:04:01.709> have<00:04:02.100> an<00:04:02.930> end<00:04:03.930> mill<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.350> right

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
you don't have an end mill the right

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.510 
you don't have an end mill the right
size<00:04:04.860> you<00:04:04.890> can<00:04:05.430> get<00:04:05.730> into<00:04:06.030> trouble<00:04:07.490> by<00:04:08.490> making

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
size you can get into trouble by making

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.990 
size you can get into trouble by making
one<00:04:09.180> yourself<00:04:11.330> out<00:04:12.330> of<00:04:12.390> a<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:13.170> good<00:04:14.130> fairly<00:04:14.790> good

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
one yourself out of a a good fairly good

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.820 
one yourself out of a a good fairly good
metal<00:04:15.420> drill<00:04:15.690> with<00:04:17.239> narrow<00:04:19.519> flutes<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:21.390> um<00:04:21.830> but

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
metal drill with narrow flutes so um but

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.760 
metal drill with narrow flutes so um but
obviously<00:04:23.400> can't<00:04:23.669> do<00:04:23.820> it<00:04:23.910> very<00:04:24.030> long<00:04:24.770> because

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
obviously can't do it very long because

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.740 
obviously can't do it very long because
otherwise<00:04:26.370> it'll<00:04:26.669> flex<00:04:27.030> all<00:04:27.300> over<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.570> place

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
otherwise it'll flex all over the place

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.670 
otherwise it'll flex all over the place
in<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.020> you<00:04:28.830> can't<00:04:29.220> cut<00:04:29.669> it<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:29.970> same<00:04:30.680> cutting

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
in you you can't cut it the same cutting

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.030 
in you you can't cut it the same cutting
speed<00:04:32.190> as<00:04:32.480> you<00:04:33.480> can<00:04:33.750> with<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.169> with<00:04:34.350> a<00:04:34.380> you<00:04:34.919> know
