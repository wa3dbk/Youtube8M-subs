have to make sure you have a good

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.500 
have to make sure you have a good
installation<00:00:29.099> which<00:00:29.340> if<00:00:29.789> you've<00:00:30.060> just<00:00:30.240> run

installation which if you've just run

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.730 
installation which if you've just run
out<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.689> water<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> pump<00:00:31.560> has<00:00:31.710> been

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
out of water and the pump has been

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.010 
out of water and the pump has been
working<00:00:32.099> fine<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> past<00:00:33.120> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
working fine in the past the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.660 
working fine in the past the
installation<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.829> very<00:00:35.219> well<00:00:35.399> could<00:00:35.460> be

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
installation that very well could be

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.780 
installation that very well could be
okay<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:37.620> important<00:00:38.100> thing<00:00:38.219> about<00:00:38.250> priming

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
okay the important thing about priming

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.819 
okay the important thing about priming
to<00:00:39.030> mach-5<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.719> remember<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
to mach-5 is remember that this is a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.580 
to mach-5 is remember that this is a
high<00:00:41.129> flow<00:00:41.460> rate<00:00:41.730> pump<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.870> if<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.290> some

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
high flow rate pump and if you have some

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.410 
high flow rate pump and if you have some
air<00:00:43.800> caught<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.579> need<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> high<00:00:45.090> flow

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
air caught in it you need a high flow

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.650 
air caught in it you need a high flow
rate<00:00:45.719> even<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.890> few<00:00:47.070> seconds

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
rate even if it's for just a few seconds

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.340 
rate even if it's for just a few seconds
to<00:00:48.660> allow<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.620> pump<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.309> eject<00:00:50.730> air<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.170> this

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
to allow the pump to eject air so this

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.760 
to allow the pump to eject air so this
is<00:00:52.500> accomplished<00:00:53.160> by<00:00:53.989> if<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.170> pump<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.620> on

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
is accomplished by if the pump is on

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.170 
is accomplished by if the pump is on
turn<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.610> off

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
turn it off

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.810 
turn it off
this<00:00:58.050> pump<00:00:58.379> has<00:00:58.500> already<00:00:58.920> turned<00:00:59.190> off<00:00:59.399> after

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
this pump has already turned off after

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.070 
this pump has already turned off after
you<00:00:59.879> turn<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.270> pump<00:01:00.510> off<00:01:01.160> you<00:01:02.160> open<00:01:02.690> at<00:01:03.690> least

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you turn the pump off you open at least

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.560 
you turn the pump off you open at least
two<00:01:04.409> or<00:01:04.559> three<00:01:04.619> faucets<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> boat<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.299> let

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
two or three faucets on the boat and let

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.530 
two or three faucets on the boat and let
the<00:01:06.750> pressure<00:01:07.040> go<00:01:08.040> away<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:09.060> let<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.420> run

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the pressure go away just let it run

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.149 
the pressure go away just let it run
until<00:01:09.600> there's<00:01:09.990> no<00:01:10.140> pressure<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.650> system

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
until there's no pressure on the system

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.950 
until there's no pressure on the system
until<00:01:11.520> your<00:01:11.700> gain<00:01:12.090> says<00:01:12.650> zero<00:01:14.600> when<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.720> turn

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
until your gain says zero when you turn

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.270 
until your gain says zero when you turn
on<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> pump<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.920> you're<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.220> to

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
on the pump like this you're going to

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.130 
on the pump like this you're going to
get<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> high<00:01:17.729> flow<00:01:18.090> rate<00:01:18.360> instantly<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.080> if

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
get a high flow rate instantly and if

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.050 
get a high flow rate instantly and if
there's<00:01:19.320> any<00:01:19.500> airport<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> pump<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.850> will

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
there's any airport in the pump it will

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.670 
there's any airport in the pump it will
eject<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.720> course<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.020> want<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> remind<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
eject it of course I want to remind you

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.020 
eject it of course I want to remind you
you<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.280> with<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> full<00:01:23.790> water

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
you have to do this with a full water

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.270 
you have to do this with a full water
tank<00:01:24.500> that's<00:01:25.500> something<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.040> I'm<00:01:26.100> always

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
tank that's something that I'm always

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.530 
tank that's something that I'm always
remembering<00:01:27.799> okay<00:01:28.799> once<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:30.299> no

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
remembering okay once you I have no

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
remembering okay once you I have no
water<00:01:30.869> pressure<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> system<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:33.560> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
water pressure in the system and the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.469 
water pressure in the system and the
tank<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.189> full<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.759> you're<00:01:35.880> ready<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.210> go

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
tank is full and you're ready to go

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.899 
tank is full and you're ready to go
basically<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.770> do<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.100> turn<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.490> pump<00:01:38.729> on

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
basically all you do is turn the pump on

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.789 
basically all you do is turn the pump on
now<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.390> pump<00:01:39.689> has<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.960> switch<00:01:40.350> underneath

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
now this pump has a switch underneath

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:49.070 
now this pump has a switch underneath
here<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.070> I'm<00:01:41.310> going<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.549> turn<00:01:42.329> on

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.130 

it<00:01:50.080> goes<00:01:50.350> wide<00:01:51.100> open

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.710 

the<00:01:55.140> air<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.000> country<00:01:59.420> now<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.540> don't

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
the air of the country now you don't

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.660 
the air of the country now you don't
have<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.960> let<00:02:01.229> her<00:02:01.350> hunt<00:02:01.590> for<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.860> long<00:02:02.040> time<00:02:02.399> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
have to let her hunt for a long time and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.399 
have to let her hunt for a long time and
usually<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> amount<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.659> time<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.080> takes<00:02:04.229> you

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
usually the amount of time it takes you

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.779 
usually the amount of time it takes you
to<00:02:04.439> leave<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.860> pump<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.310> go<00:02:05.399> close<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
to leave the pump and go close the

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.449 
to leave the pump and go close the
faucets<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:07.110> an<00:02:07.350> adequate<00:02:07.829> amount<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.220> time

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
faucets is an adequate amount of time

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.220 
faucets is an adequate amount of time
now<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.660> normal<00:02:10.009> it's<00:02:11.009> normal<00:02:11.310> for<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.880> pump

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
now it's normal it's normal for the pump

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.530 
now it's normal it's normal for the pump
to<00:02:13.230> run<00:02:13.440> about<00:02:13.800> 15<00:02:14.340> seconds<00:02:14.880> before<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.330> turns

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
to run about 15 seconds before it turns

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.390 
to run about 15 seconds before it turns
off<00:02:15.810> what<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.170> just<00:02:16.410> turned<00:02:16.709> off<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.099> is<00:02:17.250> how

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
off what you just turned off this is how

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.150 
off what you just turned off this is how
this<00:02:17.580> pump<00:02:17.880> behaves<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:19.050> has<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.230> flow<00:02:19.590> meter<00:02:19.800> in

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
this pump behaves it has a flow meter in

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.520 
this pump behaves it has a flow meter in
it<00:02:20.310> then<00:02:20.819> when<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.120> sees<00:02:21.330> no<00:02:21.360> flow<00:02:21.870> for<00:02:22.140> 15

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
it then when it sees no flow for 15

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.400 
it then when it sees no flow for 15
seconds<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.160> turns<00:02:23.400> off<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.049> we<00:02:25.049> have<00:02:25.170> just

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
seconds it turns off so we have just

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.860 
seconds it turns off so we have just
essentially<00:02:25.860> primed<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.580> system<00:02:27.569> on<00:02:27.690> this

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
essentially primed the system on this

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.680 
essentially primed the system on this
display<00:02:28.200> here
