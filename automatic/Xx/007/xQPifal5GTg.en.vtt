00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
here I cancer is hot well it should be

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.049 
here I cancer is hot well it should be
whatever<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.340> it's<00:00:11.639> pretty<00:00:11.820> lightweight

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
whatever it is it's pretty lightweight

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.200 
whatever it is it's pretty lightweight
and<00:00:12.599> I'm<00:00:13.160> kind<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.190> concerned<00:00:14.580> about<00:00:14.759> quality

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
and I'm kind of concerned about quality

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.429 
and I'm kind of concerned about quality
of<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.680> weighs<00:00:16.680> maybe<00:00:17.190> one<00:00:17.520> ounce<00:00:17.699> but<00:00:18.320> i'll<00:00:19.320> go

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
of it weighs maybe one ounce but i'll go

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.010 
of it weighs maybe one ounce but i'll go
ahead<00:00:19.619> open<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:20.100> now<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.180> from<00:00:21.330> pop<00:00:21.720> vine

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
ahead open it now this is from pop vine

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.200 
ahead open it now this is from pop vine
so<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.590> not<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.810> genuine<00:00:24.810> Rubik's<00:00:25.470> clock

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
so this is not a genuine Rubik's clock

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.810 
so this is not a genuine Rubik's clock
in<00:00:27.210> fact<00:00:27.510> they<00:00:27.779> misspelled<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.260> word<00:00:28.320> magic

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
in fact they misspelled the word magic

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:37.940

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
letters let's see we got all these

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.510 
letters let's see we got all these
little<00:01:08.700> symbols<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.510> got<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:10.070> little<00:01:11.070> sad

onion thing um you shouldn't throw it

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.730 
onion thing um you shouldn't throw it
away<00:01:16.409> no<00:01:17.189> matter<00:01:17.400> how<00:01:17.820> bad<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.229> it<00:01:19.229> should<00:01:19.650> be

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
away no matter how bad it it should be

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.420 
away no matter how bad it it should be
pretty<00:01:19.920> good<00:01:21.200> okay<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.740> when<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> open<00:01:22.979> this

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
pretty good okay so when you open this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.289 
pretty good okay so when you open this
is<00:01:24.060> what<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:25.280> it's<00:01:26.280> basically<00:01:26.640> packaged

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
is what you see it's basically packaged

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:36.990 
is what you see it's basically packaged
to<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.930> sold<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.409> store<00:01:31.220> chinese<00:01:32.220> store

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.630 

actually<00:01:38.000> a<00:01:38.030> lot<00:01:38.150> smarter<00:01:38.450> than<00:01:38.630> I<00:01:38.750> thought

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:02:00.460 

open<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:56.950> box<00:01:57.950> melz<00:01:58.310> interesting<00:01:59.470> like

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
open this box melz interesting like

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.810 
open this box melz interesting like
scraping<00:02:00.830> i<00:02:01.509> just<00:02:02.509> read<00:02:03.380> these<00:02:04.479> okay<00:02:06.640> we<00:02:07.640> got<00:02:07.789> a

scraping i just read these okay we got a

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
scraping i just read these okay we got a
full<00:02:08.239> of<00:02:08.330> paper<00:02:08.539> size<00:02:08.869> piece<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.649> paper<00:02:10.840> with

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
writing that time goes off the page it's

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.250 
writing that time goes off the page it's
like<00:02:18.470> um<00:02:19.239> see<00:02:20.239> like<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.540> paragraph<00:02:20.959> starts

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
like um see like the paragraph starts

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.340 
like um see like the paragraph starts
right<00:02:21.530> here<00:02:21.560> but<00:02:22.340> then<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:22.580> comes<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.030> hear<00:02:23.350> so

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
right here but then it comes to hear so

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.240 
right here but then it comes to hear so
that's<00:02:24.650> poor<00:02:25.220> but<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.880> other<00:02:26.030> side<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:27.250> thing

done correctly and slate misspelled
magic<00:02:34.090> plus<00:02:35.090> I<00:02:35.269> guess<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.690> pretty<00:02:38.230> common

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
magic plus I guess is a pretty common

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.449 
magic plus I guess is a pretty common
hammer<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:41.320> know<00:02:42.320> they<00:02:42.440> actually<00:02:42.560> puzzle<00:02:43.070> is<00:02:43.160> so

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
hammer I know they actually puzzle is so

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:53.080 
hammer I know they actually puzzle is so
I<00:02:46.360> only<00:02:47.360> keep<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.600> package<00:02:48.079> is<00:02:48.230> nice<00:02:52.000> here<00:02:53.000> it

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
I only keep the package is nice here it

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.410 
I only keep the package is nice here it
is<00:02:53.239> it's<00:02:53.870> pretty<00:02:54.140> small<00:02:54.290> let<00:02:54.590> me<00:02:54.680> get<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:55.150> few<00:02:56.150> /

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
is it's pretty small let me get a few /

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:07.610 
is it's pretty small let me get a few /
compares

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.100 

ok<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.430> here<00:03:08.879> we<00:03:09.000> got<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> normal<00:03:09.810> size<00:03:09.989> 3<00:03:10.379> by<00:03:10.530> 3

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
ok so here we got a normal size 3 by 3

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.089 
ok so here we got a normal size 3 by 3
this<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:13.170> how<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.650> measures<00:03:14.310> up<00:03:14.640> be<00:03:16.010> it's<00:03:17.010> about

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
this is how it measures up be it's about

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:25.729 
this is how it measures up be it's about
it<00:03:17.400> as<00:03:17.640> best<00:03:18.000> they<00:03:18.299> can<00:03:19.099> one<00:03:20.099> block<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:25.560> can

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
it as best they can one block you can

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.750 
it as best they can one block you can
see<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.099> size<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.370> Pearson<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:28.640> don't<00:03:29.640> really

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
see the size of Pearson I don't really

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.970 
see the size of Pearson I don't really
know<00:03:29.940> much<00:03:30.150> about<00:03:30.329> these<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:31.019> know<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:31.799> the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
know much about these I know that the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.680 
know much about these I know that the
goal<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.700> get<00:03:32.849> all<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.780> little<00:03:34.069> clocks<00:03:35.069> on

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
goal is to get all the little clocks on

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.680 
goal is to get all the little clocks on
to<00:03:36.690> read<00:03:37.409> twelve<00:03:37.769> o'clock<00:03:38.099> I<00:03:38.430> know<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.540> these

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
to read twelve o'clock I know that these

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.849 
to read twelve o'clock I know that these
pegs<00:03:40.019> can<00:03:40.470> change<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:42.690> way<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.049> clocks<00:03:43.379> we

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
pegs can change the way the clocks we

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.180 
pegs can change the way the clocks we
interact<00:03:44.609> with<00:03:44.700> each<00:03:44.879> other<00:03:45.980> well<00:03:46.980> that's<00:03:47.129> a

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
interact with each other well that's a

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.039 
interact with each other well that's a
little<00:03:47.310> cracked<00:03:47.940> right<00:03:48.150> there<00:03:48.329> but<00:03:48.629> it's<00:03:48.810> not

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
little cracked right there but it's not

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.949 
little cracked right there but it's not
just<00:03:49.709> too<00:03:49.920> big<00:03:50.069> of<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.220> deal<00:03:51.980> might<00:03:52.980> polish<00:03:53.400> it

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
just too big of a deal might polish it

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.559 
just too big of a deal might polish it
try<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.019> nullify<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.670> amount<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:56.760> cracks<00:03:57.329> that

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
try to nullify the amount of cracks that

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.180 
try to nullify the amount of cracks that
are<00:03:57.629> in<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:58.280> um<00:03:59.450> there's<00:04:00.450> some<00:04:00.810> Chinese<00:04:01.440> riding

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
are in it um there's some Chinese riding

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.559 
are in it um there's some Chinese riding
on<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.489> have<00:04:02.609> no<00:04:02.730> idea<00:04:02.760> what<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.180> means<00:04:03.299> i'm

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
on I have no idea what it means i'm

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.319 
on I have no idea what it means i'm
guessing<00:04:03.959> US<00:04:04.049> has<00:04:04.200> magic<00:04:04.590> clock<00:04:04.769> but<00:04:05.329> you're

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
guessing US has magic clock but you're

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.240 
guessing US has magic clock but you're
Chinese<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:06.989> you<00:04:07.379> know<00:04:07.500> this<00:04:07.680> says<00:04:07.890> leave<00:04:08.220> a

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
Chinese and you know this says leave a

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.520 
Chinese and you know this says leave a
comment<00:04:09.560> it<00:04:10.560> could<00:04:10.950> be<00:04:11.069> anything<00:04:11.280> all<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.790> know

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
comment it could be anything all I know

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.170 
comment it could be anything all I know
see<00:04:13.530> all<00:04:13.590> these<00:04:13.680> little<00:04:13.889> pegs<00:04:14.280> go<00:04:15.030> in<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.359> out

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
see all these little pegs go in and out

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.690 
see all these little pegs go in and out
and<00:04:18.349> like<00:04:19.349> I'm<00:04:19.560> guessing<00:04:19.950> they<00:04:20.039> do<00:04:20.190> some<00:04:20.489> kind

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
and like I'm guessing they do some kind

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.900 
and like I'm guessing they do some kind
of<00:04:21.349> gear<00:04:22.349> gear<00:04:22.979> changes<00:04:23.370> i<00:04:23.460> guess<00:04:23.610> was<00:04:23.760> like<00:04:23.880> a

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
of gear gear changes i guess was like a

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.510 
of gear gear changes i guess was like a
little<00:04:24.060> transmission<00:04:24.750> type<00:04:24.900> of<00:04:25.050> deal<00:04:25.200> in<00:04:25.380> here

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.550 

but<00:04:29.520> all<00:04:29.669> these<00:04:29.880> turn<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.669> back<00:04:32.849> ones

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
but all these turn to the back ones

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.020 
but all these turn to the back ones
that's<00:04:34.560> weird<00:04:34.919> this<00:04:35.610> is<00:04:35.760> going<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:35.940> be

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
that's weird this is going to be

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.080 
that's weird this is going to be
complicated<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:36.720> could<00:04:37.020> tell<00:04:37.849> let's<00:04:38.849> see<00:04:38.940> all

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
complicated I could tell let's see all

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.890 
complicated I could tell let's see all
the<00:04:39.180> back<00:04:39.330> ones<00:04:39.570> turn<00:04:40.910> do<00:04:41.910> that<00:04:42.120> only<00:04:42.630> the

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
the back ones turn do that only the

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.650 
the back ones turn do that only the
corners<00:04:43.639> well<00:04:44.639> I'm<00:04:44.699> calling<00:04:45.030> this<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.180> back<00:04:45.449> I

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
corners well I'm calling this the back I

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.810 
corners well I'm calling this the back I
guess<00:04:45.990> just<00:04:46.320> because<00:04:46.410> it's<00:04:46.710> um<00:04:46.979> darker<00:04:47.669> is

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
guess just because it's um darker is

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.000 
guess just because it's um darker is
naturally<00:04:48.360> it's<00:04:49.050> natural<00:04:49.169> to<00:04:49.380> call<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:49.800> the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
naturally it's natural to call it the

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.730 
naturally it's natural to call it the
back<00:04:50.490> part<00:04:50.820> of<00:04:50.940> something<00:04:51.560> could<00:04:52.560> be<00:04:52.590> the

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
back part of something could be the

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.250 
back part of something could be the
front<00:04:52.979> element<00:04:53.870> well<00:04:54.870> let's<00:04:55.050> see<00:04:55.169> what

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
front element well let's see what

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.040 
front element well let's see what
happens<00:04:55.680> when<00:04:55.800> we<00:04:56.039> touch<00:04:56.280> all<00:04:56.520> these<00:04:56.639> up<00:05:00.050> all

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
happens when we touch all these up all

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.430 
happens when we touch all these up all
these<00:05:01.199> turn<00:05:01.530> I'm<00:05:01.740> guessing<00:05:02.160> that

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.090 

okay<00:05:06.440> oh<00:05:07.300> yes<00:05:08.300> to<00:05:08.570> keep<00:05:08.930> this<00:05:09.050> video<00:05:09.380> from

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
okay oh yes to keep this video from

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.530 
okay oh yes to keep this video from
being<00:05:10.310> too<00:05:10.460> long<00:05:10.670> i<00:05:10.790> guess<00:05:10.940> i'll<00:05:11.090> just<00:05:11.120> stop<00:05:11.390> it

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
being too long i guess i'll just stop it

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.730 
being too long i guess i'll just stop it
right<00:05:11.660> here<00:05:11.960> but<00:05:12.740> um<00:05:13.270> once<00:05:14.270> i<00:05:14.390> figure<00:05:14.720> out<00:05:14.750> how

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
right here but um once i figure out how

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.490 
right here but um once i figure out how
this<00:05:15.860> actually<00:05:16.070> works<00:05:16.340> um<00:05:16.910> i<00:05:17.600> think<00:05:17.840> i'll<00:05:18.200> make

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
this actually works um i think i'll make

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.770 
this actually works um i think i'll make
a<00:05:18.530> video
