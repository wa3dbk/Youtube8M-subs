00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.100 

so<00:02:08.380> steve<00:02:08.619> i<00:02:08.800> used<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.130> think<00:02:09.160> that<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.810> color

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
so steve i used to think that the color

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.260 
so steve i used to think that the color
of<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.500> egg<00:02:11.680> actually<00:02:12.430> changed<00:02:12.850> as<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.000> got

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
of the egg actually changed as I got

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.120 
of the egg actually changed as I got
older<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:13.990> meant<00:02:14.319> that<00:02:14.680> was<00:02:14.860> how<00:02:15.069> you

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
older and that meant that was how you

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.949 
older and that meant that was how you
could<00:02:15.459> tell<00:02:15.790> if<00:02:16.000> an<00:02:16.120> egg<00:02:16.300> was<00:02:16.510> fresh<00:02:16.690> enough

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
could tell if an egg was fresh enough

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.590 
could tell if an egg was fresh enough
but<00:02:17.319> that's<00:02:17.440> not<00:02:17.560> actually<00:02:17.680> true<00:02:18.069> is<00:02:18.220> it

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
but that's not actually true is it

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.210 
but that's not actually true is it
no<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.750> color<00:02:20.020> of<00:02:20.230> an<00:02:20.350> egg<00:02:20.500> doesn't<00:02:21.100> have

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
no the color of an egg doesn't have

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.280 
no the color of an egg doesn't have
anything<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.730> do<00:02:21.850> with<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.090> age<00:02:22.290> different

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
anything to do with the age different

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.040 
anything to do with the age different
hens<00:02:23.560> have<00:02:24.000> different<00:02:25.000> pigmentation<00:02:25.750> in

whether eggs and the cholesterol that

whether eggs and the cholesterol that
they<00:03:15.310> contain<00:03:15.760> are<00:03:16.239> good<00:03:16.540> for<00:03:16.750> us<00:03:16.840> we<00:03:17.110> actually

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
they contain are good for us we actually

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.699 
they contain are good for us we actually
know<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.400> most<00:03:18.910> people<00:03:19.299> can<00:03:19.600> consume<00:03:19.840> one

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
know that most people can consume one

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.620 
know that most people can consume one
egg<00:03:20.980> per<00:03:21.010> day<00:03:21.400> without<00:03:21.640> it<00:03:22.000> affecting<00:03:22.120> their

cholesterol<00:03:22.900> levels<00:03:23.530> reason<00:03:24.340> being<00:03:24.549> is<00:03:24.760> that

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
cholesterol levels reason being is that

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.610 
cholesterol levels reason being is that
our<00:03:25.120> body<00:03:25.390> actually<00:03:25.660> produces<00:03:26.440> cholesterol

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
our body actually produces cholesterol

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.890 
our body actually produces cholesterol
from<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.489> amount<00:03:27.610> of<00:03:27.760> saturated<00:03:28.090> fat<00:03:28.690> we<00:03:28.870> eat

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
from the amount of saturated fat we eat

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.440
