00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
yeah I want to go over a little trick

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.789 
yeah I want to go over a little trick
that<00:00:02.300> it's<00:00:03.300> good<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.629> know<00:00:03.780> you<00:00:04.500> can<00:00:04.650> run

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
that it's good to know you can run

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.920 
that it's good to know you can run
6-cylinder<00:00:05.609> Chevy<00:00:05.910> points<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.509> old<00:00:06.660> six

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
6-cylinder Chevy points the old six

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.900 
6-cylinder Chevy points the old six
cylinders<00:00:07.410> used<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.160> have<00:00:08.309> in<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.519> Chevy's

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
cylinders used to have in the Chevy's

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.560 
cylinders used to have in the Chevy's
back<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.450> 60s<00:00:10.050> 70s<00:00:10.290> 50s<00:00:11.280> whatever<00:00:11.670> like<00:00:12.540> a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
back in the 60s 70s 50s whatever like a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.750 
back in the 60s 70s 50s whatever like a
190<00:00:13.349> cubic<00:00:13.769> inch<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.160> think<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.519> 230<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.240> 250<00:00:15.900> and

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
190 cubic inch I think a 230 of 250 and

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.160 
190 cubic inch I think a 230 of 250 and
just<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.880> standard<00:00:18.270> set<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.510> points<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.020> can

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
just a standard set of points you can

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.620 
just a standard set of points you can
run<00:00:19.320> points<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.859> your<00:00:19.949> Harley<00:00:20.340> right<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.570> you

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
run points in your Harley right so you

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.480 
run points in your Harley right so you
take<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.020> cover<00:00:22.260> off<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.920> little<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.430> is

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
take the cover off this little this is

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.400 
take the cover off this little this is
the<00:00:23.640> cover<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.779> electronic

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
the cover this is for the electronic

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.679 
the cover this is for the electronic
ignition<00:00:26.000> now<00:00:27.000> with<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> electronic

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
ignition now with the electronic

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.290 
ignition now with the electronic
ignition<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:29.189> goes<00:00:29.369> back<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.150> know<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
ignition it goes back to you know a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.130 
ignition it goes back to you know a
black<00:00:30.599> box<00:00:30.900> which<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.710> here<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
black box which is up in here and

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.110 
black box which is up in here and
actually<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.260> behind<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> cover

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
actually it's behind this is a cover

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.650 
actually it's behind this is a cover
triangle<00:00:36.930> cover<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.469> behind<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.660> right

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
triangle cover it's behind this right

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.549 
triangle cover it's behind this right
here<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.649> triangle<00:00:41.280> cover<00:00:42.050> and<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.379> got<00:00:43.530> a

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
here is triangle cover and it's got a

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.950 
here is triangle cover and it's got a
boat<00:00:43.800> switch<00:00:44.250> vacuum<00:00:44.820> operated<00:00:45.000> electronic

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
boat switch vacuum operated electronic

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.389 
boat switch vacuum operated electronic
switch<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.649> when<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.890> hit<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> gas<00:00:47.340> and

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
switch so like when you hit the gas and

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.430 
switch so like when you hit the gas and
retard<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> timing<00:00:48.539> you're<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> little<00:00:49.260> bit

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
retard to the timing you're a little bit

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.560 
retard to the timing you're a little bit
so<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.449> you<00:00:51.449> know

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
so you don't have a you know

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.170 
so you don't have a you know
pre-ignition<00:00:52.520> but<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.000> use<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
pre-ignition but you have to use a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.970 
pre-ignition but you have to use a
different<00:00:54.480> coil<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.320> use<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.800> this

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
different coil so what I use is this

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.310 
different coil so what I use is this
accel<00:00:56.550> coil<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.570> works<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:57.989> both<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
accel coil it works with both the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.250 
accel coil it works with both the
electronic<00:00:58.859> ignition<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.940> points<00:01:00.329> so

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
electronic ignition and the points so

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.720 
electronic ignition and the points so
because<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.829> can't<00:01:02.039> use<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> standard

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
because you can't use the standard

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.660 
because you can't use the standard
electronic<00:01:03.149> ignition<00:01:03.570> coil<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.260> points<00:01:04.680> but

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
electronic ignition coil with points but

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.130 
electronic ignition coil with points but
I<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.030> deal<00:01:06.299> because<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.110> a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
I like this deal because if you have a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.859 
I like this deal because if you have a
problem<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.010> still<00:01:08.369> get<00:01:08.520> gone<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.780> this

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
problem you can still get gone and this

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.770 
problem you can still get gone and this
is<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.110> points<00:01:10.470> plate<00:01:10.740> setup<00:01:11.340> what<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.570> is

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
is the points plate setup what you do is

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.810 
is the points plate setup what you do is
you<00:01:12.869> bolt<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.470> I've<00:01:13.890> had<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:14.610> but

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
you bolt this in I've had it in here but

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.310 
you bolt this in I've had it in here but
I<00:01:14.850> don't<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.210> taking<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.720> out<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:15.900> putting

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
I don't like taking it out and putting

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.770 
I don't like taking it out and putting
it<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.590> too<00:01:16.799> much<00:01:17.090> because<00:01:19.009> you<00:01:20.009> could<00:01:20.220> um

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
it in too much because you could um

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.450 
it in too much because you could um
break<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.960> bolt<00:01:22.350> pretty<00:01:22.680> easily<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.280> not

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
break this bolt pretty easily it's not

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.730 
break this bolt pretty easily it's not
that<00:01:23.729> thick<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.780> know<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.229> pretty<00:01:25.500> thin

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
that thick you know it's a pretty thin

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.679 
that thick you know it's a pretty thin
bulb<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.310> actually<00:01:26.729> like<00:01:26.909> when<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.119> put<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.540> in

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
bulb and actually like when I put it in

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.840 
bulb and actually like when I put it in
there<00:01:27.900> I'll<00:01:28.680> put<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.130> little<00:01:29.310> bit<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.640> Loctite

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
there I'll put a little bit of Loctite

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.069 
there I'll put a little bit of Loctite
so<00:01:30.659> I'll<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.110> heat<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:32.299> to<00:01:33.299> take<00:01:33.930> it

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
so I'll have to heat this up to take it

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.020 
so I'll have to heat this up to take it
out<00:01:34.259> that's<00:01:34.890> how<00:01:35.130> you'll<00:01:35.310> get<00:01:35.460> out<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.820> lock

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
out that's how you'll get out the lock

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.450 
out that's how you'll get out the lock
tight<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.320> plates<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:38.159> set

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
tight but it's just the plates you set

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.179 
tight but it's just the plates you set
these<00:01:38.670> plates<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.009> you<00:01:41.009> know<00:01:41.130> you

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
these plates in here and you know you

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.219 
these plates in here and you know you
can<00:01:41.579> use<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> Tesla<00:01:42.360> you'd<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.840> screw<00:01:43.110> it

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
can use a Tesla you'd have to screw it

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.660 
can use a Tesla you'd have to screw it
on<00:01:43.320> here<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.740> got<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> screws<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.460> same

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
on here you got the screws the same

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.429 
on here you got the screws the same
screws<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.180> hold<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> cover<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.110> screw

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
screws that hold the cover on you screw

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.899 
screws that hold the cover on you screw
it<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:48.500> use<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> test<00:01:49.860> light<00:01:50.189> turn

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
it on here and use a test light turn

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.149 
it on here and use a test light turn
this<00:01:51.180> when<00:01:51.899> you're<00:01:52.020> at<00:01:52.140> top<00:01:52.380> dead<00:01:52.619> center<00:01:52.979> just

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
this when you're at top dead center just

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.100 
this when you're at top dead center just
so<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.430> points<00:01:53.880> start<00:01:54.119> breaking<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:54.930> now

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
so the points start breaking up but now

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.889 
so the points start breaking up but now
you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.320> use<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.470> test<00:01:55.799> light<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:58.579> actually

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
you can use a test light to actually

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.240 
you can use a test light to actually
show<00:02:00.899> exactly<00:02:01.409> where<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> points<00:02:02.189> are

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
show exactly where the points are

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.649 
show exactly where the points are
breaking<00:02:02.610> open<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.969> get<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.149> right<00:02:03.299> on<00:02:03.420> top

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
breaking open and get it right on top

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.510 
breaking open and get it right on top
dead<00:02:03.930> center<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.350> advance<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.130> here<00:02:05.369> and

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
dead center and advance it to here and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.819 
dead center and advance it to here and
see<00:02:05.670> if<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.850> runs<00:02:06.060> good<00:02:06.329> but<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.530> know<00:02:07.649> if

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
see if it runs good but you know if

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.740 
see if it runs good but you know if
you're<00:02:07.979> stuck<00:02:08.280> out<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> road<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.330> always

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
you're stuck out on the road I always

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.780 
you're stuck out on the road I always
keep<00:02:10.020> these<00:02:10.229> points<00:02:10.709> with<00:02:10.860> me<00:02:11.039> because<00:02:11.489> if<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
keep these points with me because if the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.020 
keep these points with me because if the
electronic<00:02:12.360> ignition

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
electronic ignition

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.090 
electronic ignition
goes<00:02:13.150> out<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.540> seems<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.870> be<00:02:13.990> very<00:02:14.260> reliable<00:02:14.680> I

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
goes out it seems to be very reliable I

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.030 
goes out it seems to be very reliable I
got<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.760> way<00:02:16.030> around<00:02:16.230> now<00:02:17.230> if<00:02:17.470> you're<00:02:17.650> talking

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
got a way around now if you're talking

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.740 
got a way around now if you're talking
about<00:02:18.160> end<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.390> world

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
about end of the world

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.090 
about end of the world
plan<00:02:20.050> out<00:02:20.200> into<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.590> world<00:02:20.770> but<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.010> don't

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
plan out into the world but you don't

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.140 
plan out into the world but you don't
say<00:02:21.310> like<00:02:21.580> one<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.940> those<00:02:22.030> uh<00:02:22.530> EMM<00:02:24.150> electronic

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
say like one of those uh EMM electronic

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.730 
say like one of those uh EMM electronic
pulse<00:02:25.480> attacks<00:02:25.959> or<00:02:26.140> whatever<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.440> hell<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.560> is

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
pulse attacks or whatever the hell it is

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.360 
pulse attacks or whatever the hell it is
and<00:02:27.670> electronic<00:02:28.240> ignitions<00:02:28.720> don't<00:02:28.959> work<00:02:29.370> well

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
and electronic ignitions don't work well

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.910 
and electronic ignitions don't work well
you<00:02:31.000> could<00:02:31.150> put<00:02:31.300> this<00:02:31.480> puppy<00:02:31.959> in<00:02:32.080> there<00:02:32.260> points

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
you could put this puppy in there points

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.610 
you could put this puppy in there points
and<00:02:33.190> you'll<00:02:33.580> still<00:02:33.880> run<00:02:34.350> nothing<00:02:35.350> anything

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
and you'll still run nothing anything

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.220 
and you'll still run nothing anything
else<00:02:35.980> will<00:02:36.190> work<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:36.750> that's<00:02:37.750> one<00:02:38.080> advantage

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
else will work but that's one advantage

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.580 
else will work but that's one advantage
to<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.760> it's<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.600> good<00:02:40.840> setup<00:02:41.170> for<00:02:41.500> the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
to it so it's a good setup for the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.990 
to it so it's a good setup for the
Harley<00:02:41.980> because<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.459> don't<00:02:42.610> know<00:02:42.670> what<00:02:42.850> else

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
Harley because I don't know what else

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.030 
Harley because I don't know what else
bikes<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.540> can<00:02:43.690> do<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.050> with<00:02:44.319> except<00:02:44.920> the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
bikes you can do that with except the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.370 
bikes you can do that with except the
Harley<00:02:45.430> could<00:02:45.700> run<00:02:45.910> 6-cylinder<00:02:46.600> Chevy<00:02:46.870> points

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
Harley could run 6-cylinder Chevy points

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.310 
Harley could run 6-cylinder Chevy points
very<00:02:48.370> cheap<00:02:48.760> just<00:02:49.030> put<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.269> condenser<00:02:49.870> one<00:02:50.110> wire

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
very cheap just put a condenser one wire

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.430 
very cheap just put a condenser one wire
set<00:02:50.739> up<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.550> wire<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:52.120> actually<00:02:52.600> just<00:02:52.750> sitting

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
set up the wire is actually just sitting

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.430 
set up the wire is actually just sitting
right<00:02:53.650> under<00:02:53.980> here<00:02:54.220> right<00:02:54.760> under<00:02:55.030> there<00:02:55.209> and

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
right under here right under there and

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.530 
right under here right under there and
it's<00:02:56.440> easy<00:02:56.590> access<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:58.030> got<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.239> quick

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
it's easy access it's got a quick

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.729 
it's easy access it's got a quick
disconnect<00:02:58.959> on<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.560> that's<00:02:59.890> got<00:03:00.489> like<00:03:00.730> a

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
disconnect on it that's got like a

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.100 
disconnect on it that's got like a
special<00:03:02.739> waterproof<00:03:03.610> grease<00:03:04.180> all<00:03:04.420> cased<00:03:04.870> in

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
special waterproof grease all cased in

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.780 
special waterproof grease all cased in
it<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.470> doesn't<00:03:05.620> get<00:03:05.860> all<00:03:06.010> messed<00:03:06.280> up<00:03:06.459> even

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
it so it doesn't get all messed up even

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.080 
it so it doesn't get all messed up even
if<00:03:06.880> I'm<00:03:07.000> running<00:03:07.269> through<00:03:07.420> deep<00:03:07.630> water<00:03:07.980> but

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
if I'm running through deep water but

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.759 
if I'm running through deep water but
it's<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.239> good<00:03:10.450> setup<00:03:10.750> because<00:03:11.050> you<00:03:11.410> got<00:03:11.590> that

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
it's a good setup because you got that

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.259 
it's a good setup because you got that
option<00:03:12.040> if<00:03:12.430> you're<00:03:12.550> out<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.970> road<00:03:13.239> the

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
option if you're out on the road the

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.479 
option if you're out on the road the
electronic<00:03:14.019> ignition<00:03:14.290> goes<00:03:14.680> out<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.310> got<00:03:15.459> a

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
electronic ignition goes out you got a

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.120 
electronic ignition goes out you got a
way<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.790> get<00:03:16.000> going<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:16.600> know<00:03:17.560> if<00:03:17.769> you<00:03:17.890> have<00:03:18.010> an

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
way to get going you know if you have an

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.130 
way to get going you know if you have an
EMP<00:03:18.670> attack<00:03:18.700> or<00:03:19.450> something<00:03:19.870> all<00:03:20.019> these

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
EMP attack or something all these

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.199 
EMP attack or something all these
electronic<00:03:20.739> vehicles<00:03:21.220> don't<00:03:21.459> work<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:22.090> could

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
electronic vehicles don't work you could

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.030 
electronic vehicles don't work you could
still<00:03:22.450> run<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:22.870> thing<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.440> it's<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.680> it's<00:03:23.920> a

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
still run this thing so it's a it's a

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.860 
still run this thing so it's a it's a
cool<00:03:24.280> setup<00:03:24.579> it's<00:03:24.880> very<00:03:25.120> cheap<00:03:25.390> too<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.840> I

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
cool setup it's very cheap too and I

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.240 
cool setup it's very cheap too and I
think<00:03:26.110> Harley's<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.560> only<00:03:26.739> one<00:03:26.920> that's<00:03:27.070> got

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
think Harley's the only one that's got

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.090 
think Harley's the only one that's got
that<00:03:27.459> type<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.880> deal
