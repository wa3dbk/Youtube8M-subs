00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.320 

I<00:05:08.930> think<00:05:09.349> so<00:05:09.770> yeah<00:05:10.010> hopping<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.610> great<00:05:11.030> side

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
I think so yeah hopping the great side

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.480 
I think so yeah hopping the great side
and<00:05:11.599> nothing<00:05:11.960> will<00:05:12.320> prove<00:05:12.560> that<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:13.220> ended

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
and nothing will prove that the ended

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.469 
and nothing will prove that the ended
back<00:05:13.729> end<00:05:13.910> of<00:05:13.970> this<00:05:14.090> season

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
back end of this season

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.740 
back end of this season
once<00:05:15.349> we've<00:05:15.620> got<00:05:15.650> a<00:05:16.310> few<00:05:17.210> people<00:05:17.270> back<00:05:17.720> from

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
once we've got a few people back from

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.170

the<00:05:18.139> injuries<00:05:18.470> and<00:05:18.500> I<00:05:18.919> think<00:05:19.400> we<00:05:19.490> start<00:05:19.760> to<00:05:19.910> gel

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180

the injuries and I think we start to gel
and<00:05:20.449> I<00:05:20.960> think<00:05:21.410> we<00:05:21.470> better<00:05:21.620> go<00:05:21.889> running<00:05:22.250> with
