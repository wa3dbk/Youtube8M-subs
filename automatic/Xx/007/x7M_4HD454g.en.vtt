bearings going to fail you do your best

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.380 
bearings going to fail you do your best
to<00:00:17.070> make<00:00:17.100> sure<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.609> it's<00:00:17.760> not<00:00:17.880> going<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.210> fail

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
to make sure that it's not going to fail

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.849 
to make sure that it's not going to fail
by<00:00:18.600> doing<00:00:18.930> proper<00:00:19.320> maintenance<00:00:19.500> and

linear bearings still will fail and if
this<00:00:25.320> happens<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.340> cost<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.849> linear

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
this happens the cost of a linear

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.990 
this happens the cost of a linear
bearing<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:28.199> very<00:00:28.619> insignificant<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.880> the

bearing is very insignificant to the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.089 
bearing is very insignificant to the
cost<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> machine<00:00:30.840> that's<00:00:31.019> riding<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.619> the

cost of the machine that's riding on the
linear<00:00:32.340> bearing<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.420> by<00:00:34.050> spending<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.710> small

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
linear bearing so by spending a small

amount to replace the linear bearing now

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.220 
amount to replace the linear bearing now
you<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.100> certainly<00:00:38.340> avoid<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.300> large<00:00:39.840> amount

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
you can certainly avoid a large amount

is very reasonable assumption to make

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.340 
is very reasonable assumption to make
so<00:00:55.649> when<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.489> ability<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.600> shut<00:00:57.870> the

so when you have ability to shut the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.330 
so when you have ability to shut the
line<00:00:58.530> down<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.070> check<00:00:59.879> your<00:01:00.059> linear<00:01:00.300> bearings

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
line down and check your linear bearings

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.979 
line down and check your linear bearings
it's<00:01:02.340> definitely<00:01:02.910> recommended<00:01:03.059> because<00:01:03.840> you

actually hear the noise of the bearings
as<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.900> goes<00:01:28.080> through<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.680> actually<00:01:28.979> rougher

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
as it goes through it's actually rougher

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.310 
as it goes through it's actually rougher
you<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.329> actually<00:01:30.479> hear<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> clicking<00:01:31.170> noise

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
you can actually hear a clicking noise

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.530 
you can actually hear a clicking noise
it's<00:01:32.130> actually<00:01:32.400> causing<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.880> stuttering<00:01:33.299> in

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
it's actually causing a stuttering in

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the movement and if one were to actually

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.569 
the movement and if one were to actually
feel<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.229> product<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.040> actually<00:01:38.310> feel

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
feel the product you can actually feel

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.789 
feel the product you can actually feel
the<00:01:38.729> vibrations<00:01:38.759> as<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.990> runs<00:01:40.259> back<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.590> forth

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the vibrations as it runs back and forth

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.460 
the vibrations as it runs back and forth
as<00:01:41.130> well<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.210> look<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.049> see<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.320> they're

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
as well you can look to see if they're

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.590 
as well you can look to see if they're
actually<00:01:43.619> grooving<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:45.030> shaft<00:01:45.360> itself

actually grooving on the shaft itself

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.310 
actually grooving on the shaft itself
and<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.829> well<00:01:47.159> take<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> sample<00:01:48.420> off<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.229> the

and as well take a sample off of the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.730 
and as well take a sample off of the
surface<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:50.280> look<00:01:50.460> for<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:51.420> metal<00:01:52.110> particulates

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
surface to look for a metal particulates

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.910 
surface to look for a metal particulates
now<00:01:53.310> there<00:01:53.909> are<00:01:54.090> other<00:01:54.299> occasions<00:01:54.840> where<00:01:55.170> none

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
now there are other occasions where none

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.709 
now there are other occasions where none
of<00:01:55.950> these<00:01:56.159> signs<00:01:56.399> exist<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.360> may<00:01:57.659> still

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
of these signs exist but you may still

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.170 
of these signs exist but you may still
have<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> failure<00:01:58.500> more<00:01:59.369> often<00:01:59.759> you'd<00:01:59.909> want<00:02:00.119> to

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
have a failure more often you'd want to

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.480 
have a failure more often you'd want to
actually<00:02:00.270> monitor<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.170> load<00:02:01.590> very

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
actually monitor the load very

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.279 
actually monitor the load very
and<00:02:02.579> one<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.539> the<00:02:03.600> things<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:04.049> do<00:02:04.170> is

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
and one of the things you can do is

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.490 
and one of the things you can do is
actually<00:02:04.439> check<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.860> vibration<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:06.049> on<00:02:07.049> here

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
actually check the vibration so on here

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.790 
actually check the vibration so on here
you<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.710> actually<00:02:07.979> see<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:09.229> variation<00:02:10.229> that

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
you can actually see the variation that

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.759 
you can actually see the variation that
we<00:02:10.979> have<00:02:11.250> from<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.510> load<00:02:12.720> one<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.620> things

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
we have from the load one of the things

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.559 
we have from the load one of the things
you<00:02:13.890> want<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.160> do<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.550> try<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.060> catch<00:02:15.330> your

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
you want to do is try to catch your

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.440 
you want to do is try to catch your
failures<00:02:15.959> early<00:02:16.379> so<00:02:17.099> that<00:02:17.129> way<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.519> can<00:02:17.819> put

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
failures early so that way you can put

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.210 
failures early so that way you can put
do<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.780> preventative<00:02:19.380> maintenance<00:02:19.530> replace

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
do the preventative maintenance replace

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.220 
do the preventative maintenance replace
the<00:02:20.430> bearing<00:02:20.819> at<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.599> appropriate<00:02:22.050> time

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
the bearing at the appropriate time

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.930 
the bearing at the appropriate time
before<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.709> actually<00:02:22.830> starts<00:02:23.340> affecting<00:02:23.640> your

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
before it actually starts affecting your

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.910 
before it actually starts affecting your
product<00:02:24.330> or<00:02:24.480> your<00:02:24.510> crew<00:02:24.840> foot<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.769> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
product or your crew foot and in the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.770 
product or your crew foot and in the
worst<00:02:26.099> case<00:02:26.340> actually<00:02:26.580> deaths<00:02:27.000> cause<00:02:27.300> damage

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
worst case actually deaths cause damage

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:36.680 
worst case actually deaths cause damage
to<00:02:27.810> your<00:02:27.989> machine<00:02:35.269> so<00:02:36.269> what<00:02:36.450> we're<00:02:36.540> going<00:02:36.630> to

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
to your machine so what we're going to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.630 
to your machine so what we're going to
do<00:02:36.840> right<00:02:37.019> now<00:02:37.049> is<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.560> we're<00:02:37.739> going<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.890> take

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
do right now is that we're going to take

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.000 
do right now is that we're going to take
out<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.120> failed<00:02:39.599> bearing<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.140> what<00:02:40.890> are<00:02:40.950> you

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
out the failed bearing and what are you

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.680 
out the failed bearing and what are you
going<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.160> do<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.370> going<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.549> unload<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.510> load

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
going to do is going to unload the load

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.460 
going to do is going to unload the load
cell<00:02:43.340> block<00:02:44.340> off<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:44.940> load<00:02:45.360> plate<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.049> then

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
cell block off the load plate and then

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.380 
cell block off the load plate and then
pull<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.160> shaft<00:02:47.310> out<00:02:47.549> replace<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.090> bearing

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
pull the shaft out replace the bearing

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.850 
pull the shaft out replace the bearing
put<00:02:48.780> in<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.930> brand<00:02:49.140> new<00:02:49.200> bearing

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
put in a brand new bearing

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.190 
put in a brand new bearing
so<00:02:50.459> what<00:02:50.760> you'll<00:02:50.910> note<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.299> that<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.780> sound<00:02:52.019> is

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
so what you'll note is that the sound is

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.930 
so what you'll note is that the sound is
a<00:02:52.230> force<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.620> lot<00:02:52.739> quieter<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.640> can<00:02:53.790> actually

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
a force a lot quieter you can actually

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.479 
a force a lot quieter you can actually
in<00:02:54.599> touching<00:02:55.019> this<00:02:55.140> rig<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.829> tell<00:02:56.280> that

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
in touching this rig you can tell that

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.339 
in touching this rig you can tell that
it's<00:02:56.670> not<00:02:56.849> jumping<00:02:57.360> up<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.569> down<00:02:57.660> anymore<00:02:58.079> and

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
it's not jumping up and down anymore and

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.410 
it's not jumping up and down anymore and
don't<00:02:58.620> feel<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.010> vibrations<00:02:59.579> you<00:02:59.760> don't<00:03:00.180> hear

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
don't feel the vibrations you don't hear

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.330 
don't feel the vibrations you don't hear
it<00:03:00.569> either<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.140> what<00:03:01.769> we've<00:03:01.890> done<00:03:02.040> is<00:03:02.190> we've

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
it either and what we've done is we've

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.009 
it either and what we've done is we've
gone<00:03:02.459> ahead<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.760> sub<00:03:03.060> basically<00:03:03.660> apply<00:03:03.959> the

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
gone ahead and sub basically apply the

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.319 
gone ahead and sub basically apply the
same<00:03:04.440> load<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:05.370> we<00:03:05.489> had<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.060> prior

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
same load that we had on the prior

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.979 
same load that we had on the prior
bearing<00:03:07.370> these<00:03:08.370> bearings<00:03:08.850> are<00:03:09.329> clearly<00:03:09.750> has

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
bearing these bearings are clearly has

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.840 
bearing these bearings are clearly has
seen<00:03:10.200> better<00:03:10.350> days<00:03:10.470> what<00:03:11.160> we<00:03:11.280> did<00:03:11.459> was<00:03:11.639> we<00:03:11.760> went

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
seen better days what we did was we went

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.879 
seen better days what we did was we went
ahead<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.209> placed<00:03:12.510> them<00:03:12.780> during<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.560> part<00:03:13.829> of

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
ahead and placed them during the part of

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.860 
ahead and placed them during the part of
our<00:03:14.010> standard<00:03:14.790> maintenance<00:03:14.940> cycle<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.750> can

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
our standard maintenance cycle you can

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.569 
our standard maintenance cycle you can
see<00:03:16.109> from<00:03:16.350> here<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:17.040> know<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.280> fact<00:03:17.489> that

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
see from here you know the fact that

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.550 
see from here you know the fact that
it's<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.239> whole<00:03:18.420> bearing<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.049> actually

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
it's the whole bearing is actually

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.470 
it's the whole bearing is actually
fairly<00:03:19.769> dry<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.819> lubrication<00:03:21.180> that

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
fairly dry but the lubrication that

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.420 
fairly dry but the lubrication that
there<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:22.139> actually<00:03:22.500> that's<00:03:22.980> caked<00:03:23.250> on

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
there is is actually that's caked on

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.640 
there is is actually that's caked on
there's<00:03:23.670> old<00:03:23.880> it's<00:03:24.209> discolored<00:03:24.720> rather<00:03:25.410> than

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
there's old it's discolored rather than

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.500 
there's old it's discolored rather than
waiting<00:03:25.920> for<00:03:26.069> any<00:03:26.340> sort<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.609> a<00:03:26.700> failure<00:03:26.970> or

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
waiting for any sort of a failure or

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.180 
waiting for any sort of a failure or
things<00:03:27.870> like<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.049> you<00:03:28.200> want<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.620> definitely

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
things like that you want to definitely

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.009 
things like that you want to definitely
maintain<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:29.940> bearing<00:03:30.269> on<00:03:30.359> a<00:03:30.389> regular<00:03:30.810> cycle

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
maintain this bearing on a regular cycle

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.620 
maintain this bearing on a regular cycle
but<00:03:31.560> in<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.739> case<00:03:32.010> there<00:03:32.850> was<00:03:33.030> actually<00:03:33.389> no

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
but in this case there was actually no

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.240 
but in this case there was actually no
clear<00:03:34.049> manifestation<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:35.040> it's<00:03:35.160> those

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
clear manifestation and it's those

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.940 
clear manifestation and it's those
hidden<00:03:35.670> failures<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:36.900> are<00:03:36.959> probably<00:03:37.859> going

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
hidden failures that are probably going

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.770 
hidden failures that are probably going
to<00:03:38.130> be<00:03:38.220> worse<00:03:38.430> now<00:03:38.819> is<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.239> time<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.600> think

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
to be worse now is the time to think

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.809 
to be worse now is the time to think
about<00:03:40.049> replacing<00:03:40.290> your<00:03:41.160> linear<00:03:41.430> bearings

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
about replacing your linear bearings

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.670 
about replacing your linear bearings
taking<00:03:42.329> a<00:03:42.389> look<00:03:42.540> at<00:03:42.720> them<00:03:42.900> making<00:03:43.500> sure

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
taking a look at them making sure

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.190 
taking a look at them making sure
they're<00:03:43.950> lubricated<00:03:44.819> if<00:03:45.030> there's<00:03:45.599> any<00:03:45.870> sort

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
they're lubricated if there's any sort

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.470 
they're lubricated if there's any sort
of<00:03:46.349> you<00:03:46.799> know<00:03:46.829> signs<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.579> warning<00:03:48.060> signs<00:03:48.269> of

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
of you know signs of warning signs of

of you know signs of warning signs of
failure<00:03:48.709> a<00:03:49.709> good<00:03:50.400> time<00:03:50.609> to<00:03:50.760> think<00:03:50.940> about<00:03:51.150> doing

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
failure a good time to think about doing

failure a good time to think about doing
it<00:03:51.540> while<00:03:51.690> you've<00:03:51.870> got<00:03:51.900> your<00:03:52.079> retooling

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650
