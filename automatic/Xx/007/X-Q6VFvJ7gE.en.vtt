00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.570
 I got this kind of thing 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.900

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.189

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.050

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.090
 I can personally thank him personally 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.320
 because he lives in another city but I 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.269
 I think dude us there still necessarily 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.340
 meet and the first time I thought that 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.009
 I troll how to write to give 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.750
 the console there is all that I thought it was 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.210
 some joke but no stitching 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.879
 really turned out to be very kind and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.180
 a generous man after all give a console 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.710
 absolutely stranger but in 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.410
 principle not familiar because we personally 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.420
 not familiar this is just super generosity in 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.149
 general now let's talk a little about 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.489
 I took the console yaponochku because 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.050
 as far as I know the Japanese version is more 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.800
 well, as they say 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:03.420

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.740

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.619

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.939
 fifa 14 fifa 14 x gene is the only one 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.909
 mountain for which I took this console 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.630

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.100
 Any kill zone and I'm not interested 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.020
 What else can I actually say 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.820
 on this gamepad and and it is not very comfortable 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.630
 but I think I'll get used to it or 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.409
 wait for some analog from x-box 360 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.829
 buy a joystick included here 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.980

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.570
 small and 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.390
