that's<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> side<00:00:57.840> there<00:00:58.140> that's

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
that's just the side there that's

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.219

falling<00:00:58.949> apart

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.219 

okay<00:01:04.260> back<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.390> added<00:01:06.390> these<00:01:06.479> red<00:01:06.780> bits<00:01:06.960> as

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
okay back on added these red bits as

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.410 
okay back on added these red bits as
well<00:01:07.260> for<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> bit<00:01:07.920> more<00:01:08.100> color<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.210> drunk

air<00:01:09.600> holds<00:01:09.930> these<00:01:10.140> two<00:01:10.350> bits<00:01:10.530> together<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.610> it

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
air holds these two bits together so it

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.600 
air holds these two bits together so it
doesn't<00:01:12.030> hold<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.659> event<00:01:12.960> now<00:01:13.110> but

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
doesn't hold on to this event now but

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.600 
doesn't hold on to this event now but
they<00:01:14.610> go<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:15.680> they<00:01:16.680> find<00:01:16.890> myself<00:01:17.310> don't

exactly<00:01:17.850> work<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.390> set<00:01:18.630> because<00:01:18.920> just

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
exactly work on this set because just

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.910

clean<00:02:28.010> Wilkinson<00:02:28.459> once<00:02:29.020> you<00:02:30.020> get<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.410> there

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
clean Wilkinson once you get to there

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.110 
clean Wilkinson once you get to there
and<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:30.950> get<00:02:31.130> no<00:02:31.250> one<00:02:31.400> on<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.610> side

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
and you get no one on the side

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.040 
and you get no one on the side
I<00:02:33.670> think<00:02:34.670> this<00:02:34.880> here<00:02:35.360> isn't<00:02:35.600> meant<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.900> be

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
I think this here isn't meant to be

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.810 
I think this here isn't meant to be
where<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.350> can<00:02:36.440> hold<00:02:36.739> it<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.130> push<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.310> but

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
where you can hold it and push it but

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.920 
where you can hold it and push it but
what<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.150> can<00:02:38.510> do<00:02:38.750> is<00:02:38.989> if<00:02:39.410> you<00:02:39.560> take<00:02:39.800> this<00:02:40.190> back

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
what you can do is if you take this back

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.910 
what you can do is if you take this back
back<00:02:41.930> piece<00:02:42.230> off<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.900> could<00:02:45.110> probably<00:02:45.620> get

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
back piece off you could probably get

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.680 
back piece off you could probably get
something<00:02:46.190> like<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.610> pole<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.239> go<00:02:47.390> through<00:02:47.600> the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
something like a pole to go through the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.170 
something like a pole to go through the
bomb<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.200> then<00:02:48.440> fix<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.550> up<00:02:49.670> at<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.820> bottom<00:02:50.000> so

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
bomb and then fix it up at the bottom so

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.290 
bomb and then fix it up at the bottom so
it<00:02:50.270> doesn't<00:02:50.300> slide<00:02:50.780> through<00:02:51.970> then<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.120> get

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
it doesn't slide through then you get

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.210 
it doesn't slide through then you get
pause<00:02:53.570> up<00:02:53.840> there<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.230> get<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.440> gun<00:02:54.860> sticking

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
pause up there and get the gun sticking

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.490 
pause up there and get the gun sticking
out<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:56.209> it'd<00:02:56.420> be<00:02:56.450> like<00:02:56.600> he's<00:02:56.930> man<00:02:57.110> in<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.320> back

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
out so it'd be like he's man in the back

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.620 
out so it'd be like he's man in the back
which<00:02:58.280> is<00:02:58.400> pretty<00:02:58.430> cool<00:02:58.790> but<00:02:59.030> I<00:02:59.239> like<00:02:59.270> it<00:02:59.600> like

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
which is pretty cool but I like it like

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.160 
which is pretty cool but I like it like
that

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.270 

so<00:03:03.170> I'll<00:03:03.260> probably<00:03:03.440> keep<00:03:03.650> this<00:03:03.800> and<00:03:04.040> put<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.190> on

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
so I'll probably keep this and put it on

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.590 
so I'll probably keep this and put it on
my<00:03:04.400> playing<00:03:04.640> army<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:05.269> want<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.480> make<00:03:05.570> a

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
my playing army and I want to make a

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.080 
my playing army and I want to make a
clone<00:03:05.870> army<00:03:06.019> video<00:03:06.440> she<00:03:06.530> knows<00:03:06.950> after<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:07.940> lot<00:03:08.060> a

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
clone army video she knows after a lot a

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.390 
clone army video she knows after a lot a
few<00:03:08.330> more<00:03:08.480> sets

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
few more sets

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.460 
few more sets
it's<00:03:10.400> pretty<00:03:10.640> cool<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:11.510> share<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:11.930> from<00:03:12.110> every

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
it's pretty cool to share it from every

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.410 
it's pretty cool to share it from every
side<00:03:12.680> basically<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:13.459> these<00:03:13.820> push<00:03:14.090> me<00:03:14.269> about

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
side basically and these push me about

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.840 
side basically and these push me about
the<00:03:14.540> wheels<00:03:14.780> agenda<00:03:15.769> around<00:03:16.010> halfway<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:16.760> if

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
the wheels agenda around halfway so if

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.850 
the wheels agenda around halfway so if
you<00:03:16.940> look<00:03:17.060> for<00:03:17.090> clone<00:03:17.510> Walker<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:17.959> could<00:03:18.170> make

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
you look for clone Walker you could make

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.150 
you look for clone Walker you could make
it<00:03:18.980> go<00:03:19.010> all<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.370> way<00:03:19.400> around<00:03:19.640> there<00:03:19.850> yes<00:03:20.180> I
