them just be great what's been the
toughest<00:00:23.400> transition<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.060> from<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.900> way

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
toughest transition going from the way

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.480 
toughest transition going from the way
you<00:00:25.080> punt<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.560> all<00:00:25.680> t<00:00:25.830> ball<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.310> way<00:00:26.430> you

you punt and all t ball to the way you

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.000 
you punt and all t ball to the way you
put<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.820> one's<00:00:27.500> probably<00:00:28.500> probably<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
put this one's probably probably the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.740 
put this one's probably probably the
bowl<00:00:29.220> itself<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.910> australian<00:00:30.330> bowls<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.630> bit

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
bowl itself the australian bowls a bit

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.220 
bowl itself the australian bowls a bit
bigger<00:00:31.880> it's<00:00:32.880> got<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> bigger<00:00:33.660> sweet<00:00:33.960> spot

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
bigger it's got like a bigger sweet spot

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.290 
bigger it's got like a bigger sweet spot
on<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.590> easy<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.950> hit<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.969> ball

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
on it's easy to hit so this this ball

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.110 
on it's easy to hit so this this ball
just<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.829> wraps<00:00:38.309> around<00:00:38.550> threats<00:00:38.969> just

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
just just wraps around threats just

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.610 
just just wraps around threats just
getting<00:00:39.390> used<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> american<00:00:40.140> ball<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.530> was

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
getting used to the american ball it was

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.049 
getting used to the american ball it was
probably<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.950> biggest<00:00:41.129> thing<00:00:41.309> biggest

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
probably the biggest thing biggest

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.119 
probably the biggest thing biggest

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.670 
sort of predict the ball bouncing
forward<00:03:24.480> or<00:03:24.569> back<00:03:24.750> I'm<00:03:25.050> obviously<00:03:25.260> on<00:03:25.650> a

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
forward or back I'm obviously on a

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.720 
forward or back I'm obviously on a
longer<00:03:25.920> punt<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.310> want<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.580> bounce

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
longer punt you want it to bounce

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.400 
longer punt you want it to bounce
forward<00:03:27.000> if<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.239> hits<00:03:27.420> whereas<00:03:27.930> its<00:03:28.140> short

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
forward if it hits whereas its short

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.710 
forward if it hits whereas its short
upon<00:03:28.680> trying<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.340> paint<00:03:29.519> him<00:03:29.610> if<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.330> hits<00:03:30.599> you

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
upon trying to paint him if it hits you

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.059 
upon trying to paint him if it hits you
want<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:30.989> kick<00:03:31.200> back<00:03:31.349> so<00:03:31.590> yeah<00:03:31.739> there's

different things that I can practice to

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.420 
different things that I can practice to
try<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.350> get<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.590> bounce<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:34.890> on<00:03:34.950> looking<00:03:35.220> for

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
try and get to bounce it on looking for

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.610 
try and get to bounce it on looking for
so<00:03:36.090> many<00:03:36.150> techniques<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:36.870> Australian<00:03:37.500> rules

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
that I use when we pointed from like the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.490 
that I use when we pointed from like the
50<00:03:52.230> in<00:03:52.640> that<00:03:53.640> not<00:03:53.790> many<00:03:54.170> American<00:03:55.170> guys<00:03:55.290> are

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
the traditional torpedo spiral sort of

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.650 
the traditional torpedo spiral sort of
fun<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:59.100> think<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.430> helps<00:03:59.790> what's<00:04:00.569> your
