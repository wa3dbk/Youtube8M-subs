 Well, let's start 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:12.039
 we also need a power adapter 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:12.039
 here he is returning him too 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:35.410

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.390

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.859
 I also want to note that there is no key 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:49.130
 off and on is a little bit 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:53.060
 inconvenient after connecting the cable 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.970
 ethernet to the router is already in this 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.950

 mouth 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.870
 for starters, I advise you to flash the router 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:44.210
 since this firmware is very 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.790
 unstable and sometimes lays network well 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:50.570
