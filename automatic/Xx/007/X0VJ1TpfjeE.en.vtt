USB port power switch and an LED for
just<00:00:19.740> added<00:00:20.039> functionality<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:21.180> added<00:00:21.720> a

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
just added functionality I have added a

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.390 
just added functionality I have added a
switch<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> inside<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.630> here<00:00:24.920> so<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.160> if

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
switch on the inside of here so that if

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.240 
switch on the inside of here so that if
I<00:00:26.580> don't<00:00:26.789> want<00:00:27.029> an<00:00:27.960> LED<00:00:28.410> shining<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.130> my<00:00:29.160> face

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
I don't want an LED shining in my face

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.310 
I don't want an LED shining in my face
so<00:00:29.670> I'm<00:00:29.730> trying<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.090> sleep<00:00:30.210> whatever<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:31.109> a

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
so I'm trying to sleep whatever in a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.690 
so I'm trying to sleep whatever in a
tent<00:00:31.560> something<00:00:31.949> trying<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.189> charge<00:00:32.399> my<00:00:32.579> phone

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
tent something trying to charge my phone

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.630 
tent something trying to charge my phone
or<00:00:32.910> iPod<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.450> don't<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> slight<00:00:35.280> shining<00:00:35.579> in

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
or iPod I don't have a slight shining in

or iPod I don't have a slight shining in
my<00:00:35.670> face<00:00:35.760> skin<00:00:36.690> also<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:37.050> work<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
my face skin also just work is a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.470 
my face skin also just work is a
flashlight<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:39.149> that's<00:00:39.300> pretty<00:00:39.540> bright<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:42.059> I

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
flashlight see that's pretty bright so I

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.049 
flashlight see that's pretty bright so I
will<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.469> show<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.460> does<00:00:44.820> actually

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
will just show that it does actually

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.819 
will just show that it does actually
work<00:00:46.039> get<00:00:47.039> my<00:00:47.160> phone<00:00:49.550> plug<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:52.440> it

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
work get my phone plug it in and it

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.610 
work get my phone plug it in and it
starts<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.280> charge<00:00:54.620> once<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.680> hit<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> switch

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
starts to charge once I hit the switch

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.369 
starts to charge once I hit the switch
and<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.460> turn<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.850> off<00:00:59.879> and

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
and you can just turn it off and

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.590 
and you can just turn it off and
obviously<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.500> stops<00:01:02.210> now<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.390> will<00:01:03.480> work

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
obviously it stops now this will work

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.620 
obviously it stops now this will work
for<00:01:03.660> an<00:01:03.960> ipod<00:01:04.379> touch<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.090> what<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
for an ipod touch to what you have to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.590 
for an ipod touch to what you have to
add<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.110> resistor<00:01:07.770> show<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.760> what<00:01:08.939> kind<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
add a resistor show you what kind and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.410 
add a resistor show you what kind and
how<00:01:09.860> in<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.979> second<00:01:13.070> you<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.340> flick<00:01:15.270> that

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
how in a second you just flick that

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.090 
how in a second you just flick that
switch<00:01:15.720> takes<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.290> couple<00:01:16.439> seconds<00:01:16.830> from<00:01:16.950> my

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
switch takes a couple seconds from my

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.920 
switch takes a couple seconds from my
ipod<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:18.439> starts<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.500> charge<00:01:20.659> again<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.780> can

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
ipod and starts to charge again you can

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.800 
ipod and starts to charge again you can
have<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.229> led<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:23.390> or<00:01:24.390> not<00:01:25.460> turn<00:01:26.460> off<00:01:28.280> yeah

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
have that led on or not turn off yeah

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.039 
have that led on or not turn off yeah
this<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> schematic<00:01:31.259> amid<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.270> can<00:01:33.630> wire

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
this is a schematic amid so you can wire

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.399 
this is a schematic amid so you can wire
this<00:01:34.290> up<00:01:34.500> however<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.009> want<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.810> goes<00:01:36.810> from<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
this up however you want it goes from a

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.030 
this up however you want it goes from a
9-volt<00:01:38.130> battery<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:40.020> negative<00:01:40.500> lead<00:01:40.710> will<00:01:40.920> go

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
9-volt battery the negative lead will go

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.179 
9-volt battery the negative lead will go
to<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.310> first<00:01:41.579> prong<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.329> your<00:01:42.829> 5<00:01:43.829> volt

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
to the first prong on your 5 volt

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.770 
to the first prong on your 5 volt
voltage<00:01:44.640> regulator<00:01:45.149> that's<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.600> right

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
voltage regulator that's that right

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.359 
voltage regulator that's that right
there<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.670> then<00:01:47.670> you're<00:01:49.100> positively<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
there and then you're positively the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.160 
there and then you're positively the
ground<00:01:50.610> will<00:01:51.210> go<00:01:51.329> through<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> switch<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.079> up

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
ground will go through a switch and up

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.630 
ground will go through a switch and up
to<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.680> second<00:01:53.220> prong<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:56.399> 5<00:01:56.610> volt

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
to the second prong and the 5 volt

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.389 
to the second prong and the 5 volt
voltage<00:01:57.210> regulator<00:01:57.740> takes<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.890> from<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.189> nine

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
voltage regulator takes it from the nine

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.170 
voltage regulator takes it from the nine
volts<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.000> drops<00:02:00.600> down<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.619> 5<00:02:02.070> volts<00:02:02.100> which<00:02:03.000> is

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
volts and drops down to 5 volts which is

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.389 
volts and drops down to 5 volts which is
pretty<00:02:03.390> much<00:02:03.509> what<00:02:03.869> any<00:02:04.170> USB<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.159> going<00:02:05.340> to

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
pretty much what any USB is going to

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.660 
pretty much what any USB is going to
charge<00:02:05.640> off<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.740> now<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:07.920> 5<00:02:08.220> volts

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
charge off of so now you have 5 volts

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.460 
charge off of so now you have 5 volts
and<00:02:11.270> you<00:02:12.270> come<00:02:12.540> out

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
and you come out

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.810 
and you come out
with<00:02:14.070> your<00:02:14.250> negative<00:02:14.610> lead<00:02:14.990> goes<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
with your negative lead goes to the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.540 
with your negative lead goes to the
fourth<00:02:17.820> prong<00:02:18.150> or<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.560> red<00:02:19.710> wire<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.250> your

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
fourth prong or the red wire on your

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.450 
fourth prong or the red wire on your
female<00:02:21.000> USB<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:22.620> comes<00:02:22.860> out<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.130> third

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
female USB it comes out of the third

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.390 
female USB it comes out of the third
right<00:02:23.970> there<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.390> then<00:02:25.230> right<00:02:25.590> here<00:02:25.950> out<00:02:26.220> of

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
right there and then right here out of

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.650 
right there and then right here out of
your<00:02:26.550> second<00:02:26.880> prong<00:02:27.060> you're<00:02:27.270> going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.450> take<00:02:27.630> a

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
your second prong you're going to take a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.420

you're<00:02:37.140> going<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.350> have<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.620> add<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:38.040> 330<00:02:38.730> ohm

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
you're going to have to add a 330 ohm

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.550 
you're going to have to add a 330 ohm
resistor<00:02:39.770> from<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.920> third<00:02:41.190> prong<00:02:41.570> to<00:02:42.570> either

if it's going to be the second or third

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.370 
if it's going to be the second or third
because<00:02:50.459> mine<00:02:50.840> as<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.590> can<00:02:52.740> see<00:02:52.950> right<00:02:52.980> here

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
because mine as you can see right here

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.030 
because mine as you can see right here
actually<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.410> don't<00:02:55.470> know<00:02:55.560> if<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.740> can<00:02:55.860> see

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
actually I don't know if you can see

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.560 
actually I don't know if you can see
that<00:02:56.070> but<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.400> just<00:02:56.430> spliced<00:02:56.940> my<00:02:57.150> mind's<00:02:57.450> not

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
that but I just spliced my mind's not

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.890 
that but I just spliced my mind's not
with<00:02:57.870> prongs<00:02:58.170> swine<00:02:59.040> has<00:02:59.280> the<00:03:00.180> four<00:03:00.420> colors<00:03:00.750> as

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
with prongs swine has the four colors as

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.180 
with prongs swine has the four colors as
red<00:03:01.170> blue<00:03:01.890> red<00:03:02.220> black<00:03:02.850> white<00:03:03.270> and<00:03:04.230> green<00:03:04.590> for

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
red blue red black white and green for

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.550 
red blue red black white and green for
me<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.640> just<00:03:06.450> had<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.600> solder<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.230> my<00:03:07.350> white

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
me I just had to solder that to my white

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.500 
me I just had to solder that to my white
wire<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:08.459> if<00:03:08.520> you<00:03:08.610> have<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:08.970> set<00:03:09.240> it<00:03:09.390> to

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
wire so if you have that you set it to

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.570 
wire so if you have that you set it to
the<00:03:09.600> white<00:03:09.780> if<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.830> don't<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.250> can<00:03:11.370> just

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
the white if you don't you can just

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.160 
the white if you don't you can just
start<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.910> right<00:03:12.030> there<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.720> just<00:03:12.750> touch

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
start it right there and you just touch

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.100 
start it right there and you just touch
it<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.410> each<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.860> prongs<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.810> see<00:03:15.810> how<00:03:15.959> it

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
it to each of the prongs and see how it

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.310 
it to each of the prongs and see how it
works<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.970> can<00:03:18.090> see<00:03:18.269> here<00:03:18.480> how<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.630> wired<00:03:19.080> up

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
works you can see here how I wired up

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.940 
works you can see here how I wired up
the<00:03:20.090> LED<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.360> need<00:03:22.350> you're<00:03:22.590> going<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.800> need<00:03:22.920> a

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
the LED you need you're going to need a

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.759 
the LED you need you're going to need a
hundred<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:23.640> fifty<00:03:23.910> k<00:03:24.120> resistor<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:25.709> you

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
hundred and fifty k resistor so that you

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.340 
hundred and fifty k resistor so that you
don't<00:03:25.920> fry<00:03:26.190> your<00:03:26.400> LED<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.090> don't<00:03:27.959> really<00:03:28.080> need

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
don't fry your LED you don't really need

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.750 
don't fry your LED you don't really need
you<00:03:28.500> don't<00:03:28.620> even<00:03:28.709> need<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.010> LED<00:03:29.280> but<00:03:29.489> i<00:03:29.519> like

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
you don't even need the LED but i like

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.120 
you don't even need the LED but i like
it<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.209> can<00:03:31.140> add<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.350> switch<00:03:31.590> like<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:31.950> did

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
it and you can add the switch like I did

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.670 
it and you can add the switch like I did
I<00:03:32.310> don't<00:03:32.550> know<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.940> don't<00:03:33.120> need<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.330> either

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
I don't know you don't need that either

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.509 
I don't know you don't need that either
and<00:03:36.230> yeah<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.440> pretty<00:03:37.709> much<00:03:37.860> how<00:03:38.310> you
