hopefully in candy purple what else

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.730 
hopefully in candy purple what else
there's<00:01:46.899> not<00:01:46.990> much<00:01:47.109> else<00:01:47.259> to<00:01:47.350> say<00:01:47.529> about<00:01:47.590> it

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740

car
in<00:01:50.859> the<00:01:51.959> engine<00:01:52.959> bay<00:01:53.139> I<00:01:53.170> think<00:01:53.529> it's<00:01:53.649> a<00:01:53.709> ram<00:01:54.009> air

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
in the engine bay I think it's a ram air

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.609 
in the engine bay I think it's a ram air
intake<00:01:55.209> I've<00:01:55.630> done<00:01:55.840> about<00:01:55.929> to<00:01:56.109> change<00:01:56.319> you<00:01:56.469> for

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
intake I've done about to change you for

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.269 
intake I've done about to change you for
a<00:01:56.649> K&amp;N<00:01:57.899> I'm<00:01:58.899> used<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.319> enclosed<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.099> it's<00:02:00.159> an

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:00.279 
a K&amp;N I'm used to enclosed and it's an

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:01.679 
a K&amp;N I'm used to enclosed and it's an
open<00:02:00.399> one<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:00.819> does<00:02:00.939> sound<00:02:01.179> good<00:02:01.329> though<00:02:01.509> and

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
open one it does sound good though and

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.569 
open one it does sound good though and
so<00:02:02.319> I<00:02:02.349> might<00:02:02.529> leave<00:02:02.679> it<00:02:02.859> the<00:02:03.009> interior<00:02:04.049> is

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
so I might leave it the interior is

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.100 
so I might leave it the interior is
obviously<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.729> 180<00:02:07.060> interior<00:02:07.630> is<00:02:07.810> really

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
obviously the 180 interior is really

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.810 
obviously the 180 interior is really
nice<00:02:08.229> seats<00:02:08.890> have<00:02:09.040> got<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.190> slight<00:02:09.400> bobble<00:02:09.580> in

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
on bobbling on

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.580 
on bobbling on
so<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:11.950> could<00:02:12.220> do<00:02:12.370> with<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:14.760> one<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.850> them<00:02:15.940> till

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
so you could do with a one of them till

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.810 
so you could do with a one of them till
grinder<00:02:17.590> things<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:18.040> rub<00:02:18.310> over<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.580> top<00:02:18.790> of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820
