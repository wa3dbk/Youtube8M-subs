well I think really all games that done

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.470 
well I think really all games that done
illegally<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.640> where<00:00:53.879> we're<00:00:54.059> big<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.449> mean

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
illegally one where we're big I mean

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.119 
illegally one where we're big I mean
obviously<00:00:54.989> Game<00:00:55.260> two<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.100> don't

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
obviously Game two with you is you don't

the goal from from down sorell so I was

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.660 
the goal from from down sorell so I was
it<00:01:48.900> was<00:01:49.050> tough<00:01:49.260> to<00:01:49.440> watch<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.979> then<00:01:50.160> a<00:01:50.190> minute

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
it was tough to watch but then a minute

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.780 
it was tough to watch but then a minute
per<00:01:50.820> minute<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:51.210> maybe<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:52.020> make<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.259> place

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790
