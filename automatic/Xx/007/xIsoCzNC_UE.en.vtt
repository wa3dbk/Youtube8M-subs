unacceptable<00:04:42.220> but<00:04:43.220> I<00:04:43.280> can<00:04:43.460> rip<00:04:43.669> it<00:04:43.789> into<00:04:43.910> the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
unacceptable but I can rip it into the

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.820 
unacceptable but I can rip it into the
gap<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.510> I<00:04:45.169> can<00:04:45.350> beat<00:04:45.590> them<00:04:45.710> out

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830

that's my gift speed is my gift hitting
is<00:04:50.129> what<00:04:50.280> I<00:04:50.310> can<00:04:50.520> improve<00:04:50.639> on<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:52.819> let's<00:04:53.819> make

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
is what I can improve on so let's make

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.029 
is what I can improve on so let's make
the<00:04:54.090> most<00:04:54.240> of<00:04:54.389> it<00:04:54.569> obviously<00:04:55.500> this<00:04:55.650> Fresno

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:04.129 

as<00:06:00.539> the<00:06:00.779> month<00:06:00.960> winds<00:06:01.409> down<00:06:01.650> and<00:06:02.690> I<00:06:03.690> just<00:06:03.719> keep

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
as the month winds down and I just keep

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:06.589
