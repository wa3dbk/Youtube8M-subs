it's going to grab some where no matter
what<00:04:50.300> I<00:04:50.509> mean<00:04:50.800> unless<00:04:51.800> you<00:04:52.129> grab<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.520> whole<00:04:52.639> of

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
what I mean unless you grab the whole of

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.659

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
pretty much hold on to it so when I

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.230 
pretty much hold on to it so when I
first<00:05:02.479> receive<00:05:03.110> it<00:05:03.319> yesterday<00:05:03.740> I<00:05:04.240> wasn't

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
first receive it yesterday I wasn't

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.379 
first receive it yesterday I wasn't
entirely<00:05:05.449> sure<00:05:05.659> I<00:05:05.930> would<00:05:06.169> like<00:05:06.409> it<00:05:06.620> because<00:05:07.389> it

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
entirely sure I would like it because it

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.920 
entirely sure I would like it because it
really<00:05:08.659> kind<00:05:08.990> of<00:05:09.110> felt<00:05:10.030> flimsy<00:05:11.030> almost<00:05:11.419> but

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
really kind of felt flimsy almost but

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.879 
really kind of felt flimsy almost but
the<00:05:12.050> fact<00:05:12.259> is<00:05:12.530> it's<00:05:12.949> it's<00:05:13.879> solid<00:05:14.889> just

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
the fact is it's it's solid just

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.390 
the fact is it's it's solid just
incredibly<00:05:16.250> light<00:05:17.860> as<00:05:18.860> you<00:05:18.919> can<00:05:19.099> see<00:05:19.220> there's

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
incredibly light as you can see there's

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.950 
incredibly light as you can see there's
no<00:05:19.490> blade<00:05:20.120> play<00:05:21.039> these<00:05:22.039> skills<00:05:22.759> even<00:05:23.750> though

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
no blade play these skills even though

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:32.710 
no blade play these skills even though
they're<00:05:24.169> so<00:05:24.349> thin<00:05:24.740> they<00:05:24.770> are<00:05:25.159> not<00:05:25.460> moving

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.070 

although<00:05:33.500> it's<00:05:33.710> a<00:05:33.860> little<00:05:33.890> bit<00:05:34.250> more<00:05:34.840> flashy<00:05:35.840> I

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
although it's a little bit more flashy I

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:43.030 
although it's a little bit more flashy I
guess<00:05:36.440> be<00:05:37.190> the<00:05:39.820> term<00:05:40.820> abused<00:05:41.860> then<00:05:42.860> I<00:05:42.980> would

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
guess be the term abused then I would

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.720 
guess be the term abused then I would
normally<00:05:43.400> carry<00:05:43.940> I<00:05:44.410> mean<00:05:45.410> normally<00:05:45.650> I<00:05:45.890> i<00:05:46.280> carry

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
normally carry I mean normally I i carry

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.100 
normally carry I mean normally I i carry

the Kershaw shallots of a playing
stainless<00:05:51.770> steel<00:05:54.310> nothing<00:05:55.310> fancy<00:05:55.550> which<00:05:56.270> is

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
stainless steel nothing fancy which is

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:07.890 
stainless steel nothing fancy which is

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.780 

it's<00:06:08.470> collector<00:06:08.979> space<00:06:09.250> basically<00:06:09.610> I

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
it's collector space basically I

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.560 
it's collector space basically I
wouldn't<00:06:10.270> I<00:06:11.250> don't<00:06:12.250> know<00:06:12.370> that<00:06:12.550> every<00:06:12.910> VC<00:06:13.449> it

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
wouldn't I don't know that every VC it

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.550 
wouldn't I don't know that every VC it
it's<00:06:14.500> not<00:06:14.680> a<00:06:14.740> working<00:06:15.160> knife<00:06:16.259> so<00:06:17.259> there<00:06:17.410> you<00:06:17.500> go

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
it's not a working knife so there you go

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:23.580 
it's not a working knife so there you go
those<00:06:18.520> are<00:06:18.669> those<00:06:19.919> um<00:06:20.919> so<00:06:22.080> that's<00:06:23.080> it<00:06:23.350> i'm

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
those are those um so that's it i'm

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.409 
those are those um so that's it i'm
probably<00:06:24.039> going<00:06:24.250> to<00:06:24.340> have<00:06:24.490> another<00:06:24.789> video<00:06:25.240> up

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
probably going to have another video up

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.219 
probably going to have another video up
as<00:06:25.600> well<00:06:26.340> then<00:06:27.340> this<00:06:27.550> mess<00:06:27.940> i'm<00:06:28.150> fixing<00:06:28.960> to<00:06:28.990> put

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:29.229 
as well then this mess i'm fixing to put

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:38.189 
as well then this mess i'm fixing to put
on<00:06:29.410> the<00:06:33.389> sling<00:06:34.389> lock<00:06:35.460> whatever<00:06:36.460> adapter<00:06:37.330> for

on the sling lock whatever adapter for
my<00:06:38.259> ar-15<00:06:42.720> that's<00:06:43.720> basically<00:06:44.020> it<00:06:44.139> take<00:06:44.440> care

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
my ar-15 that's basically it take care
