00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.280 

you

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.840 

this<00:00:55.290> section<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> trench<00:00:56.220> is<00:00:56.430> actually

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
this section of the trench is actually

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.630 
this section of the trench is actually
the<00:00:57.329> most<00:00:57.540> important<00:00:58.230> part<00:00:58.290> that's<00:00:59.280> why<00:00:59.460> we're

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
the most important part that's why we're

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.310 
the most important part that's why we're
running<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.970> trencher<00:01:00.360> over<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.989> also

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
running the trencher over here and also

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.049 
running the trencher over here and also
it<00:01:01.440> was<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.739> muddy<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.220> wet<00:01:02.580> on<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:02.910> other

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
it was so muddy and wet on the other

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.640 
it was so muddy and wet on the other
side<00:01:03.330> that<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.629> could<00:01:03.900> not<00:01:04.050> run<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.410> trench

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
side that we could not run the trench

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.980 
side that we could not run the trench
here<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:04.920> had<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.190> dig<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.519> by<00:01:05.700> hand<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.780> this

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
here we had to dig that by hand but this

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.780 
here we had to dig that by hand but this
line<00:01:07.200> needs<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.680> fairly<00:01:07.950> deep<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.550> we<00:01:08.580> have

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
line needs to be fairly deep so we have

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.150 
line needs to be fairly deep so we have
a<00:01:08.820> good<00:01:09.090> discharge<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.200> gravity<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.800> really

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
a good discharge and gravity can really

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
a good discharge and gravity can really
pull<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.580> water<00:01:11.850> away<00:01:13.490> one<00:01:14.490> guy's<00:01:14.670> trenching

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
pull this water away one guy's trenching

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.969 
pull this water away one guy's trenching
which<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.479> me<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.020> another<00:01:16.259> guy<00:01:16.440> comes<00:01:16.740> back

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
which is me the another guy comes back

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.670 
which is me the another guy comes back
with<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> small<00:01:17.729> six-inch<00:01:18.360> shovel<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.960> cleans

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
down on the bottom so that that water

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.820 
down on the bottom so that that water
can<00:01:23.400> drain<00:01:23.580> quite<00:01:24.180> quickly<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.900> easily<00:01:25.259> from

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
little base down in the gravel so when

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.100 
little base down in the gravel so when
you're<00:02:28.519> installing<00:02:28.730> your<00:02:29.030> perforated<00:02:29.900> pipe

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
you're installing your perforated pipe

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.440 
you're installing your perforated pipe
always<00:02:31.069> make<00:02:31.280> sure<00:02:31.459> that<00:02:31.610> your<00:02:31.790> holes<00:02:32.090> are

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
always make sure that your holes are

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.610 
always make sure that your holes are
pointing<00:02:33.019> down<00:02:33.050> into<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.709> gravel<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:36.260> reason

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
pointing down into the gravel the reason

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.890 
pointing down into the gravel the reason
why<00:02:36.800> is<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:37.160> water<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.180> going<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.360> flood<00:02:38.630> up

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
why is that water is going to flood up

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.979 
why is that water is going to flood up
through<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.010> gravel<00:02:40.459> into<00:02:40.940> your<00:02:41.330> pipe<00:02:41.569> it

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
through the gravel into your pipe it

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.420 
through the gravel into your pipe it
doesn't<00:02:42.170> there's<00:02:42.530> no<00:02:42.709> way<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.040> that<00:02:43.190> water

all the water from the yard comes back

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.120 
all the water from the yard comes back
and<00:04:55.030> gathers<00:04:55.479> in<00:04:55.750> this<00:04:56.080> low<00:04:56.320> spot<00:04:56.380> where<00:04:57.010> it's

going on here this system should last
for<00:05:14.620> years<00:05:14.770> to<00:05:14.889> come
