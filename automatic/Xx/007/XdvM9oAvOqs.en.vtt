00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
method number two is the way that jury

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.180 
method number two is the way that jury
recommend<00:00:09.839> and<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.740> go<00:00:10.889> into<00:00:11.099> your

recommend and that is you go into your

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.400 
recommend and that is you go into your
programming<00:00:11.870> so<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.990> depending<00:00:13.290> on<00:00:13.320> the

you some options and one of them is

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.410 
you some options and one of them is
clean<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> milk<00:00:26.400> system<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:27.060> should<00:00:27.090> click

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
clean the milk system you should click

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.519 
clean the milk system you should click
on<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.470> then<00:00:28.619> asks<00:00:29.009> you<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.340> put<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.670> 15<00:00:30.119> moles

on and then asks you to put in 15 moles

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.200 
on and then asks you to put in 15 moles
with<00:00:31.529> 250<00:00:32.400> moles<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:33.660> I'm<00:00:33.840> going<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.969> just<00:00:35.969> put

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
with 250 moles so I'm going to just put

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:45.460 
with 250 moles so I'm going to just put
the<00:00:36.360> 15<00:00:36.780> moles<00:00:37.020> in

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.580 

top<00:00:46.340> that<00:00:46.550> would<00:00:46.970> at<00:00:47.300> least<00:00:47.330> not<00:00:47.690> quite<00:00:47.960> 250

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
top that would at least not quite 250

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:57.520 
top that would at least not quite 250
miles<00:00:52.090> put<00:00:53.090> that<00:00:53.240> in<00:00:53.620> and<00:00:55.690> then<00:00:56.690> once<00:00:57.320> you've

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
miles put that in and then once you've

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.670 
miles put that in and then once you've
done<00:00:57.680> this<00:00:57.860> you<00:00:58.070> can<00:00:58.100> press<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.610> button<00:00:59.680> sorry

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
done this you can press the button sorry

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:25.040 
done this you can press the button sorry
next<00:01:03.160> person<00:01:04.160> next

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.540 

what<00:01:26.050> this<00:01:26.170> does<00:01:26.350> is<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.620> cleans<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:27.160> system

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
what this does is it cleans the system

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.000 
what this does is it cleans the system
once<00:01:27.730> includes<00:01:28.150> it<00:01:28.300> again<00:01:28.600> it's<00:01:29.500> like<00:01:29.680> you<00:01:29.740> get

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
once includes it again it's like you get

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.360 
once includes it again it's like you get
in<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:30.960> other<00:01:31.960> machines<00:01:32.440> that<00:01:32.590> have<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:32.740> slower

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
in the other machines that have a slower

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.170 
in the other machines that have a slower
process<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:36.040> while<00:01:36.400> I<00:01:36.430> prefer<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:36.970> do<00:01:37.090> the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
process and while I prefer to do the

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.060 
process and while I prefer to do the
milk<00:01:37.390> frothing<00:01:38.140> because<00:01:38.440> I've<00:01:38.560> got<00:01:38.710> control

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
milk frothing because I've got control

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.100 
milk frothing because I've got control
of<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:41.940> this<00:01:42.940> will<00:01:43.120> not<00:01:43.270> into<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.720> cup<00:01:43.930> and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
of it this will not into the cup and

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.810 
of it this will not into the cup and
then<00:01:44.200> it'll<00:01:44.500> ask<00:01:44.590> you<00:01:44.770> to<00:01:44.830> clean<00:01:45.160> here<00:01:45.550> almost

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
then it'll ask you to clean here almost

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:54.150 
then it'll ask you to clean here almost
like<00:01:46.060> we<00:01:46.150> did<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.420> first<00:01:46.570> time<00:01:53.100> okay<00:01:54.100> so

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
like we did the first time okay so

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.970 
like we did the first time okay so
that's<00:01:54.430> his<00:01:54.700> water<00:01:55.000> for<00:01:55.420> cleaning<00:01:55.630> system<00:01:56.590> see

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
that's his water for cleaning system see

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.390 
that's his water for cleaning system see
you<00:01:57.070> tend<00:01:57.310> use<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.640> full<00:01:57.850> 250<00:01:58.330> miles<00:01:59.400> although

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
you tend use the full 250 miles although

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.760 
you tend use the full 250 miles although
those<00:02:00.700> roughly<00:02:01.240> two<00:02:01.450> vegetables<00:02:01.630> so<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.590> just

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
those roughly two vegetables so you just

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.190 
those roughly two vegetables so you just
basically<00:02:02.970> take<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.120> cup<00:02:04.540> spec<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.140> you

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
basically take the cup spec and you

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.860 
basically take the cup spec and you
crema<00:02:05.590> not<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.160> then<00:02:06.730> you<00:02:06.880> proceed<00:02:07.540> just<00:02:07.750> now

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
crema not and then you proceed just now

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.410 
crema not and then you proceed just now
so<00:02:08.080> I'm<00:02:08.170> gonna<00:02:08.320> go<00:02:08.470> do<00:02:08.619> that<00:02:08.830> just<00:02:09.490> wait<00:02:09.640> okay

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
so I'm gonna go do that just wait okay

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.960 
so I'm gonna go do that just wait okay
now<00:02:11.080> put<00:02:11.410> what's<00:02:11.650> in<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.980> sauce<00:02:12.310> clean<00:02:12.790> that

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
now put what's in the sauce clean that

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.630 
now put what's in the sauce clean that
gloss<00:02:13.210> out<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.750> I'm<00:02:13.900> ready<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.140> go<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:15.310> take

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
gloss out and I'm ready to go and take

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.300 
gloss out and I'm ready to go and take
on<00:02:15.850> next

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.800 

this<00:02:23.260> this<00:02:24.260> method<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:25.819> main<00:02:26.000> difference<00:02:26.480> is

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
this this method the main difference is

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.860 
this this method the main difference is
that<00:02:27.310> uses<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.430> colder<00:02:28.940> water<00:02:29.180> or<00:02:29.540> in<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.720> hot

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
that uses a colder water or in a hot

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.170 
that uses a colder water or in a hot
water<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:30.980> find<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.459> hot<00:02:31.640> water<00:02:31.849> works

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
water and I find the hot water works

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:43.320 
water and I find the hot water works
better<00:02:40.120> now<00:02:41.120> it's<00:02:41.269> clean<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:42.019> read<00:02:42.200> zero

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
better now it's clean and you read zero

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.810 
better now it's clean and you read zero
reads<00:02:44.330> go<00:02:44.630> ahead
