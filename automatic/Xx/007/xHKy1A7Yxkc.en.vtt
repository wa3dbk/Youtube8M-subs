00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.750
 I believe that 

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:08.019
 and Brazil came out drawn in a very group 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.849
 competitive 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.849
 just by thinking that we have 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.110
 the champion says champion of the last 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.470
 European and is a team like Serbia that 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.859
 is in a renovation and 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.990
 and eager to show what it is 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.960
 the power of Serbian basketball 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.050
 without highlighting the other two rivals 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.320
 but the group is extremely 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.430
 competitive I think because of the condition 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.680
 of locality 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.890
 Spain has a plus 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.280
 but do not forget too 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.010
 at some time Spanish organized a 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.870
 European and it was local 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.600
 and it's a little bit also played a little bit 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.320
 against in its moment today Spain is 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.020
 very well and for me it is one of the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.710
 favorite mentalize 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.920
 to our players 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.080
 fundamentally 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.110
 to give him the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.480
 the idea of ​​the importance of this 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.840
 world for the Brazilian Basque 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.390
 and then mentalize 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.550
 from as high as possible inside the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.010
 area so that future crossings 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.900
 be 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.180
 up to competition not 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.050
 our brazilian competition comes 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.720
 doing a job I think important 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.440
 stay out 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.500
 have been left out 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.020
 of this world 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.560
 it was a step back fortunately 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.560
 the invitation arrived 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.310
 today the selection of brazil is still 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.690
 as everywhere in the world is still 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.080
 being a mirror for basketball 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.060
 local 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.330
 I hope we are up to the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.520
 conditions of being able to reflect in the 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.620
 young people in children in people that 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.160
 like from vásquez de brasil or leave 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.160
 a good image
