you a tip on on driving more specific is
set<00:00:09.809> up<00:00:09.960> with<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.139> driver<00:00:10.380> now<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:11.070> drive<00:00:11.309> is

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
set up with a driver now the drive is

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.890 
set up with a driver now the drive is
the<00:00:11.580> one<00:00:11.730> club<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.090> we<00:00:12.179> get<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.509> lot<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.690> people

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
the one club that we get a lot of people

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.999 
the one club that we get a lot of people
walking<00:00:13.290> through<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.530> door<00:00:13.679> saying<00:00:13.860> their

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
walking through the door saying their

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.740 
walking through the door saying their
struggle<00:00:14.340> with<00:00:14.460> they<00:00:14.969> want<00:00:15.150> more<00:00:15.240> consistency

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
struggle with they want more consistency

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.029 
struggle with they want more consistency
there<00:00:15.990> weren't<00:00:16.109> more<00:00:16.199> distance<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.859> kind<00:00:17.010> of

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
there weren't more distance that kind of

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.769 
there weren't more distance that kind of
thing<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.430> what<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:17.940> tend<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.210> see<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.600> lot

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
thing and what we tend to see is a lot

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.720 
thing and what we tend to see is a lot
of<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.930> problems<00:00:19.289> they<00:00:19.380> have<00:00:19.650> are<00:00:20.430> already

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
of the problems they have are already

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.070 
of the problems they have are already
presence<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.180> setup<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:21.630> before<00:00:21.930> they<00:00:22.020> even

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
presence of setup so before they even

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.750 
presence of setup so before they even
move<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.619> way<00:00:22.769> have<00:00:23.220> not<00:00:23.369> really

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
move it for the way have not really

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.390 
move it for the way have not really
created<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.240> right<00:00:24.390> positions<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.310> what<00:00:26.310> we

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
created the right positions so what we

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.939 
created the right positions so what we
often<00:00:26.699> tend<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.970> see<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.359> driver<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
often tend to see with the driver is a

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.120 
often tend to see with the driver is a
setup<00:00:29.400> where<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.810> ball<00:00:31.019> position<00:00:31.230> may<00:00:32.070> be

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
setup where the ball position may be

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.760 
setup where the ball position may be
correct<00:00:32.510> but<00:00:33.510> they<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> hips<00:00:34.200> too<00:00:34.530> far

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
correct but they have the hips too far

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.069 
correct but they have the hips too far
to<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.010> right<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.700> too<00:00:35.850> far<00:00:36.000> back<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.660> what

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
to the right or too far back and what

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.350 
to the right or too far back and what
that<00:00:37.110> does<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.590> puts<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.910> spine<00:00:38.910> tilted

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
that does it puts the spine tilted

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.299 
that does it puts the spine tilted
slightly<00:00:39.600> towards<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.290> target<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.190> is

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
slightly towards the target and this is

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.280 
slightly towards the target and this is
a<00:00:41.370> very<00:00:41.460> very<00:00:41.700> common<00:00:41.879> setup<00:00:42.180> mainly<00:00:43.170> because

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
a very very common setup mainly because

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.799 
a very very common setup mainly because
the<00:00:43.500> balls<00:00:43.710> bit<00:00:43.890> further<00:00:44.129> forward<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.820> right

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the balls bit further forward and right

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.000 
the balls bit further forward and right
hand<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> bit<00:00:46.289> lower<00:00:46.500> than<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> left<00:00:46.829> they

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
hand is a bit lower than the left they

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.860 
hand is a bit lower than the left they
tend<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.250> reach<00:00:47.520> over<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.270> way<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
tend to reach over for it this way and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.479 
tend to reach over for it this way and
create<00:00:49.170> these<00:00:49.379> positions<00:00:49.890> now<00:00:50.309> that's

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
create these positions now that's

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.850 
create these positions now that's
starting<00:00:51.059> position<00:00:51.480> those<00:00:51.629> body<00:00:51.960> angles<00:00:52.410> will

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
starting position those body angles will

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.010 
starting position those body angles will
tend<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.309> create<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.879> steeper<00:00:54.719> angle<00:00:54.780> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
tend to create a steeper angle of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.209 
tend to create a steeper angle of
approach<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.500> club<00:00:55.680> tends<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.949> work<00:00:56.070> more

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
approach the club tends to work more

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.369 
approach the club tends to work more
downwards<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.449> often<00:00:57.719> find<00:00:57.899> from<00:00:58.199> here

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
downwards and we often find from here

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.720 
downwards and we often find from here
that<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> Gulf<00:00:58.800> could<00:00:59.010> attend<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.399> work<00:00:59.550> more

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
that the Gulf could attend to work more

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.819 
that the Gulf could attend to work more
to<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> left<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.420> target<00:01:00.629> now<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.379> shots<00:01:01.649> we

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
to the left of target now the shots we

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.229 
to the left of target now the shots we
would<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.190> from<00:01:02.430> there<00:01:02.670> would<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:02.910> shocked

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
would see from there would be shocked

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.359 
would see from there would be shocked
which<00:01:03.359> go<00:01:03.510> straight<00:01:03.809> left<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.379> pulse<00:01:04.680> shots

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
which go straight left so pulse shots

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.280 
which go straight left so pulse shots
that<00:01:05.549> curve<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.970> right<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.540> slice<00:01:06.990> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
that curve to the right I a slice and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.990 
that curve to the right I a slice and
often<00:01:07.830> ones<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.159> come<00:01:08.280> off<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> sort<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
often ones that come off the sort of the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.310 
often ones that come off the sort of the
top<00:01:09.210> edge<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.510> club<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.869> goes<00:01:10.049> straight

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
top edge of the club that goes straight

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.109 
top edge of the club that goes straight
up<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.560> air<00:01:10.619> not<00:01:10.830> very<00:01:11.040> far<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.729> sometimes

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
up in the air not very far and sometimes

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.820 
up in the air not very far and sometimes
we<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.299> different<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.290> actually<00:01:13.439> want<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
we get different so we actually want to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.570 
we get different so we actually want to
do<00:01:14.270> is<00:01:15.270> take<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> starting<00:01:16.140> position<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
do is take a starting position and the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.490 
do is take a starting position and the
front<00:01:17.909> hip<00:01:18.150> wants<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> little<00:01:19.140> bit<00:01:19.290> more

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
front hip wants to be a little bit more

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320 
front hip wants to be a little bit more
forwards<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.430> little<00:01:20.610> bit<00:01:20.729> more<00:01:20.790> up<00:01:21.030> than

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
forwards and a little bit more up than

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.149 
forwards and a little bit more up than
the<00:01:21.450> back<00:01:21.600> yet<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.619> will<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:22.950> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the back yet what that will do is it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.820 
the back yet what that will do is it
taught<00:01:23.340> my<00:01:23.520> side<00:01:24.390> tilting<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.470> cuz

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
taught my side tilting like this cuz

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.530 
taught my side tilting like this cuz
they're<00:01:25.860> my<00:01:26.009> right<00:01:26.250> front<00:01:26.400> leg<00:01:26.580> lower<00:01:26.909> my

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
they're my right front leg lower my

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.240 
they're my right front leg lower my
spine<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.840> tilted<00:01:28.320> away<00:01:28.409> from<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.710> target<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
spine is tilted away from the target and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.460 
spine is tilted away from the target and
those<00:01:29.880> starting<00:01:30.420> positions<00:01:30.869> tend<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
those starting positions tend to

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.410 
those starting positions tend to
encourage<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> club<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.340> work<00:01:32.520> more<00:01:32.790> upwards

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
encourage the club to work more upwards

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.719 
encourage the club to work more upwards

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
capture we use tells us that when the

Gulf could work upwards as it hits the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
golf ball that tends to give us better

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.410 
it okay so i'm going to show you that
set<00:02:05.130> up<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.520> i<00:02:05.670> get<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> give<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.060> fall<00:02:06.240> ahead

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
set up and i get to give this fall ahead

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.359 
set up and i get to give this fall ahead
and<00:02:06.570> see<00:02:06.719> if<00:02:06.780> we<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:06.930> get<00:02:07.020> those<00:02:07.369> positions

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
and see if we can get those positions

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.730 
and see if we can get those positions
that<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:08.759> spoke

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
that we spoke

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.980 
that we spoke
so<00:02:10.740> good<00:02:11.039> sense<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.660> hips<00:02:12.660> go<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> little

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
so good sense of hips go a little

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:23.130 
so good sense of hips go a little
forward<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.860> then<00:02:13.950> from<00:02:14.190> there<00:02:14.459> give<00:02:15.209> it

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.559 

ok<00:02:23.830> so<00:02:24.160> if<00:02:24.220> we'll<00:02:24.310> try<00:02:24.460> those<00:02:24.610> positions<00:02:24.880> get<00:02:25.540> a

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
ok so if we'll try those positions get a

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.210 
ok so if we'll try those positions get a
good<00:02:25.780> setup<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.590> hopefully<00:02:26.950> we'll<00:02:27.069> get<00:02:27.160> more

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
good setup and hopefully we'll get more

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.580 
good setup and hopefully we'll get more
consistent<00:02:27.790> drives<00:02:27.970> longer<00:02:28.510> drives<00:02:28.720> by<00:02:29.380> more

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
consistent drives longer drives by more

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.459 
consistent drives longer drives by more
favors<00:02:29.890> thank<00:02:30.340> you
