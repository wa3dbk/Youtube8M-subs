00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.530
 from a lot of people 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.820
 super mario bros 3 is simply 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.470
 sensational 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.939
 especially at the time when people 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.890
 received him 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.130

 high 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.330

 besides the very good of me as a child 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.409
 can not move beyond the phase of 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.840
