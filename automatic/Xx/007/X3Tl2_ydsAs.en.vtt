00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
you look at the three to six dollars

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.460 
you look at the three to six dollars
there's<00:01:12.330> there's<00:01:12.689> quite<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> few<00:01:12.960> players<00:01:13.200> here

there's there's quite a few players here

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.530 
there's there's quite a few players here
