00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
different things but what worked for me

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.299 
different things but what worked for me
in<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> end<00:00:41.070> was<00:00:41.940> port<00:00:42.360> forwarding<00:00:43.040> on<00:00:44.040> my

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
in the end was port forwarding on my

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.750 
in the end was port forwarding on my
router<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.750> I'm<00:00:45.809> gonna<00:00:45.930> show<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.460> how<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.520> do

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
router so I'm gonna show you how to do

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.830 
router so I'm gonna show you how to do
that<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.629> Motorola<00:00:49.500> router<00:00:49.820> my<00:00:50.820> IFB<00:00:51.539> is

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
that on a Motorola router my IFB is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.119 
that on a Motorola router my IFB is
bright<00:00:52.379> house<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:55.110> Motorola<00:00:55.590> router<00:00:55.890> is

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
bright house and the Motorola router is

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.560 
bright house and the Motorola router is
a<00:00:56.329> 6850<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> first<00:00:59.910> thing<00:01:00.059> we're<00:01:00.180> gonna<00:01:00.239> do

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
a 6850 so the first thing we're gonna do

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.700 
a 6850 so the first thing we're gonna do
is<00:01:01.100> connect<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> router<00:01:02.539> and<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:04.229> me<00:01:04.379> that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
is connect to the router and for me that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.109 
is connect to the router and for me that
would<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:06.860> 192<00:01:07.860> 168<00:01:08.340> 0<00:01:09.350> 1<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.729> when<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.939> get

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
would be 192 168 0 1 so when you get

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.690 
would be 192 168 0 1 so when you get
here<00:01:12.299> you're<00:01:12.420> gonna<00:01:12.540> type<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.020> admin<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.740> your

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
