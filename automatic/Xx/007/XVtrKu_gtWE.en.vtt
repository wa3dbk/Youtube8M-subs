my<00:00:54.239> senegalese<00:00:54.780> twists<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:56.070> used<00:00:56.879> expressions

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
my senegalese twists I used expressions

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.400 
my senegalese twists I used expressions
and<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.590> cut<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.190> into<00:00:59.550> three<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.840> cut<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
and I cut it into three so I cut the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.619 
and I cut it into three so I cut the
length<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> hair<00:01:02.010> into<00:01:02.190> three<00:01:02.359> in<00:01:03.359> most

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
length of the hair into three in most

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.660 
length of the hair into three in most
three<00:01:03.840> sections<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:04.979> split<00:01:05.309> them<00:01:05.460> into

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
three sections I then split them into

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.240 
three sections I then split them into
half<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:06.869> easier<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.680> pull<00:01:07.950> hair

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
half because it's easier to pull hair

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.010 
half because it's easier to pull hair
when<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> smaller<00:01:09.030> amount<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.869> when

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
when you have a smaller amount then when

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.480 
when you have a smaller amount then when
you<00:01:10.110> try<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.439> pull<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.770> all<00:01:10.920> at<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.250> same<00:01:11.430> time

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you try and pull it all at the same time

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.480 
you try and pull it all at the same time
okay<00:01:12.200> for<00:01:13.200> demonstration<00:01:13.740> purposes<00:01:14.250> I'm

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.410 
you guys can see putting the hair out
and<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:04.409> want<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.680> make<00:03:04.829> sure<00:03:04.909> that<00:03:05.909> you<00:03:06.180> get

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
and you want to make sure that you get

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.330 
and you want to make sure that you get
the<00:03:06.599> ones<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.989> are<00:03:07.109> like<00:03:07.290> down<00:03:08.040> at<00:03:08.250> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
the ones that are like down at the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.099 
the ones that are like down at the
bottom<00:03:08.489> because<00:03:09.329> even<00:03:09.540> when<00:03:09.659> you<00:03:09.750> start<00:03:10.019> off

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
bottom because even when you start off

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.869 
bottom because even when you start off
not<00:03:10.290> all<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.590> hairs<00:03:10.859> at<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.129> same<00:03:11.340> level<00:03:11.519> so

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
not all the hairs at the same level so

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.220 
not all the hairs at the same level so
you<00:03:12.239> need<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.510> make<00:03:12.540> sure<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.900> get<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.079> ones

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
you need to make sure you get the ones

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.589 
you need to make sure you get the ones
that<00:03:13.380> are<00:03:13.500> lowered<00:03:13.859> down<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.579> as<00:03:14.849> well<00:03:15.329> as

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
that are lowered down and as well as

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:23.110 
that are lowered down and as well as
ones<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.139> are<00:03:16.319> higher<00:03:16.530> up<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.040> can<00:03:17.250> see

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.809 

okay<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.260> just<00:03:24.290> pull<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.920> couple<00:03:25.459> of

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
okay so you just pull a couple of

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:33.510 
okay so you just pull a couple of
strands<00:03:26.209> each<00:03:27.220> time

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.780 

if<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.330> pull<00:03:34.570> out<00:03:34.630> loads<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.680> strands<00:03:36.160> at<00:03:36.310> once

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
if you pull out loads of strands at once

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.390 
if you pull out loads of strands at once
you<00:03:37.510> end<00:03:37.780> up<00:03:37.930> just<00:03:38.110> having<00:03:38.320> another<00:03:38.740> blunt

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
you end up just having another blunt

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.980 
you end up just having another blunt
edge<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.210> don't<00:03:40.420> want<00:03:40.600> that<00:03:40.750> because

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
edge and you don't want that because

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.030 
edge and you don't want that because
that<00:03:41.170> will<00:03:41.230> waste<00:03:41.380> your<00:03:41.560> time<00:03:41.770> when<00:03:41.950> you're

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
that will waste your time when you're

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.770 
that will waste your time when you're
actually<00:03:42.220> braiding<00:03:42.880> because<00:03:43.480> you'll<00:03:43.600> have<00:03:43.630> to

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
actually braiding because you'll have to

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.280 
actually braiding because you'll have to
keep<00:03:44.140> pulling<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.190> hair<00:03:45.400> then<00:03:45.610> as<00:03:45.760> well

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
keep pulling the hair then as well

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.460 
keep pulling the hair then as well
that'd<00:03:47.290> be<00:03:47.320> a<00:03:47.470> waste<00:03:47.590> of<00:03:47.770> time<00:03:49.260> although<00:03:50.260> that

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
that'd be a waste of time although that

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.800 
that'd be a waste of time although that
is<00:03:50.590> another<00:03:50.920> way<00:03:51.160> of<00:03:51.460> doing<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:52.180> which<00:03:52.240> I<00:03:52.600> think

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
is another way of doing it which I think

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.890 
is another way of doing it which I think
I'll<00:03:52.930> probably<00:03:53.050> show<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:53.350> guys<00:03:53.530> in<00:03:53.710> a<00:03:53.770> second

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.990 

okay

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.530 

so<00:04:05.570> you<00:04:05.630> just<00:04:05.870> keep<00:04:06.110> going<00:04:06.620> just<00:04:07.070> a<00:04:07.280> few<00:04:08.060> hairs

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
so you just keep going just a few hairs

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.900 
so you just keep going just a few hairs
at<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:08.960> time<00:04:09.400> that's<00:04:10.400> all<00:04:10.550> you<00:04:10.640> have<00:04:10.790> to

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
at a time that's all you have to

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.700 
at a time that's all you have to
remember<00:04:10.940> you<00:04:11.780> just<00:04:11.960> have<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.140> take<00:04:12.320> your<00:04:12.380> time

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
remember you just have to take your time

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.110 
remember you just have to take your time
if<00:04:12.890> it's<00:04:13.010> your<00:04:13.130> first<00:04:13.160> time<00:04:13.460> doing<00:04:13.610> it<00:04:13.910> just

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
if it's your first time doing it just

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.069 
if it's your first time doing it just
take<00:04:14.270> your<00:04:14.450> time<00:04:14.510> and<00:04:14.960> it<00:04:15.560> will<00:04:15.680> come<00:04:15.800> out<00:04:15.860> okay

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
just a few strands of hair at a time you

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.760 
just a few strands of hair at a time you
can<00:04:25.940> once<00:04:26.810> you<00:04:26.900> got<00:04:26.990> to<00:04:27.170> end<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:27.470> give<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:27.710> a

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
can once you got to end you give it a

more way you can actually call here

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.270 
more way you can actually call here
there's<00:04:55.110> another<00:04:55.290> way<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.530> can<00:04:55.710> call<00:04:55.980> here

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
along so you do not have to do all at

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.510 
along so you do not have to do all at

direction<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:27.390> what<00:05:27.930> I<00:05:27.960> do<00:05:28.140> is<00:05:28.380> I<00:05:28.800> pull<00:05:29.220> a

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
direction and what I do is I pull a

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.340 
direction and what I do is I pull a
little<00:05:29.670> bit<00:05:29.820> from<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.030> top<00:05:30.390> on<00:05:30.420> one<00:05:30.810> side<00:05:31.110> and

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
little bit from the top on one side and

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.810 
little bit from the top on one side and
a<00:05:31.410> little<00:05:31.620> bit<00:05:31.770> from<00:05:31.920> the<00:05:31.950> bottom<00:05:32.490> on<00:05:32.670> the

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
a little bit from the bottom on the

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.540 
a little bit from the bottom on the
other<00:05:33.000> side<00:05:33.330> so<00:05:34.230> on<00:05:34.590> this<00:05:34.770> side<00:05:35.040> I'm<00:05:35.280> going<00:05:35.460> to

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
other side so on this side I'm going to

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.090 
other side so on this side I'm going to
pour<00:05:35.910> a<00:05:36.120> bit<00:05:36.390> of<00:05:36.540> the<00:05:36.690> top<00:05:36.960> and<00:05:37.260> on<00:05:37.740> this<00:05:37.920> that

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
pour a bit of the top and on this that

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.740 
pour a bit of the top and on this that
I'm<00:05:38.190> going<00:05:38.340> to<00:05:38.400> pour<00:05:38.640> a<00:05:38.790> bit<00:05:38.970> from<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.330> bottom

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
I'm going to pour a bit from the bottom

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.150 
I'm going to pour a bit from the bottom
so<00:05:39.990> it's<00:05:40.110> just<00:05:40.200> like<00:05:40.290> where<00:05:40.650> you<00:05:40.800> put<00:05:41.040> the

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
so it's just like where you put the

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.730 
so it's just like where you put the
pressure<00:05:41.400> so<00:05:42.150> basically<00:05:42.840> on<00:05:42.990> once<00:05:43.200> i<00:05:43.350> put<00:05:43.560> more

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
pressure so basically on once i put more

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.110 
pressure so basically on once i put more
pressure<00:05:43.920> on<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.280> top<00:05:44.460> on<00:05:44.640> the<00:05:44.730> other<00:05:44.880> side

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
pressure on the top on the other side

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.510 
pressure on the top on the other side
put<00:05:45.300> more<00:05:45.480> pressure<00:05:45.600> on<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:46.080> bottom<00:05:46.680> that

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
put more pressure on the bottom that

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.970 
put more pressure on the bottom that
makes<00:05:47.760> sense<00:05:47.970> ok<00:05:48.870> and<00:05:49.110> then<00:05:49.290> you<00:05:49.380> just<00:05:49.560> really

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
makes sense ok and then you just really

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.240 
makes sense ok and then you just really
want<00:05:50.010> to<00:05:50.310> pull<00:05:50.840> pull<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:51.990> hair<00:05:52.170> apart<00:05:52.530> in

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
want to pull pull the hair apart in

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.430 
want to pull pull the hair apart in
opposite<00:05:53.640> directions<00:05:53.790> the<00:05:54.720> more<00:05:54.960> you<00:05:54.990> pull

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
opposite directions the more you pull

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.040 
opposite directions the more you pull
the<00:05:55.980> pointer<00:05:56.520> here<00:05:56.730> ends<00:05:57.060> are<00:05:57.180> going<00:05:57.330> to<00:05:57.420> be<00:05:57.570> so

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
the pointer here ends are going to be so

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.920 
the pointer here ends are going to be so
as<00:05:58.410> you<00:05:58.650> can<00:05:58.800> see<00:05:59.070> that<00:06:00.030> ends<00:06:00.330> a<00:06:00.420> bit<00:06:00.450> point

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
as you can see that ends a bit point

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.330 
as you can see that ends a bit point
here<00:06:01.169> now<00:06:02.600> and<00:06:03.600> you<00:06:04.380> can<00:06:04.530> you<00:06:04.890> can<00:06:05.070> keep<00:06:05.310> doing

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
here now and you can you can keep doing

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.310 
here now and you can you can keep doing
it<00:06:05.820> until<00:06:07.400> you<00:06:08.400> get<00:06:08.640> the<00:06:08.790> desired<00:06:09.050> look<00:06:10.050> like

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
it until you get the desired look like

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.690 
it until you get the desired look like
though<00:06:10.440> that's<00:06:10.710> one<00:06:10.950> way<00:06:11.100> of<00:06:11.130> doing<00:06:11.400> it<00:06:11.640> and

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
though that's one way of doing it and

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.490 
though that's one way of doing it and
you<00:06:11.850> can<00:06:12.000> do<00:06:12.150> that<00:06:12.180> as<00:06:12.419> you<00:06:12.570> go<00:06:12.690> along<00:06:12.840> so<00:06:13.260> when

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
you can do that as you go along so when

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.530 
you can do that as you go along so when
you<00:06:13.620> pick<00:06:13.830> up<00:06:13.980> a<00:06:14.070> bit<00:06:14.250> of<00:06:14.340> the<00:06:14.820> hair<00:06:15.030> to<00:06:15.270> braid

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
you pick up a bit of the hair to braid

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.500 
you pick up a bit of the hair to braid
you<00:06:16.320> pull<00:06:16.560> it<00:06:16.680> and<00:06:16.830> then<00:06:16.980> you<00:06:17.070> braid<00:06:17.340> it<00:06:17.550> I<00:06:17.700> just

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
you pull it and then you braid it I just

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.690 
you pull it and then you braid it I just
prefer<00:06:18.750> to<00:06:18.930> do<00:06:19.710> all<00:06:19.919> my<00:06:19.950> pudding<00:06:20.310> at<00:06:20.580> the
