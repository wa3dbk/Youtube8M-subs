00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:10.149
 hello I am the film promotes lower and today 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.149
 let's look at the air to our knitting 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.010
 do not be scared I'm not yet 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.350
 angry with knitting 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.390
 But today we're going to go there, come on. 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.060
 look here on these sides for the 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.640
 knitting ears 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.189
 I have to show a point in how 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.880
 know the stitch the knits all 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.510
 careers 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:35.350
 It may be all in the morning and what happens 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:40.150
 is that in the lateral specific forums 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.460
 in one act and the other to give 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.920
 continuity to point mons 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.469
 and gets a pretty finish 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.110
 because otherwise we give a 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.910
 continuity to point 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.850
 what happens is that when we tax the 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.739
 point taxed 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.899
 on the right side all points and 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.870
 Maya, and on the wrong side all points and 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.910
 ever and the left side of the finish 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.750
 right side and will follow this 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.330
 recipe 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.500
 the finishes do not look the same on the 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.470
 right 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.660
 Let's stick with this finishing side 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.750
 it seems a chain does not see a 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.940
 finish and on the left side we 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.490
 with this finish and little bit exactly 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.920
 As the finishing point our invitation 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.740
 we can not have two types of finish 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.990
 this camping with little ones all the time 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.539
 she is made with these new 21 the other 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.899
 wedding with chains but like 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:38.319
 we do one and the other to achieve 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.090
 this finish in a chain of one 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:41.590
 side and the other on the left and hit 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.470
 and work 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.270
 we always have to carry the first suitcase and 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.910
 morning or soya introduces my needle 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.950
 as if it were taxed in Maya too 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.910
 introduces my courage in this sense and 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.890
 I'm a towel now, this line is right. 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:08.560
 Morning tax is payable and I go 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:10.330
 taxon goes to the penultimate mesh and 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.890
 here in the last march passes the line there 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.660
 up the left thigh and do yoga 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.260
 The last way worked on him son. 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.090
 job reinstates first 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.940
 knit my needle like I was going to do 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.510
 Mayan 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.010
 in this sense and tax retreats 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.020
 It's gone up here now. 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.770
 corresponds to make this entire career 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.930
 island and let's make it unique 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.560
 even the last mesh for this 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.510
 finishing the last mesh has to be 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.470
 It was always terrible when we 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.320
 at once 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.940
 there is no concern here we do 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.130
 league and in the last league when 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.580
 right side 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.530
 we must keep in mind we 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.150
 first tide in may 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.620
 we must always keep in mind that the 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.560
 last mesh 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.140
 We have to tax who we call here. 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.100
 whole career in May but only up to 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.100

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.810
 when we stayed here the penultimate Mayan 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.950
 we passed ours up and we go 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.950
 william will do 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.870
 we were worked so we point but 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.600
 Let's get this finished in 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.690

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.910

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.090

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.330
