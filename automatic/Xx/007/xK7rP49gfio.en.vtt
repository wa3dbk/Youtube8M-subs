out and you notice watch this you can
watch<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.540> little<00:02:29.959> fall<00:02:30.200> down<00:02:30.440> as<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.769> pull

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
watch this a little fall down as I pull

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.780 
watch this a little fall down as I pull
this<00:02:31.129> out<00:02:32.620> okay<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:34.129> so<00:02:34.370> there's<00:02:34.640> your

this out okay and so there's your

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.009 
this out okay and so there's your
controller<00:02:35.180> out<00:02:35.480> now<00:02:36.349> with<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:38.019> controller

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
controller out now with the controller

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.900 
controller out now with the controller
out<00:02:39.200> it's<00:02:39.500> easy<00:02:39.650> enough<00:02:39.769> you<00:02:40.250> can<00:02:40.430> reconnect
