00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:13.719
 in animal buttocks back hello friends 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.850
 have good today we have a 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.289
 phenomenal exercise that will work 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.640
 much our energy center 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.760
 fundamentally what we are going to try 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.830
 is the back the lower back this area 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.110
 here the pelvic area the musculature 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.930
 deep and a little bit up 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.910
 the gluteus is german behind in the gluteus 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.430
 is from behind is an exercise that 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.170
 also to rehabilitate the back is 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.879
 great if you have back pain 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.789
 you wake up in the morning that hurts 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.069
 a little bit, then you put on a mat 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.870
 of graves and you make the movement of 

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:45.200
 up and down and now the clients and in 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.079
 three after 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.390
 very simple is called pelvic curl 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.480
 this what goes well is going to make us a 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.110
 demonstration 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.080
 Exercise when you want 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.080
 and nothing by the nose going up 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:07.930
 you release the air with your mouth up and 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.930
 you exhale doing 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.569
 great is fine 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.569
 could be repeated to our friends 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.479
 thought-out 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.410
 and nothing 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.960
 at the end of hexane above 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.240
 and no work 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.159
 ok let's see errors we can 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.770
 commit in the exercise of the viewer of 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.950
 profile 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.630
 let's see that would be a mistake 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.460
 you think it 's interesting to stress the 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.369
 neck and is with the contracted the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.810
 vertebrae that position would be wrong with 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.759
 head back is not possible 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.890
 has that someone has to support 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.990
 correctly 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.850
 very well other failures that you can have 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.220
 in the hands position the hands 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.870
 they have to be completely folded not 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.390
 you can see them shrunken as I had 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.950
 well not very well recording a look 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.050
 extended and parallel hands perfect 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.459
 another very common mistake is to be with 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.500
 the legs open this position 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.390
 our times two parallel lines in 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.490
 the body segments we need two 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.310
 parallel lines therefore you have to 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.280
 set an angle perfectly 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.530
 parallel with the ground very well more 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.880
 mistakes that can be made when starting 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.209
 the movement starts the movement and 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.209
 goes up 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.840
 that's a sharp rise 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:58.120
 and the progressive 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.580
 leave it alone 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.160
 is 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.080
 you are fluency and control of the center 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.490
 energy very well javier the gluteus 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.490
 also more back good what 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.659
 here we are for what you want and with 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.659
 we will give you the hundred 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.660
 the gluteus also further back
