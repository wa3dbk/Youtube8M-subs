00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
let's first have a good look at the

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.530 
let's first have a good look at the
position<00:00:10.050> on<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:11.040> kingside<00:00:11.519> right<00:00:11.849> has<00:00:12.090> three

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
against three points but on the

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.550 
against three points but on the
queenside<00:00:14.309> white<00:00:15.210> has<00:00:15.420> two<00:00:15.719> against<00:00:16.170> one

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
queenside white has two against one

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.660 
queenside white has two against one

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
it looks easy Paulin b2 should be

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.990 
it looks easy Paulin b2 should be
exchanged<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.570> one<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.050> seven<00:00:22.710> but<00:00:23.430> first<00:00:23.730> I

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
exchanged for one on a seven but first I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.420 
exchanged for one on a seven but first I
will<00:00:24.720> show<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.410> wrong<00:00:25.619> way<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.039> doing<00:00:26.070> it

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
will show you the wrong way of doing it

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.700 
will show you the wrong way of doing it
and<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.660> play<00:00:28.010> b4<00:00:29.689> okay<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.500> these

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
and that is to play b4 okay so these

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.860 
and that is to play b4 okay so these
spawns<00:00:32.130> without<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.969> help<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.329> white<00:00:33.570> King

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
spawns without the help of white King

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.729 
spawns without the help of white King
they<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:35.090> no<00:00:36.090> chance<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.750> succeeding<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
they have no chance of succeeding and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.340 
they have no chance of succeeding and
now<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.309> black<00:00:38.850> who<00:00:39.690> will<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> game

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
now it is black who will be in the game

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.080 
now it is black who will be in the game
because<00:00:40.710> he<00:00:40.739> will<00:00:41.100> capture<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.610> pawns<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
because he will capture the pawns and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.520 
because he will capture the pawns and
then<00:00:42.270> he<00:00:42.480> will<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.750> his<00:00:42.899> own<00:00:43.079> outside

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
then he will have his own outside

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.959 
then he will have his own outside
passport<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.289> right<00:00:46.469> way<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.280> bring

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
passport so the right way is to bring

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.880 
passport so the right way is to bring
the<00:00:48.300> King<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> center<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.350> board<00:00:49.530> to
