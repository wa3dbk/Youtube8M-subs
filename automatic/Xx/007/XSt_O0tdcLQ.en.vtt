must<00:00:31.450> be<00:00:31.540> wondering<00:00:31.930> how<00:00:32.140> we<00:00:32.200> calculate<00:00:32.860> these

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
must be wondering how we calculate these

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.270 
must be wondering how we calculate these
things<00:00:33.399> so<00:00:34.239> I<00:00:34.480> thought<00:00:34.899> because<00:00:35.590> I<00:00:35.800> have<00:00:36.100> got

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
things so I thought because I have got

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.819 
things so I thought because I have got
the<00:00:36.430> formula<00:00:36.880> I<00:00:37.030> thought<00:00:37.360> to<00:00:37.540> tell<00:00:37.750> you<00:00:37.870> all<00:00:38.050> so

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
the formula I thought to tell you all so

talking to you about number one number
two<00:01:02.949> number<00:01:03.070> three<00:01:03.399> film<00:01:03.850> you<00:01:04.360> should<00:01:04.390> know

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
two number three film you should know

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.620 
two number three film you should know
why<00:01:05.350> and<00:01:05.680> how<00:01:05.710> they<00:01:06.159> are<00:01:06.250> talking<00:01:06.490> so<00:01:06.820> so<00:01:07.420> let

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
why and how they are talking so so let

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.630 
why and how they are talking so so let
me<00:01:07.840> tell<00:01:08.080> you<00:01:08.170> this<00:01:08.380> exact<00:01:08.980> science<00:01:09.430> or<00:01:09.580> I

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
me tell you this exact science or I

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.300 
me tell you this exact science or I
should<00:01:10.270> say<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.630> formula<00:01:11.080> how<00:01:11.530> we<00:01:11.590> calculated

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
should say the formula how we calculated

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.969 
should say the formula how we calculated
on<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.670> basis<00:01:13.479> of<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.840> coin<00:01:14.079> way<00:01:14.290> parameters

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
on the basis of the coin way parameters

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.830 
on the basis of the coin way parameters
so<00:01:15.189> I'm<00:01:15.340> going<00:01:15.640> to<00:01:15.700> tell<00:01:16.000> you<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.299> exact

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
so I'm going to tell you the exact

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.289 
so I'm going to tell you the exact
formula<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.530> exact<00:01:17.950> science<00:01:18.369> how<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.729> coin

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
formula the exact science how the coin

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.920 
formula the exact science how the coin
boy<00:01:19.540> power<00:01:19.899> index<00:01:20.259> position<00:01:20.829> is<00:01:20.950> being<00:01:21.310> judged

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
boy power index position is being judged

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.050 
boy power index position is being judged
so<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.259> formula<00:01:23.740> is<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:24.280> number<00:01:24.549> one<00:01:24.759> point

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
so the formula is the number one point

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.410 
so the formula is the number one point
if<00:01:25.659> any<00:01:26.229> stars<00:01:26.799> film<00:01:27.130> does<00:01:27.399> 100<00:01:28.119> crore

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
if any stars film does 100 crore

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.959 
if any stars film does 100 crore
business<00:01:28.869> he<00:01:29.170> will<00:01:29.320> get<00:01:29.560> 100<00:01:30.219> points<00:01:30.640> for<00:01:30.670> his

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
business he will get 100 points for his

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.530 
business he will get 100 points for his

800 crore fill simultaneously if his

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.109 
800 crore fill simultaneously if his
films<00:01:34.899> does<00:01:35.110> 200<00:01:36.009> crowed<00:01:36.310> business<00:01:36.729> he<00:01:36.969> will

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
films does 200 crowed business he will

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.109 
films does 200 crowed business he will
get<00:01:37.299> 200<00:01:37.869> points<00:01:38.380> for<00:01:38.409> each<00:01:38.829> film<00:01:39.189> okay

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
get 200 points for each film okay

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.050 
get 200 points for each film okay
the<00:01:40.840> next<00:01:41.110> point<00:01:41.350> is<00:01:41.530> if<00:01:41.770> his<00:01:42.189> film<00:01:42.520> is<00:01:42.700> in<00:01:42.939> the

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
the next point is if his film is in the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.480 
the next point is if his film is in the
top<00:01:43.329> 10<00:01:43.689> overseas<00:01:44.289> crosser<00:01:44.770> list

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
top 10 overseas crosser list

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.880 
top 10 overseas crosser list
he<00:01:45.789> will<00:01:46.000> get<00:01:46.210> 50<00:01:46.750> points<00:01:47.140> for<00:01:47.170> each<00:01:47.530> film

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
he will get 50 points for each film

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.670 
he will get 50 points for each film
suppose<00:01:48.610> he<00:01:48.820> has<00:01:49.000> five<00:01:49.360> homes<00:01:49.689> the<00:01:50.170> five<00:01:50.409> films

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
suppose he has five homes the five films

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.670 
suppose he has five homes the five films
will<00:01:50.950> be<00:01:51.100> multiplied<00:01:51.609> by<00:01:51.640> 15<00:01:52.630> so<00:01:53.229> this<00:01:53.380> is<00:01:53.560> how

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
will be multiplied by 15 so this is how

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.950 
will be multiplied by 15 so this is how
we<00:01:53.740> calculated<00:01:54.399> so<00:01:54.969> now<00:01:55.149> I'm<00:01:55.390> going<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.719> tell
