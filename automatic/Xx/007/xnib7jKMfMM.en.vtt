00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
little bit bent from the rolling when

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.299 
little bit bent from the rolling when
they<00:00:36.750> came<00:00:36.960> shipped<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.070> see

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
they came shipped but as you can see

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.030 
they came shipped but as you can see
they're<00:00:38.489> really<00:00:38.640> nice<00:00:39.379> they're<00:00:40.379> kind<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.739> soft

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
they're really nice they're kind of soft

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.430 
they're really nice they're kind of soft
I<00:00:41.540> don't<00:00:42.540> know<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:43.020> see<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.320> but

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
I don't know if you can see it but

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.260 
I don't know if you can see it but
they're<00:00:43.559> kind<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.579> little<00:00:44.789> bit<00:00:44.940> fuzzy

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
they're kind of just a little bit fuzzy

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.220 
they're kind of just a little bit fuzzy
and<00:00:45.660> that's<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:47.510> it<00:00:48.510> won't<00:00:48.629> shine<00:00:48.960> back

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and that's so that it won't shine back

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
and that's so that it won't shine back
on<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> camera<00:00:50.539> so<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:53.090> this<00:00:54.090> is

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
on the camera so this is the this is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.380 
on the camera so this is the this is
kind<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.870> general<00:00:55.910> one<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.120> got

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
kind of just the general one that I got

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.849 
kind of just the general one that I got
and<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.690> think<00:00:57.719> I'm<00:00:58.050> really<00:00:58.289> gonna<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.800> it

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
and I think I'm really gonna like it

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.150 
and I think I'm really gonna like it
because<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.399> really<00:00:59.489> just<00:01:01.160> multi-purpose

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
because it's really just multi-purpose

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.000 
because it's really just multi-purpose
and<00:01:03.260> then<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.619> got<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.220> other<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:06.890> which<00:01:07.890> I

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
and then I got this other one which I

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.109 
and then I got this other one which I
think<00:01:08.040> will<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:09.260> lot<00:01:10.260> more<00:01:11.090> just<00:01:12.090> funky<00:01:14.119> as

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
think will be a lot more just funky as

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.490 
think will be a lot more just funky as
you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.630> got<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> lot<00:01:15.930> more<00:01:15.960> colors

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
you can see it's got a lot more colors

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.350 
you can see it's got a lot more colors

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.219 
in it and it's got like some nail holes
