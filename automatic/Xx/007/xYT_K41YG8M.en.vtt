00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
there was no time where I was just about

there was no time where I was just about
to<00:00:58.410> cross<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:58.949> he<00:00:59.039> was<00:00:59.190> there<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.460> had<00:00:59.760> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
to cross it and he was there you had to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.639 
to cross it and he was there you had to
wait<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.270> out<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.780> wings<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.199> that's

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
exactly why I did even when he gets into

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.210 
exactly why I did even when he gets into
the<00:01:03.899> penalty<00:01:04.140> area<00:01:04.199> guys<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.860> you're<00:01:05.040> gonna

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the penalty area guys if you're gonna

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.149 
the penalty area guys if you're gonna
buy<00:01:05.430> him<00:01:05.640> as<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.820> target<00:01:06.479> man<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.140> still<00:01:07.830> wouldn't

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
buy him as a target man I still wouldn't

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.250 
buy him as a target man I still wouldn't
recommend<00:01:08.400> him<00:01:08.670> because<00:01:09.000> he<00:01:09.360> might<00:01:09.659> miss<00:01:10.080> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
recommend him because he might miss a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.380 
recommend him because he might miss a
lot<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.619> chances<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.549> even<00:01:11.850> though<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> crossed

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
lot of chances so even though I crossed

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.649 
lot of chances so even though I crossed
it<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.689> him<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.470> would<00:01:14.220> say<00:01:14.369> 50%<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> time<00:01:15.479> he

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it to him I would say 50% of the time he

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.179 
it to him I would say 50% of the time he
would<00:01:15.750> actually<00:01:16.200> head<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.590> into<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> back<00:01:17.159> of

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
would actually head it into the back of

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.300 
would actually head it into the back of
the<00:01:17.430> net<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.150> over<00:01:18.390> 50<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.990> off<00:01:19.409> target<00:01:19.920> or<00:01:20.130> he

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the net the over 50 is off target or he

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.760 
the net the over 50 is off target or he
actually<00:01:20.790> misses<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> ball<00:01:21.479> completely<00:01:22.259> so

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
actually misses the ball completely so

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.280 
actually misses the ball completely so
as<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.220> target<00:01:23.700> man<00:01:23.880> don't<00:01:24.540> expect<00:01:24.869> him<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.080> be

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
as a target man don't expect him to be

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.320 
as a target man don't expect him to be
anywhere<00:01:25.830> near<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.189> good<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.520> infirmed<00:01:27.060> closer

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
anywhere near as good as infirmed closer

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.870 
anywhere near as good as infirmed closer
when<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.229> comes<00:01:28.470> down<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.799> heading<00:01:29.400> now

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
when it comes down to heading now

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.850 
when it comes down to heading now
finishing<00:01:30.509> he<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.049> actually<00:01:31.380> pretty<00:01:31.530> good<00:01:31.710> in

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
finishing he is actually pretty good in

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.859 
finishing he is actually pretty good in
the<00:01:31.950> penalty<00:01:32.220> area<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.549> finish<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.240> one

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
the penalty area to finish with and one

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.390 
the penalty area to finish with and one
of<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.110> best<00:01:34.320> things<00:01:34.619> about<00:01:34.920> him<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.250> his

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
of the best things about him is his

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.609 
of the best things about him is his
shooting<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.030> very<00:01:36.479> very<00:01:36.780> underrated<00:01:37.079> as<00:01:37.470> in

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
shooting is very very underrated as in

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.859 
shooting is very very underrated as in
game<00:01:37.740> sets<00:01:38.130> he<00:01:38.430> has<00:01:38.670> very<00:01:38.970> high<00:01:39.299> shot<00:01:39.630> power

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
game sets he has very high shot power

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.899 
game sets he has very high shot power
but<00:01:40.560> his<00:01:40.680> long<00:01:40.920> shots<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.250> felt<00:01:41.460> were<00:01:41.610> even

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
but his long shots I felt were even

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.730 
but his long shots I felt were even
better<00:01:42.180> than<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.140> game<00:01:43.320> set<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.619> was

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
better than what is in game set as I was

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.950 
better than what is in game set as I was
showing<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.310> didn't<00:01:44.880> manage<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.119> score<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.630> but

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
showing I didn't manage to score one but

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.889 
showing I didn't manage to score one but
his<00:01:46.320> shots<00:01:46.680> dip<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.399> no<00:01:47.610> tomorrow<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.659> make

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
his shots dip like no tomorrow so make

his shots dip like no tomorrow so make

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780

area you will see a couple of them or a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.399 
area you will see a couple of them or a
couple<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.450> times<00:02:00.689> where<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.930> tried<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.290> finish

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
couple of times where I tried to finish

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.800 
couple of times where I tried to finish
with<00:02:01.649> his<00:02:01.740> left<00:02:01.979> foot<00:02:02.070> also<00:02:02.670> his<00:02:02.939> pace<00:02:03.210> wasn't

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
with his left foot also his pace wasn't

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.209 
with his left foot also his pace wasn't
a<00:02:03.869> problem<00:02:04.110> at<00:02:04.320> all<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.500> actually<00:02:04.680> found<00:02:05.009> him

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
a problem at all I actually found him

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.190 
a problem at all I actually found him
faster<00:02:06.060> than<00:02:06.210> while<00:02:06.360> his<00:02:06.509> in-game<00:02:06.719> stats<00:02:07.020> are

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
faster than while his in-game stats are

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.199 
faster than while his in-game stats are
showing<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.649> shows<00:02:07.890> he<00:02:08.069> has<00:02:08.220> 78<00:02:08.610> sprint<00:02:09.000> speed

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
showing it shows he has 78 sprint speed

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.449 
showing it shows he has 78 sprint speed
I<00:02:09.420> felt<00:02:09.959> he<00:02:10.110> was<00:02:10.140> faster<00:02:10.649> than<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.190> there

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
I felt he was faster than that and there

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.520 
I felt he was faster than that and there
is<00:02:11.489> no<00:02:11.730> problem<00:02:12.150> with<00:02:12.180> him<00:02:12.450> being<00:02:12.480> slow<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.230> if

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
is no problem with him being slow and if

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.730 
is no problem with him being slow and if
you

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
you

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.470 
you
still<00:02:13.920> think<00:02:14.130> he<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.430> slow<00:02:14.700> with<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:14.940> 78

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
still think he is slow with that 78

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.150 
still think he is slow with that 78
spring<00:02:15.750> speed<00:02:15.960> I<00:02:16.080> have<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.380> say<00:02:16.530> he<00:02:16.710> is<00:02:16.740> pretty

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
spring speed I have to say he is pretty

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.010 
spring speed I have to say he is pretty
damn<00:02:17.430> strong<00:02:17.790> but<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.210> is<00:02:18.300> quite<00:02:18.570> inconsistent

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
damn strong but it is quite inconsistent

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.410 
damn strong but it is quite inconsistent
sometimes<00:02:19.800> you'll<00:02:20.310> be<00:02:20.460> running<00:02:20.730> forward<00:02:21.240> with

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
sometimes you'll be running forward with

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.780 
sometimes you'll be running forward with
him<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.780> he's<00:02:22.170> very<00:02:22.410> strong<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.070> defenders

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
him and he's very strong and defenders

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.730 
him and he's very strong and defenders
finding<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.570> hard<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.960> you<00:02:25.200> know<00:02:25.320> shove<00:02:25.620> him

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
finding it hard to you know shove him

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.560 
finding it hard to you know shove him
off<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.010> wall<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.400> sometimes

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
off the wall and sometimes

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.900 
off the wall and sometimes
Giovinco<00:02:28.350> would<00:02:28.710> get<00:02:29.010> off<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.340> ball<00:02:29.490> which<00:02:29.700> is

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
Giovinco would get off the ball which is

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.300 
Giovinco would get off the ball which is
quite<00:02:30.390> ridiculous<00:02:31.320> I<00:02:31.650> don't<00:02:31.830> know<00:02:31.920> what<00:02:32.160> the

instructions but let me give you an

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.160 
instructions but let me give you an
example<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:53.130> how<00:02:53.520> bad<00:02:54.030> his<00:02:54.390> agility<00:02:54.840> and

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
example of how bad his agility and

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.810 
example of how bad his agility and
dribbling<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.800> say<00:02:56.190> you're<00:02:56.340> running<00:02:56.640> in<00:02:56.730> a

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
dribbling is say you're running in a

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.100 
dribbling is say you're running in a
straight<00:02:57.150> line<00:02:57.180> because<00:02:57.510> that's<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.900> best

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
straight line because that's the best

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.560 
straight line because that's the best
thing<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.380> could<00:02:58.530> do<00:02:58.680> with<00:02:58.890> Wolford<00:02:59.280> boney<00:02:59.570> as

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
thing you could do with Wolford boney as

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.420 
thing you could do with Wolford boney as
soon<00:03:01.080> as<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.320> turn<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.770> him<00:03:01.890> because<00:03:02.220> it's

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
soon as you turn of him because it's

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.300 
soon as you turn of him because it's
dribbling<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:02.970> agility<00:03:03.360> or<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:03.900> shit<00:03:04.320> is<00:03:04.590> game

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
dribbling and agility or so shit is game
