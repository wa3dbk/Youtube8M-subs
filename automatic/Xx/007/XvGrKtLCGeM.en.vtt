of the xuv500 well the bad news is it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.330 
of the xuv500 well the bad news is it
will<00:00:35.580> be<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:36.030> long<00:00:36.330> wait<00:00:36.690> not<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.950> couple<00:00:38.160> of

will be a long wait not just a couple of

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.670 
will be a long wait not just a couple of

completely new transmission supplier has

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.210 
completely new transmission supplier has
to<00:00:59.850> be<00:00:59.970> sauce<00:01:00.239> now<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.020> job<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.620> sourcing<00:01:02.130> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
transmission supplier and automatic

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.660 
transmission supplier and automatic
transmission<00:01:04.380> supplier<00:01:04.770> is<00:01:05.009> being<00:01:05.369> given<00:01:05.520> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
transmission supplier is being given to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.300 
transmission supplier is being given to
ssangyong<00:01:06.240> because<00:01:06.600> clearly<00:01:07.100> ssangyong<00:01:08.100> is

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
ssangyong because clearly ssangyong is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.100 
ssangyong because clearly ssangyong is
going<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.000> bulk<00:01:09.300> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> demand<00:01:09.899> for

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
going to have the bulk of the demand for

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.590 
going to have the bulk of the demand for
auto<00:01:10.350> transmissions<00:01:11.160> so<00:01:11.580> ssangyong<00:01:12.270> has<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
auto transmissions so ssangyong has to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.240 
auto transmissions so ssangyong has to
take<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> lead<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.259> and<00:01:13.649> whoever

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
take the lead on that and whoever

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.760 
take the lead on that and whoever
ssangyong<00:01:15.119> ties<00:01:15.390> up<00:01:15.630> mahindra<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.410> will<00:01:16.619> use

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
ssangyong ties up mahindra to will use

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.460 
ssangyong ties up mahindra to will use
the<00:01:16.950> same<00:01:16.979> supplier<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:18.509> something<00:01:19.350> like

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the same supplier but something like

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.770 
the same supplier but something like
this<00:01:19.649> doesn't<00:01:20.190> take<00:01:20.520> months<00:01:20.789> it<00:01:21.119> takes<00:01:21.509> years

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
this doesn't take months it takes years

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.230 
this doesn't take months it takes years
so<00:01:22.380> we<00:01:22.710> really<00:01:22.950> can't<00:01:23.070> give<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.670> fix<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
so we really can't give you a fix on a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.160 
so we really can't give you a fix on a
date<00:01:24.479> when<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.260> auto<00:01:25.729> xuv500<00:01:26.729> will<00:01:27.570> be<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
date when the auto xuv500 will be in the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.170 
date when the auto xuv500 will be in the
market<00:01:28.530> also<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> lot<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> been<00:01:29.850> asking

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
market also a lot of you been asking

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.609 
market also a lot of you been asking
about<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> four-wheel-drive<00:01:30.990> version<00:01:31.350> of

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
about the four-wheel-drive version of

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.380 
about the four-wheel-drive version of
the<00:01:31.710> xuv500<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.700> lot<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.940> you<00:01:33.030> think<00:01:33.240> there's

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the xuv500 a lot of you think there's

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.640 
the xuv500 a lot of you think there's
some<00:01:33.510> problem<00:01:33.750> over<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.200> well<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> real

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
some problem over there well the real

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.230 
some problem over there well the real
problem<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.610> demand<00:01:36.030> has

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
problem is that the demand has

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.170 
problem is that the demand has
completely<00:01:37.020> gone<00:01:37.200> haywire<00:01:37.830> now<00:01:38.640> Mahindra

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
completely gone haywire now Mahindra

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.109 
completely gone haywire now Mahindra
budgeted<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.140> about<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> five<00:01:40.860> percent<00:01:41.369> mix<00:01:41.850> of

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
budgeted for about a five percent mix of

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.880 
budgeted for about a five percent mix of
five<00:01:42.330> percent<00:01:42.720> four-wheel-drive<00:01:43.080> mix<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
five percent four-wheel-drive mix in the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.030 
five percent four-wheel-drive mix in the
XUV<00:01:44.340> sales<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.930> initially<00:01:46.409> went<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.890> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
XUV sales but that initially went up to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.920 
XUV sales but that initially went up to
around<00:01:47.159> thirty<00:01:47.580> percent<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.180> now<00:01:48.720> it's

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
around thirty percent and now it's

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.350 
around thirty percent and now it's
settled<00:01:49.259> at<00:01:49.350> around<00:01:49.530> twenty<00:01:49.920> percent<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.759> they

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
settled at around twenty percent so they

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.060 
settled at around twenty percent so they
are<00:01:51.479> looking<00:01:51.840> at<00:01:51.960> now<00:01:51.990> supplying<00:01:52.680> they<00:01:52.950> can

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
are looking at now supplying they can

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.950 
are looking at now supplying they can
only<00:01:53.189> supply<00:01:53.520> about<00:01:53.759> 300<00:01:54.390> there<00:01:54.600> four<00:01:54.810> wheel

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
only supply about 300 there four wheel

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.870 
only supply about 300 there four wheel
drive<00:01:55.170> xuv500<00:01:55.770> every<00:01:56.310> month<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> think

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
drive xuv500 every month but I think

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.490 
drive xuv500 every month but I think
even<00:01:56.970> that's<00:01:57.210> clearly<00:01:57.479> not<00:01:57.600> enough<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.409> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
even that's clearly not enough so it's a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.530 
even that's clearly not enough so it's a
question<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:58.950> too<00:01:59.460> much<00:01:59.610> demand<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.299> too

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
question of too much demand and too

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.270 
question of too much demand and too
little<00:02:00.689> supply<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.950> four-wheel-drive

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
little supply of the four-wheel-drive

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.850 
little supply of the four-wheel-drive
version<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.210> xuv500<00:02:03.810> well<00:02:04.530> that's<00:02:04.740> it

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
version of the xuv500 well that's it

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.679 
version of the xuv500 well that's it
from<00:02:05.009> me<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.400> week<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.000> if<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.420> want<00:02:06.600> to
