00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
10% front wheel drive transmission we

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:23.650 
10% front wheel drive transmission we
don't<00:02:55.320> want<00:02:55.530> about<00:02:58.970> 250<00:03:03.109> scoops<00:03:04.109> lots<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.470> talk

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.330 

okay<00:03:24.500> let's<00:03:25.280> test<00:03:25.520> if<00:03:25.730> our<00:03:25.910> new<00:03:26.180> juicer<00:03:26.690> works

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
okay let's test if our new juicer works

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.430 
okay let's test if our new juicer works
let's<00:03:28.340> go<00:03:28.460> to

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:50.070 

much<00:03:35.440> actual<00:03:35.950> use<00:03:36.480> I'll<00:03:37.480> use

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.260 

I<00:03:50.160> think<00:03:52.350> there<00:03:53.350> is<00:03:53.380> a<00:03:53.830> culture<00:03:54.610> shock<00:03:54.880> the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
I think there is a culture shock the

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:27.590 
I think there is a culture shock the
Tokyo<00:03:55.660> are<00:03:55.900> 46<00:03:56.620> our<00:03:57.250> team<00:03:57.610> for<00:03:57.880> six

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:39.560 

so<00:04:28.950> let's<00:04:29.950> start<00:04:30.340> this

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.000 

okay<00:04:40.570> on<00:04:40.780> this<00:04:40.930> track<00:04:41.230> this<00:04:41.470> little<00:04:41.800> pipe

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
okay on this track this little pipe

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.560 
okay on this track this little pipe
there's<00:04:42.610> some<00:04:42.760> stock<00:04:43.030> ones<00:04:43.270> where<00:04:43.450> there's

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
there's some stock ones where there's

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.140 
there's some stock ones where there's
not<00:04:43.690> a<00:04:43.750> lot<00:04:43.870> of<00:04:44.139> mini<00:04:44.440> turns<00:04:44.940> so<00:04:45.940> you're<00:04:46.060> just

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
not a lot of mini turns so you're just

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.280 
not a lot of mini turns so you're just
going<00:04:46.300> after<00:04:46.389> it<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.690> most<00:04:46.840> of<00:04:47.020> what<00:04:47.169> we've

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
going after it and most of what we've

00:04:47.290 --> 00:05:02.520 
going after it and most of what we've
got

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.350 

I<00:05:02.560> think<00:05:03.190> we<00:05:03.250> can<00:05:03.400> drift<00:05:03.580> on<00:05:03.790> straights<00:05:04.120> as

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
I think we can drift on straights as

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.670 
I think we can drift on straights as
well<00:05:05.400> what<00:05:06.400> if<00:05:06.520> you<00:05:06.670> do<00:05:06.880> a<00:05:07.270> scar<00:05:07.720> like<00:05:07.780> water

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
well what if you do a scar like water

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.310 
well what if you do a scar like water
first

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
yeah they would be hard to control a

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.310 
yeah they would be hard to control a
smaller<00:05:35.880> type<00:05:36.210> class<00:05:36.450> because<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:37.050> front

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
smaller type class because the front

00:05:37.320 --> 00:06:03.560 
smaller type class because the front
