00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
spaceman has a suit and we need him to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.840 
spaceman has a suit and we need him to
use<00:01:27.170> it<00:01:29.290> well<00:01:30.290> because<00:01:30.710> he's<00:01:30.980> got<00:01:31.160> a<00:01:31.190> spacesuit

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
use it well because he's got a spacesuit

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.900 
use it well because he's got a spacesuit
can't<00:01:32.690> go<00:01:32.840> out<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:33.050> space<00:01:33.350> without<00:01:33.560> one<00:01:33.980> and<00:01:34.250> if

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
can't go out in space without one and if

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.150 
can't go out in space without one and if
we're<00:01:35.090> going<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.420> escape<00:01:35.720> we<00:01:36.590> need<00:01:36.920> to<00:01:37.040> go

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
we're going to escape we need to go

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.850 
we're going to escape we need to go
outside<00:01:37.840> if<00:01:38.840> they<00:01:38.990> turn<00:01:39.050> out<00:01:39.230> the<00:01:39.410> elevator

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
outside if they turn out the elevator

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.970 
outside if they turn out the elevator
thinks<00:01:40.340> that's<00:01:40.760> the<00:01:40.970> only<00:01:41.330> other<00:01:41.480> way<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.660> go

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
thinks that's the only other way to go

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.940 
thinks that's the only other way to go
so<00:01:42.980> we<00:01:43.130> need<00:01:43.280> a<00:01:43.310> suit<00:01:43.670> see<00:01:44.530> simple

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.840 

this<00:01:48.950> is<00:01:49.160> going<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.610> be<00:01:49.760> so<00:01:50.210> neat
