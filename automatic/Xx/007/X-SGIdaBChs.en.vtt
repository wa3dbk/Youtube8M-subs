the rollercoasters of yesterday we were

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.020 
the rollercoasters of yesterday we were
far<00:00:14.219> cry

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
far cry

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:30.710

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.179 
today's high-tech scream machine when
you're<00:00:30.869> designing<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.380> coaster<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.980> know<00:00:32.009> I've

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
you're designing a coaster you know I've

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.790 
you're designing a coaster you know I've
had<00:00:32.369> I've<00:00:33.300> had<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.690> many<00:00:33.780> people<00:00:34.290> come<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.530> me

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
had I've had so many people come to me

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.680 
had I've had so many people come to me
and<00:00:34.890> say<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.160> know<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.940> not<00:00:36.149> really<00:00:36.450> hard

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
and say you know it it's not really hard

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.080 
and say you know it it's not really hard
to<00:00:36.930> design<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> coaster<00:00:38.100> all<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.940> do

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
to design a coaster all you have to do

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.190 
to design a coaster all you have to do
is<00:00:39.469> is<00:00:40.469> figure<00:00:41.219> out<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.610> losses<00:00:42.180> are<00:00:42.390> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
is is figure out what the losses are and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.720 
is is figure out what the losses are and
if<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.440> tell<00:00:43.649> me<00:00:43.800> those<00:00:44.010> I'll<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.489> able<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
if you tell me those I'll be able to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.700 
if you tell me those I'll be able to
design<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.329> well<00:00:45.600> that's<00:00:45.840> that's<00:00:46.320> what<00:00:46.590> it's

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
design one well that's that's what it's

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.380 
design one well that's that's what it's
all<00:00:46.860> about<00:00:47.129> knowing<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> losses<00:00:48.000> are

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
all about knowing what the losses are

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
all about knowing what the losses are
you<00:00:48.660> know<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.960> want<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.469> start<00:00:49.680> trying<00:00:49.950> to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
you know and I want to start trying to

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.060 
you know and I want to start trying to
do<00:00:50.219> something<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.360> pretty<00:00:51.629> hard<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.340 

visualize<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.489> thing<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> piece<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.390> paper<00:00:57.750> so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
visualize a thing on a piece of paper so

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.260 
visualize a thing on a piece of paper so
you<00:00:58.500> know<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.770> start<00:00:58.980> doing<00:00:59.190> something<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.640> 3d

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you know you start doing something in 3d

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.950 
you know you start doing something in 3d
and<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.730> know<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.969> can't<00:01:03.180> bend<00:01:03.780> this

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and and you know you can't bend this

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.500 
and and you know you can't bend this
thing<00:01:04.019> around<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.860> turn<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.030> know<00:01:06.180> a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
thing around and turn in you know a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
thing around and turn in you know a
normal<00:01:07.200> loop<00:01:07.380> looks<00:01:07.710> sort<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:12.530> now

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
normal loop looks sort of like that now

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.649 
normal loop looks sort of like that now
you<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.770> picture<00:01:13.950> something<00:01:14.310> coming<00:01:15.210> down

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
you can picture something coming down

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.600 
you can picture something coming down
here<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.259> dropping<00:01:16.619> down<00:01:17.009> quickly<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
here and dropping down quickly and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.760 
here and dropping down quickly and
around<00:01:18.000> turn<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.930> over<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> engineering

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
like to build a prototype of the riot

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.190 
like to build a prototype of the riot
either<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> full-scale<00:01:32.280> ride<00:01:32.610> or<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.360> full-scale

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
part of a ride it's kind of a scary

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.990 
part of a ride it's kind of a scary
thing<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:36.990> ride<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.560> because<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.610> only<00:01:38.759> built

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
thing to ride on because we only built

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.760 
thing to ride on because we only built
part<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.570> ride<00:01:39.780> there's<00:01:40.079> no<00:01:40.229> lifts<00:01:40.530> or

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
part of a ride there's no lifts or

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.620 
part of a ride there's no lifts or
anything<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:42.119> get<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> big

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
anything like that and we get a big

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.630 
anything like that and we get a big
crane<00:01:43.020> out<00:01:43.049> there<00:01:43.530> when<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:43.860> time<00:01:44.100> lift<00:01:44.490> this

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
crane out there when it's time lift this

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.580 
crane out there when it's time lift this
whole<00:01:44.850> track<00:01:45.210> piece<00:01:45.540> up<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.990> set<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.380> on

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
whole track piece up and set it up on

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.080 
whole track piece up and set it up on
top<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.880> let<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.270> thing<00:01:48.479> go<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:49.619> it

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
top and then let the thing go and it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.090 
top and then let the thing go and it
does<00:01:51.090> its<00:01:51.329> gyrations<00:01:52.170> from<00:01:52.439> around<00:01:52.740> its<00:01:52.950> own

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
does its gyrations from around its own

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.160 
does its gyrations from around its own
centerline<00:01:53.790> comes<00:01:54.570> back<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.079> there's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
centerline comes back and there's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.690 
centerline comes back and there's
nothing<00:01:55.530> there<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.070> end<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> track

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
nothing there but the end of the track

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.880 
nothing there but the end of the track
and<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> bunch<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.360> break<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.500> kind<00:01:58.799> of

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
and a bunch of break so it's kind of

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.190 
and a bunch of break so it's kind of
scary<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.399> see<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.390> end<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> pipes

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
scary to see this this end of the pipes

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.620 
scary to see this this end of the pipes
approaching<00:02:01.950> at<00:02:02.100> great<00:02:02.430> speed<00:02:02.820> knows<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
approaching at great speed knows and the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.780 
approaching at great speed knows and the
brakes<00:02:03.869> come<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.649> just<00:02:05.100> stop<00:02:05.369> before

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
brakes come on and you just stop before

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.999 
brakes come on and you just stop before
going<00:02:05.969> over<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> edge<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.899> then<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.829> think

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
going over the edge and then I think

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.499 
going over the edge and then I think
that's<00:02:08.190> been<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.369> pretty<00:02:08.550> exciting<00:02:08.729> ride<00:02:09.300> by

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
that's been a pretty exciting ride by

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.690 
that's been a pretty exciting ride by
its
