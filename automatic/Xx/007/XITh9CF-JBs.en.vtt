00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
it's just like if you take out of the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.289 
it's just like if you take out of the
box<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.920> start<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.430> first<00:01:08.640> time<00:01:08.820> for

box and start up for the first time for

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.300 
box and start up for the first time for
some<00:01:09.479> reason<00:01:09.810> maybe<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.650> image<00:01:10.979> gets

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
some reason maybe that image gets

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.670 
some reason maybe that image gets
corrupted<00:01:11.580> which<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.270> happen<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:13.049> recommend

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
corrupted which can happen we recommend

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.230 
corrupted which can happen we recommend
getting<00:01:13.799> recovery<00:01:14.189> disks<00:01:14.820> now<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.030> can

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
getting recovery disks now you can

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.030 
getting recovery disks now you can
create<00:01:15.689> them<00:01:16.080> which<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.439> created<00:01:16.830> another

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
create them which we created another

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.130 
create them which we created another
segment<00:01:17.340> or<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.970> buy<00:01:18.090> them<00:01:18.299> from<00:01:18.450> HP<00:01:18.780> com

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
segment or you can buy them from HP com

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.450
