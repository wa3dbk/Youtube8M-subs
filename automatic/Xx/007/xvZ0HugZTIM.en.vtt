let it some beyblades better than others
they<00:02:40.860> worked<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.459> all<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:42.060> beyblades<00:02:42.570> would

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
they worked it all the beyblades would

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:54.440 
they worked it all the beyblades would
work<00:02:43.140> differently<00:02:44.120> but<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:49.140> rules<00:02:49.500> are<00:02:53.450> you

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
work differently but the rules are you

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.729 
work differently but the rules are you
on<00:02:55.459> board<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.700> spacing<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:58.590> is

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
on board the spacing and this is

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.780 
on board the spacing and this is
basically<00:02:59.070> no<00:02:59.610> rules<00:02:59.940> no<00:03:00.290> makeup<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.790> yourself
