00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
this letter decent start because they

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.240 
this letter decent start because they

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
know there

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.530

like<00:01:46.930> a<00:01:46.960> runaway<00:01:47.619> train<00:01:50.250> there's<00:01:51.250> really<00:01:51.430> a

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
like a runaway train there's really a

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.639 
like a runaway train there's really a
track<00:01:51.880> hold<00:01:52.149> now<00:01:52.509> no<00:01:52.899> question<00:01:53.409> about<00:01:53.590> that

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
track hold now no question about that

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.660 
track hold now no question about that
and<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:54.520> think<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:56.259> crew<00:01:56.590> are<00:01:56.890> all<00:01:57.159> going<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.580> be

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
and I think the crew are all going to be

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.609 
and I think the crew are all going to be
okay<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.240> brake<00:01:58.570> man<00:01:58.810> at<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.140> back<00:01:59.380> they're

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
okay the brake man at the back they're

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.160 
okay the brake man at the back they're
very<00:02:00.160> exposed<00:02:00.700> there<00:02:01.000> is<00:02:01.119> nothing<00:02:01.630> behind<00:02:01.780> him

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
very exposed there is nothing behind him

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.430 
very exposed there is nothing behind him
the<00:02:02.800> sled<00:02:03.490> is<00:02:03.670> wide<00:02:04.060> open<00:02:04.090> as<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:04.750> roll<00:02:04.990> back<00:02:05.020> to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
the sled is wide open as it roll back to

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.850 
the sled is wide open as it roll back to
the<00:02:05.470> end<00:02:05.679> of<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:05.860> concrete<00:02:06.310> wall<00:02:07.410> yes<00:02:08.410> you<00:02:08.739> can

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
the end of the concrete wall yes you can

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.169 
the end of the concrete wall yes you can
see<00:02:09.039> him<00:02:09.130> scrambling<00:02:09.580> out<00:02:09.729> there<00:02:09.910> just

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
see him scrambling out there just

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:21.930 
see him scrambling out there just
between<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.600> heads<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:21.250> looks<00:02:21.640> like

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
between the heads it looks like

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.740 
between the heads it looks like
everybody<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.600> okay<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.820> sled<00:02:25.120> is<00:02:25.890> okay<00:02:26.890> but

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
everybody is okay the sled is okay but

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.940 
everybody is okay the sled is okay but
very<00:02:28.750> unlikely<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.290> they<00:02:29.560> were<00:02:29.620> going<00:02:29.860> to

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
very unlikely that they were going to

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.190 
very unlikely that they were going to
make<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.220> second<00:02:30.550> heat<00:02:30.700> anyway<00:02:31.150> but<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.019> mean

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
make the second heat anyway but I mean

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.140 
make the second heat anyway but I mean
look<00:02:32.560> at<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:32.799> you<00:02:33.070> know<00:02:33.190> it's<00:02:33.400> all<00:02:33.700> hands<00:02:34.030> to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
look at this you know it's all hands to

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.970 
look at this you know it's all hands to
