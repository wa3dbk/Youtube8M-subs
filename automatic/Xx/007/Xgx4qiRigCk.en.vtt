00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.260
 hello guys Welcome back to all this 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.170
 Customer space is xander 90 today we are 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.290
 again on pes always on club but 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.539
 for a very short video done on yours 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.240
 request or I tell you my method 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.670
 I explain to you my method of accumulating 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.710
 in short, credits more or less easily 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.869
 it's not really a trick though it is 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.730
 a simple reasoning that allows me 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.000
 every time you have a nice set aside 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.830
 nest egg then the basic principle for 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.650
 how paradoxical it can be 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.799
 play every day but play and little 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.839
 in the sense but the clubs is a very mode 

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:44.000
 onerous in terms of costs 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.530
 team maintenance as ad 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.739
 example renewal of contracts 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.640
 in fact if you play too many games 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:54.140
 every day ends up being more money 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.640
 credits that you would spend renewing 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.140
 continuously with traits rather than 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.629
 those who enter it from games that 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.019
 then play the trick as it is then 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.449
 su because there is obviously on the maghreb 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.950
 a daily bonus which is a bonus 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.840
 is given an account every day for the 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.659
 first win of the day 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.159
 so what should the bonus do is 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.560
 very substantial we say that with the 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.719
 more or less first victory is achieved 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.369
 4,000 gp the 3000 egp is something short 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.289
 between 3,000 and 4,000 rpm min and a nice 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.259
 nest egg 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:25.850
 so what needs to be done then must 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.890
 try to play every day 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.409
 possibly to connect at least one 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.789
 once a day and play and up to 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.710
 first win 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.969
 then if you are strong you will only need to do one 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.840
 game a day because played one 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.509
 game and you win 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.280
 but the trick is to connect every day 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.670
 find at least half an hour for 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.049
 connect you play until you do 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.579
 wins the first game as soon as he wins 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.740
 of the first game and collect the bonus 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.420
 for the first win of the day 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.729
 stop playing so you don't 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.710
 consume other contracts in this way 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.240
 if you are also quite patent there 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.909
 get away with winning the first 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.640
 game at the first attempt the maximum at 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.110
 second 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.119
 a week for example succeeded in 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.950
 really set a nice one 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.380
 nest egg if indeed it was good 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.019
 and you have not played too many 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.310
 games so this is the trick I will 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.500
 I had already explained a little in the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.760
 comments in video speeches however never 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.019
 also asked to explain in a video 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.030
 also because it is rightly clearer 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.130
 explained verbally or at least I hope so 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.709
 and in any case the trick comes to everyone 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.390
 it's playing every day but always little 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.739
 try to make as few games as possible 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.720
 try to win per day 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.370
 possibly the first game so 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.049
 to collect the bonus and not waste 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.700
 contracts this way you succeed 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.319
 always to have a good amount set aside 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.569
 igp you can spend when maybe 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.950
 special agents are placed or when 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.370
 you simply want to reinforce the 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.380
 team 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.530
 I hope I was clear this was 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.030
 more or less the method I use then 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.620
 let me know if you want maybe you have half 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.989
 different if you know any other 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.489
 good method for making credits 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.650
 then clearly it must also be said that in the 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.569
 online divisions the higher you rise with 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.700
 the divisions and more the reward however in 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.040
 victory and high so maybe when not 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.120
 or vision comes first things change 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.650
 alone perhaps at that point it is more 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.450
 profitable and play rather than use 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.980
 this method but if starting from the bottom 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.920
 this is a method to begin with is 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.600
 the guys are definitely ideal 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.130
 leave a like to this video serves 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.109
 somehow it was useful to you 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.340
 subscribe to space channels if still 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.720
