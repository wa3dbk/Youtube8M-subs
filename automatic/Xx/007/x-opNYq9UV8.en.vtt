00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.289 
is what it looks like the core right
here<00:01:15.710> just<00:01:16.710> light<00:01:16.979> stainless<00:01:17.580> steel<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.180> this

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
here just light stainless steel but this

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.310 
here just light stainless steel but this
is<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:19.439> sharp<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.420> then<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
is very sharp and then you have the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.609 
is very sharp and then you have the
handle<00:01:23.270> which<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.600> goes<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.229> top<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:26.130> that

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
handle which just goes on top like that

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:35.510 
handle which just goes on top like that
and<00:01:28.619> you're<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:31.350> first<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.100> slice<00:01:32.759> off<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:34.520> top

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
and you're so first I slice off the top

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.240 
and you're so first I slice off the top
of<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> pineapple<00:01:36.590> according<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
of the pineapple according to the to the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:49.969 
of the pineapple according to the to the
directions<00:01:42.140> like<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:46.250> next<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:48.110> core<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
directions like so and next I core the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.280 
directions like so and next I core the
pineapple<00:01:50.640> with<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.210> tool<00:01:51.829> so<00:01:52.829> it's<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.189> a

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
pineapple with this tool so it's just a

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:05.830 
pineapple with this tool so it's just a
clockwise<00:01:55.290> motion

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.229 

and<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.140> goes<00:02:07.350> into<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.069> pineapple<00:02:08.280> so

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
and if this goes into the pineapple so

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.990 
and if this goes into the pineapple so
easily<00:02:09.479> actually<00:02:10.430> really<00:02:11.430> easy<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.940> I'm

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
easily actually really easy so I'm

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.920 
easily actually really easy so I'm
hitting<00:02:12.120> some<00:02:12.480> resistance<00:02:14.299> and<00:02:15.299> all<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.840> have

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
hitting some resistance and all you have

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.449 
hitting some resistance and all you have
to<00:02:15.989> do<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.200> then<00:02:16.319> you<00:02:16.410> pull<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.920> guess<00:02:17.280> you

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
to do it then you pull out I guess you

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:25.190 
to do it then you pull out I guess you
pull<00:02:17.700> up<00:02:17.879> on<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:21.739> that<00:02:22.739> is<00:02:24.019> awesome

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
pull up on it that is awesome

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.910 
pull up on it that is awesome
that's<00:02:25.650> pretty<00:02:25.950> incredible<00:02:26.540> okay<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:28.620> then

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
that's pretty incredible okay and then

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.630 
that's pretty incredible okay and then
you

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
you

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.850 
you
I<00:02:32.690> think<00:02:33.690> pull<00:02:33.900> off<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.200> top<00:02:39.140> so<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.410> take<00:02:40.680> off

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
I think pull off the top so you take off

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.069 
I think pull off the top so you take off
the<00:02:41.040> top<00:02:41.280> right<00:02:41.489> here<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:44.299> this<00:02:45.299> just<00:02:45.360> slides
