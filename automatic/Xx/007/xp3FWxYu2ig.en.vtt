00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
to have a good swimsuit cover-up so the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.860 
to have a good swimsuit cover-up so the
one<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.170> would<00:02:03.530> take<00:02:03.710> is<00:02:03.920> from<00:02:04.540> Marshalls<00:02:05.540> and

one I would take is from Marshalls and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.080 
one I would take is from Marshalls and
this<00:02:06.620> is<00:02:06.770> more<00:02:06.950> of<00:02:07.040> like<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.310> guess<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.520> fancier

option<00:02:08.539> but<00:02:08.750> I<00:02:08.780> think<00:02:09.020> it's<00:02:09.170> really

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
option but I think it's really

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.630 
option but I think it's really
acceptable<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.009> wear<00:02:10.039> over<00:02:10.369> spring<00:02:10.610> break

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
acceptable to wear over spring break

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.730 
acceptable to wear over spring break
because<00:02:11.000> it's<00:02:11.360> neon<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:11.990> I<00:02:12.050> like<00:02:12.260> never<00:02:12.500> wear

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
because it's neon and I like never wear

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
color but during spring break I think

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.090 
color but during spring break I think
it's<00:02:14.690> acceptable<00:02:14.959> so<00:02:15.620> this<00:02:15.740> one's<00:02:15.950> like<00:02:16.070> a
