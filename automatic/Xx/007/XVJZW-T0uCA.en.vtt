00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
like a two-hundred-dollar camera that

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.490 
like a two-hundred-dollar camera that
actually<00:00:56.640> got<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:57.000> about<00:00:57.180> 75<00:00:57.719> bucks<00:00:57.750> because

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
actually got for about 75 bucks because

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.099 
actually got for about 75 bucks because
it<00:00:58.800> was<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.039> clearance<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.930> some<00:01:00.930> other

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
it was on clearance and some other

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.840 
it was on clearance and some other
discounts<00:01:01.710> were<00:01:01.829> applied<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.670> actually

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
discounts were applied so I actually

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.460 
discounts were applied so I actually
picked<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.359> pretty<00:01:03.420> cheap<00:01:03.809> figured<00:01:04.350> why

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
picked it up pretty cheap figured why

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.560 
picked it up pretty cheap figured why
not<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.920> know<00:01:04.949> at<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.939> very<00:01:06.090> least<00:01:06.180> it's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
not you know at the very least it's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.630 
not you know at the very least it's
probably<00:01:06.930> will<00:01:07.110> look<00:01:07.229> better<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.680> number<00:01:08.520> two

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
probably will look better and number two

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.300 
probably will look better and number two
it's<00:01:08.760> smaller<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:10.409> know<00:01:10.500> why<00:01:10.680> why<00:01:11.100> not

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it's smaller so you know why why not

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.070 
it's smaller so you know why why not

I wasn't there to see it but apparently

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.399 
I wasn't there to see it but apparently
some<00:01:36.360> people<00:01:36.390> said<00:01:36.750> its<00:01:36.869> own<00:01:36.960> was<00:01:37.140> bribing

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.249 
some people said its own was bribing
someone<00:01:37.650> or<00:01:38.460> people<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.869> that's<00:01:40.020> how<00:01:40.140> they

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
someone or people and that's how they

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.899 
someone or people and that's how they
shot<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.650> pretty<00:01:40.680> quick<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> polls<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.880> I

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
shot up pretty quick in the polls so I

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.179 
shot up pretty quick in the polls so I
would<00:01:42.150> definitely<00:01:42.180> consider<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.439> second

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189

would definitely consider it a second
place<00:01:44.899> second<00:01:45.899> place<00:01:45.930> victory<00:01:47.090> but<00:01:48.090> if<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.689> do

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.409 
which is really crappy um so it's
probably<00:04:37.280> gonna<00:04:37.460> be<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.580> little<00:04:37.669> bit<00:04:38.030> less<00:04:38.270> of

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
probably gonna be a little bit less of

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:39.940 
probably gonna be a little bit less of
an<00:04:38.510> output<00:04:38.750> of<00:04:38.810> videos<00:04:39.080> I<00:04:39.260> work<00:04:39.470> at<00:04:39.590> 6am

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
an output of videos I work at 6am

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.520 
an output of videos I work at 6am
tomorrow<00:04:40.790> I<00:04:41.240> got<00:04:41.389> off<00:04:41.510> of<00:04:41.540> work<00:04:41.690> at<00:04:41.930> seven<00:04:42.260> p.m.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
tomorrow I got off of work at seven p.m.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.780 
tomorrow I got off of work at seven p.m.
which<00:04:42.710> means<00:04:42.740> there's<00:04:43.100> about<00:04:43.250> an<00:04:43.370> 11<00:04:43.700> hour

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
which means there's about an 11 hour

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.640 
which means there's about an 11 hour
difference<00:04:44.090> which<00:04:44.600> isn't<00:04:45.020> a<00:04:45.050> whole<00:04:45.080> lot<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:45.560> do

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
difference which isn't a whole lot to do

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.680 
difference which isn't a whole lot to do
much<00:04:45.889> when<00:04:46.520> you<00:04:46.610> factor<00:04:46.850> in<00:04:47.120> sleep<00:04:47.419> and

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
much when you factor in sleep and

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.080 
much when you factor in sleep and
everything<00:04:48.590> else<00:04:48.740> so<00:04:49.040> we'll<00:04:49.880> see<00:04:50.000> what

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
everything else so we'll see what

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.070 
everything else so we'll see what
happens<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.419> next<00:04:50.480> few<00:04:50.720> days<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:50.870> actually

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
happens the next few days I actually

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.570 
happens the next few days I actually
managed<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.470> get<00:04:51.620> rid<00:04:51.770> of<00:04:51.830> one<00:04:52.250> of<00:04:52.280> my<00:04:52.430> days

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
managed to get rid of one of my days

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.760 
managed to get rid of one of my days
next<00:04:52.910> week<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.389> the<00:04:53.870> schedule<00:04:54.080> after<00:04:54.350> that<00:04:54.620> is

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
next week and the schedule after that is

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.560 
next week and the schedule after that is
a<00:04:54.800> little<00:04:54.919> bit<00:04:55.070> late<00:04:55.370> I'm<00:04:55.910> also<00:04:56.060> going<00:04:56.300> for<00:04:56.540> a

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
a little bit late I'm also going for a

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.080 
a little bit late I'm also going for a
promotion<00:04:57.110> again<00:04:57.440> um<00:04:57.680> it<00:04:58.430> would<00:04:58.490> be<00:04:58.640> like<00:04:58.940> the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
promotion again um it would be like the

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.630 
promotion again um it would be like the
second<00:04:59.419> promotion<00:04:59.810> in<00:04:59.930> for<00:05:00.250> four<00:05:01.250> months<00:05:01.460> and

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
second promotion in for four months and

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.030 
second promotion in for four months and
it<00:05:01.790> would<00:05:01.910> actually<00:05:02.210> put<00:05:02.390> me<00:05:02.480> into<00:05:02.860> two<00:05:03.860> like<00:05:04.010> a

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
it would actually put me into two like a

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.880 
it would actually put me into two like a
lower<00:05:04.340> end<00:05:04.669> manager<00:05:05.120> position<00:05:06.080> which<00:05:06.860> would

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
lower end manager position which would

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.530 
lower end manager position which would
boost<00:05:07.250> them<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:07.610> pay<00:05:07.850> a<00:05:07.880> little<00:05:08.180> bit<00:05:08.300> which

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
boost them I pay a little bit which

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.900 
boost them I pay a little bit which
would<00:05:08.660> be<00:05:08.720> nice<00:05:08.870> so<00:05:09.140> more<00:05:10.010> more<00:05:10.490> news<00:05:10.700> on<00:05:10.850> that

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
would be nice so more more news on that

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.659 
would be nice so more more news on that
probably<00:05:11.510> on<00:05:11.720> the<00:05:11.840> other<00:05:11.960> channel<00:05:12.669> Sheamus

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
probably on the other channel Sheamus

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.730 
probably on the other channel Sheamus
pkc<00:05:14.060> which<00:05:14.360> is<00:05:14.480> real-life<00:05:14.690> stuff<00:05:14.870> you<00:05:15.500> don't
