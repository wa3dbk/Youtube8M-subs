00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.629
 So I want it already 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.089
 SID Meier's traditional strategy Web goes into the fourth round 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.049
 and again the name is program 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.910
 we have one of 18 tribes, including the Egyptians as well as the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.820
 Mongols or Teutons from the beginning of civilization bit of 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.060
 vehicle owners 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.149
 and beyond 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.399
 As already in the three predecessors are already in Seville already four 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.349
 first laps on the crucial ones 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.470
 As the starting conditions are explored, it may be that they are rich 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.200
 Land of the middle of the desert an arm 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 In such cases, a restart is usually announced 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.120
 But it can also happen that as in our party here in the vicinity 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.410
 a river flows from the fertile fields and play right next door 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.100
 Aboriginal baptism raises that the discoverer with appreciate the Colts cards 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.580
 Rewards or even fresh units rewarded 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.450
 unless they make the mistake of invading a soldier 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.790
 The tribal warriors do not like that 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.500
 in our case, the first contact succeeds the natives give us 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.480
 a map with which we get to know the environment better a mouse click 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.530
 later our first city was founded Berlin as the first building 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.830
 we give a barracks order the units trained there experience points 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.770
 promises 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.240
 they make them more resistant in combat 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.400
 We also give our first research assignment 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.090
 Forms that the land wants to be able to manage 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.180
 the technologies are beside the building parts the a and o in Sevilla mental 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.420
 and the excellent menu guidance and advice 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.400
 which project we should tackle next, it usually lies with it 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.930
 also exactly right 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.460
 In principle, they can play offended here very well without ever the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.810
 Leave main card 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.320
 only for fine-tuning you sometimes have to use the administrative 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.320
 to endeavor to scold 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.670
 slowly but surely, we start to cultivate the surrounding land 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.390
 For this, the workers form troops from those in the surrounding fields 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.750
 For example, farms build mines dig ditches and roads 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.290
 The more resources like fish wheat ivory or iron a city 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.290
 the faster the 10 grows the happier and happier you live 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.379
 their citizens 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.559
 In addition, rare raw materials bring benefits in many construction and 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.029
 research projects 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:22.290
 and also make coveted trading books because we with the of 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.069
 Lead computer controlled 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.069
 rich can exchange 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.930
 build and research and act the card set Meier's earlier works also 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.769
 Already what the religions did not have some technologies like 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:35.499
 philosophy 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:39.649
 The Basic Law Bodo Monotheism enable the first discoverer one 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:43.479
 To proclaim a new belief We have just started Confucianism here 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:44.459
 called 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.299
 if we manage to spread it with missionaries in all our cities 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.319
 and establish as a state religion 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.179
 increases the satisfaction of our citizens 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.779
 But religions also have risks 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.849
 so it can come to civil war if too many different faiths 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.089
 to fight for supremacy 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:04.429
 also between entire peoples can request the religious wars us report 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.419
 On the other hand, foreign cities sometimes close peacefully to others 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:09.250
 States 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.250
 if they believe and share other cultural peculiarities 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.909
 the fight for cultural supremacy seems to be on at all 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:18.209
 Gained importance 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.759
 who creates other peoples through cultural masterpieces and 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:23.309
 Impress world wonders 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.939
 against his sphere of influence always further and can so in the best case 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.949
 entire continents under its flag bring together great civilizations 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:34.569
 also great explorers and researchers who can be used 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.070
 as scientists accelerate research 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.900
 to develop a completely new technology though special building too 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.419
 establish 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:46.680
 here the ambience in their new world a Dutch explorer many 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:50.699
 Microorganisms in Hamburg build a laboratory that the Research Council 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:55.040
 Alone, the most pious person can not live in peace if it lives up to it 

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:58.909
 evil neighbors do not like the computer princes use in the higher ones 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.919
 Difficulty any weakness mercilessly 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.540
 and so we find ourselves after a while meanwhile arrived in the Middle Ages 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:08.279
 Suddenly Leighton sprang back 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:12.249
 Lucky we did not neglect our military and a big one 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:15.349
 Army Plus is ready for such cases already at the border 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.930
 Commonly, the others at Corridor immediately seek profit out of the conflict 

00:04:19.929 --> 00:04:20.559
 beat 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.740
 Hundt even comparatively weak peoples like the police Rosenheim 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.419
 we now set outrageous demands 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.919
 knowing that we have to respond if we do not go to war 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.840
 want to risk multiple fronts 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.540
 also the person Englishmen fall us soon with Reboot demands in the 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.599
 move 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.819
 that's one against man from the system of Civilization 4 is still 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:42.680
 comparatively positive 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.230
 that have competing titles like the two crossing Hauer offshoot already better 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:47.370
 solved 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.490
 despite process bonuses stone scissors paper principle and different tare 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.020
 Modification still depends a good part of the outcome of a battle 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.180
 Coincidence 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.360
 after all, and sword fighting no tank army beat more 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.650
 why, for example, our ACS is in the fight against covered catapults 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.360
 Hamburg remain processing 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.650
 no idea 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.560
 For this she is slowly but surely working on the first of our strike army 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.350
 Assassin town after two rounds banter finally under 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.919
 our control Â»field 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.789
 the bottom line, they get offended Mitterrand with the fourth part of the 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.830
 Range of an ingenious feature for the region made sense 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.050
 successor 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.250
 for newcomers SZ Meier's latest trick due to the successful user interface 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.550
 and the handsome graphics are the ideal entry point 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.259
 Personally, I would have liked a bit bolder improvements 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.389
 especially the fighting system that still sticks to the age-old m Mr. Winners 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.389
 I just can not keep up with the times today 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:49.539
 No
