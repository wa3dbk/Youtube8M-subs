well folks this is my old champion 5500

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.430 
well folks this is my old champion 5500
watt<00:00:05.060> backup<00:00:06.060> generator<00:00:06.450> I've<00:00:06.720> had<00:00:07.020> for<00:00:07.259> about

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
watt backup generator I've had for about

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.640 
watt backup generator I've had for about
10<00:00:07.740> years<00:00:07.919> now<00:00:08.269> as<00:00:09.269> you<00:00:09.510> can<00:00:09.660> see<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:10.050> hasn't

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
10 years now as you can see it hasn't

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.890 
10 years now as you can see it hasn't
been<00:00:10.920> cleaned<00:00:11.219> in<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.490> long<00:00:11.670> time<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.179> more

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
been cleaned in a long time and more

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.749 
been cleaned in a long time and more
importantly<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.860> gas<00:00:14.070> hasn't<00:00:14.670> been

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
importantly the gas hasn't been

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.279 
importantly the gas hasn't been
replenished<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.330> here<00:00:15.509> for<00:00:15.719> at<00:00:15.900> least<00:00:16.020> five

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
replenished in here for at least five

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.160 
replenished in here for at least five
years<00:00:17.060> this<00:00:18.060> gas<00:00:18.270> has<00:00:18.539> been<00:00:18.660> sitting<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.020> here

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
years this gas has been sitting in here

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.740 
years this gas has been sitting in here
forever<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.850> hasn't<00:00:21.000> started<00:00:21.480> in

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
forever and it hasn't started in

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.660 
forever and it hasn't started in
approximately<00:00:22.380> two<00:00:22.560> years<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.490> see

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
approximately two years and you can see

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.000 
approximately two years and you can see
oh<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.240> don't<00:00:24.720> know<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.170> might<00:00:25.380> not<00:00:25.410> be<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.740> good

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
oh I don't know this might not be a good

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.120 
oh I don't know this might not be a good
thing

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.230 

document<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.220> just<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.550> see<00:00:29.699> if<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.910> starts

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
document this just to see if it starts

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.999 
document this just to see if it starts
and<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.539> will<00:00:30.720> kind<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.230> debunk<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.800> myth

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
and this will kind of debunk the myth

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.540 
and this will kind of debunk the myth
the<00:00:32.250> people<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.730> gas<00:00:32.969> goes<00:00:33.960> bad<00:00:34.430> what<00:00:35.430> I've

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the people that gas goes bad what I've

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.270 
the people that gas goes bad what I've
done<00:00:35.670> differently<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.420> then<00:00:37.170> what<00:00:38.129> my

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
done differently on this then what my

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.150 
done differently on this then what my
dad<00:00:38.489> used<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.840> his<00:00:40.079> power<00:00:40.649> tools<00:00:40.950> he

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
dad used to do with his power tools he

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.150 
dad used to do with his power tools he
used<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.579> shut<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> fuel<00:00:42.870> off<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.500> let<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
used to shut the fuel off and let the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.549 
used to shut the fuel off and let the
carburetor<00:00:44.550> drain<00:00:44.850> every<00:00:45.510> time<00:00:45.690> he<00:00:45.840> used<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
carburetor drain every time he used a

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.830 
carburetor drain every time he used a
lawnmower<00:00:47.100> or<00:00:47.370> whatever<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.750> he<00:00:48.809> was

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
lawnmower or whatever but he was

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.360 
lawnmower or whatever but he was
constantly<00:00:49.289> having<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.890> take<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
constantly having to take the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.580 
constantly having to take the
carburetors<00:00:50.789> apart<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.329> clean<00:00:51.750> them<00:00:51.930> because

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
carburetors apart and clean them because

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.799 
carburetors apart and clean them because
the<00:00:52.920> fuel<00:00:53.160> would<00:00:53.370> varnish<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.120> them<00:00:54.300> this

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the fuel would varnish up in them this

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.450 
the fuel would varnish up in them this
one<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.350> gas<00:00:55.500> cap<00:00:55.770> has<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.160> been<00:00:56.309> turned

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
one here the gas cap has not been turned

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.840 
one here the gas cap has not been turned
off<00:00:57.620> see<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> gas<00:00:58.920> valves<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:01.850> hopefully

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
off see the gas valves on and hopefully

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.789 
off see the gas valves on and hopefully
the<00:01:03.030> gas<00:01:03.660> hasn't<00:01:04.080> evaporated<00:01:04.290> from<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the gas hasn't evaporated from the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.190 
the gas hasn't evaporated from the
football<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:06.090> gas<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.570> evaporate<00:01:06.720> would

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
football and what gas to evaporate would

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.770 
football and what gas to evaporate would
be<00:01:07.350> replenished<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.360> let's<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.510> see<00:01:09.630> this

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
be replenished and let's just see this

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.660 
be replenished and let's just see this
thing<00:01:09.840> starts<00:01:10.320> now<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> don't<00:01:11.100> even<00:01:11.310> know<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
thing starts now I don't even know the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.250 
thing starts now I don't even know the
batteries<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> charge<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:13.110> it

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
batteries get a charge in it because it

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.859 
batteries get a charge in it because it
hasn't<00:01:13.439> been<00:01:13.619> started<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.640> about<00:01:15.450> 20<00:01:15.750> months

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
hasn't been started in about 20 months

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.770 
hasn't been started in about 20 months
so<00:01:16.229> let's<00:01:16.470> see<00:01:16.680> what<00:01:16.799> happens<00:01:17.420> so<00:01:18.420> first<00:01:18.659> thing

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
so let's see what happens so first thing

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.990 
so let's see what happens so first thing
I<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.049> I'm<00:01:19.140> gonna<00:01:19.229> turn<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> choke<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:23.000> see

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
I do is I'm gonna turn the choke on see

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:50.300 
I do is I'm gonna turn the choke on see
if<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.150> starts

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:02:26.870 

so<00:01:51.310> far<00:01:51.550> nothing

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.420 

so<00:02:27.240> there<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.570> it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.820 

but<00:02:31.000> started<00:02:31.719> up<00:02:31.810> no<00:02:31.989> problem

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
but started up no problem

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.250 
but started up no problem
gaseous<00:02:34.490> in<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.760> tank<00:02:35.000> here<00:02:35.300> is<00:02:35.450> five<00:02:36.050> minute

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
gaseous in the tank here is five minute

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:45.800 
gaseous in the tank here is five minute
set<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.500> off

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.840 

so<00:02:46.810> there<00:02:46.990> you<00:02:47.050> have<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.530> did<00:02:48.490> take<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> bit<00:02:48.820> of

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
so there you have it I did take a bit of

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.820 
so there you have it I did take a bit of
cranking<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.330> get<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.510> going<00:02:49.780> but<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.710> did

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
cranking to get it going but it did

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.000 
cranking to get it going but it did
start<00:02:51.100> no<00:02:51.460> problem<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.380> this<00:02:53.380> gas<00:02:53.590> has<00:02:53.830> been

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
start no problem and this gas has been

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.070 
start no problem and this gas has been
in<00:02:54.130> this<00:02:54.250> tank<00:02:54.520> for<00:02:54.880> about<00:02:55.120> five<00:02:55.480> years<00:02:55.690> now

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
in this tank for about five years now

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.290 
in this tank for about five years now
has<00:02:56.260> only<00:02:56.410> been<00:02:56.650> filled<00:02:56.920> up<00:02:57.040> once<00:02:57.490> since<00:02:58.120> I

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
has only been filled up once since I

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.910 
has only been filled up once since I
purchased<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.960> generator<00:02:59.380> I've<00:02:59.620> had<00:02:59.800> it

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
purchased the generator I've had it

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.310 
purchased the generator I've had it
about<00:02:59.980> 10<00:03:00.280> years<00:03:00.520> and<00:03:00.900> we<00:03:01.900> don't<00:03:02.080> get<00:03:02.140> many

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
about 10 years and we don't get many

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.980 
about 10 years and we don't get many
power<00:03:02.620> failures<00:03:03.010> here<00:03:03.660> still<00:03:04.660> got<00:03:04.780> about<00:03:04.930> a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
power failures here still got about a

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.470

equipment<00:03:27.010> every<00:03:27.760> every<00:03:28.600> spring<00:03:28.930> he<00:03:29.110> was

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
equipment every every spring he was

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.920 
equipment every every spring he was
having<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.590> take<00:03:29.709> carburetors<00:03:30.250> apart<00:03:30.550> and

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
having to take carburetors apart and

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.690 
having to take carburetors apart and
clean<00:03:31.930> them<00:03:32.110> take<00:03:32.650> all<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.950> varnish<00:03:33.310> out<00:03:33.459> and

clean them take all the varnish out and

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.110 
clean them take all the varnish out and
that's<00:03:33.820> because<00:03:35.580> when<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.670> fuel<00:03:36.880> evaporates

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
that's because when the fuel evaporates

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.810 
that's because when the fuel evaporates
it<00:03:37.540> leaves<00:03:37.570> a<00:03:37.900> sticky<00:03:38.800> varnish<00:03:39.280> behind<00:03:39.640> that

it leaves a sticky varnish behind that

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.080 
it leaves a sticky varnish behind that
will<00:03:39.940> clog<00:03:40.420> up<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:40.630> Jets<00:03:41.520> by<00:03:42.520> leaving<00:03:43.000> the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
it's replenished by fresh gas so you

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.710 
it's replenished by fresh gas so you

never end up with a residue it's always

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.340 
never end up with a residue it's always
replenished<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:54.400> gained<00:03:55.239> for<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:56.140> last
