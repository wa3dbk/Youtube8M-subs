in<00:00:16.070> this<00:00:16.910> example<00:00:17.090> we're<00:00:17.599> going<00:00:17.720> to<00:00:17.779> talk

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
in this example we're going to talk

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.779 
in this example we're going to talk
about<00:00:18.140> how<00:00:18.439> to<00:00:18.470> make<00:00:18.740> transitions<00:00:19.369> involving

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
about how to make transitions involving

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.470 
about how to make transitions involving

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
Tom Phil's sound more natural now here's

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.760 
Tom Phil's sound more natural now here's
a<00:00:23.980> here's<00:00:24.980> a<00:00:25.130> Tom<00:00:25.400> Phil<00:00:26.199> leading<00:00:27.199> out<00:00:27.439> of<00:00:27.619> a

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
a here's a Tom Phil leading out of a

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.589 
a here's a Tom Phil leading out of a
pre-chorus<00:00:28.340> into<00:00:28.700> a<00:00:28.730> course<00:00:29.000> this<00:00:29.239> is<00:00:29.329> what's

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.110 

really<00:00:32.599> good<00:00:32.840> Phil<00:00:33.170> lots<00:00:34.160> nice<00:00:34.520> lots<00:00:34.969> of

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
really good Phil lots nice lots of

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.900 
really good Phil lots nice lots of
energy<00:00:35.239> nice<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:36.320> robust<00:00:36.739> but<00:00:37.280> you<00:00:37.430> can<00:00:37.610> see

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
energy nice and robust but you can see

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.139 
energy nice and robust but you can see
that<00:00:37.940> this<00:00:38.450> last<00:00:39.410> floor<00:00:39.860> tom<00:00:40.129> hit<00:00:40.399> is<00:00:40.550> very

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
that this last floor tom hit is very

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.060 
that this last floor tom hit is very
close<00:00:41.539> to<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:41.899> downbeat<00:00:42.440> of<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.590> next<00:00:42.829> bar

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
close to the downbeat of the next bar

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.160 
close to the downbeat of the next bar
and<00:00:43.340> just<00:00:44.060> because<00:00:44.360> of<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.510> way<00:00:44.570> loops<00:00:44.930> are

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
and just because of the way loops are

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.040 
and just because of the way loops are
are<00:00:45.829> constructed<00:00:46.520> each<00:00:47.120> one<00:00:47.450> starts<00:00:47.840> on<00:00:47.960> the

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
are constructed each one starts on the

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.710 
are constructed each one starts on the
downbeat<00:00:48.260> of<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:48.590> bar<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.160> that<00:00:49.430> that<00:00:49.760> Tom

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
downbeat of the bar and so that that Tom

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.920 
downbeat of the bar and so that that Tom
feel<00:00:50.930> gets<00:00:51.170> off<00:00:51.650> and<00:00:52.640> we<00:00:52.790> know<00:00:52.970> that<00:00:53.000> that<00:00:53.780> the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
feel gets off and we know that that the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.530 
feel gets off and we know that that the
next<00:00:54.230> loop<00:00:54.560> since<00:00:55.520> this<00:00:55.730> is<00:00:55.910> a<00:00:55.940> pretty<00:00:56.239> rowdy

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
next loop since this is a pretty rowdy

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.750 
next loop since this is a pretty rowdy
fill<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.560> next<00:00:57.829> loop<00:00:57.980> for<00:00:58.190> sure<00:00:58.370> is<00:00:58.520> going<00:00:58.670> to

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
fill the next loop for sure is going to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.350 
fill the next loop for sure is going to
want<00:00:58.940> to<00:00:59.000> start<00:00:59.360> with<00:00:59.600> a<00:01:00.520> crash<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:02.120> here's

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
want to start with a crash so here's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.229 
want to start with a crash so here's
course<00:01:02.780> crash<00:01:03.280> we'll<00:01:04.280> put<00:01:04.489> that<00:01:04.640> in<00:01:04.790> there<00:01:05.000> and

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
course crash we'll put that in there and

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.870 
course crash we'll put that in there and
see<00:01:05.449> what<00:01:05.570> it<00:01:05.659> sounds<00:01:05.960> like<00:01:06.579> see<00:01:07.579> if<00:01:07.700> it's

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
see what it sounds like see if it's

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.209 
see what it sounds like see if it's
sufficient<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:09.890> make<00:01:10.189> that<00:01:10.430> Tom<00:01:12.009> ok<00:01:13.009> that

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
sufficient to to make that Tom ok that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:18.190 
sufficient to to make that Tom ok that
works<00:01:13.399> ok<00:01:13.790> plan<00:01:14.360> together<00:01:16.900> and<00:01:17.900> we<00:01:17.990> have<00:01:18.110> the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
works ok plan together and we have the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.870 
works ok plan together and we have the
crash<00:01:18.409> on<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.680> downbeat<00:01:18.860> now<00:01:19.220> their<00:01:19.490> guitars

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
crash on the downbeat now their guitars

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.640 
crash on the downbeat now their guitars
are<00:01:20.120> playing<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.720> base<00:01:20.930> is<00:01:21.170> playing<00:01:21.440> and

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
are playing and the base is playing and

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.039 
are playing and the base is playing and
stuff<00:01:21.860> that<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:23.000> know<00:01:23.090> that<00:01:23.299> might<00:01:23.840> get

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
stuff that you know that might get

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.870 
stuff that you know that might get
masked<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:24.740> you<00:01:25.100> probably<00:01:25.400> wouldn't<00:01:25.700> notice

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
masked and you probably wouldn't notice

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.240 
masked and you probably wouldn't notice
it<00:01:26.360> but<00:01:26.990> if<00:01:27.229> you<00:01:27.350> really<00:01:27.530> want<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.830> finesse<00:01:28.220> a

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
it but if you really want to finesse a

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.760 
it but if you really want to finesse a
Phil<00:01:28.760> like<00:01:29.000> this<00:01:29.330> and<00:01:29.600> make<00:01:30.200> it<00:01:30.380> sound<00:01:30.650> very

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
Phil like this and make it sound very

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.930 
Phil like this and make it sound very
very<00:01:31.400> natural<00:01:32.290> this<00:01:33.290> is<00:01:33.440> how<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.650> do<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.100> let's

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
very natural this is how you do it let's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.539 
very natural this is how you do it let's
go<00:01:35.290> gone<00:01:36.290> I've<00:01:36.500> gone<00:01:36.650> into<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.010> single<00:01:37.220> hits

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
go gone I've gone into the single hits

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.730 
go gone I've gone into the single hits
and<00:01:37.790> grab<00:01:38.390> this<00:01:38.720> floor<00:01:39.020> time<00:01:39.200> head<00:01:39.380> it's<00:01:39.530> just

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
and grab this floor time head it's just

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.440 
and grab this floor time head it's just
a<00:01:39.860> single<00:01:40.100> floor<00:01:40.430> tom<00:01:40.640> hit<00:01:40.909> oh<00:01:43.210> ok<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:44.330> what

of<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.200> grid<00:01:51.380> mode<00:01:51.560> since<00:01:51.860> this<00:01:52.070> is<00:01:52.250> not<00:01:52.430> a

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
of the grid mode since this is not a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.649 
of the grid mode since this is not a
grid<00:01:53.740> action<00:01:54.740> there's<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.970> there's<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.390> Tom

Phil hit or the Tom floor tom hit I'm

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.859 
Phil hit or the Tom floor tom hit I'm
going<00:02:00.049> to<00:02:00.170> take<00:02:00.350> this<00:02:00.560> additional<00:02:01.490> Tom<00:02:01.869> single

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
going to take this additional Tom single

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.780 
going to take this additional Tom single
hit<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.229> stick<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:03.920> that<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.189> happens
