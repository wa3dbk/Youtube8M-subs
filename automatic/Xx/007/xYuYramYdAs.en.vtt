00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
symptoms now what happens is when you're

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.440 
symptoms now what happens is when you're
eating<00:00:31.769> these<00:00:31.949> foods<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.000> you're<00:00:33.180> allergic

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
eating these foods that you're allergic

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.440 
eating these foods that you're allergic
to<00:00:33.660> they<00:00:34.290> enter<00:00:34.620> your<00:00:34.649> bloodstream<00:00:35.100> as<00:00:35.760> whole

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
to they enter your bloodstream as whole

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.360 
to they enter your bloodstream as whole
food<00:00:36.890> components<00:00:37.890> which<00:00:38.040> they're<00:00:38.219> not

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
food components which they're not

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.459 
food components which they're not
supposed<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.059> do<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.629> that's<00:00:40.079> because

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
supposed to do and that's because

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.560 
supposed to do and that's because
there's<00:00:40.649> little<00:00:40.860> holes<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.489> your<00:00:41.640> GI<00:00:41.879> tract

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
there's little holes in your GI tract

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.810 
there's little holes in your GI tract
when<00:00:43.140> these<00:00:43.260> food<00:00:43.559> components<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.399> into<00:00:44.670> your

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
when these food components get into your

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.299 
when these food components get into your
blood<00:00:45.180> your<00:00:45.510> immune<00:00:45.809> system<00:00:46.379> recognizes<00:00:47.160> that

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
blood your immune system recognizes that

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.600 
blood your immune system recognizes that
and<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.700> an<00:00:47.789> immune<00:00:48.120> reaction<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.960> that

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
and you get an immune reaction and that

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.090 
and you get an immune reaction and that
intense<00:00:50.610> immune<00:00:51.090> reaction<00:00:51.809> also<00:00:52.350> goes<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.829> in

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
intense immune reaction also goes on in

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.810 
intense immune reaction also goes on in
the<00:00:53.190> brain<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.469> brain<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.980> immune<00:00:56.219> system

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the brain so the brain is immune system

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.810 
the brain so the brain is immune system
is<00:00:56.940> also<00:00:57.180> activated<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.590> releases<00:00:58.820> toxic

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
is also activated it releases toxic

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.479 
is also activated it releases toxic
components<00:01:00.559> including<00:01:01.559> glutamate<00:01:02.250> and

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
components including glutamate and

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.759 
components including glutamate and
that's<00:01:03.270> what<00:01:03.480> causes<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.960> neurological

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
that's what causes the neurological

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.240 
that's what causes the neurological
dysfunction<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.380> get<00:01:07.530> all<00:01:07.680> kinds<00:01:07.710> of

completely<00:02:09.599> normal<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.849> as<00:02:12.450> long<00:02:12.750> as<00:02:12.780> they

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
completely normal and as long as they

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.990 
completely normal and as long as they

avoided

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.090 
avoided
and<00:02:14.390> gluten<00:02:14.780> they<00:02:14.960> were<00:02:15.020> normal<00:02:15.590> when<00:02:15.920> they

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
and gluten they were normal when they

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.790 
and gluten they were normal when they
got<00:02:16.280> back<00:02:16.340> on<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:16.970> even<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.420> small<00:02:18.050> amount<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.620> it

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
got back on it even a small amount of it

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.100 
got back on it even a small amount of it
they<00:02:19.250> were<00:02:19.310> fully<00:02:19.820> schizophrenic<00:02:20.540> again<00:02:20.930> and

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
they were fully schizophrenic again and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.860 
they were fully schizophrenic again and
had<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.320> be<00:02:21.440> hospitalized<00:02:22.330> case<00:02:23.330> after<00:02:23.690> case

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
had to be hospitalized case after case

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.670 
had to be hospitalized case after case
after<00:02:24.140> case<00:02:25.240> so<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:26.510> shows<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:26.870> this<00:02:27.410> can

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
after case so that shows that this can

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.730 
after case so that shows that this can
have<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:28.190> terrible<00:02:28.910> effect<00:02:29.330> on<00:02:29.570> brain<00:02:29.990> function

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
have a terrible effect on brain function

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.180 
have a terrible effect on brain function
and<00:02:30.920> could<00:02:31.700> end<00:02:31.850> up<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.210> mental<00:02:32.420> institute

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
and could end up in a mental institute

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.030 
and could end up in a mental institute
now<00:02:34.190> ironically<00:02:34.610> food<00:02:35.240> allergies<00:02:35.900> often<00:02:36.530> make

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
now ironically food allergies often make

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.920 
now ironically food allergies often make
you<00:02:37.250> crave<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.940> very<00:02:38.180> food<00:02:38.450> you're<00:02:38.720> allergic

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
you crave the very food you're allergic

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.860 
you crave the very food you're allergic
to<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.490> see<00:02:40.850> people<00:02:41.060> are<00:02:41.330> allergic<00:02:41.510> to

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
to so you see people are allergic to

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.240 
to so you see people are allergic to
food<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.440> that's<00:02:42.590> what<00:02:42.740> they<00:02:42.890> want<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.190> eat

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
food and that's what they want to eat

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.890 
food and that's what they want to eat
they'll<00:02:43.670> eat<00:02:43.820> it<00:02:43.850> need<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.270> need<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:44.780> of

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
they'll eat it need it need it and of

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.570 
they'll eat it need it need it and of
course<00:02:44.930> every<00:02:45.320> time<00:02:45.530> they<00:02:45.680> do<00:02:45.740> they<00:02:46.040> get<00:02:46.220> sick

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
course every time they do they get sick

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.790 
course every time they do they get sick
and<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.450> don't<00:02:47.720> know<00:02:47.959> how<00:02:48.110> many<00:02:48.170> people<00:02:48.650> we've

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
and I don't know how many people we've

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.730 
and I don't know how many people we've
had<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.310> complained<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:50.020> unable<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.200> thanked

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
had that complained of unable to thanked

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.340 
had that complained of unable to thanked
and<00:02:51.890> cloudy<00:02:52.190> thinking<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.720> found<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.170> food

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
and cloudy thinking and you found a food

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.900 
and cloudy thinking and you found a food
allergy<00:02:54.590> took<00:02:55.010> them<00:02:55.160> off<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.340> food<00:02:55.640> and

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
allergy took them off the food and

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.390 
allergy took them off the food and
they're<00:02:56.030> just<00:02:56.360> amazing<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:57.440> can't<00:02:57.740> believe<00:02:58.130> how

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
they're just amazing I can't believe how

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.840 
they're just amazing I can't believe how
clearly<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:59.090> can<00:02:59.390> think<00:02:59.690> now<00:03:00.490> so<00:03:01.490> these<00:03:01.640> are

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
clearly I can think now so these are

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.790 
clearly I can think now so these are
profound<00:03:02.300> effects<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.110> this<00:03:03.260> has<00:03:03.410> all<00:03:03.590> been

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
profound effects and this has all been

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.730 
profound effects and this has all been
worked<00:03:04.040> out<00:03:04.310> in<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.600> laboratory<00:03:06.260> we<00:03:06.709> can

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
worked out in the laboratory we can

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.010 
worked out in the laboratory we can
demonstrate<00:03:07.190> this<00:03:07.880> we<00:03:08.150> know<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.480> some<00:03:08.690> immune

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
demonstrate this we know the some immune

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.930 
demonstrate this we know the some immune
cytokines<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.890> actually<00:03:10.370> do<00:03:10.550> it

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
cytokines that actually do it

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.780 
cytokines that actually do it
the<00:03:11.870> same<00:03:12.170> effect<00:03:12.650> happens<00:03:12.920> with<00:03:13.400> over

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
the same effect happens with over

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.680 
the same effect happens with over
vaccinations<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.459> why<00:03:16.690> vaccinating

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
vaccinations and this is why vaccinating

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.050 
vaccinations and this is why vaccinating
kids<00:03:18.019> with<00:03:18.230> so<00:03:18.560> many<00:03:18.709> vaccines<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.550> producing

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
kids with so many vaccines is producing

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.170 
kids with so many vaccines is producing
all<00:03:20.239> these<00:03:20.390> neurological<00:03:20.810> effects<00:03:21.440> ATD<00:03:22.370> ADHD

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
all these neurological effects ATD ADHD

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.740 
all these neurological effects ATD ADHD
autism<00:03:23.810> is<00:03:24.620> because<00:03:25.370> when<00:03:25.820> you<00:03:25.940> vaccinate<00:03:26.720> a

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
autism is because when you vaccinate a

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.770 
autism is because when you vaccinate a
kid<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:27.950> not<00:03:28.190> only<00:03:28.340> activate<00:03:29.090> his<00:03:29.420> immune

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
kid you not only activate his immune

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.509 
kid you not only activate his immune
system<00:03:29.810> where<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:30.500> vaccinate<00:03:31.130> him<00:03:31.250> but<00:03:31.400> you

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
system where you vaccinate him but you

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.520 
system where you vaccinate him but you
turn<00:03:31.760> on<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.030> brain's<00:03:32.360> immune<00:03:32.780> system<00:03:33.290> just

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
turn on the brain's immune system just

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.710 
turn on the brain's immune system just
like<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.860> food<00:03:34.040> allergy<00:03:34.370> with<00:03:35.209> one<00:03:35.450> major

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
like the food allergy with one major

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.990 
like the food allergy with one major
difference<00:03:36.110> is<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:37.070> when<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.340> inject<00:03:37.790> them

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
difference is that when you inject them

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.720 
difference is that when you inject them
with<00:03:38.030> a<00:03:38.150> vaccine<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:39.530> immune<00:03:39.890> reaction<00:03:40.489> goes

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
with a vaccine the immune reaction goes

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.470 
with a vaccine the immune reaction goes
on<00:03:40.970> for<00:03:41.239> years<00:03:41.540> non-stop<00:03:42.580> and<00:03:43.580> so<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:44.239> kid

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
on for years non-stop and so that kid

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.910 
on for years non-stop and so that kid
has<00:03:44.750> an<00:03:44.930> inflamed<00:03:45.910> brain<00:03:46.930> that<00:03:47.930> will<00:03:48.230> not<00:03:48.500> calm

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
has an inflamed brain that will not calm

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.370 
has an inflamed brain that will not calm
down<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.610> that's<00:03:49.820> what<00:03:49.970> produces<00:03:50.450> this<00:03:50.600> brain

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
down and that's what produces this brain

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.160 
down and that's what produces this brain
dysfunction<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:52.549> this<00:03:52.970> has<00:03:53.150> been<00:03:53.360> shown

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
dysfunction and this has been shown

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.440 
dysfunction and this has been shown
numerous<00:03:55.010> times<00:03:55.340> in<00:03:55.580> every<00:03:55.850> kind<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.180> study

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
numerous times in every kind of study

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.150 
numerous times in every kind of study
you<00:03:56.630> can<00:03:56.780> imagine<00:03:57.019> and<00:03:57.470> there<00:03:57.950> is<00:03:58.130> a

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
you can imagine and there is a

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.630 
you can imagine and there is a
connection<00:03:58.519> between<00:03:58.870> food<00:03:59.870> allergies<00:04:00.380> and

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
connection between food allergies and

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.160 
connection between food allergies and
hypoglycemia<00:04:01.640> a<00:04:01.820> lot<00:04:02.030> of<00:04:02.180> people<00:04:02.450> who<00:04:03.019> develop

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
hypoglycemia a lot of people who develop

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.160 
hypoglycemia a lot of people who develop
these<00:04:03.560> allergies<00:04:04.070> will<00:04:04.190> become<00:04:04.459> hypoglycemic

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
these allergies will become hypoglycemic

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.390 
these allergies will become hypoglycemic
now<00:04:06.170> what<00:04:06.320> are<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.500> leading<00:04:06.709> foods<00:04:07.160> that

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
now what are the leading foods that

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.449 
now what are the leading foods that
cause<00:04:07.610> food<00:04:08.090> allergies<00:04:08.500> milk<00:04:09.500> is<00:04:09.769> a<00:04:09.799> major

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
cause food allergies milk is a major
