00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:08.099
 in general, the exposure time is over 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.730
 so all I think is enough to be lit 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.330
 five minutes have passed at the moment 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:19.050
 so now we have to do now 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:23.250
 we need this drawing which 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.710
 lit up to show we will be in 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.289
 solution 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.099
 soda ash in general solution 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.489
 such on 1 liter 2 tablespoons 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.180
 soda ash 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.090
 we breed and then we take manifest before 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.020
 What should be removed from the photoresist 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:49.020
 protective film remove ordinary 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:54.989
 you see, you take off the scotch tape 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.180
 film and after that we omit this one 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.399
 billet or knife blades in solution 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.460
 soda ash and wait for him 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.350
 manifest along the way we will 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:11.760
 use a little bit to 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:14.060
 help the drawing to appear faster 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.060
 knives 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.600
 let's see what he see here already 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:33.240
 development begins 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:43.950
 so let's help a little bit so you see already 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:46.380
 this main patience manifests itself even I 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.510
 I forgot to tell you that this one 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.300
 photoresist is negative 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:58.979
 this suggests that it will light the 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.009
 and will remain here as you see in our 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:06.080
 I slide around lit shark left 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.080
 and that is not lit this will wash off 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.990
 to help brush a little bit 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.170
 so a little bit left 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.170
 In general, the picture as I see us is ours 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.890
 this picture has now appeared 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:10.610
 need to rinse with plain water and 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.610
 pickle with acid so now I will wash
