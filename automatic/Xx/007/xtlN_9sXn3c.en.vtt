okay the next setup after having the can
crusher<00:01:34.500> completed<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.159> thought<00:01:35.369> well<00:01:35.610> what

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
crusher completed I thought well what

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.940 
crusher completed I thought well what
would<00:01:36.000> make<00:01:36.149> it<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.390> lot<00:01:36.509> easier<00:01:36.899> to<00:01:37.049> use<00:01:37.079> you've

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
would make it a lot easier to use you've

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.429 
would make it a lot easier to use you've
seen<00:01:38.219> the<00:01:38.430> vacuum<00:01:39.180> tubes<00:01:39.420> systems<00:01:40.079> they<00:01:40.229> have

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
seen the vacuum tubes systems they have

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.380 
seen the vacuum tubes systems they have
in<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.770> big<00:01:41.009> stores<00:01:41.369> where<00:01:41.670> they<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
in like big stores where they have a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.539 
in like big stores where they have a
container<00:01:43.110> they<00:01:43.350> send<00:01:43.619> paperwork<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
container they send paperwork to the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.669 
container they send paperwork to the

you follow the path along here this is

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.569 
you follow the path along here this is
the<00:02:42.090> one<00:02:42.269> tube<00:02:42.510> inside<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.200> garage<00:02:43.350> as<00:02:43.890> it

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
the one tube inside the garage as it

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.610 
the one tube inside the garage as it
goes<00:02:44.730> around<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.690> goes<00:02:45.840> around<00:02:46.170> three<00:02:46.380> walls

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
goes around it goes around three walls

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.830 
goes around it goes around three walls
and<00:02:47.010> for<00:02:47.250> for<00:02:47.639> effect<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.150> put<00:02:48.359> real<00:02:48.540> sharp

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
and for for effect I put real sharp

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.479 
and for for effect I put real sharp
corners<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.500> cans<00:02:49.739> make<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> lot<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.310> noise

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
corners so the cans make a lot of noise

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.670 
corners so the cans make a lot of noise
when<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.819> bangs<00:02:51.030> around<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.380> actual

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
when it bangs around and the actual

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.120 
when it bangs around and the actual
starting<00:02:53.280> point<00:02:53.519> is<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:54.510> remote<00:02:55.500> station<00:02:56.010> we
