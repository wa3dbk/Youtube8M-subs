00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
extra thing about the characters that

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.670 
extra thing about the characters that
under<00:04:19.510> underwater<00:04:20.080> they<00:04:20.290> have<00:04:20.410> different

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
under underwater they have different

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.040 
under underwater they have different
abilities<00:04:20.799> too<00:04:21.099> this<00:04:21.400> time<00:04:21.580> around<00:04:21.870> there<00:04:22.870> is

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
abilities too this time around there is

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.690 
abilities too this time around there is
underwater<00:04:23.650> sections<00:04:24.190> they<00:04:24.340> were<00:04:24.400> really

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
underwater sections they were really

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.870 
underwater sections they were really
well<00:04:25.060> done<00:04:25.090> I<00:04:25.300> thought<00:04:25.510> they<00:04:25.630> could

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
well done I thought they could

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.510 
well done I thought they could
are<00:04:26.120> pretty<00:04:26.270> good<00:04:26.450> and<00:04:27.410> like<00:04:27.680> Diddy<00:04:28.010> Kong<00:04:28.310> gets

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
are pretty good and like Diddy Kong gets

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.580 
are pretty good and like Diddy Kong gets
a<00:04:28.610> short<00:04:29.090> boost<00:04:29.360> in<00:04:29.540> the<00:04:29.630> water<00:04:29.810> Dixie<00:04:30.260> Kong<00:04:30.440> is

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
a short boost in the water Dixie Kong is

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.960 
a short boost in the water Dixie Kong is
the<00:04:30.620> most<00:04:30.830> useful<00:04:31.040> underwater<00:04:31.460> because<00:04:31.790> she

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
the most useful underwater because she

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.450 
the most useful underwater because she
can<00:04:32.150> actually<00:04:32.510> swim<00:04:32.810> really<00:04:33.050> fast<00:04:33.170> and<00:04:33.770> cranky

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
can actually swim really fast and cranky

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.710 
can actually swim really fast and cranky
Kong<00:04:34.610> is<00:04:34.760> kind<00:04:34.940> of<00:04:35.000> useless<00:04:35.150> underwater

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
Kong is kind of useless underwater

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.870 
Kong is kind of useless underwater
because<00:04:35.990> Ellie<00:04:36.200> does<00:04:36.350> his<00:04:36.470> whack<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.650> stick<00:04:36.980> um

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.300 
of difficulty is perfect
it<00:05:28.880> starts<00:05:29.570> off<00:05:29.690> nice<00:05:29.990> and<00:05:30.020> easy<00:05:30.410> it<00:05:30.740> wheels

have<00:05:40.040> with<00:05:40.250> the<00:05:40.370> game<00:05:40.550> personally<00:05:40.820> is<00:05:41.330> that

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
have with the game personally is that

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.470 
have with the game personally is that
the<00:05:41.930> loading<00:05:42.200> times<00:05:42.590> are<00:05:42.860> really<00:05:43.220> long

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
the loading times are really long

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.030 
the loading times are really long
considering<00:05:44.480> the<00:05:44.600> fact<00:05:44.840> that<00:05:44.960> you<00:05:45.740> know<00:05:45.830> we

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
considering the fact that you know we

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.700 
considering the fact that you know we
are<00:05:46.190> in<00:05:46.220> an<00:05:46.520> age<00:05:46.640> of<00:05:47.030> a<00:05:47.630> lot<00:05:47.990> of<00:05:48.140> you<00:05:48.440> know<00:05:48.470> like

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
are in an age of a lot of you know like

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.320 
are in an age of a lot of you know like
like<00:05:48.890> processing<00:05:49.700> shouldn't<00:05:49.940> be<00:05:50.000> that<00:05:50.150> hard

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
like processing shouldn't be that hard

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.210 
like processing shouldn't be that hard
you<00:05:50.510> know<00:05:50.660> we<00:05:50.840> know<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.500> hardware<00:05:51.770> but<00:05:52.010> it

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
you know we know the the hardware but it

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.040 
you know we know the the hardware but it
was<00:05:52.730> really<00:05:52.970> long<00:05:53.240> some<00:05:53.630> of<00:05:53.720> the<00:05:53.780> loading

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
was really long some of the loading

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.480 
was really long some of the loading
times<00:05:54.260> like<00:05:54.530> when<00:05:54.800> you<00:05:54.890> boot<00:05:55.100> up<00:05:55.190> the<00:05:55.250> game

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
times like when you boot up the game

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.070 
times like when you boot up the game
it's<00:05:55.700> about<00:05:55.820> a<00:05:55.940> two<00:05:56.210> minute<00:05:56.240> wait<00:05:56.720> you<00:05:56.990> know

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
it's about a two minute wait you know

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.140 
it's about a two minute wait you know
they<00:05:57.200> even<00:05:57.320> get<00:05:57.560> to<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.920> map<00:05:58.100> screen<00:05:58.370> and<00:05:58.670> then

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
they even get to the map screen and then

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.000 
they even get to the map screen and then
each<00:05:59.330> level<00:05:59.600> takes<00:05:59.900> about<00:06:00.020> you<00:06:00.290> know<00:06:00.410> 40

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
each level takes about you know 40

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.180 
each level takes about you know 40
seconds<00:06:01.490> to<00:06:01.610> load<00:06:01.790> so<00:06:02.060> that's<00:06:02.660> kind<00:06:02.930> of

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
seconds to load so that's kind of

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.400 
seconds to load so that's kind of
excusable<00:06:04.190> because<00:06:04.510> overall<00:06:05.510> you're<00:06:05.900> just<00:06:06.110> so

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
excusable because overall you're just so

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.050 
excusable because overall you're just so
having<00:06:07.040> so<00:06:07.250> much<00:06:07.340> fun<00:06:07.550> that<00:06:07.610> you<00:06:07.790> don't<00:06:07.940> really

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.300 
having so much fun that you don't really
notice<00:06:08.240> it<00:06:08.510> so<00:06:09.050> it<00:06:09.560> gets<00:06:09.770> my<00:06:09.890> personal

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310
