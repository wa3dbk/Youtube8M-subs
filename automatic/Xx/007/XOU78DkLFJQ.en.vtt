its<00:01:53.520> configuring<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:56.810> now<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.079> we're

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
its configuring and now that we're

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
into in spectator game so right there

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.130 
into in spectator game so right there
was<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.819> game<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.510> was<00:02:18.569> being<00:02:18.810> feature

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
was a game that was being feature

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.780 
was a game that was being feature
currently<00:02:20.069> as<00:02:20.300> either<00:02:21.300> higher<00:02:21.780> players<00:02:22.170> or

currently as either higher players or

currently as either higher players or
just<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.910> game<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.300> they<00:02:24.420> had<00:02:24.540> selected<00:02:25.019> to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
just a game that they had selected to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.490 
just a game that they had selected to
show<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.340> public<00:02:26.780> now<00:02:27.780> as<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.290> game

show to the public now as this game

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.670 
show to the public now as this game
loads<00:02:28.800> up<00:02:29.480> it's<00:02:30.480> still<00:02:30.720> getting<00:02:30.959> different

interesting<00:02:41.670> things<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:42.000> note<00:02:42.620> we<00:02:43.620> can<00:02:43.650> sort

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
interesting things to note we can sort

how<00:02:44.760> we're<00:02:45.030> looking<00:02:45.420> at<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.660> files<00:02:46.370> now

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
how we're looking at the files now

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.000 
how we're looking at the files now
let's<00:02:48.510> say<00:02:48.630> we<00:02:48.750> want<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:48.989> look<00:02:49.049> at<00:02:49.230> what<00:02:49.440> UDP

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
let's say we want to look at what UDP

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.640 
let's say we want to look at what UDP
protocols<00:02:50.610> we<00:02:51.090> have<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.510> filter<00:02:51.870> up<00:02:52.170> here<00:02:52.440> and

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
protocols we have a filter up here and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.720 
protocols we have a filter up here and
if<00:02:53.190> we<00:02:53.280> type<00:02:53.459> UDP<00:02:54.299> into<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.959> filter<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:56.040> shows

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
if we type UDP into the filter it shows

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.080 
if we type UDP into the filter it shows
only<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.060> UDP<00:02:57.540> protocols<00:02:59.000> and<00:03:00.799> some<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:01.920> these

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
only the UDP protocols and some of these

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.660 
only the UDP protocols and some of these
are<00:03:03.090> just<00:03:04.250> notifications<00:03:05.250> queries<00:03:06.319> just

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
are just notifications queries just

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.400 
are just notifications queries just
basic<00:03:08.670> things<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.540> go<00:03:09.630> across<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.110> network

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
basic things that go across the network

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.800 
basic things that go across the network
anytime<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.069> access<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.860> then<00:03:14.660> we<00:03:15.660> have

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
anytime you access it and then we have

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.250 
anytime you access it and then we have
some<00:03:16.019> responses<00:03:16.970> but<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.750> important<00:03:19.230> thing

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
some responses but the important thing

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.229 
some responses but the important thing
actually<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:20.250> we're<00:03:20.579> looking<00:03:20.670> for<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> specific

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
actually is we're looking for a specific

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.050 
actually is we're looking for a specific
port<00:03:22.069> associated<00:03:23.069> with<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.340> game<00:03:23.519> that's<00:03:23.880> now

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
port associated with the game that's now

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.509 
port associated with the game that's now
running<00:03:24.389> in<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.600> background<00:03:25.310> since<00:03:26.310> we've

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
running in the background since we've

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.009 
running in the background since we've
loaded<00:03:26.910> into<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.269> game<00:03:27.450> I'm<00:03:27.690> going<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.900> go

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
loaded into the game I'm going to go

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.870 
loaded into the game I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:28.380> stop<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.799> capture<00:03:29.220> we<00:03:29.579> have<00:03:29.730> all

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
ahead and stop the capture we have all

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.150 
ahead and stop the capture we have all
the<00:03:30.030> information<00:03:30.239> we<00:03:30.540> need<00:03:30.780> at<00:03:30.930> this<00:03:31.049> point<00:03:31.160> so

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
the information we need at this point so

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.110 
the information we need at this point so
we<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.090> go<00:03:33.389> over<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.850> expressions<00:03:35.850> bar

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
we can go over to the expressions bar

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.449 
we can go over to the expressions bar
here<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:38.269> looking<00:03:39.269> at<00:03:39.389> our<00:03:39.569> chart<00:03:40.109> here

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
here and looking at our chart here

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.059 
here and looking at our chart here
spectator<00:03:41.459> mode<00:03:41.549> is<00:03:41.970> port<00:03:42.389> 8088<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:43.739> doesn't

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
spectator mode is port 8088 it doesn't

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.509 
spectator mode is port 8088 it doesn't
tell<00:03:44.190> us<00:03:44.280> whether<00:03:44.459> that's<00:03:44.760> TCP<00:03:45.329> or<00:03:45.660> UDP<00:03:46.069> so<00:03:47.069> the

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
tell us whether that's TCP or UDP so the

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.340 
tell us whether that's TCP or UDP so the
easiest<00:03:47.850> thing<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.120> do<00:03:48.299> is<00:03:48.630> just<00:03:49.109> to<00:03:49.230> go

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
easiest thing to do is just to go

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.440 
easiest thing to do is just to go
through<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.709> look<00:03:49.769> at<00:03:49.950> each<00:03:50.180> we'll<00:03:51.180> start

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
through and look at each we'll start

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.420 
through and look at each we'll start
with<00:03:51.720> UDP<00:03:52.549> the<00:03:53.549> user<00:03:54.299> Datagram<00:03:54.959> protocol<00:03:55.530> now

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
with UDP the user Datagram protocol now

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.550 
with UDP the user Datagram protocol now
under<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:57.389> there<00:03:57.870> are<00:03:57.959> several<00:03:58.109> different

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
under this there are several different

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.520 
under this there are several different
options<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:59.540> the<00:04:00.540> destination<00:04:01.019> port<00:04:01.349> is

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
options and the destination port is

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.750 
options and the destination port is
actually<00:04:01.859> the<00:04:01.980> one<00:04:02.099> we're<00:04:02.250> interested<00:04:02.340> in

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
actually the one we're interested in

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.729 
actually the one we're interested in
because<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.480> destination<00:04:03.660> port<00:04:04.109> is<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.590> one

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
because the destination port is the one

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.229 
because the destination port is the one
that<00:04:04.920> has<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.880> 8088<00:04:06.420> on<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.769> we<00:04:08.609> have<00:04:08.819> it

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
that has the 8088 on it so we have it

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.990 
that has the 8088 on it so we have it
marked<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:10.290> that<00:04:10.410> when<00:04:10.590> we<00:04:10.680> hit<00:04:10.799> OK<00:04:11.130> here<00:04:11.370> it

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
marked so that when we hit OK here it

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.030 
marked so that when we hit OK here it
will<00:04:12.120> actually<00:04:12.269> try<00:04:12.569> to<00:04:12.630> find<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.079> and<00:04:13.260> in<00:04:13.889> this

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
will actually try to find it and in this

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.370 
will actually try to find it and in this
case<00:04:14.310> this<00:04:14.910> script<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:15.450> not<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.690> valid<00:04:15.930> filter

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
case this script is not a valid filter

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.420 
case this script is not a valid filter
it<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:16.859> didn't<00:04:17.160> find<00:04:17.340> if<00:04:17.489> this<00:04:17.639> isn't<00:04:17.820> here<00:04:18.229> so

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
it it didn't find if this isn't here so

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.520 
it it didn't find if this isn't here so
the<00:04:20.430> other<00:04:20.549> thing<00:04:20.789> we<00:04:21.209> can<00:04:21.359> do<00:04:21.510> then<00:04:21.959> since<00:04:22.440> we

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
the other thing we can do then since we

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.980 
the other thing we can do then since we
know<00:04:22.650> it's<00:04:22.800> not<00:04:22.890> UDP<00:04:23.400> we<00:04:23.789> can<00:04:23.940> go<00:04:24.060> over<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.330> TCP

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
know it's not UDP we can go over to TCP

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.170 
know it's not UDP we can go over to TCP
