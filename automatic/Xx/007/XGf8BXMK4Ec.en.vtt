00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.940
 for the medical community the tissue that surrounds the cells did not have any 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.199
 importance for many years 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.620
 so it's really a filler material you may not have any 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:16.679
 function 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.309
 let's see what can be found if we approach with the microscope 

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:22.519
 electronic 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.489
 At first sight the external structure resembles a matrix in 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.929
 actually we observe a network of sugar biopolymers I think that since 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.380
 had a three-dimensional space 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.760
 very prominent mind appears interlacing a repeated patriada 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.780
 structural elements such as collagen and elastin 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.090
 we continue a bit in these two structures 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.680
 the collagen 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.400
 It is observed in the form of thicker fibers 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.110
 fibrillar constitution and will last without free ends of donations 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.489
 while elastin 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.370
 presents figures of boxes 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.700
 rectilinear 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.940
 everything what it means in Chiapas as it knows 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.440
 We also found a rich circulatory counterpart charged with exchange of 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.210
 nutrients 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510
 the transport of biomarkers 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.190
 is the path of arrival of structural immunological components 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.410
 near the blood vessels by matches by the matrix is ​​in 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.740
 the ETA cells 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.450
 we went through ana martínez 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300
 fibroblasts appear 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.440
 with a large core composed of 21 years 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.010
 Fixed key macrophages for local defense processes 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.350
 irregularly 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.780
 with numerous prolongation and five hours 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.780
 we come across the conglomerates of fat cells 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.360
 find out spicy scenes of variable sizes 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.660
 we also observe 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.660
 an intricate network of terminal nerve estates that initiate a computer and the 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.540
 matrix 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.470
 these structural parts 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.800
 so contact with the cell membrane 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.270
 that interconnection of the matrix is ​​evident this week 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.740
 as the intracellular matrix of the cytoskeleton 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.830
 that reaching the nucleus of the cell 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.890
 allows you to give it information 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.909
 that contact with the nuclear tape matrix 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.519
 and impact on the has
