00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.370
 Chrome was not very creative 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.960
 that is, if you know the lawyer 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.490

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.680
 that the author hired to give life to 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.789
 these characters ie you can 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.809

 similar things that he prayed supper 2 the steaks 106 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.660
 due to the chrome delay 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.000
 among them we can mention the pity crates 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.760

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.850
 come on 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.369
 but the saga of asgard and pineapple is fillet and 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.780
 that same one of the sagas more time of 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.500

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.500
 let's go to the next 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.070
 3 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.979
 to write errors 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.110
 it may seem silly but the first 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.000
 Next day hair blog full of 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.270
 but it was not for the studio that in the 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.100
 era era boca magicar is who this tv 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.600
 remembered very well but in the 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.280
 because the series imported from the 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.890
 spain who had already done a dubbing 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:44.119
 at least if you want to see 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:49.009
 some decisive in the inscription link 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:54.380
 has a video of da uefa that he shows 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.820
 many typing errors and type is one 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.600
 thing you do not believe in things 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.539
 type the south with the dubbing 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.509
 there were no waves with the dubbing of the south 15 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:10.100
 of the biologist's neighborhood is the new god of death 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.750
 that the capricorn change there and several 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.540
 things that will give a little sophie 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.120
 monk the subject 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.070
 4 official continuation in 2006 apple 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.530
 chromium resolves to remain full 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.570
 Then the next manga stir into account 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.920
 two parallel stories to Aunt War 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.200
 contradicts the continuation of the classic 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.000
 but these two stories end up 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.700
 interconnecting I do not talk much to 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.600
 reply but with flowers 76 is worth a lot 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.209
 worth reading 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:40.700
 let's stop five and last thing to five 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.640
 it's actually a very strange thing 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.579
 that I heard recently in 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.480
 beginning of creation of the chrome apple manga 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.880
 wanted an andromeda showroom 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.780
 it would be the phoenix of that would be the 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.400
 Following 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.610
 as a matter of fact 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.560
 and would be from andromeda and south of phoenix 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.750
 but both and to maintain the same 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.959
 personality but does not give much to 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.209
 imagine how this would stay in some 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.079
 NACA on the Internet for 10 teams are 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.769
 seeing now 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.390
 but imagine itu phoenix sound and the drug 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.890
 debut 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.840
 So that's what she expects things I 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.060
 like if you liked shares 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.640
 video click did not like that will help 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.920
 too much channel disclosure is clean 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.870
 name since it's a new channel and I think 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.690
 what will they like if you are 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.090
 otakus they were too so this is it 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.440
