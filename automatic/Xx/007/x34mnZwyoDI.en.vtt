your<00:00:43.949> chroma<00:00:44.339> key<00:00:44.609> evenly<00:00:45.449> is<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:46.589> choice<00:00:47.249> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
your chroma key evenly is a choice of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.879 
your chroma key evenly is a choice of
lights<00:00:47.839> there<00:00:48.839> are<00:00:49.019> a<00:00:49.079> lot<00:00:49.229> of<00:00:49.260> light<00:00:49.499> kits<00:00:49.769> out

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:49.889 
lights there are a lot of light kits out

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:51.590 
lights there are a lot of light kits out
there<00:00:50.129> they're<00:00:50.280> very<00:00:50.460> expensive<00:00:50.729> and<00:00:51.269> then

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
there they're very expensive and then

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.590 
there they're very expensive and then
there<00:00:52.019> are<00:00:52.370> reasonably<00:00:53.370> priced<00:00:53.699> lights<00:00:54.030> like

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
there are reasonably priced lights like

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.750 
there are reasonably priced lights like
for<00:00:54.780> instance<00:00:54.809> these<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.589> work<00:00:55.769> lights<00:00:56.129> there

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
for instance these are work lights there

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.919 
for instance these are work lights there
are<00:00:56.909> 500<00:00:57.569> watts<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:58.109> each<00:00:58.350> light<00:00:59.159> they're

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
are 500 watts for each light they're

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.419 
are 500 watts for each light they're
blinding<00:01:00.929> me<00:01:01.079> right<00:01:01.319> now<00:01:01.499> really<00:01:02.249> are

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
blinding me right now really are

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.100 
blinding me right now really are
actually<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.729> came<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.389> what<00:01:03.510> I'm<00:01:03.600> doing<00:01:03.809> I

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
actually I came and see what I'm doing I

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.740 
actually I came and see what I'm doing I
hardly<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.549> they<00:01:05.700> give<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.940> nice<00:01:06.150> even<00:01:06.450> light

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
hardly but they give a nice even light

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.819 
hardly but they give a nice even light
and<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.680> thing<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.100> relatively<00:01:08.670> cheap<00:01:09.829> $49

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
and the thing is a relatively cheap $49

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.709 
and the thing is a relatively cheap $49
50<00:01:11.219> to<00:01:11.340> our<00:01:11.460> lights<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.000> they're<00:01:12.479> great

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
50 to our lights and they're great

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:15.139 
50 to our lights and they're great
they're<00:01:12.930> work<00:01:13.409> excellent<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.610> never<00:01:14.909> had

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
they're work excellent I have never had

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.060 
they're work excellent I have never had
any<00:01:15.299> problems<00:01:15.689> with<00:01:15.750> them<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.170> actually<00:01:16.649> liked

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
any problems with them I actually liked

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.359 
any problems with them I actually liked
these<00:01:17.430> better<00:01:17.490> than<00:01:18.210> my<00:01:18.390> light<00:01:18.719> kit<00:01:19.159> but<00:01:20.159> what

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
these better than my light kit but what

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.029 
these better than my light kit but what
you<00:01:20.399> do<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.180> put<00:01:21.479> these<00:01:21.899> lights<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.740> this

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
you do is you put these lights like this

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:29.510 
you do is you put these lights like this
one<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:24.079> angle<00:01:26.509> adjacent<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.710> chroma

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
one at a angle adjacent to the chroma

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.399 
one at a angle adjacent to the chroma
key<00:01:29.759> you'll<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.719> same<00:01:30.750> thing<00:01:31.170> over<00:01:31.289> here

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
key you'll do the same thing over here

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.120 
key you'll do the same thing over here
on<00:01:31.649> this<00:01:31.829> side<00:01:33.619> up

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
on this side up

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.700 
on this side up
them<00:01:37.130> at<00:01:37.250> an<00:01:37.370> angle<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.850> make<00:01:38.120> sure<00:01:38.510> that<00:01:39.380> your

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.610 
chroma key screen is evenly lift now
that<00:01:43.430> we've<00:01:43.580> got<00:01:43.820> our<00:01:43.850> chroma<00:01:44.510> key<00:01:44.780> evenly<00:01:45.380> lit
