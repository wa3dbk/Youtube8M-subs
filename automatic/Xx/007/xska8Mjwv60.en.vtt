industry is about 2.2 billion dollars
but<00:00:46.770> most<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.610> them<00:00:47.789> are<00:00:48.120> way<00:00:48.600> too<00:00:48.860> complicated

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
but most of them are way too complicated

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.010

for the average consumer and this year
at<00:00:52.079> CES<00:00:52.260> they're<00:00:52.649> trying<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.039> change<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.550> and

at CES they're trying to change that and
bring<00:00:53.820> them<00:00:54.120> more<00:00:54.270> into<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.899> lower<00:00:55.230> price<00:00:55.500> range

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
bring them more into a lower price range

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.729 
bring them more into a lower price range
and<00:00:56.070> easier<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> use<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.109> by<00:00:58.289> 3d

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and easier to use so this is by 3d

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.580 
and easier to use so this is by 3d

parent<00:02:38.100> company<00:02:38.580> was<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> 2d<00:02:39.720> printer<00:02:40.110> so

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
parent company was a 2d printer so

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.770 
parent company was a 2d printer so
they're<00:02:40.680> able<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.950> make<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.370> guy<00:02:41.550> for<00:02:41.820> $4.99

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
they're able to make this guy for $4.99

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.850 
they're able to make this guy for $4.99
yeah<00:02:43.590> 499<00:02:44.459> bucks<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:44.850> super<00:02:45.180> cheap<00:02:45.420> but<00:02:45.860> it's

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
yeah 499 bucks it's super cheap but it's

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.400 
yeah 499 bucks it's super cheap but it's
made<00:02:47.190> by<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> 2d<00:02:47.790> printer<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.450> now<00:02:48.630> makes<00:02:48.870> 3d

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
made by a 2d printer that now makes 3d

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.930 
made by a 2d printer that now makes 3d
printers<00:02:49.770> they<00:02:49.920> just<00:02:50.070> added<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.400> extra<00:02:50.459> D

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
printers they just added that extra D

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.360 
printers they just added that extra D
and<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.720> has<00:02:51.840> proprietary<00:02:52.170> print<00:02:52.890> cartridges

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
and it has proprietary print cartridges

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.460 
and it has proprietary print cartridges
so<00:02:53.970> that's<00:02:54.120> pretty<00:02:54.300> much<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.480> for<00:02:54.780> 3d<00:02:55.140> printing

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
so that's pretty much it for 3d printing

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.770 
so that's pretty much it for 3d printing
