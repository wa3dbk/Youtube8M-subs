well as be is at the there's actually a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.960 
well as be is at the there's actually a
lot<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.890> people<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.340> go<00:01:53.579> at<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
lot of people that like to go at the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.300 
lot of people that like to go at the
previous<00:01:54.450> sniper<00:01:54.990> spot<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.860> keep<00:01:56.040> an<00:01:56.189> eye<00:01:56.280> out

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
previous sniper spot so keep an eye out

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.639 
previous sniper spot so keep an eye out
for<00:01:56.490> there<00:01:56.820> as<00:01:57.030> well<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:58.049> opening<00:01:58.409> there

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
for there as well as the opening there

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.010 
for there as well as the opening there
which<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.880> pretty<00:02:00.119> easy<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.420> kill<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.810> if

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
which it's pretty easy to kill you if

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.060 
which it's pretty easy to kill you if
you're<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.320> here<00:02:01.350> because<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.920> don't<00:02:02.040> have

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
you're up here because you don't have

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.520 
you're up here because you don't have
much<00:02:02.280> cover<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:03.659> careful<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:04.170> people<00:02:04.439> on

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
much cover and be careful for people on

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.569 
much cover and be careful for people on
top<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.829> lighthouse<00:02:05.040> because<00:02:05.399> obviously

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
top of the lighthouse because obviously

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.429 
top of the lighthouse because obviously
they<00:02:05.939> can<00:02:06.090> see<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.360> relatively<00:02:06.869> well<00:02:07.200> and

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
they can see you relatively well and

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.499 
they can see you relatively well and
just<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.190> careful<00:02:08.700> when<00:02:08.940> you're<00:02:09.060> going<00:02:09.330> around

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
just be careful when you're going around

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.210 
just be careful when you're going around
like<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:09.989> isn't<00:02:10.170> really<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.619> best<00:02:10.830> spot<00:02:11.190> to

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
like this isn't really the best spot to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.010 
like this isn't really the best spot to
go<00:02:11.489> to

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
go to

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.930 
go to
and<00:02:12.140> when<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.100> go<00:02:13.280> out<00:02:13.460> you<00:02:13.490> don't<00:02:13.790> really

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
and when you go out you don't really

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.160 
and when you go out you don't really
have<00:02:14.120> much<00:02:14.330> cover<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.900> have<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.080> be

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
have much cover so you have to be

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.080 
have much cover so you have to be
careful<00:02:15.350> for<00:02:15.680> those<00:02:15.920> who<00:02:16.220> do<00:02:16.490> have<00:02:16.730> cover

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
careful for those who do have cover

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.640 
careful for those who do have cover
because<00:02:17.630> they<00:02:17.870> have<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.050> higher<00:02:18.260> chance<00:02:18.290> of

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
because they have a higher chance of

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.070 
because they have a higher chance of
killing<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.040> now<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.700> third<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.420> sniper<00:02:20.720> spot

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
killing you now the third a sniper spot

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.710 
killing you now the third a sniper spot
this<00:02:21.350> is<00:02:21.470> not<00:02:21.650> really<00:02:21.860> good<00:02:22.250> for<00:02:22.450> domination<00:02:23.450> I

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
this is not really good for domination I

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.230 
this is not really good for domination I
feel<00:02:23.930> but<00:02:24.230> if<00:02:24.470> you're<00:02:24.620> playing<00:02:24.770> TDM<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.520> noticed

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
feel but if you're playing TDM I noticed

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.150 
feel but if you're playing TDM I noticed
some<00:02:26.450> people<00:02:26.870> like<00:02:27.020> to<00:02:27.050> use<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.500> spot<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:27.980> I

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
some people like to use this spot and I

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.640 
some people like to use this spot and I
try<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.490> out<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.880> does<00:02:29.120> work<00:02:29.390> out<00:02:29.690> if<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.470> know

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
try it out it does work out if you know

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.070 
try it out it does work out if you know
how<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.860> work<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.490> really<00:02:31.760> well<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:32.900> it

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
how to work it really well and so it

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.900 
how to work it really well and so it
does<00:02:33.230> work<00:02:33.260> out<00:02:33.530> just<00:02:33.710> don't<00:02:33.950> go<00:02:34.160> completely

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
does work out just don't go completely

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.050 
does work out just don't go completely
you<00:02:35.330> know<00:02:35.360> don't<00:02:35.750> hug<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.740> front<00:02:37.370> wall<00:02:37.790> or

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
you know don't hug the front wall or

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.220 
you know don't hug the front wall or
whatever<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.420> want<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.570> call<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:38.810> because<00:02:39.110> the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
whatever you want to call it because the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.870 
whatever you want to call it because the
bars<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.620> metal<00:02:39.830> bars<00:02:40.040> they<00:02:40.280> will<00:02:40.430> block<00:02:40.670> your

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
bars the metal bars they will block your

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.910 
bars the metal bars they will block your
view<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.810> move<00:02:42.140> back<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.380> little<00:02:42.500> bit<00:02:42.800> you

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
view so you move back a little bit you

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.290 
view so you move back a little bit you
can<00:02:43.010> actually<00:02:43.160> check<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.670> first<00:02:43.940> night<00:02:44.180> in

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
can actually check the first night in

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.090 
can actually check the first night in
spot<00:02:44.600> from<00:02:44.750> over<00:02:44.990> here<00:02:45.020> so<00:02:45.710> it's<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:45.950> pretty

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
spot from over here so it's a pretty

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.500 
spot from over here so it's a pretty
