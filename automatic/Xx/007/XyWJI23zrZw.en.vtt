00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 fight in korea because it's very long 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.970
 fought on humanitarian she was one of 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.099
 the longest 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.740
 this is not the most and what was the longest 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.259
 tube around in fact we are now 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.750
 have seen a man who was going to him 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.660
 tomorrow of course you can not go to the movies 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.880
 watch alte tv i guess 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.160
 what are his questions about rushed 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.890
 the rest let him on this rating 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.199
 look at this narrow element but wo n't let it go 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.539
 for the cattle will not work but my face is everything 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.940
 so I think it's just him 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.040
 karate kid once such glycine and row 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.579
 Sobolev for a long time did not see this 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.860
 just ugly and how people behaved 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.670
 because you can't throw glasses and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.770
 hockey bottles or coach 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.030
 or watering is still just I think 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.620
 what is it on conscience now everything is completely 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.480
 positions which here should be neither 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.380
 he has one third but I think 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.110
 that this is not their responsibility 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.330
 they have no responsibility full yes and I 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.260
 I think that this is not what the framework does not go on 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.990
 about everything 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.600
 guys play and can get hurt 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.280
 as well as the coach I also like after 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.510
 field 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.510
 guys who did not play did not rush 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.620
 bottles and spat on it just no longer 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.150
 I think that the boorish side if 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.750
 talk on the game wot what happened 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.030
 teams 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.220
 there in this segment when four steps 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.080
 missed think what you saw perfectly 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.540
 like what was on the ice 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:41.240
 what happened deletion which is not 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.229
 should we have not forgotten to retire 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.229
 the rest are already deleting which were 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.820
 perfectly visible 1000 watts namely 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.150
 breaking the rules is true 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.890
 minority up conspiracies on course 12 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.570
 minutes got here we think it 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.570
 It was all but removal is not necessary 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.180
 season will surely punish you for quests 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.490
 well first of all no one 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.950
 said nothing about being saved for that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.830
 for that let's take 10 minutes i think it is 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.920
 not serious either 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.230
 fry he please everyone why if u 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.420
 the person does not understand English not 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.360
 just asking why because he 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.460
 need a responsible such using and 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.490
 Tatar and Che there are ways at least 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.870
 there is and I think a lot of things 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.900
 strumming and now of course not everyone 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.960
 it turns out but the process is underway 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.380
 work so that the season is no longer there and 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:38.980
 moment of sulfur concentrate on what 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.980
 it is very beautiful thank you thanks
