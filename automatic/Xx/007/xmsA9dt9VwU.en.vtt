going to put the work just the slide
there<00:00:14.000> these<00:00:15.000> losses<00:00:15.330> haven't<00:00:15.750> been<00:00:15.840> floated

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 
there these losses haven't been floated

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:25.370 
there these losses haven't been floated
for<00:00:16.380> a<00:00:16.439> long<00:00:16.619> time<00:00:20.720> so

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
I'm just going to set it up here so that

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.730 
I'm just going to set it up here so that
I<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.540> do<00:00:27.810> one<00:00:28.020> at<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.230> time<00:00:29.300> all<00:00:30.300> right<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.810> I'm

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
I can do one at a time all right so I'm

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.140 
I can do one at a time all right so I'm
just<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.099> control<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.610> space<00:00:32.880> here

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
just going to control this space here

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.900 
just going to control this space here
I'm<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.540> ask<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.140> boss<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.440> go<00:00:34.560> forward

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.930 

and<00:00:38.910> I'm<00:00:39.150> going<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.390> go<00:00:40.020> around<00:00:40.550> just<00:00:41.550> walking

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
and I'm going to go around just walking

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.490 
and I'm going to go around just walking
now<00:00:44.940> having<00:00:45.239> done<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:46.220> normally<00:00:48.260> I'll<00:00:49.260> just

now having done that normally I'll just
throw<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.070> there<00:00:50.510> over<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> back<00:00:51.780> I'll

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
throw this on there over the back I'll

throw this on there over the back I'll
show<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.010> what<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.250> do<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.520> rope<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
show you what we do with the rope and

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:06.360 
show you what we do with the rope and
myth<00:00:53.970> now<00:00:54.120> ask<00:00:54.330> the<00:00:54.480> other<00:00:54.600> horse<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.930> go<00:00:55.050> up

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.950 

now<00:01:07.370> for<00:01:07.790> some<00:01:08.000> people<00:01:08.030> they'll<00:01:08.480> say<00:01:08.510> what's

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
now for some people they'll say what's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.930 
now for some people they'll say what's
the<00:01:09.080> big<00:01:09.260> deal<00:01:09.440> about<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:09.770> every<00:01:10.490> horse<00:01:10.700> does

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
the big deal about that every horse does

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.910 
the big deal about that every horse does
well<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.510> reality<00:01:11.750> is<00:01:12.020> no<00:01:12.230> every<00:01:12.740> horse

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
well the reality is no every horse

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.360 
well the reality is no every horse
doesn't<00:01:13.340> do<00:01:13.460> that<00:01:13.900> and<00:01:14.900> that<00:01:15.170> especially<00:01:15.950> we

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
doesn't do that and that especially we

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.010 
doesn't do that and that especially we
get<00:01:16.550> asked<00:01:16.730> to<00:01:16.910> come<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.120> help<00:01:17.420> people<00:01:17.630> who

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
get asked to come and help people who

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.140 
get asked to come and help people who
are<00:01:18.680> struggling<00:01:19.400> with<00:01:19.580> their<00:01:19.850> horses

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
are struggling with their horses

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150 
are struggling with their horses
imploding<00:01:21.110> sometimes<00:01:21.680> they're<00:01:21.890> scrambling

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
imploding sometimes they're scrambling

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.590 
imploding sometimes they're scrambling
all<00:01:22.670> sorts<00:01:23.090> of<00:01:23.150> things<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:24.910> as<00:01:25.910> I<00:01:26.090> said<00:01:26.300> I<00:01:26.330> want

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
all sorts of things and as I said I want

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.990 
all sorts of things and as I said I want
my<00:01:26.660> horses<00:01:27.260> to<00:01:27.440> walk<00:01:27.680> on<00:01:27.950> like<00:01:28.460> that<00:01:28.760> I<00:01:28.790> don't

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
my horses to walk on like that I don't

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.360 
my horses to walk on like that I don't
want<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.420> get<00:01:29.630> in<00:01:29.780> there<00:01:29.990> with<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.290> horse<00:01:30.560> so

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
want to get in there with the horse so

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.430 
want to get in there with the horse so
that's<00:01:31.610> how<00:01:31.820> we<00:01:31.880> train<00:01:32.240> them<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.780> we<00:01:33.080> expect

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
that's how we train them and we expect

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.840 
that's how we train them and we expect
them<00:01:33.590> then<00:01:33.770> just<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:34.160> stand<00:01:34.430> there<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.700> I

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
them then just to stand there and I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.150 
them then just to stand there and I
don't<00:01:34.910> need<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.420> huge<00:01:35.630> breaching<00:01:36.260> gates<00:01:36.500> and

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
don't need the huge breaching gates and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.969 
don't need the huge breaching gates and
I<00:01:37.250> don't<00:01:37.490> need<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.820> use<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.119> center<00:01:38.420> divider

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
I don't need to use the center divider

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.650 
I don't need to use the center divider
my<00:01:39.979> thoughts<00:01:40.369> about<00:01:40.760> breaching<00:01:41.270> gates<00:01:41.479> and

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
my thoughts about breaching gates and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.870 
my thoughts about breaching gates and
centre<00:01:41.900> dividers<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:42.680> can<00:01:43.190> look<00:01:43.340> at<00:01:43.490> on<00:01:43.700> the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
centre dividers you can look at on the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.090 
centre dividers you can look at on the
website<00:01:44.300> but<00:01:44.690> just<00:01:44.930> quickly<00:01:45.170> I<00:01:45.470> think<00:01:45.770> there

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
website but just quickly I think there

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.040 
website but just quickly I think there
are<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.190> waste<00:01:46.369> of<00:01:46.550> time<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:47.090> they<00:01:47.479> caused<00:01:47.750> so

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
are a waste of time and they caused so

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.520 
are a waste of time and they caused so
much<00:01:48.229> trouble<00:01:48.770> for<00:01:49.580> horses<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.690> also<00:01:51.290> they're

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
much trouble for horses and also they're

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.760 
much trouble for horses and also they're
wrong<00:01:51.710> they<00:01:52.130> caused<00:01:52.610> or<00:01:53.420> compromised<00:01:54.050> the

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
wrong they caused or compromised the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.920 
wrong they caused or compromised the
handlers<00:01:55.280> safety<00:01:55.759> especially<00:01:56.060> breach<00:01:56.600> gates

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
handlers safety especially breach gates

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.410 
handlers safety especially breach gates
so<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:57.800> don't<00:01:58.100> want<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.280> be<00:01:58.400> anywhere<00:01:58.759> where<00:01:59.360> I

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
so I don't want to be anywhere where I

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.690 
so I don't want to be anywhere where I
could<00:01:59.840> get<00:01:59.990> hurt<00:02:00.259> and<00:02:00.800> certainly<00:02:01.430> for<00:02:01.640> the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
could get hurt and certainly for the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.850 
could get hurt and certainly for the
horse<00:02:01.970> but<00:02:02.750> if<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.930> horse<00:02:03.140> happen<00:02:03.440> to<00:02:03.500> go<00:02:03.650> down

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
horse but if a horse happen to go down

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.170 
horse but if a horse happen to go down
the<00:02:04.040> float<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.369> last<00:02:04.580> thing<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:04.880> want<00:02:05.060> in

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
the float the last thing you want in

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.949 
the float the last thing you want in
there<00:02:05.330> really<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:06.550> center<00:02:07.550> divider<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.840> the

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
there really is a center divider so the

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.570 
there really is a center divider so the
horse<00:02:09.170> is<00:02:09.229> traveled<00:02:09.709> very<00:02:10.010> comfortably

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
horse is traveled very comfortably

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.729 
horse is traveled very comfortably
without<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.209> there's<00:02:11.510> no<00:02:11.630> common<00:02:12.019> rule<00:02:12.200> what

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
without that there's no common rule what

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.229 
without that there's no common rule what
I<00:02:12.769> do<00:02:12.920> recommend<00:02:13.220> though<00:02:13.700> is<00:02:13.820> that<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.030> have<00:02:14.209> a

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
I do recommend though is that you have a

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.050 
I do recommend though is that you have a
head<00:02:14.510> divider<00:02:14.930> okay<00:02:15.739> anyway<00:02:16.700> we're<00:02:16.880> going<00:02:17.000> to

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
head divider okay anyway we're going to

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.750 
head divider okay anyway we're going to

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
bother doing the other side at the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.380 
bother doing the other side at the
moment<00:02:39.270> now<00:02:40.080> what<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.319> would<00:02:40.470> do<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:41.120> don't<00:02:42.120> tie

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
moment now what I would do I don't tie

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.120 
moment now what I would do I don't tie
the<00:02:42.450> horses<00:02:42.780> up<00:02:43.110> well<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.410> targets<00:02:43.890> down

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
the horses up well the targets down

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.729 
the horses up well the targets down
we'll<00:02:44.310> get<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.550> tailgate<00:02:45.000> up<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.410> then<00:02:46.410> I'll

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
we'll get the tailgate up and then I'll

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.250 
we'll get the tailgate up and then I'll
go<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.190> tie<00:02:47.459> them<00:02:47.730> up<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.510> it's<00:02:48.930> really<00:02:49.170> just

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
go and tie them up and it's really just

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260 
go and tie them up and it's really just
about<00:02:49.530> they're<00:02:49.860> not<00:02:49.890> turning<00:02:50.400> around<00:02:50.459> which

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
about they're not turning around which

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.820 
about they're not turning around which
if<00:02:51.540> you've<00:02:51.660> got<00:02:51.750> two<00:02:51.900> big<00:02:52.050> horses<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:52.590> this

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
if you've got two big horses like this

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.940 
if you've got two big horses like this
is<00:02:53.010> near<00:02:53.550> impossible<00:02:53.700> anyway<00:02:54.830> but<00:02:55.830> the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
is near impossible anyway but the

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.850 
is near impossible anyway but the
procedure<00:02:56.370> then<00:02:56.670> once<00:02:56.910> we've<00:02:57.120> traveled<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:58.230> to

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
procedure then once we've traveled is to

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.520 
procedure then once we've traveled is to
go<00:02:59.010> into<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> float<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.940> drop<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.810> rope<00:03:00.989> down

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
go into the float and drop the rope down

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.229 
go into the float and drop the rope down
on<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.890> floor<00:03:02.130> in<00:03:02.489> between<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:03.000> chest

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
on the floor in between the chest

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.840 
on the floor in between the chest
Braille<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.200> horse<00:03:04.440> especially<00:03:05.340> with

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
Braille and the horse especially with

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.940 
Braille and the horse especially with
long<00:03:06.090> ropes<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:07.050> when<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.470> horse<00:03:07.680> comes

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
long ropes so that when the horse comes

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.220 
long ropes so that when the horse comes
out<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.730> can<00:03:08.970> trial<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:09.780> if<00:03:09.900> you're<00:03:10.049> outside

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
out it can trial and if you're outside

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.830 
out it can trial and if you're outside
you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.799> just<00:03:10.980> easily<00:03:11.190> pick<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.670> up<00:03:11.840> without

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
you can just easily pick it up without

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.330 
you can just easily pick it up without
the<00:03:13.110> horse<00:03:13.290> bogging<00:03:13.680> off<00:03:13.830> or<00:03:14.010> do<00:03:14.130> anything

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
the horse bogging off or do anything

the horse bogging off or do anything
like<00:03:14.580> that

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
like that

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
train them this way you usually don't

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.839

now<00:03:53.030> I've<00:03:53.720> under<00:03:54.050> that<00:03:54.230> side<00:03:54.470> then<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:54.860> come

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
now I've under that side then I come

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.979 
now I've under that side then I come
over<00:03:55.129> here<00:03:55.550> simply<00:03:56.330> because<00:03:56.480> I'm<00:03:56.660> left-handed

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
over here simply because I'm left-handed

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.470 
over here simply because I'm left-handed
or<00:03:57.380> right-handed<00:03:58.069> it's<00:03:58.880> easier<00:03:59.209> for<00:03:59.239> me<00:03:59.450> to

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
or right-handed it's easier for me to

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.600 
or right-handed it's easier for me to
operate<00:03:59.989> this<00:04:00.170> side<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:03.250> then<00:04:04.250> just<00:04:04.280> straight

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
operate this side and then just straight

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.460 
operate this side and then just straight
down<00:04:04.760> with<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.239> target<00:04:05.660> keep<00:04:05.870> myself<00:04:06.260> at<00:04:06.380> the
