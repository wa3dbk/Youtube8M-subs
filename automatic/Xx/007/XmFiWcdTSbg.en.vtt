00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In September 2012, it will be 40 years since grandpa 
 Sev started the nursery together with his sons. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
As a result of the companyâ€™s subsequent growth, it 
 now raises plants over nearly 40 hectares.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
As a nursery, we buy seeds from the seed 
 company, in this case Rijk Zwaan. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And our job is to sow these seeds in small sowing trays..

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
By using the good seeds, we get a plant which 
 looks like this one 40 days after sowing.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In the Netherlands, nearly all tomato plants are grafted.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is because the grafted tomato plant produces very tasty tomatoes.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.000
And we need a rootstock which is extra vigorous...

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
...and ensures that those tomatoes are packed with all kinds 
 of nutrients and have a nice sweet taste.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
They are now cutting the rootstock and putting a 
 clip on it, and then onto the plant.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.500
This clip serves to attach the rootstock and the plant together.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.000
After grafting, the plants need to be placed in a larger pot, so that the roots can 
 spread throughout the pot and the plant can grow to the top of the stick.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Between sowing and harvesting, at least three and a half months will elapse.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
A tomato plant immediately before delivery.
It is now 8 weeks since 
 we sowed and 5.5 weeks since we grafted the plants.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You can now see the first flowers coming out.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.000
That is the moment when the plants can go 
 to the market gardener from the nursery.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It takes another 7 to 8 weeks before he can harvest 
 the first tomatoes and you get to enjoy them.
