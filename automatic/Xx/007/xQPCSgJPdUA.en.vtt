so<00:00:00.599> the<00:00:00.870> cute<00:00:01.140> craft<00:00:01.410> mod<00:00:01.589> introduces<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.220> lot

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
so the cute craft mod introduces a lot

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.110 
so the cute craft mod introduces a lot
of<00:00:02.790> pretty<00:00:03.449> fun<00:00:03.720> things<00:00:03.990> among<00:00:04.500> them<00:00:04.529> is

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.120 
of pretty fun things among them is

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.639 
of pretty fun things among them is
teleportation<00:00:06.120> so<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:06.990> want<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.170> show<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.379> how

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
teleportation so I want to show you how

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.980 
teleportation so I want to show you how
you<00:00:07.710> can<00:00:07.919> use<00:00:08.069> teleportation<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.150> teleport<00:00:09.690> a

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
you can use teleportation to teleport a

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.700 
you can use teleportation to teleport a
house<00:00:10.800> underwater<00:00:11.759> so<00:00:12.630> here<00:00:13.049> we've<00:00:13.230> got<00:00:13.440> a

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
house underwater so here we've got a

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.609 
house underwater so here we've got a
house<00:00:14.130> built<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:15.570> let's<00:00:16.170> go<00:00:16.289> up<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
house built and let's go up to the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.050 
house built and let's go up to the
chimney<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.100> build<00:00:17.310> an<00:00:17.400> entrance<00:00:17.670> chimney<00:00:17.940> so

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
chimney I build an entrance chimney so

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.220 
chimney I build an entrance chimney so
once<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.359> underwater<00:00:18.690> we'll<00:00:18.990> still<00:00:19.140> be<00:00:19.199> able

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
once it's underwater we'll still be able

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.070 
once it's underwater we'll still be able
to<00:00:19.350> get<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:21.000> from<00:00:21.180> up<00:00:21.240> here<00:00:21.510> we<00:00:21.689> can<00:00:21.810> see

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
to get in and from up here we can see

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.189 
to get in and from up here we can see
that<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.820> house<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.119> surrounded<00:00:24.510> by<00:00:24.539> four

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
that the the house is surrounded by four

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.810 
that the the house is surrounded by four
pillars<00:00:25.800> there<00:00:25.949> sitting<00:00:26.250> with<00:00:26.279> glass<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:26.730> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
pillars there sitting with glass on the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.339 
pillars there sitting with glass on the
top<00:00:27.000> there's<00:00:27.660> something<00:00:27.930> special<00:00:28.109> at<00:00:28.289> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
top there's something special at the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.480 
top there's something special at the
bottom<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:28.740> we'll<00:00:28.890> go<00:00:29.010> over<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.369> a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
bottom but we'll go over that in a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.209 
bottom but we'll go over that in a
second<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.000> if<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.929> look<00:00:31.199> out<00:00:31.380> here<00:00:31.439> there's

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
second and if you look out here there's

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.280 
second and if you look out here there's
four<00:00:32.610> identical<00:00:33.180> pillars<00:00:33.570> same<00:00:33.899> distance

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
four identical pillars same distance

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.560 
four identical pillars same distance
apart<00:00:34.410> same<00:00:34.980> composition<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:35.820> they're

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
apart same composition but they're

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.959 
apart same composition but they're
underwater<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.190> idea<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.610> we'll<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:38.879> able

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
underwater so the idea is we'll be able

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.150 
underwater so the idea is we'll be able
to<00:00:39.120> teleport<00:00:39.570> from<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.899> these<00:00:40.649> four<00:00:41.010> pillars

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
to teleport from this these four pillars

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.850 
to teleport from this these four pillars
to<00:00:41.640> those<00:00:41.879> four<00:00:42.120> pillars<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:43.140> let's<00:00:43.379> go<00:00:43.649> down

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
to those four pillars so let's go down

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.440 
to those four pillars so let's go down
our<00:00:44.219> chimney<00:00:44.550> into<00:00:44.940> our<00:00:45.059> house<00:00:47.270> so<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.360> can

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
our chimney into our house so you can

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.439 
our chimney into our house so you can
see<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.840> very<00:00:49.079> finely<00:00:49.770> decorated<00:00:49.890> house

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
see it's a very finely decorated house

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.150 
see it's a very finely decorated house
and<00:00:51.449> now<00:00:51.660> you'll<00:00:52.170> see<00:00:52.230> we've<00:00:52.710> got<00:00:52.860> these<00:00:52.949> four

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and now you'll see we've got these four

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.650 
and now you'll see we've got these four
pillars<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> bottom<00:00:54.090> now<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.480> see

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
pillars at the bottom now you can see

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.260 
pillars at the bottom now you can see
these<00:00:54.809> blocks<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.710> gold<00:00:56.190> these<00:00:57.149> are

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
these blocks are gold these are

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.090 
these blocks are gold these are
observational<00:00:57.870> independent<00:00:58.440> blocks<00:00:58.649> that

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
observational independent blocks that

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.900 
observational independent blocks that
means<00:00:59.280> when<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.699> craft<00:01:00.000> them<00:01:00.329> using<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
means when you craft them using the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.009 
means when you craft them using the
essence<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:02.969> observation<00:01:03.539> from<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.870> cue

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
essence of observation from the cue

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.899 
essence of observation from the cue
craft<00:01:04.199> mod<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.129> make<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.580> depend<00:01:05.850> on

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
craft mod you can make it so depend on

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.060 
craft mod you can make it so depend on
how<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.119> look<00:01:06.330> at<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> block<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.990> changes<00:01:07.590> its

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
how you look at the block it changes its

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.149 
how you look at the block it changes its
composition<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:09.780> I've<00:01:10.140> set<00:01:10.409> these<00:01:10.560> up<00:01:10.799> so

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
composition so I've set these up so

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.440 
composition so I've set these up so
whenever<00:01:11.880> you're<00:01:12.030> looking<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
whenever you're looking for the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.850 
whenever you're looking for the

they're<00:01:14.159> all<00:01:14.430> gold<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.240> one<00:01:15.390> just

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
they're all gold see that one just

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.719 
they're all gold see that one just
changed<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.470> one<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.619> changed<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.610> was

our quantum computer it's been crafted
to<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.939> entangled<00:01:24.299> with<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> chrono<00:01:25.049> computer

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
to be entangled with the chrono computer

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.249 
to be entangled with the chrono computer
out<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.640> those<00:01:26.850> four<00:01:27.150> pillars<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:28.110> also

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
out in with those four pillars it's also

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.200 
out in with those four pillars it's also
got<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> block<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.009> ice<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.610> keep<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.000> nice<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
got a block of ice to keep it nice and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.010 
got a block of ice to keep it nice and
cool<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.810> we'll<00:01:31.590> right<00:01:31.799> click<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.310> hit

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
cool so we'll right click it and hit

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.039 
cool so we'll right click it and hit
energize<00:01:35.329> now<00:01:36.329> if<00:01:36.479> you'll<00:01:36.600> notice<00:01:36.630> it's

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
energize now if you'll notice it's

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929 
energize now if you'll notice it's
gotten<00:01:37.380> very<00:01:37.409> dark<00:01:38.159> our<00:01:38.369> house<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.759> gone

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
gotten very dark our house is gone

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.520 
gotten very dark our house is gone
that's<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.390> teleportation<00:01:40.140> only

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
that's because teleportation only

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.520 
that's because teleportation only
affects<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.430> stuff<00:01:42.329> around<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:43.020> not

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
we brought a huge block of water there

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.380 
we brought a huge block of water there
that's<00:01:52.470> because<00:01:52.649> we've<00:01:52.920> exchanged<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that's because we've exchanged the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.420 
that's because we've exchanged the
