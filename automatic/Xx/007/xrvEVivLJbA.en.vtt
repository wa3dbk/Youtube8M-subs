eight<00:04:46.730> dollars<00:04:46.760> so<00:04:47.690> I<00:04:47.720> felt<00:04:48.050> like<00:04:48.169> it<00:04:48.380> was<00:04:48.500> a

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
eight dollars so I felt like it was a

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.740 
eight dollars so I felt like it was a
still<00:04:48.860> because<00:04:49.340> even<00:04:50.000> at<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.390> regular<00:04:50.630> price

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750

still because even at the regular price
of<00:04:51.020> lipsticks<00:04:51.470> I<00:04:51.740> think<00:04:52.250> they<00:04:52.490> cost<00:04:52.700> about
