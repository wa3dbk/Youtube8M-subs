00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.560
 carlos greets night congratulations hello 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.800
 good night thank you carlos tell us 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.679
 why it cost so much to reach the goal 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.299
 because there are many in the first time 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.750
 to make a goal I'm a head for 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.570
 there are some that you see with your back to the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.430
 arch that wants to finish without angle but 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.529
 then they are things that happen in a game 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.840
 it is not sometimes an attempt tried and it 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.689
 cover against a pediment but good for 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.880
 fortune we were marked a criminal I think 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.329
 that it was fair that we insist on 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.329
 the attack 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.910
 of those carlos matches where 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.810
 value victory more than expression 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.990
 soccer 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.310
 I think it's better than other games by 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.770
 at least now we were more managing 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.470
 ball in other games to go is not given 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.720
 because what mattered most was winning 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.730
 but but good we have wall with the 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.920
 half arrived by the bands arrived 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.330
 centers that I think are much better than 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.800
 the last two health matches to 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.670
 gabriel cazenave hello carlos congratulations 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.100
 had really been seen in matches 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.440
 previous a good partnership between you 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.780
 compatriot figueroa and vos nevertheless 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.480
 it did not work on this commitment because you 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.070
 it seems that it happened that good I think that 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.460
 for the position they are in carlito 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.990
 we can not with a line of five and he 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.600
 was the lane on the right then 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.120
 it was about going but but hey there was 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.240
 concern to return but the 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.920
 try try tried out there and you 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.930
 some balls escaped but 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.640
 Well, I think you have to give it credit 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.890
 because he is a player who unbalanced 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.930
 I was pre - established that you were the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.240
 charged with finishing the penalties if it is 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.299
 that they had 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.729
 it's not the captain denis but but hey 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.649
 he approached me he said that he gives me 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.180
 trust and good usually yo yo 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.100
 for all criminal birds where 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.680
 played and in the clear selection equal to 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.820
 you asked denis and I got the ball 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.560
 I was watching when he came walking 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.869
 by half court of the ball and good 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.259
 then he came up to me and well he gave me the 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.229
 trust 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.490
 Carlos to enjoy this victory 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.929
 we have only a few days because we went down 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.170
 on Sunday again so it's true 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.790
 try to keep your head calm and 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.830
 prepare for the game on Sunday, Carlos 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.690

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.690
 match the author of the goal of olympia
