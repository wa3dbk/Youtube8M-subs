panel so what is NFC NFC is stands for

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.790 
panel so what is NFC NFC is stands for
near<00:00:17.550> field<00:00:17.580> communications<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.500> short

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
near field communications it is a short

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.890 
near field communications it is a short
distance<00:00:20.039> wireless<00:00:20.880> protocol<00:00:21.420> for

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
distance wireless protocol for

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.540 
distance wireless protocol for
connecting<00:00:22.350> between<00:00:22.680> two<00:00:22.859> devices<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.490> allow

them to communicate in short distance

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.880 
them to communicate in short distance
means<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.460> couple<00:00:27.029> inches<00:00:27.300> probably<00:00:27.710> use<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> lot

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
means a couple inches probably use a lot
