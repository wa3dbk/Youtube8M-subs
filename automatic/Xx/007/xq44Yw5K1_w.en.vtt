00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.859 
one from them that's actually what I did
when<00:02:02.110> I<00:02:02.170> forgot<00:02:02.590> it<00:02:02.740> last<00:02:02.770> time<00:02:03.190> so<00:02:04.000> once<00:02:04.630> we're

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
when I forgot it last time so once we're

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.830 
when I forgot it last time so once we're
here<00:02:05.170> these<00:02:05.650> are<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.159> goggles<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:07.210> there<00:02:07.659> are

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
here these are the goggles so there are

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.749 
here these are the goggles so there are
two<00:02:08.080> methods<00:02:08.289> of<00:02:08.649> killing<00:02:08.799> you<00:02:09.429> could<00:02:09.579> use

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
two methods of killing you could use

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.429 
two methods of killing you could use
your<00:02:09.909> abilities<00:02:10.389> but<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.989> could<00:02:11.170> also<00:02:11.290> not

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:11.439 
your abilities but you could also not

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:12.120 
your abilities but you could also not
use<00:02:11.829> your

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
use your

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.400 
use your
so<00:02:12.400> we're<00:02:12.520> just<00:02:12.550> going<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.790> cut<00:02:13.060> up<00:02:13.210> here<00:02:13.570> we're

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
so we're just going to cut up here we're

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.830 
so we're just going to cut up here we're
going<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.560> cost<00:02:14.890> or<00:02:15.250> mentor<00:02:15.700> turn<00:02:16.570> on<00:02:16.750> the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
going to cost or mentor turn on the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.620 
going to cost or mentor turn on the
prayer<00:02:17.080> you're<00:02:17.830> going<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.040> see<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.910> damage<00:02:19.210> oh

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
prayer you're going to see the damage oh

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.040 
prayer you're going to see the damage oh
it<00:02:20.020> with<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.800> all<00:02:21.460> right<00:02:21.670> now<00:02:22.240> there<00:02:22.870> we<00:02:22.960> go

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
it with it all right now there we go

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.840 
it with it all right now there we go
you're<00:02:23.710> going<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:23.920> you're<00:02:24.100> going<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.370> see<00:02:24.640> that

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
you're going to you're going to see that

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.850 
you're going to you're going to see that
you<00:02:25.180> do<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.300> lot<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.690> damage<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:27.900> what<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:28.930> like

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
you do a lot of damage and I what I like

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.920 
you do a lot of damage and I what I like
to<00:02:29.950> recommend<00:02:30.460> is<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.730> actually<00:02:30.970> just<00:02:31.450> use

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
to recommend is to actually just use

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.100 
to recommend is to actually just use
momentum<00:02:32.920> because<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.730> just<00:02:33.880> eases<00:02:34.810> things

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
momentum because it just eases things

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.980 
momentum because it just eases things
down<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.590> lot<00:02:35.860> because<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:37.210> have<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.540> worry

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
down a lot because you have to worry

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.990 
down a lot because you have to worry
less<00:02:38.260> about<00:02:38.320> your<00:02:38.710> buttons<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.400> since<00:02:39.850> you

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
less about your buttons and since you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.210 
less about your buttons and since you
you'll<00:02:40.600> kill<00:02:40.840> them<00:02:41.020> false<00:02:41.320> like<00:02:41.590> this<00:02:41.830> but<00:02:42.070> as

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
you'll kill them false like this but as

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.400 
you'll kill them false like this but as
you<00:02:42.310> can<00:02:42.400> see<00:02:42.640> right<00:02:42.670> here<00:02:43.270> I'm<00:02:43.450> actually

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
you can see right here I'm actually

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.590 
you can see right here I'm actually
going<00:02:44.710> to<00:02:44.890> have<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.310> use<00:02:45.430> different<00:02:45.970> spells

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
going to have to use different spells

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.330 
going to have to use different spells
because<00:02:46.960> only<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.320> Q<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.710> ER<00:02:48.040> really

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
because only the Q and the ER really

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.000 
because only the Q and the ER really
worth<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:49.270> kill<00:02:49.450> them<00:02:49.630> real<00:02:49.780> fast<00:02:50.050> if<00:02:50.860> you

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
worth it to kill them real fast if you

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.400 
worth it to kill them real fast if you
use<00:02:51.100> momentum<00:02:51.340> most<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.540> time<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:53.200> will

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
use momentum most of the time you will

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.920 
use momentum most of the time you will
to<00:02:53.980> hit<00:02:54.130> them<00:02:54.340> what<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:54.940> good<00:02:55.150> tactic<00:02:55.480> though<00:02:55.660> is

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
to hit them what a good tactic though is

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.320 
to hit them what a good tactic though is
to<00:02:55.960> always<00:02:56.290> use<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.800> chain<00:02:57.220> ability<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:58.180> that

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
to always use this chain ability so that

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.720 
to always use this chain ability so that
you<00:02:58.420> have<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.630> multiple<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.110> them<00:02:59.500> on<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.520> and

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
you have a multiple of them on you and

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.090 
you have a multiple of them on you and
then<00:03:01.270> you<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.540> just<00:03:01.690> clear<00:03:02.110> them<00:03:02.290> out<00:03:02.410> like<00:03:02.800> so

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
then you can just clear them out like so

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.280 
then you can just clear them out like so
so<00:03:03.640> that's<00:03:04.000> one<00:03:04.210> way<00:03:04.390> momentum<00:03:04.930> obviously

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
so that's one way momentum obviously

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.410 
so that's one way momentum obviously
being<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.530> other<00:03:05.740> one<00:03:06.120> something<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:07.180> want<00:03:07.360> to

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
being the other one something I want to

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.870 
being the other one something I want to
go<00:03:07.600> in<00:03:07.870> here<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.290> this<00:03:08.980> metamorphose

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
go in here is this metamorphose

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.110 
go in here is this metamorphose
disability<00:03:10.630> let<00:03:11.380> me<00:03:11.470> cost<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:11.890> there<00:03:12.880> we<00:03:13.000> go

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
disability let me cost it there we go

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.600 
disability let me cost it there we go
what<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.870> does<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.410> really<00:03:14.860> raises<00:03:15.370> your

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
what it does it really raises your

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.610 
what it does it really raises your
damage<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.300> with<00:03:16.480> this<00:03:16.690> yes<00:03:17.170> you're<00:03:17.380> going<00:03:17.560> to

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
damage and with this yes you're going to

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.980 
damage and with this yes you're going to
hate<00:03:18.130> them<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.640> probably<00:03:19.150> won't<00:03:19.600> hit<00:03:19.810> them

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
hate them and probably won't hit them

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.800 
hate them and probably won't hit them
every<00:03:20.290> now<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.650> then<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:21.700> it's<00:03:22.300> really<00:03:22.540> good

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
every now and then and it's really good

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.740 
every now and then and it's really good
but<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.380> downside<00:03:23.530> is<00:03:24.100> that<00:03:24.130> only<00:03:24.520> lasts<00:03:25.480> 30

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
but the downside is that only lasts 30

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.680 
but the downside is that only lasts 30
seconds<00:03:26.380> and<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:27.400> cooldown<00:03:27.820> is<00:03:27.850> quite<00:03:28.300> long

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
seconds and the cooldown is quite long

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.150 
seconds and the cooldown is quite long
so<00:03:29.550> therefore<00:03:30.550> I<00:03:30.820> actually<00:03:31.450> recommend<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:32.410> use

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
so therefore I actually recommend to use

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.130 
so therefore I actually recommend to use
momentum<00:03:33.430> which<00:03:34.420> we're<00:03:34.600> going<00:03:34.780> I'm<00:03:34.930> going<00:03:35.020> to

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
momentum which we're going I'm going to

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.920 
momentum which we're going I'm going to
show<00:03:35.350> you<00:03:35.610> once<00:03:36.610> you<00:03:36.700> get<00:03:36.850> my<00:03:36.970> status<00:03:37.390> bar<00:03:37.600> up

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
show you once you get my status bar up

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.600 
show you once you get my status bar up
all<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.740> way<00:03:39.480> let's<00:03:40.480> just<00:03:40.780> do<00:03:41.230> this<00:03:41.470> change<00:03:42.250> so

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
all the way let's just do this change so

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.120 
all the way let's just do this change so
we<00:03:42.760> can<00:03:42.940> get<00:03:43.150> some<00:03:43.420> more<00:03:43.450> on<00:03:43.870> us<00:03:44.080> I<00:03:44.320> just<00:03:44.950> like

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
we can get some more on us I just like

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.830 
we can get some more on us I just like
to<00:03:45.280> use<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.580> chain<00:03:45.850> ability<00:03:46.330> or<00:03:46.600> whatever

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
to use the chain ability or whatever

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.020 
to use the chain ability or whatever
skull<00:03:47.140> just<00:03:47.410> so<00:03:47.709> that<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:48.250> can<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.940> know

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
skull just so that I can you know

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.420 
skull just so that I can you know
already<00:03:49.870> damaged<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.560> next<00:03:50.800> one's<00:03:50.980> a<00:03:51.160> little

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
already damaged the next one's a little

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.730 
already damaged the next one's a little
and<00:03:51.780> there<00:03:52.780> we<00:03:52.900> go<00:03:52.930> we're<00:03:53.350> going<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.560> activate

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
and there we go we're going to activate

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.330 
and there we go we're going to activate
momentum<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:55.330> as<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:56.230> can<00:03:56.410> see<00:03:56.440> right<00:03:56.740> here

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
momentum and as you can see right here

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.670 
momentum and as you can see right here
you<00:03:57.850> do<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.000> lot<00:03:58.240> of<00:03:58.300> damage<00:03:58.600> why<00:03:59.230> I<00:03:59.260> picked

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
you do a lot of damage why I picked

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.520 
you do a lot of damage why I picked
extreme<00:04:00.250> magic<00:04:00.600> potions<00:04:01.600> well<00:04:02.110> you<00:04:02.200> can<00:04:02.320> see

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
extreme magic potions well you can see

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.890 
extreme magic potions well you can see
you<00:04:02.740> kill<00:04:02.980> them<00:04:03.130> so<00:04:03.370> fast<00:04:03.670> there's<00:04:04.330> no<00:04:04.540> really

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
you kill them so fast there's no really

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.570 
you kill them so fast there's no really
not<00:04:05.200> really<00:04:05.320> a<00:04:05.470> need<00:04:05.680> for<00:04:05.890> defense<00:04:06.310> and

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
not really a need for defense and

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.310 
not really a need for defense and
overload<00:04:06.970> only<00:04:07.240> works<00:04:07.480> on<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.750> deck<00:04:07.959> strength

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
overload only works on the deck strength

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.370 
overload only works on the deck strength
and<00:04:08.620> defense<00:04:08.800> so<00:04:09.670> why<00:04:10.030> not<00:04:10.180> just<00:04:10.270> big<00:04:10.660> magic

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
and defense so why not just big magic

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.449 
and defense so why not just big magic
potion<00:04:11.740> because<00:04:11.920> that's<00:04:12.100> all<00:04:12.250> you're<00:04:12.370> going

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
potion because that's all you're going

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.160 
potion because that's all you're going
to<00:04:12.610> see<00:04:13.060> right<00:04:13.090> there<00:04:13.360> I'm<00:04:13.450> just<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.870> eating

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
to see right there I'm just to eating

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.190 
to see right there I'm just to eating
them<00:04:14.320> you<00:04:14.770> could<00:04:14.920> also<00:04:15.180> try<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.390> stand<00:04:16.810> behind

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
them you could also try and stand behind

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.039 
them you could also try and stand behind
another<00:04:17.620> gargle<00:04:18.220> or<00:04:18.250> whatever<00:04:18.820> but<00:04:19.480> I'd

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
another gargle or whatever but I'd

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.050 
another gargle or whatever but I'd
recommend<00:04:20.350> to<00:04:20.650> just<00:04:20.979> stand<00:04:21.460> in<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.820> middle

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
recommend to just stand in the middle

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.150 
recommend to just stand in the middle
and<00:04:22.330> kill<00:04:22.630> it<00:04:22.840> everything<00:04:23.410> pick<00:04:23.680> up<00:04:23.770> your<00:04:23.860> jobs

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
and kill it everything pick up your jobs

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.990 
and kill it everything pick up your jobs
every<00:04:24.400> now<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:24.669> then

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
every now and then

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.790 
every now and then
and<00:04:25.090> that's<00:04:25.660> all<00:04:25.870> there<00:04:25.990> is<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.140> this<00:04:26.470> task

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
and that's all there is to this task

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.760 
and that's all there is to this task
it's<00:04:27.370> around<00:04:27.790> 50k<00:04:28.780> xbar<00:04:29.320> with<00:04:29.470> momentum

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
it's around 50k xbar with momentum

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.550 
it's around 50k xbar with momentum
that's<00:04:30.220> what<00:04:30.430> people<00:04:30.760> say<00:04:30.790> I<00:04:31.290> average<00:04:32.290> around

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
that's what people say I average around

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.270 
that's what people say I average around
60<00:04:33.070> though<00:04:33.250> because<00:04:34.210> 60<00:04:34.750> k<00:04:34.990> xb<00:04:35.230> is<00:04:35.950> what<00:04:36.160> they

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
60 though because 60 k xb is what they

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.640 
60 though because 60 k xb is what they
say<00:04:36.580> is<00:04:36.850> abilities<00:04:37.420> but<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:37.690> think<00:04:38.050> momentum<00:04:38.530> is

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
say is abilities but I think momentum is

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.270 
say is abilities but I think momentum is
a<00:04:38.680> lot<00:04:39.070> faster<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.840> around<00:04:41.140> 60<00:04:41.530> k<00:04:41.680> xb<00:04:41.890> an<00:04:42.070> hour

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
a lot faster so around 60 k xb an hour

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.250 
a lot faster so around 60 k xb an hour
you<00:04:42.820> can<00:04:42.970> get<00:04:43.090> a<00:04:43.120> grin<00:04:43.360> at<00:04:43.480> mall<00:04:43.690> every<00:04:43.840> now<00:04:44.080> and

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
you can get a grin at mall every now and

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.710 
you can get a grin at mall every now and
then<00:04:44.350> but<00:04:44.380> I<00:04:44.560> think<00:04:44.800> it's<00:04:44.950> only<00:04:45.280> like<00:04:45.550> 100k<00:04:46.420> not

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
then but I think it's only like 100k not

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.600 
then but I think it's only like 100k not
even<00:04:46.960> now<00:04:47.050> I<00:04:47.080> think<00:04:47.260> it's<00:04:47.530> only<00:04:47.740> 25<00:04:48.160> care<00:04:48.490> or

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
even now I think it's only 25 care or

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.550 
even now I think it's only 25 care or
something<00:04:48.880> not<00:04:49.420> really<00:04:49.750> something<00:04:50.020> good<00:04:50.350> they

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
something not really something good they

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.280 
something not really something good they
drop<00:04:51.010> some<00:04:51.190> runehelms<00:04:51.430> it's<00:04:52.330> this<00:04:52.900> is<00:04:53.020> just

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
drop some runehelms it's this is just

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.990 
drop some runehelms it's this is just
