say rock Luigi because Luigi is a
rocking<00:01:11.670> character<00:01:14.030> but<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.509> to

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
rocking character but this we have to

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.590 
rocking character but this we have to
find<00:01:15.869> all<00:01:16.110> 5<00:01:16.500> star<00:01:16.770> chips<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.670> order<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.090> form<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
find all 5 star chips in order to form a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.840 
find all 5 star chips in order to form a
complete<00:01:19.080> star

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
complete star

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.690 
complete star
so<00:01:21.850> start<00:01:22.240> rolling<00:01:22.600> into<00:01:22.750> things<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.549> five<00:01:24.549> of

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
so start rolling into things and five of

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.030 
so start rolling into things and five of
them<00:01:24.820> will<00:01:25.030> hide<00:01:25.240> star<00:01:25.630> chips<00:01:27.510> and<00:01:29.040> that's

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
them will hide star chips and that's

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.219 
them will hide star chips and that's
basically<00:01:30.550> it<00:01:30.820> just<00:01:31.060> roll<00:01:31.510> into<00:01:31.690> everything

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
basically it just roll into everything

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.090 
basically it just roll into everything
until<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.619> find<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.979> five<00:01:33.190> store<00:01:33.610> trips<00:01:33.940> I

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
until you find a five store trips I

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.800 
until you find a five store trips I
don't<00:01:36.100> remember<00:01:36.460> where<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.970> five<00:01:37.180> star<00:01:37.509> chips

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
don't remember where the five star chips

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.680 
don't remember where the five star chips
are<00:01:38.110> so<00:01:38.470> I'm<00:01:38.800> probably<00:01:39.400> just<00:01:39.850> going<00:01:40.330> to<00:01:40.509> roll

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
are so I'm probably just going to roll

00:01:40.690 --> 00:02:04.650 
are so I'm probably just going to roll
into<00:01:40.899> everything<00:01:41.590> until<00:01:41.920> I<00:01:42.070> find<00:01:42.340> them

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.120

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
right over here leads to a hidden star

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.890 
right over here leads to a hidden star

of<00:04:08.740> difficult<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.370> hurt<00:04:09.640> him<00:04:09.880> because<00:04:10.060> there's

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
of difficult to hurt him because there's

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.250 
of difficult to hurt him because there's
only<00:04:10.630> which<00:04:10.960> spot<00:04:11.260> is<00:04:11.530> his<00:04:11.740> nose<00:04:12.040> and

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
only which spot is his nose and

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.550 
only which spot is his nose and
basically<00:04:14.260> he<00:04:15.130> keeps<00:04:15.400> moving<00:04:15.730> around<00:04:16.500> so<00:04:17.500> you

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
basically he keeps moving around so you

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.540 
basically he keeps moving around so you
might<00:04:17.830> accidentally<00:04:18.550> miss<00:04:19.030> getting<00:04:19.420> the<00:04:19.630> note

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.490 
might accidentally miss getting the note
like<00:04:21.550> you<00:04:21.730> might<00:04:21.910> jump<00:04:22.240> close<00:04:22.540> up<00:04:22.810> next<00:04:23.290> to<00:04:23.380> the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
like you might jump close up next to the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.260 
like you might jump close up next to the
nose<00:04:23.680> but<00:04:24.010> you<00:04:24.100> end<00:04:24.340> up<00:04:24.430> spinning<00:04:24.790> into<00:04:25.090> the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
nose but you end up spinning into the

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.900 
nose but you end up spinning into the
area<00:04:25.630> right<00:04:26.200> next<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.860> nose<00:04:27.100> like<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.580> did<00:04:27.760> right

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
area right next to nose like I did right

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.720 
area right next to nose like I did right
there<00:04:28.210> it's<00:04:28.900> not<00:04:29.200> a<00:04:29.230> very<00:04:29.470> big<00:04:29.770> target<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:30.490> it

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
there it's not a very big target and it

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.850 
there it's not a very big target and it
is<00:04:30.910> constantly<00:04:31.660> moving<00:04:31.990> in<00:04:32.260> all<00:04:32.500> three

is constantly moving in all three

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.970 
is constantly moving in all three
directions<00:04:33.090> so<00:04:34.090> it's<00:04:34.240> hard<00:04:34.480> to<00:04:34.660> hit<00:04:34.980> and

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
directions so it's hard to hit and

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.740 
directions so it's hard to hit and
you'll<00:04:36.130> notice<00:04:36.310> that<00:04:36.430> tour<00:04:36.820> Betty<00:04:37.060> runs<00:04:37.450> into
