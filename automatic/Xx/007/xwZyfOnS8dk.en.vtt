a<00:00:15.130> plug<00:00:16.130> a<00:00:16.160> servo<00:00:16.700> into<00:00:17.360> the<00:00:17.450> ECB<00:00:17.900> and<00:00:18.830> I'm

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
a plug a servo into the ECB and I'm

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.019 
a plug a servo into the ECB and I'm
gonna<00:00:19.070> give<00:00:19.250> you<00:00:19.310> a<00:00:19.340> little<00:00:19.430> bit<00:00:19.610> technical

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
gonna give you a little bit technical

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.900 
gonna give you a little bit technical
information<00:00:20.599> on<00:00:21.020> how<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:21.890> servo<00:00:22.880> is

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
information on how the servo is

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.569 
information on how the servo is
controlled<00:00:23.390> by<00:00:23.509> the<00:00:23.570> ECB<00:00:23.899> so<00:00:24.680> all<00:00:25.070> servos<00:00:25.460> are

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:25.579 
controlled by the ECB so all servos are

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.339 
controlled by the ECB so all servos are
controlled<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:25.939> same<00:00:26.119> way<00:00:26.270> and<00:00:26.540> with<00:00:27.259> this

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
controlled the same way and with this

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:28.780 
controlled the same way and with this
oscilloscope<00:00:27.950> you're<00:00:28.130> gonna<00:00:28.250> be<00:00:28.340> able<00:00:28.399> to<00:00:28.550> see

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
oscilloscope you're gonna be able to see

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.510 
oscilloscope you're gonna be able to see
the<00:00:29.300> pulses<00:00:29.750> that<00:00:30.200> actually<00:00:30.529> tell<00:00:30.770> the<00:00:30.980> servo

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
the pulses that actually tell the servo

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.490 
the pulses that actually tell the servo
what<00:00:31.820> position<00:00:32.149> to<00:00:32.210> move<00:00:32.329> into<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:33.230> right<00:00:33.380> now

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
what position to move into so right now

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.410 
what position to move into so right now
the<00:00:33.920> servo<00:00:34.220> is<00:00:34.370> just<00:00:34.579> hanging<00:00:34.790> they're<00:00:35.120> not

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
the servo is just hanging they're not

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.420 
the servo is just hanging they're not
being<00:00:35.690> used<00:00:36.020> at<00:00:36.440> all<00:00:36.559> so<00:00:36.800> therefore<00:00:37.190> we<00:00:37.340> have

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
being used at all so therefore we have

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.760 
being used at all so therefore we have
no<00:00:37.700> pulses<00:00:38.149> on<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.329> screen<00:00:38.600> but<00:00:39.350> when<00:00:39.530> I<00:00:39.559> move

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
no pulses on the screen but when I move

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.560 
no pulses on the screen but when I move
it<00:00:39.890> to<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.070> lowest<00:00:40.400> position<00:00:40.520> you're<00:00:41.510> gonna

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
it to the lowest position you're gonna

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.200 
it to the lowest position you're gonna
see<00:00:41.870> that<00:00:42.020> there's<00:00:42.230> a<00:00:42.320> single<00:00:43.160> pulse<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:44.090> you

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
see that there's a single pulse and you

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.450 
see that there's a single pulse and you
can<00:00:44.300> see<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.510> width<00:00:44.750> of<00:00:44.870> that<00:00:45.020> pulse<00:00:45.260> now<00:00:46.190> as<00:00:46.400> I

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
can see the width of that pulse now as I

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.290 
can see the width of that pulse now as I
increase<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:47.920> width<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.400> servo<00:00:49.880> starts<00:00:50.180> to

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
increase the width the servo starts to

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.670 
increase the width the servo starts to
move<00:00:50.480> so<00:00:50.780> I'm<00:00:50.840> moving<00:00:50.990> the<00:00:51.170> position<00:00:51.350> of<00:00:51.590> the

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
move so I'm moving the position of the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.280 
move so I'm moving the position of the
servo<00:00:51.860> and<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:53.180> pulse<00:00:53.600> is<00:00:53.870> actually

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
servo and the pulse is actually

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.800 
servo and the pulse is actually
increasing<00:00:54.920> its<00:00:55.280> width<00:00:55.490> so<00:00:56.240> if<00:00:56.329> i<00:00:56.420> zoom<00:00:56.450> out

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
increasing its width so if i zoom out

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.260 
increasing its width so if i zoom out
now<00:00:57.940> you're<00:00:58.940> gonna<00:00:59.090> see<00:00:59.480> multiple<00:01:00.230> pulses<00:01:01.270> and

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
now you're gonna see multiple pulses and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.310 
now you're gonna see multiple pulses and
each<00:01:02.810> pulse<00:01:03.670> is<00:01:04.670> controlled<00:01:05.180> by<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.420> ECB<00:01:05.840> and

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
each pulse is controlled by the ECB and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.969 
each pulse is controlled by the ECB and
the<00:01:06.350> width<00:01:07.250> determines<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:09.229> position<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.799> the

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
the width determines the position of the

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.880 
the width determines the position of the
of<00:01:10.579> the<00:01:10.700> servo<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:12.170> if<00:01:12.260> I<00:01:12.320> go<00:01:12.440> all<00:01:12.620> the<00:01:12.710> way<00:01:12.740> to

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
of the servo so if I go all the way to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.680 
of the servo so if I go all the way to
the<00:01:13.100> slowest<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:13.820> see<00:01:13.970> how<00:01:14.090> thin<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.479> pulse

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
the slowest you see how thin the pulse

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.090 
the slowest you see how thin the pulse
gets<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:17.240> pulse<00:01:17.479> is<00:01:17.600> repeated<00:01:18.080> now<00:01:18.920> it's

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
gets the pulse is repeated now it's

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.350 
gets the pulse is repeated now it's
different<00:01:19.250> with<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.550> ECB<00:01:19.760> versus<00:01:20.210> other

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
different with the ECB versus other

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.770 
different with the ECB versus other
servo<00:01:21.170> controllers<00:01:21.650> is<00:01:22.090> if<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:23.299> notice<00:01:23.479> the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
servo controllers is if you notice the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.560 
servo controllers is if you notice the
pulse<00:01:24.110> width<00:01:24.740> changes<00:01:25.610> but<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.970> actual<00:01:26.210> pulse

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
pulse width changes but the actual pulse

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.310 
pulse width changes but the actual pulse
position<00:01:27.140> doesn't<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:29.030> we're<00:01:29.240> more<00:01:29.750> accurate

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
position doesn't so we're more accurate

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.440 
position doesn't so we're more accurate
than<00:01:30.470> most<00:01:30.710> servo<00:01:31.460> controllers<00:01:32.000> in<00:01:32.120> the<00:01:32.180> sense

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
than most servo controllers in the sense

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.950 
than most servo controllers in the sense
that<00:01:32.540> we<00:01:33.290> don't<00:01:33.409> take<00:01:33.680> in<00:01:33.830> consideration<00:01:34.010> the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
that we don't take in consideration the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.420 
that we don't take in consideration the
just<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.080> width<00:01:36.290> of<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.470> pulse<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.250> loop

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
just the width of the pulse and the loop

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.760 
just the width of the pulse and the loop
time<00:01:37.790> we<00:01:38.240> actually<00:01:38.420> take<00:01:38.780> all<00:01:39.080> those<00:01:39.409> numbers

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
time we actually take all those numbers

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.660 
time we actually take all those numbers
in<00:01:39.920> consideration

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.130 

that's<00:01:44.670> kinda<00:01:45.000> neat<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.390> actually<00:01:45.570> zoom<00:01:45.990> in

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
that's kinda neat if we actually zoom in

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.140 
that's kinda neat if we actually zoom in
here<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:50.040> if<00:01:50.160> I<00:01:50.250> slow<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> speed<00:01:50.880> down<00:01:50.940> the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
here and if I slow the speed down the

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.270 
here and if I slow the speed down the
servo<00:01:51.690> so<00:01:52.170> I'll<00:01:52.260> slow<00:01:52.440> it<00:01:52.470> down<00:01:52.590> quite<00:01:53.010> a<00:01:53.070> bit

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
servo so I'll slow it down quite a bit

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.040 
servo so I'll slow it down quite a bit
here<00:01:53.550> and<00:01:53.730> I'm<00:01:54.090> gonna<00:01:54.180> move<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.630> servo<00:01:54.810> now

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
here and I'm gonna move the servo now

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.940 
here and I'm gonna move the servo now
you're<00:01:55.140> gonna<00:01:55.230> see<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:57.090> move<00:01:57.300> slowly<00:01:57.780> as<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
you're gonna see it move slowly as the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.550 
you're gonna see it move slowly as the
servo<00:01:59.220> moves<00:01:59.840> your<00:02:00.840> solicitor<00:02:01.200> down<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.470> little

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
servo moves your solicitor down a little

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.710 
servo moves your solicitor down a little
bit<00:02:01.710> more<00:02:03.350> let's<00:02:04.350> do<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.590> again

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:19.559 

we<00:02:09.350> can<00:02:09.500> go<00:02:09.590> even<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.830> little<00:02:09.860> bit<00:02:10.100> slower

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.690 

so<00:02:20.260> there<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:20.799> now<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:20.950> can<00:02:21.069> see<00:02:21.189> the<00:02:21.280> accuracy

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
so there so now you can see the accuracy

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.099 
so there so now you can see the accuracy
that<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.930> robot<00:02:23.890> provides<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.760> for<00:02:25.420> your

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
that the robot provides you for your

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:34.740 
that the robot provides you for your
servo<00:02:26.560> positioning<00:02:27.299> pretty<00:02:28.299> cool

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:43.040
