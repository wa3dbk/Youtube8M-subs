00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:12.460
 Yes it is a Hi Kukai this time was introduced last time 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:14.790
 hg Gundam x Devil was completed so I would like to do a review of that 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.790
 I will 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:28.560
 Gundam x has been completed in only entered is here Shazam 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:34.190
 Yes, I was able to do something really cool like this 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:37.030
 In the previous opening video I was saying that the seal is in the Dan Dan x version 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.620
 Well certainly seal I'd were many 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.790
 All important parts are expressed in 8 parts. 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.320
 For example 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:52.050
 This yellow part or this 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.630
 Part of this dark blue that is attached to the part and then the arm of the pre that country vita is Well 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.400
 It is a part 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.920
 Well then, it's in this body when you say where is the seal 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.750
 bluish 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:08.880
 There are purple to purple lines 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.770
 It became a seal, and the back of this phrase and parts became a silver seal. 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.609
 Then this 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.340
 You know the black area under the rifle 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:23.799
 This part too 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.799
 Let's once look at the operation of removing the backpack expectations than is the seal 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.340
 The collar you entered 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.869
 It works as usual . 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.869
 Then my arms 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.799
 Well there 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.870
 Also here 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:45.700
 I can open it 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:48.060
 Then you can turn it like this 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.060
 Bracelet 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.610
 I will turn up to 90 degrees more than this 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.610
 I do not go 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.360
 Waist 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.470
 Opening 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.840
 I can do it 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:11.560
 Feet or firmly open up around here 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.560
 I will open it 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.760
 then 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.820
 I can not bend any more than this 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.349
 In the ankle also move well 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:37.820
 This part is also properly 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:39.240
 I can move it, but the overall operation is like this. With love, the next description of the backpack 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.920
 I will do 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.319
 Backpack to 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.720
 Something like this 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:53.190
 Here and comes with a satellite Cannon 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.190
 Here's a flight rifle or remove it later 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.790
 By attaching this 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.950
 It is also a beam saber 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.579
 It can be installed I'd rather when fitted with a win rifle 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.610
 Because 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:12.150
 I mounted the beam rifle 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:18.030
 Yes then this satellite cannon 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.830
 The satellite cannon comes with an arm like this 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.340
 It is very 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.340
 like this 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:32.050
 You can take satellite cannons to various schools 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.560
 If you fold it, it feels like this 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.730
 I can take it forward 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.450
 and m 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.450
 People from 6 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.290
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.990
 I can do it 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.630
 Yes from it 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.980
 Here slides 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.180
 At the time of launch 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.750
 When not departing 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:06.830
 Can be turned after 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.770
 This is a high output by pulling out the individual parts 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.910
 To saber 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:21.530
 I will do 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:22.520
 In anime I was the devil source but it seems that it has not been reproduced 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.480
 is not it 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.389
 Speaking of Gundam x, it's this reflector, isn't it? 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.550
 The reflector is 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.550
 Turn you are you doing this 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.000
 By opening like this 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:44.070
 I will expand 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.490
 So this is pretty licking 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:51.040
 It is great. 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:54.150
 It looks like a reflector, yes 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:05:00.320
 When the other side also opens 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.320
 Eagle Washiwashin 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:14.110
 When you open a new field stomach cancer 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:17.249
 It is possible to deploy on the streets of the name x ThatLookLikeThis 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:23.139
 This is cool, is n't it? 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:26.060
 It is this kind of feeling now been riding I doing this satellite Cannon 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:29.020
 Let's get this out 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:34.800
 When attached to a grandchild 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:39.430
 They are fired Now live scan as anime like this 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.650
 It is also possible to replay the scene 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.150
 Yes 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:52.810
 This is pretty cool 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:55.220
 Then I forgot to say that I brought this part of this shape 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.880
 Accessory 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:01.440
 Installing a missile pod Kotono 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.830
 I can do this 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.520
 It is quite a new idea 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.449
 This is fine, isn't it great after ? 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:15.150
 On foot 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:15.150
 There is something similar like this 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:24.030
 It is also a reaction to attach this Batoringu 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:28.110
 It's not like this 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:31.940
 It was an introduction, so this time it was an introduction of Gundam x Devil 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:38.210
 Personally, and this reflector 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:42.949
 It is an arm of the satellite character original origin and I really liked it 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:44.650
 Yes What more please try to also make everyone in mean 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:48.820
