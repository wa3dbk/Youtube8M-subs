mojo to start with and how do you get
more<00:00:50.670> mojo<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.210> ask<00:00:51.390> well<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:52.350> could<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.770> wait

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
more mojo you ask well you could it wait

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.840 
more mojo you ask well you could it wait
until<00:00:53.120> certain<00:00:54.120> crops<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.809> harvested<00:00:54.840> or<00:00:55.850> you

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
until certain crops are harvested or you

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.260 
until certain crops are harvested or you
could<00:00:57.090> buy<00:00:57.120> mojo<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.430> mojo<00:00:59.430> is<00:01:00.000> more

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
could buy mojo and mojo is more

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.700 
could buy mojo and mojo is more
expensive<00:01:00.449> than<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.930> thought<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.199> would<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.469> in

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
expensive than I thought it would be in

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.939 
expensive than I thought it would be in
this<00:01:02.129> day<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.370> age<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:03.270> any<00:01:03.480> rate<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:03.949> putting

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
this day and age at any rate but putting

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.560 
this day and age at any rate but putting
all<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.159> aside<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.610> mean<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> graphics<00:01:06.360> are

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
all that aside I mean the graphics are

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.649 
all that aside I mean the graphics are
good<00:01:06.930> if<00:01:07.200> he<00:01:07.530> has<00:01:07.680> push<00:01:08.070> notifications<00:01:08.659> if

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
good if he has push notifications if

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.789 
good if he has push notifications if
you're<00:01:09.869> not<00:01:09.960> familiar<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:10.740> of

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
you're not familiar with this kind of

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.070 
you're not familiar with this kind of
game<00:01:10.920> again<00:01:11.280> sometimes<00:01:11.729> you'll<00:01:11.970> plant<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.810> crop

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
game again sometimes you'll plant a crop

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.530 
game again sometimes you'll plant a crop
that<00:01:13.200> will<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.770> ready<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.220> let's<00:01:14.520> say<00:01:14.729> 12<00:01:15.150> hours

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
that will be ready in let's say 12 hours

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.230 
that will be ready in let's say 12 hours
and<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:16.200> actually<00:01:16.350> 12<00:01:16.920> hours<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.880> can

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
and it's actually 12 hours so you can

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.399 
and it's actually 12 hours so you can
have<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.479> set<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.720> send<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.200> push

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
have it set to send you a push

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.560
