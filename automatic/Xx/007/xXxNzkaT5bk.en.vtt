 watermelons lagenaria so here I did 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.820
 warm bed type warm well 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.330
 size and diameter of about 50 centimeters 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.910
 depth 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.740
 also around 50 centimeters to the bottom 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.310
 will lay 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.939
 the church so took there were branches for 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.810
 drainage 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:38.160

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:45.719

 Further, all you need to power on the past 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.809
 week on the call, the power dried out 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.840
 almost ken 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:03.090
 a little brown and here wore yesterday 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:08.520
 also green grass and we put it but 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:15.990
 the idea will heat up all of it all 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:21.590
 tamping up add more green 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:25.280
 that it was about 20 centimeters 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.280
 all this stuff 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:45.190
 went warming up so further shred 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:47.640
 will not over time all look perry 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.640
 rot 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.770
 green grass you 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.090
 generally 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.090
 something like this 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.360
 shovel does not serve 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.709
 grind 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.170
 it turns out 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:57.400
 the bed so on we take the land to sleep 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.790
 gas 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.190
 around the site is full of her here such 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.770
 roots roots a little choose here even 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.770
 dug up a bunch of roots to hide and someone 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.300
 I dug up the wire around the perimeter 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.300
 I'll do the hole later and cover it 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.300
 cellophane 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.640
 something like that 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:57.420
 will be continued next 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:01.769
 planted got here such here and 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.780
 after 70 centimeters almost and there with that 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.610
 hand after fifty see times and 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.829
 here are the first two beds here were warm 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.689
 the beds that I shot 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.780
 started here on the bottom 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.670
 put plastic bottles but the rest 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.030
 just under the film see the difference then 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.289
 that work too much today 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.990
 all plant will not have time to do 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:28.020
 there is a dark film here that went on 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.940
 trail she will look already the difference apparently 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.199
 the sun has already looked out all over the village days 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.110
 so the earth is already warming up I think 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:40.460
 that it will be very now here we will cover 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:45.030
 here it is now that steam is prone here to blow us away 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:50.039
 wind at the edges will not grow that of 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:52.370
 This will see later all 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.370
 good luck
