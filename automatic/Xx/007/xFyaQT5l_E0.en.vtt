video on this Aaron's ST 504 snowblower
that<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.769> just<00:00:14.040> picked<00:00:14.700> up<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.330> got<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.410> for<00:00:16.560> $80

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
that I just picked up I got it for $80

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.410 
that I just picked up I got it for $80
and<00:00:18.920> it's<00:00:19.920> around<00:00:20.310> August<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.119> I'm<00:00:21.240> planning

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
and it's around August so I'm planning

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.109 
and it's around August so I'm planning
on<00:00:21.600> keeping<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.140> till<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.500> snow<00:00:22.740> season<00:00:23.119> it

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
on keeping it till the snow season it

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.689 
on keeping it till the snow season it
needs<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.600> little<00:00:24.750> bit<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.230> work<00:00:25.529> first<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.609> all

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
needs a little bit of work first of all

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.490 
needs a little bit of work first of all
you<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:26.910> see<00:00:27.090> they<00:00:27.269> sprayed<00:00:27.570> some<00:00:27.779> primer<00:00:28.140> on

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
you can see they sprayed some primer on

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.919 
you can see they sprayed some primer on
it<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.890> looks<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.250> little<00:00:29.369> rough

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
it it looks a little rough

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.340 
it it looks a little rough
engine-wise<00:00:32.210> starts<00:00:33.210> right<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:34.110> doesn't

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
engine-wise starts right up it doesn't

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.780 
engine-wise starts right up it doesn't
have<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.710> electric<00:00:35.130> start

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
have the electric start

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.900 
have the electric start
I<00:00:35.820> think<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> st5<00:00:37.170> o4v<00:00:37.829> eased<00:00:38.309> one<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
I think the st5 o4v eased one with the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.720 
I think the st5 o4v eased one with the
electric<00:00:39.329> start<00:00:41.450> it<00:00:42.450> has<00:00:42.800> four<00:00:43.800> speeds<00:00:44.250> here

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
electric start it has four speeds here

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.380 
electric start it has four speeds here
one<00:00:45.660> through<00:00:45.899> four<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.440> reverse<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> that

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
one through four and reverse so that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.600 
one through four and reverse so that
means<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.280> self-propelled<00:00:50.280> has

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
means that it's self-propelled has

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.119 
means that it's self-propelled has
pneumatic<00:00:51.210> tires<00:00:51.510> which<00:00:51.899> are<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.739> decent

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
pneumatic tires which are in decent

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.770 
pneumatic tires which are in decent
shape<00:00:54.980> not<00:00:55.980> sure<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.550> age<00:00:56.789> probably<00:00:57.660> about<00:00:59.780> 15

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
shape not sure the age probably about 15

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.200 
shape not sure the age probably about 15
years<00:01:01.100> old<00:01:02.100> maybe<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.730> little<00:01:02.940> older<00:01:03.449> than<00:01:03.660> that

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
years old maybe a little older than that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.030 
years old maybe a little older than that
whoever<00:01:06.210> had<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.630> thing<00:01:06.930> did<00:01:07.260> service<00:01:07.590> it

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
whoever had this thing did service it

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.070 
whoever had this thing did service it
there's<00:01:08.340> all<00:01:08.490> new<00:01:08.729> fuel<00:01:09.060> lines<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:10.049> new

clean there's a new spark plug there's
fresh<00:01:14.790> oil<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.979> so<00:01:16.979> when<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:17.970> bought<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.479> it

fresh oil in it so when I bought it it

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.590 
fresh oil in it so when I bought it it
started<00:01:19.710> right<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:19.979> runs<00:01:20.580> fine<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> still

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
started right up runs fine and it still

also a new primer on here and there's
also<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.130> new<00:01:29.369> primer<00:01:29.790> line<00:01:30.259> so<00:01:31.259> pretty<00:01:32.040> much

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
also a new primer line so pretty much

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.050 
also a new primer line so pretty much
everything

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
everything

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.620

mechanically<00:01:33.720> has<00:01:33.930> been<00:01:34.110> taken<00:01:34.439> care<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
mechanically has been taken care of and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.300 
mechanically has been taken care of and
it<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.869> needs<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.170> little<00:01:37.320> work<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.890> paint

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
it just needs a little work on the paint

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.420 
it just needs a little work on the paint
so<00:01:38.610> I'm<00:01:38.700> gonna<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.329> doing<00:01:39.600> some<00:01:39.780> painting<00:01:40.430> if

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
so I'm gonna be doing some painting if

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.999 
so I'm gonna be doing some painting if
we<00:01:41.610> take<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.820> look<00:01:42.030> at<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> auger<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.049> did<00:01:43.590> notice

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
we take a look at the auger I did notice

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.030 
we take a look at the auger I did notice
a<00:01:44.130> problem<00:01:44.369> right<00:01:45.060> when<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> bought<00:01:45.630> it

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.399 

underneath<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:51.110> auger<00:01:52.110> crankcase<00:01:52.920> down<00:01:53.369> here

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
underneath the auger crankcase down here

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.120 
underneath the auger crankcase down here
you<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.619> see<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.880> there<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.680> very<00:01:58.680> light

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
you can see that there is a very light

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.510 
you can see that there is a very light
leak<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.170> some<00:02:01.170> sort<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.500> liquid<00:02:01.680> oil<00:02:02.130> coming

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
leak and some sort of liquid oil coming

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.760 
leak and some sort of liquid oil coming
out<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.850> there<00:02:03.000> I'm<00:02:03.360> not<00:02:03.869> exactly<00:02:04.200> sure<00:02:04.409> what

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
out of there I'm not exactly sure what

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.350 
out of there I'm not exactly sure what
oil<00:02:05.009> goes<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.579> there<00:02:05.790> I'm<00:02:05.909> gonna<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.210> to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
oil goes in there I'm gonna have to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.589 
oil goes in there I'm gonna have to
figure<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.659> out<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.819> seems<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.390> be

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
figure that out and it it seems to be

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.260 
figure that out and it it seems to be
leaking<00:02:09.840> out<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:11.300> seal<00:02:12.300> here<00:02:12.750> Sony

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
leaking out the seal here Sony

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.900 
leaking out the seal here Sony
some<00:02:13.420> new<00:02:13.540> oil<00:02:13.810> seals<00:02:14.290> on<00:02:14.590> each<00:02:14.770> side<00:02:15.100> so

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
some new oil seals on each side so

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.280 
some new oil seals on each side so
that's<00:02:16.060> going<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.270> be<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.480> repair<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.170> I'll

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
that's going to be a repair that I'll

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.410 
that's going to be a repair that I'll
bring<00:02:17.470> in<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.950> future<00:02:18.430> soon<00:02:18.760> as<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:19.000> order

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
bring in the future soon as I order

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:27.120 
bring in the future soon as I order
those<00:02:19.630> parts<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:25.050> also<00:02:26.050> noticed<00:02:26.710> that<00:02:26.890> one<00:02:27.100> of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
those parts I also noticed that one of

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.700 
those parts I also noticed that one of
the<00:02:27.280> shear<00:02:27.580> pins<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.390> not<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.660> shear<00:02:28.960> pin<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:29.590> on

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
the shear pins is not a shear pin so on

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.380 
the shear pins is not a shear pin so on
this<00:02:29.830> side<00:02:30.070> it's<00:02:30.280> just<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.550> bolt<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.120> need

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
this side it's just the bolt so I need

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.900 
this side it's just the bolt so I need
to<00:02:31.540> put<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.750> shear<00:02:32.020> pin<00:02:32.050> in<00:02:32.500> there<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:33.760> other

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
to put a shear pin in there the other

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.600 
to put a shear pin in there the other
side<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.780> shear<00:02:34.990> pin<00:02:35.200> is<00:02:35.350> good<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.310> think

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
side the shear pin is good so I think

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.730 
side the shear pin is good so I think
our<00:02:39.850> goal<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.390> gonna<00:02:40.660> be<00:02:40.900> we're<00:02:41.650> gonna

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
our goal is gonna be we're gonna

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.620 
our goal is gonna be we're gonna
pressure<00:02:42.100> wash<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.670> machine<00:02:43.030> just<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.420> clean

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
pressure wash the machine just to clean

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.320 
pressure wash the machine just to clean
off<00:02:43.810> some<00:02:44.050> of<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.200> dirt<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.620> grime<00:02:45.330> we're

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
off some of the dirt and grime we're

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.910 
off some of the dirt and grime we're
gonna<00:02:46.510> we're<00:02:46.780> then<00:02:46.930> gonna<00:02:47.170> do<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.440> little<00:02:47.710> bit

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
gonna we're then gonna do a little bit

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.610 
gonna we're then gonna do a little bit
of<00:02:48.070> touch-up<00:02:48.520> paint<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.450> orange<00:02:49.900> spray<00:02:50.260> paint

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
of touch-up paint and orange spray paint

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.030 
of touch-up paint and orange spray paint
and<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:50.980> little<00:02:51.220> sanding<00:02:51.910> before<00:02:52.060> we<00:02:52.360> paint<00:02:52.630> and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
and a little sanding before we paint and

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.240 
and a little sanding before we paint and
we'll<00:02:54.040> replace<00:02:54.370> those<00:02:54.760> seals<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:56.830> think

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
we'll replace those seals and I think

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.950 
we'll replace those seals and I think
pretty<00:02:57.580> much<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:58.000> machine<00:02:58.360> should<00:02:58.600> be<00:02:58.660> ready

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
pretty much the machine should be ready

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.320 
pretty much the machine should be ready
to<00:02:59.080> go<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.800> I<00:02:59.860> plan<00:03:00.100> on<00:03:00.340> selling<00:03:00.820> in<00:03:01.120> the
