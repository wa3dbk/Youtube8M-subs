00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
make it run because this is step one

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:51.870 
make it run because this is step one
part<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:42.010> step<00:01:42.250> by<00:01:42.730> step<00:01:43.150> by<00:01:43.330> step<00:01:43.360> -<00:01:44.110> I<00:01:50.760> guess<00:01:51.760> I

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
part of step by step by step - I guess I

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.470 
part of step by step by step - I guess I
can<00:01:52.000> all<00:01:52.150> one<00:01:52.450> be<00:01:52.660> big<00:01:53.050> one<00:01:53.380> big<00:01:53.710> set<00:01:54.480> since

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
can all one be big one big set since

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.470 
can all one be big one big set since
rolling<00:01:55.870> out<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.140> Horde<00:01:59.970> almost<00:02:00.970> only<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.420> the
