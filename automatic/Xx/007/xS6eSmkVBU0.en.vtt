too much water flow there it loved the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.760 
too much water flow there it loved the

bolster that area with one nice big
piece<00:04:56.950> of<00:04:56.980> rock<00:04:57.580> so<00:04:58.120> now<00:04:58.270> it's<00:04:58.510> stable<00:04:58.960> but

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
piece of rock so now it's stable but

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.200 
piece of rock so now it's stable but
what<00:04:59.740> that<00:04:59.890> meant<00:05:00.220> was<00:05:02.010> everything<00:05:03.010> here<00:05:03.430> had

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
to come off and everything here had to

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.350 
to come off and everything here had to
change<00:05:07.290> so<00:05:08.290> that's<00:05:08.770> what<00:05:08.980> I<00:05:09.040> did<00:05:09.070> so<00:05:09.790> trying<00:05:10.300> to

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
change so that's what I did so trying to

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.409 
change so that's what I did so trying to
move<00:05:10.540> to<00:05:10.990> corals<00:05:11.380> around<00:05:11.680> ended<00:05:12.370> up<00:05:12.490> making<00:05:13.150> me

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
move to corals around ended up making me

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.860 
move to corals around ended up making me
do<00:05:13.630> redo<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.560> whole<00:05:14.590> top<00:05:15.400> right<00:05:16.120> section<00:05:16.630> of

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
do redo the whole top right section of

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.070 
do redo the whole top right section of
my<00:05:16.990> tank<00:05:17.230> so<00:05:18.070> I<00:05:18.370> actually<00:05:19.270> think<00:05:19.600> it<00:05:19.780> looks

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
my tank so I actually think it looks

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.920 
my tank so I actually think it looks
really<00:05:20.830> good<00:05:21.160> one<00:05:21.880> of<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.030> big<00:05:22.240> benefits<00:05:22.450> i

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
really good one of the big benefits i

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.570 
really good one of the big benefits i
got<00:05:23.490> was<00:05:24.490> i<00:05:24.790> was<00:05:24.940> able<00:05:25.180> to<00:05:25.390> relocate<00:05:25.980> this<00:05:26.980> big

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
got was i was able to relocate this big

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.780 
got was i was able to relocate this big
money<00:05:28.210> cap<00:05:28.630> colony<00:05:29.200> this<00:05:29.890> money<00:05:30.220> is<00:05:30.340> really

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
money cap colony this money is really

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.940 
money cap colony this money is really
cool<00:05:31.000> but<00:05:31.390> where<00:05:31.510> i<00:05:31.540> had<00:05:31.750> it<00:05:31.870> before<00:05:31.960> it<00:05:32.470> made

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
cool but where i had it before it made

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.130 
cool but where i had it before it made
it<00:05:33.070> really<00:05:33.370> hard<00:05:33.490> to<00:05:33.760> place<00:05:34.030> corals<00:05:34.510> around<00:05:34.900> it

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
it really hard to place corals around it

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.980 
it really hard to place corals around it
it<00:05:35.530> shadowed<00:05:35.890> everything<00:05:36.640> it<00:05:36.910> blocked<00:05:37.600> water

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
it shadowed everything it blocked water

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.680 
it shadowed everything it blocked water
flow<00:05:38.290> it<00:05:38.470> was<00:05:38.620> just<00:05:38.890> a<00:05:39.040> pain<00:05:39.520> so<00:05:40.419> what<00:05:40.570> I<00:05:40.600> did

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
flow it was just a pain so what I did

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.420 
flow it was just a pain so what I did
was<00:05:40.840> I<00:05:41.169> put<00:05:41.200> it<00:05:41.440> kind<00:05:41.680> of<00:05:41.770> over<00:05:41.979> in<00:05:42.040> the<00:05:42.130> corner

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
was I put it kind of over in the corner

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.640 
was I put it kind of over in the corner
it<00:05:42.700> seems<00:05:43.030> like<00:05:43.210> it<00:05:43.390> fits<00:05:43.600> more<00:05:44.080> aesthetically

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
it seems like it fits more aesthetically

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.370 
it seems like it fits more aesthetically
there<00:05:44.979> and<00:05:45.190> then<00:05:45.580> I<00:05:45.610> kind<00:05:45.850> of<00:05:45.940> laid<00:05:46.150> it<00:05:46.330> back<00:05:46.380> so

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
there and then I kind of laid it back so

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.469 
there and then I kind of laid it back so
it<00:05:47.500> has<00:05:47.620> more<00:05:47.830> of<00:05:47.979> a<00:05:48.070> horizontal<00:05:48.880> plane<00:05:49.000> to<00:05:49.360> it

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
it has more of a horizontal plane to it

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.650 
it has more of a horizontal plane to it
now<00:05:49.630> than<00:05:50.290> a<00:05:50.350> vertical<00:05:50.919> plane<00:05:51.210> now<00:05:52.210> that<00:05:52.479> is

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
now than a vertical plane now that is

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.420 
now than a vertical plane now that is
going<00:05:52.930> to<00:05:53.020> affect<00:05:53.320> the<00:05:53.770> coral<00:05:54.070> health<00:05:54.310> a

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
going to affect the coral health a

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.620 
going to affect the coral health a
little<00:05:54.669> bit<00:05:54.760> if<00:05:54.880> you<00:05:54.970> look<00:05:55.120> at<00:05:55.240> the<00:05:55.330> center

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
little bit if you look at the center

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.050 
little bit if you look at the center
section<00:05:55.900> of<00:05:56.169> it<00:05:56.290> it's<00:05:56.770> this<00:05:56.950> light<00:05:57.400> pink<00:05:57.850> well

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
section of it it's this light pink well

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.810 
section of it it's this light pink well
that's<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:58.419> old<00:05:58.540> shadowed<00:05:59.110> area<00:05:59.530> and<00:05:59.820> now

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
that's the old shadowed area and now

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.430 
that's the old shadowed area and now
it's<00:06:01.060> getting<00:06:01.240> highlight<00:06:01.750> so<00:06:02.020> that<00:06:02.260> whole

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
it's getting highlight so that whole

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.830 
it's getting highlight so that whole
coral<00:06:02.950> is<00:06:03.070> gonna<00:06:03.250> have<00:06:03.370> to<00:06:03.460> readapt<00:06:03.970> to<00:06:04.690> its

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
coral is gonna have to readapt to its

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.530 
coral is gonna have to readapt to its
new<00:06:04.990> location<00:06:05.310> but<00:06:06.310> over<00:06:06.550> time<00:06:06.729> it<00:06:07.000> will<00:06:07.120> and

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
new location but over time it will and

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.150 
new location but over time it will and
it'll<00:06:08.050> be<00:06:08.200> fine<00:06:09.540> but<00:06:10.540> anyways<00:06:10.900> it<00:06:11.169> was<00:06:11.590> a<00:06:11.740> huge

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160

ordeal it turned out be a couple hours
worth<00:06:15.130> of<00:06:15.280> work<00:06:15.510> twenty<00:06:16.510> tubes<00:06:16.720> of<00:06:16.930> glue<00:06:17.169> or<00:06:17.350> so

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
worth of work twenty tubes of glue or so

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.560 
worth of work twenty tubes of glue or so
and<00:06:18.180> a<00:06:19.180> completely<00:06:20.020> unforeseen<00:06:21.150> rioc<00:06:22.150> was<00:06:22.390> to

and a completely unforeseen rioc was to

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.440 
and a completely unforeseen rioc was to
a<00:06:22.600> being<00:06:22.840> of<00:06:22.960> the<00:06:23.050> tank<00:06:23.320> so<00:06:23.640> there<00:06:24.640> we<00:06:24.760> go<00:06:24.790> just

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
a being of the tank so there we go just

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.840
