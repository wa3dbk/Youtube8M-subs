00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.880
 32 should be the 32 video then 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.010
 we are at 32 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.750
 we really are in so many videos and 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.180
 we have become really many 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.970
 thanks to all the 1750s and broken there 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.619
 they are following so thank you because 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.899
 in the end it adds 2600 mi in three months 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.090
 like i think it's there i like subscribers 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.550
 be a great result guys thanks 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.579
 thanks thanks to zero video today 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.760
 very simple I will not do any kind 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.020
 of particular things and let's go 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.710
 directly only from the end to you 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.120
 is happy to know the prices 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.730
 so as usual find the banner 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.039
 at the end video you can peek if not 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.420
 I am only interested in what I will say then to ends 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.800
 video of the video already the banner 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.020
 obviously who switch is a person 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.000
 ugly but I expect you at least put yourself 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.080
 i like it on ichat and the video for 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.750
 the profuse commitment 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.900
 today I will make a small closes of five 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.400
 questions you are asking me in so many a 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.290
 which perhaps it is better to give an answer 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.210
 because otherwise I will continue to rewrite 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.560
 always the same things inside the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.119
 comments 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.770
 thank you especially for the comments 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.770
 which you release because it is anyway is 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.810
 the interaction I had in mind with 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.490
 you from the beginning is coming true 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.500
 themes thanks to all those who now i 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.329
 comments for why they are always nice 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.090
 as you leave me, I like you guys 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.189
 these last 150 are the last mile 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.229
 many thanks thanks thanks 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.180
 as usual left for commitment 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.829
 more than anything else because it is still to do 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.170
 completely kids to follow everyone 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.299
 these players that I propose you every 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.399
 day is not really easy 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.540
 so for the commitment let's put it this way 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.590
 commitment 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.939
 let me 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.799
 let's talk about the questions the first question 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.600
 What you do to me all the time is that 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.159
 caspita means bearing ei 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.509
 players bearing boys are 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.210
 players you can buy e 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.030
 resell at a price I obviously give you 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.890
 they are fairly low prices though they are 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.649
 secure and very easy earnings e 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.149
 above all at zero risk ie you know 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.250
 that these players guys do 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.980
 they resell so they will never remain there 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.870
 never ever on the group the advice which 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.400
 if you have very few credits started 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.950
 with these players then start a 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.880
 resell them buy 50 employees 50 e 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.440
 away talking 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.349
 at the beginning when I had it 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.030
 20013 I did it and earned 10 15 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.620
 stage per day 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.660
 relatively simple in a fast way 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.670
 and simple because you call yourself a player 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.220
 they buy without even keeping up 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.260
 for others the second question was mi 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.180
 make a sale please do not know how to do it 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.799
 please 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.510
 I've already given you the answer in another 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.700
 you go well every once in a while better able to 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.160
 remember answer is no not because i am 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.959
 bad because I don't want to veil 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.420
 because the time guys are buying and selling 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.340
 it is little and unfortunately I have to commit it 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.010
 for this video I can do it for you 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.389
 interrupt the series and then to the others 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.700
 1749 of you who want the video and I have to 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.470
 say sorry dude blocked me 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.569
 so unfortunately I can't do it 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.850
 so don't ask that trivially 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.350
 answer always no 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.549
 even in this case it is not meanness 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.500
 I repeat it for the umpteenth time it is 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.840
 I don't have the time 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.239
 necessary to do it for me let alone 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.950
 guys do it for other people too 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.209
 without then going to consider that if 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.370
 something happens to the account that 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.930
 obviously you have to blame them then 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.350
 it goes to me and I really do n't feel like 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.370
 put myself in these unpleasant situations 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.299
 third question with which the player 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.280
 Earns more or a variant was 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.980
 with which player you trade 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.480
 mostly there are no boys like al 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.660
 Usually I've always said this 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.400
 has 23 times there is no player in 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.620
 I have a list in life 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.660
 of 20 players I think there are twenty 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.549
 because because I myself in use 20 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.169
 that is, I make the profit 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.590
 day total during the 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:55.340
 day then selling 50 60 cards but 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.319
 of 20 different players 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.060
 and then of course I can not say 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.950
 with which I earn more because I could 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.790
 earn what I know with a cavani taken 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.590
 4 4 2 to 9 thousand and resold 11,000 1100 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.440
 credits for example are not calculations 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.440
 precise and then maybe sell some 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.720
 nasri taken 25 sold at 27 with a 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.329
 gain of 300 credits you understand well that 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.540
 each player different each different auction 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.729
 every transaction is different so you have to 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.150
 simply my advice is betting 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.610
 on the quantity choose 5 6 players 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.260
 buy them and sell them at the end 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.300
 day something something you will have 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.680
 always earned anyway I'm feeling 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.950
 of people that sometimes I get the 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.169
 messages facebook or quadagnato 150k enna 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.030
 9 or another who wrote to me is 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.780
 arrived at 2 million thanks to yours 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.330
 advice 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.860
 you slut of themes you too at this 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.050
 point how many players you bought 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.669
 why make so many idiots one 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.330
 day still does not come is not me 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.300
 succeeded 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.250
 i'm not doing much completely 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.780
 slut trout guys do so many 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.610
 theme loans also like this 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.250
 point which are the players that 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.340
 used because I want it too 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.950
 the fourth point is when you buy put the 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.750
 series is not based on the west the guys there 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.280
 series is simply to give you a hand 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.260
 to make trades then put will be 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.270
 of contour when I buy it I buy it 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.330
 when I arrive I will reach 1500 million 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.500
 and half a million 617 against you I do it 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.630
 see if you want to do one too 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.669
 match because in the end put it once 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.289
 in life one buys but then after two three 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.599
 gole boys will sell it immediately that is 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.580
 I do not keep it then and contour 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.130
 let's put it this way the seat serves to make you 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.550
 make credits not able to say fuck 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.800
 I'm very sure there was another 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.200
 question that unfortunately I have 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.910
 forgotten sorry I didn't mark it 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.950
 so I won't be able to answer you if you 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.599
 beautiful mind comes cheerfully 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.770
 in the video you have seen in this effect 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.229
 however, some players do not 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.990
 will appear in the banner is not that it is not 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.880
 they can use to see for 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.129
 example now own young and in 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.309
 priority 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:59.499
 domain we say you can use them though 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:01.119
 I don't give you the prices because I am a lot 

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:03.669
 unstable are quite difficult to 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:06.249
 take and resell that is 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.830
 resell them take up the problem is 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:10.839
 always take them so be careful 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.119
 my advice is gone and you see 

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:14.499
 state who understood the system knows how 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:16.300
 do you understand what the price of 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:18.279
 buying a player 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.929
 make yourself two quick and understood calculations 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:22.929
 alone as much as buying them as it came 

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:24.969
 young and robinho anyway you can 

00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:26.589
 lose for those of you instead of it here 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:29.019
 here the question I play on xbox like 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:31.179
 I have to do if you play on stock you don't 

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:33.219
 I can help you because unfortunately ps3 's 

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:35.259
 consequently I can't help you anyway 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:37.360
 I found a youtube channel that does 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.129
 buying and selling practically using i 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.699
 my players therefore trivially 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:45.069
 also seeing this video taken mine 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:47.169
 players obviously went to 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:48.610
 get inspired on xbox and stay there 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.749
 using I will not leave the link for the 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.879
 simple fact that I don't like it 

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:54.939
 sponsored people who obviously don't 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:57.189
 he even asked permission or such 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:58.929
 thanked for the service provided and 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.519
 is continuing to exploit cheerfully 

00:06:58.929 --> 00:07:02.499
 obviously all these videos I am 

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:04.110
 doing so it should be emitted I tell you that 

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:06.009
 all players of use are 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.389
 usable so you can 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:09.009
 quietly use also on fox 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:10.929
 so prices must change 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:12.550
 just go see how the is 

00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:14.860
 sale price and make you an account 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.909
 very fast to understand what you owe 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.529
 buy it 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:20.169
 as usual you know what the figures are 

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:22.569
 variables but names are fundamental 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:24.339
 so obviously if I tell you buy yourself 

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:27.519
 you can compliment with sneijder
