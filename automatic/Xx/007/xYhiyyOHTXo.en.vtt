andhra series and today's question is
from<00:00:18.610> Josue<00:00:19.090> Danielle<00:00:19.480> he<00:00:20.230> has<00:00:20.680> a<00:00:20.710> few

from Josue Danielle he has a few

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.130 
from Josue Danielle he has a few
questions<00:00:20.980> about<00:00:21.490> how<00:00:21.910> things<00:00:22.660> work<00:00:22.869> with<00:00:23.050> an

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
questions about how things work with an

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.870 
questions about how things work with an
effects<00:00:23.410> loop<00:00:23.500> so<00:00:23.860> first<00:00:24.130> of<00:00:24.340> all<00:00:24.490> I<00:00:24.730> would

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
effects loop so first of all I would

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.690 
effects loop so first of all I would
like<00:00:24.910> to<00:00:25.090> redirect<00:00:25.990> you<00:00:26.200> to<00:00:26.369> another<00:00:27.369> video

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
like to redirect you to another video

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.780 
like to redirect you to another video
that<00:00:28.180> I<00:00:28.210> had<00:00:28.540> about<00:00:29.259> effects<00:00:30.009> loop<00:00:30.189> so<00:00:30.640> this

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
that I had about effects loop so this

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.460 
that I had about effects loop so this
should<00:00:31.000> clear<00:00:31.119> up<00:00:31.239> a<00:00:31.419> few<00:00:31.450> things<00:00:31.630> but<00:00:32.320> your

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
should clear up a few things but your

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.750 
should clear up a few things but your
very<00:00:32.619> specific<00:00:32.800> in<00:00:33.130> your<00:00:33.220> question<00:00:33.550> in<00:00:33.670> the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
very specific in your question in the

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.280 
very specific in your question in the
sense<00:00:33.940> that<00:00:34.000> you<00:00:34.210> asked<00:00:34.480> how<00:00:34.690> is<00:00:34.750> it<00:00:34.870> possible

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
sense that you asked how is it possible

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.540 
sense that you asked how is it possible
that<00:00:35.350> you<00:00:35.530> have<00:00:35.680> some<00:00:35.920> pedals<00:00:36.190> bone<00:00:36.340> in<00:00:36.460> front

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
that you have some pedals bone in front

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.670 
that you have some pedals bone in front
of<00:00:36.700> the<00:00:36.790> amp<00:00:36.940> and<00:00:37.210> then<00:00:37.690> some<00:00:37.870> on<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.050> pedals

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
of the amp and then some on the pedals

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.830 
of the amp and then some on the pedals
going<00:00:38.920> into<00:00:39.130> the<00:00:39.220> loop<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:39.579> what's<00:00:40.420> that<00:00:40.660> you

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
going into the loop and what's that you

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.229 
going into the loop and what's that you
know<00:00:40.930> and<00:00:41.110> where<00:00:41.829> is<00:00:42.040> where<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.090> pedals

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
know and where is where the pedals

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.200 
know and where is where the pedals
actually<00:00:43.630> going<00:00:43.809> to<00:00:44.079> and<00:00:44.410> so<00:00:45.040> let's<00:00:45.310> clear<00:00:46.180> it

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
actually going to and so let's clear it

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.110 
actually going to and so let's clear it
up<00:00:46.420> for<00:00:46.600> you<00:00:46.810> just<00:00:46.900> really<00:00:47.470> quickly<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:48.790> main

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
up for you just really quickly the main

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.460 
up for you just really quickly the main
pedals<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.570> ones<00:00:49.750> that<00:00:49.870> are<00:00:49.960> in<00:00:50.050> front<00:00:50.260> of<00:00:50.350> the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
pedals the ones that are in front of the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.860 
pedals the ones that are in front of the
amp<00:00:50.620> just<00:00:51.370> work<00:00:51.670> as<00:00:51.880> any<00:00:52.270> other<00:00:52.480> pedal<00:00:52.780> you

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
amp just work as any other pedal you

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.930 
amp just work as any other pedal you
ever<00:00:53.050> used<00:00:53.260> independently<00:00:53.950> of<00:00:54.520> whatever<00:00:54.730> you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
ever used independently of whatever you

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.130 
ever used independently of whatever you
do<00:00:55.060> with<00:00:55.180> the<00:00:55.270> effects<00:00:55.510> loop<00:00:55.690> you<00:00:55.900> might<00:00:56.050> not

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
do with the effects loop you might not

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.810 
do with the effects loop you might not
even<00:00:56.200> have<00:00:56.440> an<00:00:56.590> effects<00:00:56.890> loop<00:00:56.950> and<00:00:57.610> you<00:00:57.670> can

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
even have an effects loop and you can

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.220 
even have an effects loop and you can
still<00:00:58.030> use<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.300> pedals<00:00:58.600> in<00:00:58.690> front<00:00:58.930> of<00:00:58.990> the<00:00:59.080> EM

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
still use the pedals in front of the EM

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.210 
still use the pedals in front of the EM
so<00:00:59.590> you<00:00:59.680> just<00:01:00.310> come<00:01:00.550> out<00:01:00.640> of<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.730> guitar<00:01:02.220> going

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
so you just come out of the guitar going

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.799 
so you just come out of the guitar going
through<00:01:03.400> your<00:01:03.550> distortion<00:01:04.420> pedal<00:01:04.689> with<00:01:04.780> your

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
through your distortion pedal with your

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.300 
through your distortion pedal with your
watt<00:01:05.049> pedal<00:01:05.379> or<00:01:05.560> whatever<00:01:05.829> it<00:01:05.950> is<00:01:06.009> that<00:01:06.070> your

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
watt pedal or whatever it is that your

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.980 
watt pedal or whatever it is that your
pipe<00:01:06.460> in<00:01:06.610> front<00:01:06.850> and<00:01:07.030> then<00:01:07.329> that<00:01:07.540> goes<00:01:07.780> into

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
pipe in front and then that goes into

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.580 
pipe in front and then that goes into
the<00:01:08.290> preamp<00:01:08.650> so<00:01:09.630> that's<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.930> same<00:01:11.079> as<00:01:11.140> always

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
the preamp so that's the same as always

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.170 
the preamp so that's the same as always
so<00:01:11.799> the<00:01:11.890> preamp<00:01:12.189> does<00:01:12.310> its<00:01:12.460> thing<00:01:12.549> raises<00:01:13.060> the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
so the preamp does its thing raises the

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.469 
so the preamp does its thing raises the
volume<00:01:13.509> of<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.750> of<00:01:14.049> the<00:01:14.710> input<00:01:14.979> level<00:01:15.280> then<00:01:16.119> it

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
volume of the of the input level then it

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.539 
volume of the of the input level then it
goes<00:01:16.630> through<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.899> EQ<00:01:17.409> of<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.770> amp<00:01:17.950> so<00:01:18.399> your

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
goes through the EQ of the amp so your

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.999 
goes through the EQ of the amp so your
bass<00:01:18.759> meter<00:01:19.090> trebles<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:20.140> so<00:01:20.289> you<00:01:20.350> you<00:01:20.560> modify

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
bass meter trebles and so you you modify

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.450 
bass meter trebles and so you you modify
the<00:01:21.069> signal<00:01:21.630> up<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.799> right<00:01:23.799> before<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.280> power

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
the signal up to right before the power

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.730 
the signal up to right before the power
amp<00:01:24.789> okay<00:01:25.270> so<00:01:25.329> the<00:01:25.749> preamp<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.319> what<00:01:26.499> kind<00:01:26.679> of

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
amp okay so the preamp is what kind of

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.080 
amp okay so the preamp is what kind of
shapes<00:01:27.009> the<00:01:27.189> sound<00:01:27.460> we're<00:01:27.759> gonna<00:01:27.909> be

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
shapes the sound we're gonna be

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.300 
shapes the sound we're gonna be
simplistic<00:01:28.929> a<00:01:29.200> little<00:01:29.380> bit<00:01:29.499> here<00:01:29.710> but<00:01:29.889> the

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
simplistic a little bit here but the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.859 
simplistic a little bit here but the
preamp<00:01:30.670> shapes<00:01:30.969> the<00:01:31.149> sound<00:01:31.389> of<00:01:31.539> your<00:01:31.659> guitar

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
preamp shapes the sound of your guitar

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.499 
preamp shapes the sound of your guitar
and<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:32.740> your<00:01:33.100> amp<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.549> your<00:01:33.850> pedals<00:01:34.149> it

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
and and your amp and your pedals it

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.090 
and and your amp and your pedals it
takes<00:01:34.749> all<00:01:34.929> that<00:01:35.139> and<00:01:35.350> then<00:01:35.469> he<00:01:35.560> has<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:35.859> send

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
takes all that and then he has to send

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.120 
takes all that and then he has to send
it<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.149> power<00:01:37.359> amp<00:01:37.659> which<00:01:38.319> also<00:01:38.619> colors

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
it to the power amp which also colors

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.709 
it to the power amp which also colors
the<00:01:39.249> sound<00:01:39.460> but<00:01:39.609> it's<00:01:39.729> not<00:01:39.880> as<00:01:39.999> drastic<00:01:40.210> as<00:01:40.569> all

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
the sound but it's not as drastic as all

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.080 
the sound but it's not as drastic as all
this<00:01:40.869> stuff<00:01:41.079> before<00:01:41.289> so<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.310> power<00:01:42.490> amp<00:01:42.759> just

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
this stuff before so the power amp just

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.760 
this stuff before so the power amp just
kind<00:01:43.420> of<00:01:43.509> raises<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.020> power<00:01:44.319> of<00:01:44.590> whatever

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
kind of raises the power of whatever

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.889 
kind of raises the power of whatever
you're<00:01:45.009> playing<00:01:45.249> and<00:01:45.569> gives<00:01:46.569> you<00:01:46.659> enough

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
you're playing and gives you enough

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.580 
you're playing and gives you enough
power<00:01:46.929> to<00:01:47.319> drive<00:01:47.649> speakers<00:01:48.130> okay<00:01:48.700> so<00:01:48.909> that's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
power to drive speakers okay so that's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.230 
power to drive speakers okay so that's
again<00:01:50.590> what<00:01:50.829> we're<00:01:51.189> being<00:01:51.340> quite<00:01:51.939> simplistic

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
again what we're being quite simplistic

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.059 
again what we're being quite simplistic
about<00:01:52.509> it<00:01:52.749> but<00:01:52.929> this<00:01:53.229> pretty<00:01:53.829> much<00:01:53.950> the

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
about it but this pretty much the

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.739 
about it but this pretty much the
division<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.670> preamp<00:01:55.090> gives<00:01:55.299> you<00:01:55.389> the<00:01:55.479> sound

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
division the preamp gives you the sound

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.690 
division the preamp gives you the sound
and<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.590> power<00:01:56.770> amp<00:01:57.039> gives<00:01:57.279> you<00:01:57.429> the<00:01:57.549> power

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
and the power amp gives you the power

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.029 
and the power amp gives you the power
alright<00:01:58.380> that's<00:01:59.380> how<00:01:59.499> it<00:01:59.679> works

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
alright that's how it works

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.010 
alright that's how it works
so<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:00.789> is<00:02:00.880> one<00:02:01.029> option<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.479> have<00:02:01.509> if<00:02:01.929> you

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
so this is one option you have if you

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.169 
so this is one option you have if you
have<00:02:02.049> an<00:02:02.259> effects<00:02:02.619> loop<00:02:02.649> in<00:02:02.889> your<00:02:02.920> amp<00:02:03.159> to<00:02:03.909> plug

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
have an effects loop in your amp to plug

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.539 
have an effects loop in your amp to plug
in<00:02:04.359> some<00:02:04.899> other<00:02:05.049> things<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:05.859> in<00:02:06.189> this<00:02:06.279> case

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
in some other things so in this case

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.249 
in some other things so in this case
that<00:02:07.299> you're<00:02:07.509> asking<00:02:07.779> you're<00:02:07.959> asking<00:02:08.229> about

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
that you're asking you're asking about

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.859 
that you're asking you're asking about
echo<00:02:08.590> pedals<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.160> reverb<00:02:09.520> pedals<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.599> those

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
echo pedals and reverb pedals so those

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.170 
echo pedals and reverb pedals so those
pedals<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.349> can<00:02:11.530> plug<00:02:11.740> in<00:02:11.920> between<00:02:12.790> the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
pedals you can plug in between the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.440 
pedals you can plug in between the
preamp<00:02:13.569> section<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.800> power<00:02:14.980> amp<00:02:15.190> section

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
preamp section and the power amp section

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.000 
preamp section and the power amp section
right<00:02:16.450> that's<00:02:16.840> what's<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.260> twirl<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.740> effect

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
right that's what's a twirl and effect

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.520 
right that's what's a twirl and effect
loop<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.910> just<00:02:19.150> lets<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:19.480> insert<00:02:20.200> things

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
loop is it just lets you insert things

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.070 
loop is it just lets you insert things
between<00:02:21.040> one<00:02:21.430> stage<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.600> other<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.960> the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
between one stage and the other of the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.500 
between one stage and the other of the
amp<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:24.010> advantage<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.700> this<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.240> talked<00:02:25.480> about

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
amp the advantage of this I talked about

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.400 
amp the advantage of this I talked about
in<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.930> other<00:02:26.020> video

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
in the other video

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.980 
in the other video
so<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.590> won't<00:02:26.740> go<00:02:26.860> over<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.040> again<00:02:27.130> just<00:02:27.640> very

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
so I won't go over it again just very

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.510 
so I won't go over it again just very
simply<00:02:28.990> usually<00:02:29.710> tends<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.040> sound<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.370> bit

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
simply usually tends to sound a bit

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.070 
simply usually tends to sound a bit
clearer<00:02:30.760> if<00:02:31.060> you're<00:02:31.270> playing<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.720> delay<00:02:32.050> or

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
clearer if you're playing a delay or

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.970 
clearer if you're playing a delay or
reverb<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:33.310> sounds<00:02:33.730> clearer<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.980> more

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
reverb it sounds clearer and more

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.530 
reverb it sounds clearer and more
defined<00:02:36.340> when<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:36.760> go<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.120> effects<00:02:37.360> loop

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
defined when you go to the effects loop

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.090 
defined when you go to the effects loop
right<00:02:37.870> before<00:02:38.290> going<00:02:38.590> through<00:02:38.920> all<00:02:38.980> the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
right before going through all the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.300 
right before going through all the
stages<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.550> distortion<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.930> once<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.830> have

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
stages of distortion so once you have

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.500 
stages of distortion so once you have
these<00:02:42.430> pedals<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.880> want<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.120> put<00:02:43.240> them<00:02:43.360> in<00:02:43.450> the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
these pedals you want to put them in the

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.090 
these pedals you want to put them in the
effects<00:02:43.720> loop<00:02:43.870> how<00:02:44.020> does<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.260> work<00:02:44.410> well<00:02:44.950> the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
effects loop how does it work well the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.630 
effects loop how does it work well the
effects<00:02:45.310> loop<00:02:45.490> as<00:02:45.670> an<00:02:46.540> input<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.620> output<00:02:47.980> what

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
effects loop as an input and output what

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.130 
effects loop as an input and output what
happens<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.270> input<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:49.960> output

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
happens is this input and this output

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.770 
happens is this input and this output
sit<00:02:50.710> between<00:02:51.310> your<00:02:52.210> preamp

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
sit between your preamp

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.440 
sit between your preamp
and<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.050> power<00:02:53.290> n<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.610> Nicol<00:02:54.940> input<00:02:55.300> and

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
and the power n so the Nicol input and

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.360 
and the power n so the Nicol input and
output<00:02:55.750> they're<00:02:55.900> called<00:02:56.200> send<00:02:56.740> and<00:02:56.980> return

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
output they're called send and return

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.280 
output they're called send and return
all<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:58.090> have<00:02:58.240> to<00:02:58.360> do<00:02:58.480> is<00:02:58.690> let's<00:02:58.960> say<00:02:59.050> you<00:02:59.140> have

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
all you have to do is let's say you have

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.840 
all you have to do is let's say you have
one<00:02:59.500> pedal<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.040> it's<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.400> delay<00:03:01.030> pedal<00:03:01.710> the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
one pedal and it's a delay pedal the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.000 
one pedal and it's a delay pedal the
return<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.270> amp<00:03:04.420> I'm<00:03:04.930> sorry<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.380> send<00:03:05.680> of

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
return of the amp I'm sorry the send of

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.150 
return of the amp I'm sorry the send of
the<00:03:06.430> amp<00:03:06.580> is<00:03:07.330> like<00:03:07.570> an<00:03:07.720> output<00:03:08.080> so<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.010> will

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
the amp is like an output so it will

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.590 
the amp is like an output so it will
send<00:03:09.460> the<00:03:09.610> signal<00:03:09.640> that<00:03:10.090> comes<00:03:10.240> from<00:03:10.510> the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
send the signal that comes from the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.110 
send the signal that comes from the
preamp<00:03:10.960> it<00:03:11.590> will<00:03:11.800> send<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.130> out<00:03:12.250> through<00:03:13.000> this

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
preamp it will send it out through this

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.540 
preamp it will send it out through this
cable<00:03:13.360> that<00:03:13.660> goes<00:03:13.690> from<00:03:13.990> the<00:03:14.170> sanjak<00:03:14.830> you<00:03:15.400> will

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
cable that goes from the sanjak you will

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.910 
cable that goes from the sanjak you will
go<00:03:15.670> into<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:15.940> input<00:03:16.210> of<00:03:16.600> your<00:03:16.810> pedal<00:03:17.200> so

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
go into the input of your pedal so

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.620 
go into the input of your pedal so
whatever<00:03:18.340> signal<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.790> have<00:03:18.970> your<00:03:19.240> preamp

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
whatever signal you have your preamp

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.680 
whatever signal you have your preamp
section<00:03:19.810> will<00:03:20.650> travel<00:03:20.890> along<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.030> cable

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
section will travel along the the cable

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.780 
section will travel along the the cable
reach<00:03:23.380> your<00:03:23.620> pedal<00:03:23.950> in<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.370> case<00:03:24.550> it's<00:03:24.700> an

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
reach your pedal in this case it's an

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.330 
reach your pedal in this case it's an
echo<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.720> echo<00:03:25.750> will<00:03:26.170> work<00:03:26.350> its<00:03:26.770> magic<00:03:26.920> and

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
echo the echo will work its magic and

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.230 
echo the echo will work its magic and
create<00:03:27.840> an<00:03:28.840> echo<00:03:29.170> and<00:03:29.770> then<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.760> output<00:03:31.209> of

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
create an echo and then the output of

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.360 
create an echo and then the output of
the<00:03:31.420> pedal<00:03:31.780> will<00:03:32.050> have<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.350> go<00:03:32.500> back<00:03:32.740> into<00:03:33.220> the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
the pedal will have to go back into the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.420 
the pedal will have to go back into the
loop<00:03:34.180> right<00:03:34.690> because<00:03:35.050> we<00:03:35.140> have<00:03:35.290> preamp<00:03:35.800> the

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
loop right because we have preamp the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.580 
loop right because we have preamp the
loop<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.300> power<00:03:37.510> amp<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:38.200> we'd<00:03:38.380> have<00:03:38.410> to

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
loop and the power amp so we'd have to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.190 
loop and the power amp so we'd have to
take<00:03:39.520> this<00:03:39.730> back<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.300> amp<00:03:40.450> so<00:03:40.600> from<00:03:41.050> the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
take this back to the amp so from the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.720 
take this back to the amp so from the
output<00:03:41.500> of<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.680> pedal<00:03:42.010> we're<00:03:42.250> going<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.580> the

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
output of the pedal we're going to the

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.140 
output of the pedal we're going to the
return<00:03:43.120> of<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:44.230> amp<00:03:44.440> and<00:03:44.800> now<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.640> signal

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
return of the amp and now the signal

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.480 
return of the amp and now the signal
goes<00:03:46.330> from<00:03:46.630> there<00:03:46.810> into<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.380> power<00:03:47.530> amp<00:03:47.770> drive

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
goes from there into the power amp drive

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.730 
goes from there into the power amp drive
your<00:03:48.640> speakers<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.420> your<00:03:50.290> set

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
your speakers and your set

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.620 
your speakers and your set
okay<00:03:51.070> so<00:03:51.130> this<00:03:51.340> is<00:03:51.490> how<00:03:51.850> it<00:03:51.970> works<00:03:52.150> that's<00:03:52.420> how

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
okay so this is how it works that's how

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.350 
okay so this is how it works that's how
you<00:03:52.990> plug<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.530> in<00:03:53.650> now<00:03:53.830> if<00:03:54.310> it's<00:03:54.490> if<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.150> really

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
you plug it in now if it's if you really

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.190 
you plug it in now if it's if you really
don't<00:03:55.510> know<00:03:55.570> what<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:55.780> is<00:03:55.840> about

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
don't know what this is about

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.380 
don't know what this is about
even<00:03:56.620> possible<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:57.550> you<00:03:57.700> RF<00:03:57.970> doesn't<00:03:58.300> have

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
even possible that you RF doesn't have

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.750 
even possible that you RF doesn't have
an<00:03:58.480> effects<00:03:58.750> loop<00:03:58.870> right<00:03:59.680> in<00:03:59.830> that<00:04:00.010> case<00:04:00.250> don't

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
an effects loop right in that case don't

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.160 
an effects loop right in that case don't
worry<00:04:00.970> too<00:04:01.120> much<00:04:01.150> about<00:04:01.300> it<00:04:01.600> you<00:04:01.810> can<00:04:01.930> still

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
worry too much about it you can still

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.830 
worry too much about it you can still
get<00:04:02.350> almost<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.280> same<00:04:03.430> sound<00:04:03.730> is<00:04:03.940> not<00:04:04.180> really

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
get almost the same sound is not really

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.020 
get almost the same sound is not really
a<00:04:04.900> stick<00:04:05.200> difference<00:04:05.620> just<00:04:06.400> place<00:04:06.700> your

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
a stick difference just place your

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.770 
a stick difference just place your
echoes<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.050> reverbs<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:10.150> front<00:04:10.450> of<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.630> amp

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
echoes and reverbs in front of the amp

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.720 
echoes and reverbs in front of the amp
maybe<00:04:11.320> if<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.770> can<00:04:11.920> give<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.100> a<00:04:12.190> bit<00:04:12.580> of<00:04:12.610> advice

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
maybe if I can give you a bit of advice

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.699 
maybe if I can give you a bit of advice
use<00:04:13.390> those<00:04:13.720> pedals<00:04:14.080> at<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.320> end<00:04:14.470> of<00:04:14.620> your

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
use those pedals at the end of your

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.949 
use those pedals at the end of your
chain<00:04:14.770> so<00:04:15.340> I<00:04:15.370> have<00:04:15.550> your<00:04:15.670> wha<00:04:15.959> your

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
chain so I have your wha your

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.990 
chain so I have your wha your
distortions<00:04:17.620> all<00:04:17.830> that<00:04:17.980> stuff<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.520> then<00:04:18.850> at

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
distortions all that stuff and then at

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.840 
distortions all that stuff and then at
the<00:04:19.090> end<00:04:19.120> put<00:04:19.690> your<00:04:20.070> delays<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:21.310> echoes<00:04:21.640> and

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
the end put your delays and echoes and

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.310 
the end put your delays and echoes and
choruses<00:04:22.360> and<00:04:22.390> stuff<00:04:22.660> like<00:04:22.780> that<00:04:22.930> okay

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
choruses and stuff like that okay

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.920 
choruses and stuff like that okay
so<00:04:23.950> that's<00:04:24.160> a<00:04:24.250> hopefully<00:04:25.120> should<00:04:25.240> clear<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:25.840> up

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
so that's a hopefully should clear it up

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.810 
so that's a hopefully should clear it up
for<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.200> a<00:04:26.230> little<00:04:26.320> bit<00:04:26.530> please<00:04:27.460> go<00:04:27.640> back<00:04:27.760> and

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
watch the effects loop video this should

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.880 
watch the effects loop video this should
have<00:04:30.160> also<00:04:30.400> quite<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.150> few<00:04:31.530> interesting<00:04:32.530> bits

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
have also quite a few interesting bits

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.860 
have also quite a few interesting bits
of<00:04:32.980> information<00:04:33.190> for<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:33.730> so<00:04:33.880> hope<00:04:34.570> you<00:04:34.690> like
