00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:11.049
 sacred is max of 92 usd with the huawei 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:15.009
 e5 776 mobile internet hotspot the device 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.789
 It can be changed and gsm and is in principle 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.310
 available 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.690
 the network operators or the dealers 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.790
 I have to order and then come 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.840
 it is also in germany on the market 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:28.090
 the device around we forward here 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.660
 symbol so a small display like us 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.719
 already know it from 57 5 331 so 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.829
 from the umts hotspot and no real 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.760
 display in the sense 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:42.850
 then we have a few keys here 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.149
 to the stick in principle , I'm on 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.780
 the side because we have a micro sd 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.429
 slot the power button and the sim 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.329
 card slot for normal standard sim 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.979
 cards on this page is nothing 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.579
 Here we have a connection for 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:03.039
 external antennas probably ts 9 den 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.250
 Micro USB connection for charging 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.770
 probably you can not do that 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.969
 connecting from the modem so use 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.719
 you can not surf it but 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.729
 only via wlan 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:16.210
 there we have the wps button for fast 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.740
 encryption here still where you have one 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.810
 lasche can do it and here it is again 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.369
 Nothing 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.740
 You can not change the battery 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.640
 how many milliampers has the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.799
 I do not know 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.030
 I guess about 3000 like 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.810
 also with the e 589 from the predecessor 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.270
 just can not turn on that 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.330
 is probably no battery in there what you can 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.420
 else say 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.810
 You can use up to ten devices with the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.730
 Connect 5776 and that 's it 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.230
 within 15 seconds ready to go 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.810
 If you turn it on in the amount of 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.390
 15 seconds you are on the internet 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.520
 besides, you can lte up to 150 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.560
 megabit in the download category 4 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.590
 use that is he is unique and 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.120
 there are only these devices 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.980
 test network are possible up to 84 megabits 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.910
 theoretically it is practical in 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.010
 Germany but not yet available 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.300
 this 84 megawatts and is also questionable 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.929
 whether that in germany on the market 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.770
 So much comes to huawei e5 76 and me 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.770
 Thank you for seeing this
