horsepower thing would've taken forever
to<00:04:01.129> get<00:04:01.219> through<00:04:01.430> those<00:04:01.579> I<00:04:02.620> have<00:04:03.620> other<00:04:03.739> uses

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
to get through those I have other uses

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.709 
to get through those I have other uses
too<00:04:04.129> when<00:04:04.430> I<00:04:04.459> cut<00:04:04.700> down<00:04:04.730> firewood<00:04:05.329> like<00:04:05.359> if<00:04:05.599> I

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:05.719 
too when I cut down firewood like if I

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:07.179 
too when I cut down firewood like if I
wanted<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:05.989> cut<00:04:06.109> down<00:04:06.230> that<00:04:06.290> V<00:04:06.680> tree<00:04:06.980> there

which is actually on the schedule to
come<00:04:08.659> down<00:04:08.870> pretty<00:04:09.079> soon<00:04:11.319> all<00:04:12.319> the<00:04:12.469> brush<00:04:12.650> at

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
come down pretty soon all the brush at

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.670 
come down pretty soon all the brush at
the<00:04:12.799> top<00:04:13.040> is<00:04:13.609> a<00:04:13.669> problem<00:04:14.150> I<00:04:14.359> have<00:04:15.230> huge<00:04:15.469> brush

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680

the top is a problem I have huge brush
piles<00:04:15.980> up<00:04:16.190> on<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.400> wood<00:04:16.549> line<00:04:16.729> that<00:04:17.419> I<00:04:17.479> need<00:04:17.660> to

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
piles up on the wood line that I need to

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.500 
piles up on the wood line that I need to
get<00:04:17.900> rid<00:04:17.989> of<00:04:18.049> well<00:04:19.150> that's<00:04:20.150> where<00:04:20.299> that<00:04:20.359> comes

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
get rid of well that's where that comes

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.600 
get rid of well that's where that comes
in<00:04:20.750> they're<00:04:21.019> gonna<00:04:21.109> all<00:04:21.289> go<00:04:21.409> through<00:04:21.560> that<00:04:21.739> and

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
in they're gonna all go through that and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.240 
in they're gonna all go through that and
I'm<00:04:22.699> gonna<00:04:22.789> have<00:04:22.970> mounds<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:23.449> mounds<00:04:23.510> of<00:04:23.780> that

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
I'm gonna have mounds and mounds of that

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.890 
I'm gonna have mounds and mounds of that
and<00:04:25.250> if<00:04:25.430> I<00:04:25.520> get<00:04:25.699> remiel<00:04:26.090> wood<00:04:26.330> chips<00:04:26.570> which<00:04:26.780> are

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
and if I get remiel wood chips which are

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.920 
and if I get remiel wood chips which are
the<00:04:26.990> wood<00:04:27.139> chips<00:04:27.349> from<00:04:27.789> growing<00:04:28.789> wood<00:04:29.000> under<00:04:29.690> 2

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
the wood chips from growing wood under 2

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.170 
the wood chips from growing wood under 2
and<00:04:30.080> 3/4<00:04:30.440> inches<00:04:30.470> diameter<00:04:30.919> I<00:04:31.099> think<00:04:31.340> remya

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
and 3/4 inches diameter I think remya

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.850 
and 3/4 inches diameter I think remya
wood<00:04:32.360> chips<00:04:32.599> are<00:04:32.750> really<00:04:32.990> really<00:04:33.409> good<00:04:33.590> for

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
wood chips are really really good for

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.260 
wood chips are really really good for
building<00:04:34.639> soil<00:04:35.440> so<00:04:36.440> I<00:04:36.800> give<00:04:37.280> that<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.460> shot<00:04:37.669> and

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
building soil so I give that a shot and

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.230 
building soil so I give that a shot and
see<00:04:38.449> if<00:04:38.630> I<00:04:38.720> can<00:04:38.870> build<00:04:39.050> some<00:04:39.199> soil<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:40.240> also

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
see if I can build some soil and also

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.749 
see if I can build some soil and also
have<00:04:41.599> wood<00:04:42.409> chips<00:04:42.590> for<00:04:42.770> pads<00:04:43.070> and<00:04:43.400> stuff<00:04:43.520> like

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
have wood chips for pads and stuff like

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.249 
have wood chips for pads and stuff like
that<00:04:43.940> for<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.150> bigger<00:04:44.389> diameter<00:04:44.570> stuff<00:04:45.050> and

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
that for the bigger diameter stuff and

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.230 
that for the bigger diameter stuff and
the<00:04:45.320> drier<00:04:45.560> stuff<00:04:45.889> I've<00:04:46.280> got<00:04:46.340> huge<00:04:46.729> piles<00:04:47.030> of

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
the drier stuff I've got huge piles of

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.879 
the drier stuff I've got huge piles of
brush<00:04:47.419> up<00:04:48.199> on<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:48.470> wood<00:04:48.650> lot<00:04:48.770> that<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:51.590> drier

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
brush up on the wood lot that the drier

was cut down a long long time ago and I

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.719 
was cut down a long long time ago and I
need<00:04:56.300> to<00:04:56.449> UM<00:04:56.780> I<00:04:57.250> need<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.340> get<00:04:58.430> rid<00:04:58.520> of<00:04:58.580> that

need to UM I need to get rid of that

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.080 
need to UM I need to get rid of that
stuff<00:04:58.970> so<00:04:59.030> that's<00:04:59.630> what's<00:05:00.349> the<00:05:00.970> purpose<00:05:01.970> of

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
stuff so that's what's the purpose of

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.420 
stuff so that's what's the purpose of
this<00:05:02.210> tool<00:05:02.479> we'll<00:05:03.409> see<00:05:03.560> how<00:05:03.710> it<00:05:03.860> works<00:05:04.009> it's<00:05:04.340> a

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
this tool we'll see how it works it's a

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.680 
this tool we'll see how it works it's a
it's<00:05:05.300> a<00:05:05.599> it's<00:05:06.139> well<00:05:06.409> thought<00:05:06.710> of<00:05:06.740> brand<00:05:07.220> it's

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
it's a it's well thought of brand it's

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.770 
it's a it's well thought of brand it's
locally<00:05:08.690> built<00:05:08.840> so<00:05:09.139> I<00:05:09.169> can<00:05:09.440> get<00:05:10.009> parts<00:05:10.280> for<00:05:10.460> it

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
locally built so I can get parts for it

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.260 
locally built so I can get parts for it
there's<00:05:11.780> resharpen<00:05:12.169> noble<00:05:12.470> knives<00:05:12.680> and<00:05:13.460> it's

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
there's resharpen noble knives and it's

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.860 
there's resharpen noble knives and it's
like<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.080> tank<00:05:15.320> so<00:05:15.860> hopefully<00:05:16.699> it<00:05:17.330> will<00:05:17.539> perform

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
like a tank so hopefully it will perform

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.820 
like a tank so hopefully it will perform
like<00:05:18.110> one<00:05:18.320> too<00:05:18.699> signing<00:05:19.699> off
