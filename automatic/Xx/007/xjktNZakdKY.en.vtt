can't think of the expression but kind

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.770 
can't think of the expression but kind
of<00:04:10.680> like<00:04:10.800> go<00:04:11.459> big<00:04:11.670> go<00:04:12.060> home<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:12.510> know<00:04:12.540> they're

all risk no reward that's what that's

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.310 
all risk no reward that's what that's
what<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.000> was<00:04:15.150> thinking<00:04:15.420> of<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.990> know<00:04:16.080> some

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
what I was thinking of you know some

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.220 
what I was thinking of you know some
games<00:04:16.530> you<00:04:16.770> might<00:04:16.950> have<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:18.230> ac-130

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
games you might have the the ac-130

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.289 
games you might have the the ac-130
juggernaut<00:04:19.830> Osprey<00:04:20.250> gunner<00:04:20.280> setup<00:04:20.850> but<00:04:21.120> you

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
juggernaut Osprey gunner setup but you

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:21.520 
juggernaut Osprey gunner setup but you
know

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
know

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.290 
know
even<00:04:22.280> going<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.490> be<00:04:22.580> able<00:04:22.730> to<00:04:22.790> get<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:23.060> first

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
even going to be able to get that first

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.570 
even going to be able to get that first
Osprey<00:04:23.750> gunner<00:04:24.050> eischeid<00:04:24.530> that<00:04:24.710> first<00:04:24.920> ac-130

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
Osprey gunner eischeid that first ac-130

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.280 
Osprey gunner eischeid that first ac-130
so<00:04:26.150> that's<00:04:26.270> why<00:04:26.420> sometimes<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.990> assault

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
so that's why sometimes the assault

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.900 
so that's why sometimes the assault
streaks<00:04:27.620> or<00:04:27.830> even<00:04:28.040> better<00:04:28.160> just<00:04:28.520> if<00:04:28.730> you<00:04:28.820> know

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
streaks or even better just if you know

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.430 
streaks or even better just if you know
even<00:04:29.300> if<00:04:29.390> you<00:04:29.450> want<00:04:29.600> to<00:04:29.660> run<00:04:29.840> them<00:04:29.990> low<00:04:30.200> it's

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
even if you want to run them low it's

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.130 
even if you want to run them low it's
it's<00:04:30.620> really<00:04:30.830> not<00:04:31.070> a<00:04:31.100> bad<00:04:31.310> thing

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
it's really not a bad thing

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.810 
it's really not a bad thing
supports<00:04:33.770> okay<00:04:34.160> but<00:04:34.400> you<00:04:34.460> know<00:04:34.550> they<00:04:34.670> don't

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
supports okay but you know they don't

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.460 
supports okay but you know they don't
really<00:04:34.940> help<00:04:35.150> you<00:04:35.360> get<00:04:35.570> kills<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.200> much

like I said this video is kind of
personal<00:05:13.280> preference<00:05:13.820> and<00:05:14.060> how<00:05:14.120> I<00:05:14.780> hold<00:05:15.200> the

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
personal preference and how I hold the

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.520 
personal preference and how I hold the
fork<00:05:15.650> ad<00:05:15.860> and<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:17.180> I<00:05:17.360> play<00:05:17.570> domination<00:05:18.290> with<00:05:18.500> a

fork ad and it I play domination with a

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.159 
fork ad and it I play domination with a
full<00:05:18.800> party<00:05:19.160> and<00:05:19.400> I<00:05:20.180> find<00:05:20.450> that<00:05:20.570> to<00:05:20.990> be<00:05:21.020> the

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
full party and I find that to be the

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.110 
full party and I find that to be the
easiest<00:05:21.710> way<00:05:21.890> you<00:05:21.980> know<00:05:22.220> when<00:05:22.970> this<00:05:23.060> game

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
easiest way you know when this game

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.060 
easiest way you know when this game
first<00:05:23.300> came<00:05:23.690> out<00:05:23.810> I<00:05:23.960> played<00:05:24.260> solo<00:05:24.560> for<00:05:24.890> a<00:05:24.950> bit

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
first came out I played solo for a bit

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.680 
first came out I played solo for a bit
and<00:05:25.280> let's<00:05:25.640> just<00:05:25.760> say<00:05:25.910> I<00:05:25.940> didn't<00:05:26.240> do<00:05:26.360> very<00:05:26.390> well

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
and let's just say I didn't do very well

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.320 
and let's just say I didn't do very well
as<00:05:26.930> I<00:05:26.960> think<00:05:27.440> about<00:05:27.620> to<00:05:28.040> KD<00:05:28.340> and<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:29.090> reason

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
as I think about to KD and the reason

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.520 
as I think about to KD and the reason
for<00:05:29.419> that<00:05:29.479> is<00:05:29.720> that<00:05:29.870> I<00:05:29.930> play<00:05:30.290> the<00:05:30.410> objective

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
for that is that I play the objective

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.000 
for that is that I play the objective
all<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.340> time<00:05:31.580> and<00:05:31.910> you<00:05:32.750> know<00:05:32.870> whenever<00:05:33.860> I

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
all the time and you know whenever I

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.620 
all the time and you know whenever I
play<00:05:34.190> domination<00:05:34.760> which<00:05:34.880> is<00:05:35.030> you<00:05:35.330> know<00:05:35.419> but

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630
