cruise<00:02:08.770> control<00:02:09.130> you<00:02:09.580> actually<00:02:09.910> depict<00:02:10.300> the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
cruise control you actually depict the

amount<00:02:10.600> of<00:02:10.690> car<00:02:10.899> lengths<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.260> want<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.530> be

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
amount of car lengths you want to be

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.440 
amount of car lengths you want to be
from<00:02:11.920> you're<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.430> driver<00:02:12.730> in<00:02:12.970> front<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.330> you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
from you're the driver in front of you

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.630 
from you're the driver in front of you
so<00:02:14.050> right<00:02:14.230> now<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:14.410> have<00:02:14.770> my<00:02:15.040> cruise<00:02:15.280> control

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
so right now I have my cruise control

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.840 
so right now I have my cruise control
set<00:02:15.880> at<00:02:15.970> about<00:02:16.180> 105<00:02:16.720> kilometers<00:02:17.350> an<00:02:17.650> hour<00:02:17.850> but

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
set at about 105 kilometers an hour but

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.090 
set at about 105 kilometers an hour but
I<00:02:18.880> want<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.240> be<00:02:19.330> two<00:02:19.570> car<00:02:19.870> lengths<00:02:20.230> behind<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
I want to be two car lengths behind the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.260 
I want to be two car lengths behind the
driver<00:02:21.370> in<00:02:21.610> front<00:02:21.850> of<00:02:21.940> me

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
driver in front of me

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.000 
driver in front of me
so<00:02:22.600> my<00:02:22.750> speed<00:02:23.020> is<00:02:23.170> actually<00:02:23.320> automatically

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
so my speed is actually automatically

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.460 
so my speed is actually automatically
adjusting<00:02:24.459> right<00:02:24.610> down<00:02:24.850> now<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.270> it's<00:02:25.630> down<00:02:26.320> to

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
adjusting right down now so it's down to

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.920 
adjusting right down now so it's down to
88<00:02:26.740> kilometres<00:02:27.280> an<00:02:27.400> hour<00:02:27.520> because<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.570> want<00:02:28.870> to

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
88 kilometres an hour because I want to

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.720 
88 kilometres an hour because I want to
keep<00:02:29.110> my<00:02:29.380> distance<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.890> two<00:02:30.070> car<00:02:30.310> lengths<00:02:30.640> away

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
keep my distance of two car lengths away

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.460 
keep my distance of two car lengths away
and<00:02:33.730> this<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:34.239> all<00:02:34.540> done<00:02:34.810> automatically

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
and this is all done automatically

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.810 
and this is all done automatically
through<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.980> adaptive<00:02:36.459> cruise<00:02:36.550> control

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
through the adaptive cruise control

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.510 
through the adaptive cruise control
system<00:02:37.360> my<00:02:38.350> foot<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:38.709> not<00:02:38.830> touching<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.310> brake

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520
