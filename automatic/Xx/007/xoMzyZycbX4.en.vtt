00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.660
 today we are going to do an experiment with a 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.280
 mini camera for that first thing that 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.009
 we do is put it in a sleeve 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.380
 submersible because if not we're not going to 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.900
 loading directly is not a go pro is 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.340
 a cheaper similar camera that's why the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.070
 quality of the images are not so 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.080
 good but good for the experiment 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.670
 it served us we have also checked in 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.380
 the specifications of the camera that 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.599
 endured at temperatures of up to 50 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.340
 degrees then what we do is a 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.320
 Once our water boils we will 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.239
 lower the temperature a little what I 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.489
 I wanted to imagine what the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.739
 kitchen within a few years there are many 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.659
 advances for example super comfortable 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.729
 continue with the google and you will see is you 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.159
 is saying the recipe you do not even have to 

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:49.799
 go reading a book in the end we do not know 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.180
 how far will the technology go and 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:53.159
 we do not know what will happen within 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.440
 years but let's imagine today how 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.790
 would be cooking with a casserole in which 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.790
 I could see what is happening 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.640
 this is the camera that we are going to use 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.020
 the island tucked into the holster and now for 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.760
 put it inside the casserole I've 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.610
 put in the typical tweezers at 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.619
 tweezers put a rubber band and so 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.049
 I'm going to leave it is in the pan in a 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.050
 side meanwhile we will prepare the 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.300
 egg we take a glass to the glass we are going to 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.000
 put some plastic 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.070
 transparent cooking in that 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.899
 hole that forms the plastic we're going to 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.180
 put an egg we will throw a little 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.130
 come out and we'll close it well let's use 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.610
 to close it a clamp but you can use 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.440
 the typical as it is said closing the 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.210
 mold bread bags or the one you want 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.210
 Well, we're not going to see it 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.299
 Well, now we have it closed. 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.189
 the moment of truth we are going to put the 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.709
 camera in the boiling water we will go down 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.329
 also a little what fire is for 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.519
 that the camera does not run out 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.780
 before time and once we have it 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.420
 in fire what we are going to do is 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.269
 introduce the egg let's change 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.129
 camera we are already in the camera that is 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.519
 inside the pot you see the little bubbles 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.859
 there goes the egg the truth is that the 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.420
 Casserole was a bit small and there is one 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.510
 quality as we see regular but you see 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.430
 How the egg is curdling would be great 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.000
 see how they all get to know each other 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.000
 foods 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.830
 If the definition were good, it would be 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.260
 great you see how it curds as nothing we are going to 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.620
 remove the camera and we will also remove 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.620
 the egg 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.670
 let's wait for it to cool and once 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.470
 that cools down a bit we can already remove the 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.470
 clip and remove it from the plastic 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.900
 what did you think about the video quality? 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.730
 It's not spectacular but it's funny 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.310
 think about how to cook and love if the 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.660
 pots had a camera but not 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.060
 was in the video to make us a 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.650
 good idea because we like the video to give 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.510
 I like it and if you still are not
