00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
pretty horrible in zombies you know of

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.110 
pretty horrible in zombies you know of
course<00:01:02.980> it's<00:01:03.160> still<00:01:03.219> you<00:01:03.609> know<00:01:03.640> pretty<00:01:03.969> good

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
course it's still you know pretty good

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.270 
course it's still you know pretty good
gun<00:01:04.449> within<00:01:04.870> the<00:01:04.930> first<00:01:05.110> 10<00:01:05.290> to<00:01:05.350> 15<00:01:05.590> rounds<00:01:05.920> but

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
gun within the first 10 to 15 rounds but

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.010 
gun within the first 10 to 15 rounds but
that<00:01:06.850> starts<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.120> become<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.390> little<00:01:07.480> you<00:01:07.930> know

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
that starts to become a little you know

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.300 
that starts to become a little you know
not<00:01:08.290> so<00:01:08.530> good<00:01:08.800> I<00:01:08.830> guess

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
not so good I guess

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.800 
not so good I guess
funny<00:01:09.760> enough<00:01:09.909> you<00:01:10.060> think<00:01:10.120> that<00:01:10.420> upgrading

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
funny enough you think that upgrading

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.090 
funny enough you think that upgrading
the<00:01:10.900> gun<00:01:11.050> to<00:01:11.200> mark<00:01:11.409> 20<00:01:11.680> would<00:01:11.770> highly

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
the gun to mark 20 would highly

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.470 
the gun to mark 20 would highly
increased<00:01:12.370> either<00:01:12.670> you<00:01:12.880> know<00:01:13.210> its<00:01:13.330> rate<00:01:13.450> of

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
increased either you know its rate of

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.360 
increased either you know its rate of
fire<00:01:13.570> or<00:01:14.050> its<00:01:14.170> damage<00:01:14.530> however<00:01:15.160> it<00:01:15.250> only

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
fire or its damage however it only

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.430 
fire or its damage however it only
increases<00:01:15.670> damage<00:01:16.090> by<00:01:16.300> 2.8<00:01:16.750> percent<00:01:16.900> every

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
increases damage by 2.8 percent every

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.990 
increases damage by 2.8 percent every
time<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:17.740> upgrade<00:01:17.920> so<00:01:18.280> just<00:01:18.610> like<00:01:18.700> every<00:01:18.880> time

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
time you upgrade so just like every time

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.370 
time you upgrade so just like every time
you<00:01:19.090> upgrade<00:01:19.210> your<00:01:19.390> gun<00:01:19.660> when<00:01:20.080> you<00:01:20.230> first

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.390 
mean it's a good gun it's a good point
builder<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.650> only<00:01:59.800> thing<00:01:59.980> that<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.190> does

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
builder the only thing that it does

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.950 
builder the only thing that it does
lacking<00:02:00.820> is<00:02:00.970> its<00:02:01.120> amount<00:02:01.360> of<00:02:01.510> ammo<00:02:01.720> capacity

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
lacking is its amount of ammo capacity

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.140 
lacking is its amount of ammo capacity
and<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:03.010> fact<00:02:03.220> that<00:02:03.280> its<00:02:03.460> damage<00:02:03.820> isn't<00:02:04.060> as

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
and the fact that its damage isn't as

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.580 
and the fact that its damage isn't as
high<00:02:04.270> as<00:02:04.330> you<00:02:04.510> would<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:04.990> know<00:02:05.050> expect<00:02:05.440> it<00:02:05.530> to

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
high as you would you know expect it to

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.750 
high as you would you know expect it to
be<00:02:05.650> but<00:02:05.800> that's<00:02:05.860> because<00:02:06.160> it's<00:02:06.430> basically

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
be but that's because it's basically

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.190 
be but that's because it's basically
just<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.090> same<00:02:07.270> damage<00:02:07.510> as<00:02:07.750> something<00:02:08.019> like<00:02:08.140> a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
just the same damage as something like a

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.979 
just the same damage as something like a
like<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.250> scar-h<00:02:09.700> from<00:02:10.000> black<00:02:10.179> ops<00:02:10.390> 2<00:02:10.599> in<00:02:10.899> the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
like the scar-h from black ops 2 in the

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.570 
like the scar-h from black ops 2 in the
box<00:02:11.230> or<00:02:11.440> something<00:02:11.709> that<00:02:12.099> was<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.370> weapon

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
box or something that was like a weapon

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.710 
box or something that was like a weapon
that<00:02:12.819> you<00:02:12.940> could<00:02:13.090> get<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.330> was<00:02:13.420> good<00:02:13.599> for

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
that you could get that was good for

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.790 
that you could get that was good for
them<00:02:13.840> first<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.110> little<00:02:14.200> while<00:02:14.379> but<00:02:14.560> after<00:02:14.620> a

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
them first a little while but after a

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.650 
them first a little while but after a
while<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.220> just<00:02:15.250> wasn't<00:02:15.640> any<00:02:15.790> good<00:02:15.910> anymore<00:02:16.120> or

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
see it actually takes a full clip and

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
see it actually takes a full clip and

I'd only end up taking about three
zombies<00:02:46.209> out<00:02:46.600> but<00:02:47.590> that's<00:02:47.680> cuz<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.010> is<00:02:48.069> hipfire

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
and keep them in mind but I do have a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.080 
and keep them in mind but I do have a
laser<00:02:50.050> sight<00:02:50.290> on<00:02:50.319> it<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:50.650> obviously<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.760> in

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
laser sight on it so obviously it is in

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.550

thing now like I said when you do

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.320 
thing now like I said when you do
upgrade<00:02:55.630> your<00:02:55.780> gun<00:02:55.930> around<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:57.330> fourth

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
upgrade you usually get yourself a

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.890 
upgrade you usually get yourself a
reticle<00:02:59.860> in<00:03:00.610> some<00:03:00.850> cases<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:01.299> can<00:03:01.390> be<00:03:01.450> an<00:03:01.569> ACOG

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
reticle in some cases it can be an ACOG

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.720 
reticle in some cases it can be an ACOG
some<00:03:02.140> cases<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.530> can<00:03:02.620> be<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.769> bearable<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:03.549> some

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019
