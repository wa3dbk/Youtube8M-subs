00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.670 

I<00:00:04.769> think<00:00:05.769> for<00:00:05.919> a<00:00:05.950> long<00:00:06.129> time<00:00:06.430> the<00:00:06.939> Bible

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
I think for a long time the Bible

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.539 
I think for a long time the Bible
overwhelmed<00:00:08.680> me<00:00:08.769> it<00:00:09.010> was<00:00:09.099> like<00:00:09.129> one<00:00:09.400> of<00:00:09.430> those

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:09.549 
overwhelmed me it was like one of those

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.730 
overwhelmed me it was like one of those
big<00:00:10.150> books<00:00:10.510> that's<00:00:10.809> dropped<00:00:11.200> on<00:00:11.349> your<00:00:11.440> desk

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
big books that's dropped on your desk

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.949 
big books that's dropped on your desk
and<00:00:12.039> you<00:00:12.340> know<00:00:12.459> like<00:00:12.910> ninth<00:00:13.209> grade<00:00:13.570> that<00:00:13.930> you

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959 
and you know like ninth grade that you

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.970 
and you know like ninth grade that you
have<00:00:14.199> to<00:00:14.379> read<00:00:14.590> and<00:00:15.449> for<00:00:16.449> me<00:00:16.630> I<00:00:16.930> think<00:00:17.199> I

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
have to read and for me I think I

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.850 
have to read and for me I think I
started<00:00:18.970> in<00:00:19.060> the<00:00:19.150> Old<00:00:19.330> Testament<00:00:19.599> and<00:00:20.410> beckon

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
started in the Old Testament and beckon

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.630 
started in the Old Testament and beckon
really<00:00:21.160> overwhelm<00:00:21.640> you<00:00:21.820> and<00:00:22.170> confuse<00:00:23.170> you<00:00:23.640> but

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
really overwhelm you and confuse you but

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.359 
really overwhelm you and confuse you but
for<00:00:24.880> me<00:00:24.940> it<00:00:25.270> was<00:00:25.390> it<00:00:26.110> wasn't<00:00:26.619> until<00:00:26.830> I<00:00:26.890> really

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
for me it was it wasn't until I really

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.150 
for me it was it wasn't until I really
started<00:00:27.660> reading<00:00:28.660> the<00:00:28.960> words<00:00:29.170> of<00:00:29.320> Christ<00:00:29.860> and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
started reading the words of Christ and

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.369 
started reading the words of Christ and
honestly<00:00:30.550> I've<00:00:31.029> been<00:00:31.300> a<00:00:31.330> believer<00:00:31.630> for<00:00:31.750> almost

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
honestly I've been a believer for almost

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.520 
honestly I've been a believer for almost
15<00:00:32.800> years<00:00:32.829> it<00:00:33.820> took<00:00:34.090> me<00:00:34.239> about<00:00:34.390> 10<00:00:34.690> years<00:00:34.899> to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
15 years it took me about 10 years to

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.880 
15 years it took me about 10 years to
really<00:00:35.770> get<00:00:36.519> into<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:36.879> Bible<00:00:37.329> and<00:00:37.539> I<00:00:38.469> think<00:00:38.800> I

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
really get into the Bible and I think I

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.619 
really get into the Bible and I think I
used<00:00:39.069> to<00:00:39.190> be<00:00:39.309> embarrassed<00:00:39.819> to<00:00:39.999> admit<00:00:40.030> that<00:00:40.269> but

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
used to be embarrassed to admit that but

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.540 
used to be embarrassed to admit that but
it's<00:00:40.929> the<00:00:41.140> truth<00:00:41.289> I<00:00:41.649> mean<00:00:41.829> for<00:00:42.039> a<00:00:42.069> long<00:00:42.249> time<00:00:42.519> I

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
it's the truth I mean for a long time I

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.450 
it's the truth I mean for a long time I
I<00:00:43.059> would<00:00:43.600> kind<00:00:43.780> of<00:00:43.960> go<00:00:44.589> to<00:00:44.649> church<00:00:44.949> and<00:00:45.190> you

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
I would kind of go to church and you

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.910 
I would kind of go to church and you
know<00:00:45.579> rely<00:00:45.879> on<00:00:46.030> whatever<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:46.659> pastor<00:00:47.409> brought

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
know rely on whatever the pastor brought

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.660 
know rely on whatever the pastor brought
to<00:00:48.069> the<00:00:48.159> table<00:00:48.309> and<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:50.350> in<00:00:50.589> my<00:00:50.769> own<00:00:50.799> private

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
to the table and but in my own private

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.569 
to the table and but in my own private
time<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.949> listen<00:00:54.219> to<00:00:54.399> God<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:56.309> don't<00:00:57.309> know<00:00:57.459> that

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
time to listen to God I don't know that

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.149 
time to listen to God I don't know that
I<00:00:57.639> knew<00:00:57.819> how<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:57.999> do<00:00:58.179> that<00:00:58.329> and<00:00:58.569> so<00:00:59.530> reading<00:01:00.039> the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
I knew how to do that and so reading the

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.669 
I knew how to do that and so reading the
Bible<00:01:00.639> to<00:01:00.909> me<00:01:01.059> has<00:01:01.299> felt<00:01:01.600> more<00:01:01.809> like<00:01:02.019> listening

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
Bible to me has felt more like listening

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.760 
Bible to me has felt more like listening
to<00:01:02.709> God<00:01:03.100> because<00:01:03.879> if<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.510> is<00:01:04.540> a<00:01:04.659> God<00:01:05.470> breathed

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
to God because if it is a God breathed

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.710 
to God because if it is a God breathed
word<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.580> God<00:01:07.090> inspired<00:01:07.890> sanctioned<00:01:08.890> word<00:01:09.720> then

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
word a God inspired sanctioned word then

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.720 
word a God inspired sanctioned word then
maybe<00:01:11.110> that's<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.500> best<00:01:11.710> way<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:11.920> hear<00:01:12.250> the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
maybe that's the best way to hear the

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.540 
maybe that's the best way to hear the
word<00:01:12.910> of<00:01:12.940> God<00:01:13.060> so<00:01:13.540> for<00:01:13.780> me<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.500> best<00:01:14.740> way<00:01:14.860> to<00:01:15.040> do

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
word of God so for me the best way to do

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.790 
word of God so for me the best way to do
that<00:01:15.580> is<00:01:15.760> to<00:01:15.940> read<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.450> red<00:01:17.080> letters<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:17.650> to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
that is to read the red letters and to

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.390 
that is to read the red letters and to
read<00:01:17.980> what<00:01:18.370> Jesus<00:01:18.670> is<00:01:18.820> saying<00:01:18.880> because<00:01:19.890> i<00:01:20.890> have

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400

that's<00:01:46.930> what<00:01:47.080> that's<00:01:47.409> why<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:47.530> think<00:01:47.800> the<00:01:47.950> Bible

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
that's what that's why I think the Bible

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.580 
that's what that's why I think the Bible
is<00:01:48.400> cool<00:01:48.670> now<00:01:48.700> because<00:01:49.330> it's<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.170> great<00:01:50.440> at

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
is cool now because it's so great at

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.149 
is cool now because it's so great at
communicating<00:01:52.080> why<00:01:53.080> we're<00:01:53.290> here<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.680> what

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
communicating why we're here and what

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.300 
communicating why we're here and what
we're<00:01:54.490> supposed<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.880> be<00:01:54.970> about<00:01:55.300> and<00:01:55.620> so<00:01:56.620> it's

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
we're supposed to be about and so it's

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.640 
we're supposed to be about and so it's
become<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:58.000> lot<00:01:58.360> easier<00:01:58.570> I<00:01:58.990> think<00:01:59.110> for<00:01:59.350> me<00:01:59.500> to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
become a lot easier I think for me to

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.800 
become a lot easier I think for me to
understand<00:02:00.190> that<00:02:00.790> I<00:02:00.820> don't<00:02:00.909> have<00:02:01.120> to<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:01.659> know

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
understand that I don't have to you know

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.780 
understand that I don't have to you know
I<00:02:02.050> don't<00:02:02.560> have<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.890> sit<00:02:03.040> down<00:02:03.159> and<00:02:03.340> read<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.610> all

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
I don't have to sit down and read it all

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.530 
I don't have to sit down and read it all
in<00:02:03.970> one<00:02:04.180> go<00:02:04.900> I<00:02:05.200> can<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.220> can<00:02:06.820> take<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.330> little
