00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello everyone the most has happened 

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:08.069
 that lately they get an error 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.309
 log in on the left side of 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.339
 net point connection and the vast majority of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.130
 the solutions wants to give rayon support 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.030
 it does not work or they do not know how to do it 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.100
 etc 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.680
 I am going to show you the error that I have 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.330
 For example, I'm going to show you how 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.210
 declare open all initiation treatment 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.129
 normal 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.129
 and this is going to take a long time 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.490
 incision drawn to be able to play it 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.230
 and after a good time 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.649
 this error comes out says connection error 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.470
 It was stable connection solution 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.170
 pp server a toner accepts to walk 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.170
 this page but the truth is that it's not 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.560
 much the solution that I can give you and that 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.450
 is going to work you yes or yes to get off at 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.360
 this program that is called silver 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.930
 gosht that makes this program camouflage them 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.619
 to your ip address so that it looks like 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.229
 you are from us germany to any 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.020
 stupid to go down because obviously but 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.280
 how to know how to manage good I'm going to 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.280
 install to tell you 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.100
 of the water 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.070
 I expected it to start 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.970
 it went a little bit but to be able 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.970
 play it 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.260
 and here all we have to do 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.799
 do is press home to activate a 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.069
 base has to wait for the end 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.829
 to connect this they are going to send some 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.629
 server of any country on the 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.400
 project and automatic action is 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.769
 perfectible automatic 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.280
 that always to change every time 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.280
 active 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.900
 germany halloween 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.900
 that always makes a different place than 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.900
 determine 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.260
 and I'm now that it's over we should 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.730
 to be able to play it or to start session that 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.730
 then they have to be something else 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.650
 LOL 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.280
 I became obsessed 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:30.050
 normal initiation but that's not all 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.050
 what does this have to be 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.900
 and so if I'm going to create a 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.900
 customized 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.630
 are the fields that give 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.860
 guide me to the battle 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.040
 once you load them and whatever a 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.040
 little thing more than I'm going to show you and 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.959
 this solution has its counter but it is not 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.380
 something very serious and it will not affect them 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.380
 everyone 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:17.260
 young man you will see that he has a 485 pin that 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.489
 that's because of the program because we're 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.930
 connected to the in my case and 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.030
 supposedly I'm connected is from 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.030
 germany then the pin soaring because 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.970
 so you do not know the ping is the amount 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.360
 of milliseconds in which you take a 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.100
 response to the server between the location 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.140
 where we are connected but it does not matter 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.800
 a lot is going to be fixed and we're already there 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.780
 inside what 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.990
 so that we are inside we are going to have a 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.419
 very tall pine in our case we have 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.250
 to come back to our program 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.250
 we have to disable 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.600
 connecting back to continue regulating 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.180
 the connection 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.169
 I know normal 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:06.139
 here ends the renewing connection of 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.550
 love a little 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.550
 and so much 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:20.470
 and 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.470
 and this we have that is normal how to play 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.259
 and buy everything 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.610
 and ready 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.409
 and now I'm going to follow that it's material 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.369
 this works 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.369
 now the bad 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.660
 that every time you play with this method 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.880
 when you leave to go back out this 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.190
 error 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.190
 and you have to close it 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.509
 to this egg program to go back 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.000
 initiation to a normal game are not going to 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:58.060
 can see statistics and so on 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.689
 etc. etcetera but the important thing is 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.789
 that we can play it 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:05.249
 but I'm going to ask to ask and nothing because 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:09.799
 the first videos I do does the same 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:09.799
 I hope I helped you see you
