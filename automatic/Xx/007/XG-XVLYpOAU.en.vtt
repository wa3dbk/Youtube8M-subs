00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.150
 hi how are you doing in the previous video 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.900
 we ready our almost ready 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.500
 our hexagon this is here in these 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.130
 corners is where we will work equally 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.080
 three solid chains and massifs and here in 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.130
 we're going to do nothing else groups of 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.420
 three massifs we will go sliding 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:32.330
 the thread like this 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.330
 and here we are going to start let's do 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.230
 massifs 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.030
 two chains 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.890
 three beds 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.410
 we are not going to make separation between groups 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.410
 and group we go here 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.180
 make three beds 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.159
 we continue on the corner we are going to do 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.030
 three and three 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.030
 one goes 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.890
 two 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.860
 two separation chains 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.730
 Bah 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.730
 again 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.909
 two beds 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.860
 3 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.410
 and we go here in the middle 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.410
 make only a group of three born 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.890
 two 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.900
 we go to the corner 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.140
 we do it again 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.150
 two groups of three 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.730
 two 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.730
 three massifs two separation chains 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.350
 it's going to be as big as you want 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.180
 and they are going to have to calculate the size 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.730
 compared to half the baby 's body 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.010
 because when a hex is left right now, 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.840
 I'm going to say how they arrange it so that 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.350
 go calculating that there they are left 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.350
 exact 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.370
 two separation chains 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.540
 Now I teach them well how it is going 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.540
 the shape 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.690
 we continue two chains of separation 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.570
 I hope they can subscribe to our 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:20.430
 channel and also if you have questions or 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:26.180
 you can enter facebook weaving 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.180
 mejico there we clarify all your doubts 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.209
 continue like this 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.010
 two or three massifs two chains of 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.269
 separation 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.269
 three beds 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.740
 Romans 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.820
 here is missing the last group that goes alone 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.820
 three beds 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:15.790
 and let's join in the third chain 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:20.280
 of the first massif 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.280
 we see how it goes ok 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.000
 in video 3 I'm going to tell you how 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.850
 continue let's do 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.580
 where are corners let's double and 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.340
 where it's even we're going to do here a 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.860
 group of three clumps and here another group 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.250
 of three so we're going to go to take 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.250
 shape
