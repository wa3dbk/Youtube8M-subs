operator and I've developed the axle
vest<00:00:04.500> for<00:00:05.040> tiffin<00:00:05.400> Steadicam<00:00:05.970> X<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:07.020> s<00:00:07.170> is

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
vest for tiffin Steadicam X of s is

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.930 
vest for tiffin Steadicam X of s is
different<00:00:07.859> from<00:00:08.010> other<00:00:08.220> vests<00:00:08.639> in<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.849> way

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
different from other vests in the way

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.879 
different from other vests in the way
that<00:00:09.150> it<00:00:09.269> deals<00:00:09.480> with<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.809> load<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.380> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
that it deals with the load and the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.799 
that it deals with the load and the
torque<00:00:11.190> going<00:00:11.460> into<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.880> body<00:00:12.090> for<00:00:12.780> example

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
torque going into the body for example

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.950 
torque going into the body for example
the<00:00:13.679> load<00:00:13.920> goes<00:00:14.190> into<00:00:14.460> four<00:00:14.700> places<00:00:15.059> via<00:00:15.750> these

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
the load goes into four places via these

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.650 
the load goes into four places via these
four<00:00:16.260> piles<00:00:16.560> here<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.369> correspond<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.240> where

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
four piles here that correspond to where

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.870 
four piles here that correspond to where
the<00:00:18.750> pelvic<00:00:19.109> bones<00:00:19.350> rise<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.250> surface<00:00:20.460> so

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the pelvic bones rise to the surface so

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.840 
the pelvic bones rise to the surface so
there's<00:00:21.810> no<00:00:21.960> pressure<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> abdomen

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
there's no pressure on the abdomen

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.920 
there's no pressure on the abdomen
there's<00:00:23.850> no<00:00:23.970> pressure<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.480> base<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
there's no pressure on the base of the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.779 
there's no pressure on the base of the
spine<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.470> also<00:00:26.010> there's<00:00:26.189> no<00:00:26.340> pressure<00:00:26.580> on

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
spine and also there's no pressure on

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.060 
spine and also there's no pressure on
the<00:00:26.910> sides<00:00:27.240> where<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> gluteus<00:00:28.590> muscles

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the sides where the gluteus muscles

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.060 
the sides where the gluteus muscles
attached<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.210> iliac<00:00:30.570> crest<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.590> it's

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
attached to the iliac crest so it's

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.290 
attached to the iliac crest so it's
putting<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.369> weight<00:00:32.579> into<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> right<00:00:32.940> places

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
putting the weight into the right places

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.229 
putting the weight into the right places
it's<00:00:33.960> also<00:00:34.140> putting<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.559> torque<00:00:35.040> into<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> very

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
it's also putting the torque into a very

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.750 
it's also putting the torque into a very
high<00:00:36.450> spot<00:00:36.840> instead<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.800> having<00:00:38.040> chest<00:00:38.370> straps

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
high spot instead of having chest straps

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.880 
high spot instead of having chest straps
that<00:00:39.000> come<00:00:39.180> around<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.780> level<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.350> put

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
that come around in this level and put

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.760 
that come around in this level and put
the<00:00:41.010> torque<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.610> at<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> low<00:00:42.059> level<00:00:42.290> this<00:00:43.290> raises

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the torque in at a low level this raises

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.190 
the torque in at a low level this raises
the<00:00:43.950> torque<00:00:44.250> lever<00:00:44.670> arm<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.510> very<00:00:45.750> high<00:00:45.989> up

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the torque lever arm to very high up

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.260 
the torque lever arm to very high up
between<00:00:46.469> your<00:00:46.680> shoulder<00:00:47.039> blades<00:00:47.120> which<00:00:48.120> is

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
between your shoulder blades which is

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.940 
between your shoulder blades which is
the<00:00:48.390> same<00:00:48.600> place<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.840> your<00:00:49.170> body<00:00:49.350> resists

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the same place that your body resists

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.260 
the same place that your body resists
torque<00:00:50.250> when<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.520> pick<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.789> something<00:00:51.180> in

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
torque when you pick up something in

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.799 
torque when you pick up something in
your<00:00:51.390> arms

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
your arms

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.630 
your arms
it's<00:00:52.260> resisted<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> level<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
it's resisted at the level of the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.310 
it's resisted at the level of the
shoulder<00:00:54.000> blades<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> much

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
shoulder blades so you have a much

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.160 
shoulder blades so you have a much
longer<00:00:55.739> lever<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.300> grabbing<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.930> hammer

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
longer lever it's like grabbing a hammer

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.869 
longer lever it's like grabbing a hammer
at<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> very<00:00:58.949> top<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.340> pull<00:00:59.520> out<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> nail

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
at the very top to pull out a nail

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.789 
at the very top to pull out a nail
instead<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.329> halfway<00:01:00.570> done<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:03.470> I'll<00:01:04.470> stick

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
instead of halfway done so I'll stick

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.640 
instead of halfway done so I'll stick
the<00:01:04.890> vest<00:01:05.129> on

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
the vest on

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.350 
the vest on
you'll<00:01:07.310> see<00:01:07.490> how<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:07.700> goes<00:01:09.940> gage<00:01:10.940> is<00:01:10.970> here<00:01:11.300> at

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
you'll see how it goes gage is here at

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.790 
you'll see how it goes gage is here at
the<00:01:11.450> waist<00:01:11.920> know<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:14.600> Festa<00:01:14.960> also<00:01:15.290> has<00:01:15.500> a<00:01:15.530> lot

the waist know the Festa also has a lot
of<00:01:15.830> room<00:01:16.280> up<00:01:16.670> front<00:01:17.150> so<00:01:17.690> that<00:01:17.840> if<00:01:17.960> I<00:01:18.050> have<00:01:18.170> to

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
of room up front so that if I have to

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.490 
of room up front so that if I have to
stand<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.620> running<00:01:18.950> shot<00:01:19.960> I've<00:01:20.960> got<00:01:21.200> plenty<00:01:21.350> of

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
stand a running shot I've got plenty of

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.330 
stand a running shot I've got plenty of
room<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:21.710> breathe

I've<00:01:22.910> got<00:01:23.090> no<00:01:23.240> restriction<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.020> that's<00:01:24.350> not

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
I've got no restriction and that's not

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.860 
I've got no restriction and that's not
going<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:24.860> influence<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.790> shot<00:01:26.120> now<00:01:26.810> the

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
going to influence the shot now the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.330 
going to influence the shot now the
other<00:01:27.080> great<00:01:27.320> thing<00:01:27.500> about<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.770> vest<00:01:27.980> is<00:01:28.190> it

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
other great thing about the vest is it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.260 
other great thing about the vest is it
it<00:01:28.460> has<00:01:28.490> pivots<00:01:29.380> here<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.680> here<00:01:31.100> which<00:01:31.970> is<00:01:32.120> at

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
it has pivots here and here which is at

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.540 
it has pivots here and here which is at
the<00:01:32.390> same<00:01:32.630> level<00:01:32.690> that<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.590> pelvis<00:01:34.010> pivots<00:01:34.400> so

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
the same level that the pelvis pivots so

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.820 
the same level that the pelvis pivots so
when<00:01:34.790> you<00:01:34.940> walk<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:36.080> do<00:01:36.260> not<00:01:36.470> have<00:01:36.680> to

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
when you walk you do not have to

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.100 
when you walk you do not have to
maintain<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.610> level<00:01:37.880> pelvis<00:01:38.540> like<00:01:38.690> you<00:01:38.869> would

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
maintain a level pelvis like you would

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.980 
maintain a level pelvis like you would
with<00:01:39.590> most<00:01:39.890> Steadicam<00:01:40.340> vests<00:01:40.790> with<00:01:41.510> this<00:01:41.690> vest

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
with most Steadicam vests with this vest

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.930 
with most Steadicam vests with this vest
you<00:01:42.530> just<00:01:42.770> let<00:01:42.890> your<00:01:43.010> pelvis<00:01:43.460> move<00:01:43.670> naturally

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
you just let your pelvis move naturally

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.580 
you just let your pelvis move naturally
and<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:46.130> vest<00:01:46.369> moves<00:01:46.760> with<00:01:47.270> your<00:01:47.479> pelvis<00:01:47.960> that

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
and the vest moves with your pelvis that

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.250 
and the vest moves with your pelvis that

situation when one hand is higher much

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.100 
situation when one hand is higher much
higher<00:02:10.580> than<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.030> other<00:02:11.180> then<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:11.930> don't

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
higher than the other then you don't

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.600 
higher than the other then you don't
have<00:02:12.230> all<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.650> weight<00:02:12.769> on<00:02:12.920> one<00:02:12.950> shoulder<00:02:13.340> that

have all the weight on one shoulder that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.259 
have all the weight on one shoulder that
the<00:02:13.790> weight<00:02:14.330> is<00:02:14.480> equally<00:02:15.290> placed<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:17.150> that's

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
the weight is equally placed so that's

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.729 
the weight is equally placed so that's
