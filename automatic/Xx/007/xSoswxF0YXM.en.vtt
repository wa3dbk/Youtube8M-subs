time I'm just looking for color on all

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.770 
time I'm just looking for color on all

sides with that color comes flavor so
once<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.020> do<00:03:19.080> all<00:03:19.350> four<00:03:19.620> sides<00:03:19.860> I'm<00:03:20.310> gonna<00:03:20.430> put

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
once I do all four sides I'm gonna put

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.430 
once I do all four sides I'm gonna put
it<00:03:20.700> in<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.820> different<00:03:20.970> pan<00:03:21.300> add<00:03:21.930> some<00:03:22.200> water

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
it in a different pan add some water

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.680 
it in a different pan add some water
some<00:03:22.710> sauce<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.310> go<00:03:23.940> ahead<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.300> cook<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.570> off

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
some sauce and go ahead and cook it off

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.090 
some sauce and go ahead and cook it off
so<00:03:25.200> I'm<00:03:25.290> going<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.470> go<00:03:25.530> ahead<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.800> caramelize

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
so I'm going to go ahead and caramelize

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.280 
so I'm going to go ahead and caramelize
all<00:03:26.310> four<00:03:26.520> sides<00:03:26.700> right<00:03:26.850> now<00:03:26.910> so<00:03:27.750> as<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.140> can

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
all four sides right now so as you can

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.740 
all four sides right now so as you can
see<00:03:28.350> it's<00:03:28.740> nicely<00:03:29.010> sear<00:03:29.550> on<00:03:29.700> all<00:03:29.880> sides<00:03:30.300> I

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
see it's nicely sear on all sides I

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.210 
see it's nicely sear on all sides I
really<00:03:31.170> didn't<00:03:31.320> take<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.620> long<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:32.010> first

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
really didn't take that long the first

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.100 
really didn't take that long the first
side<00:03:32.460> took<00:03:32.610> about<00:03:32.820> two<00:03:33.090> minutes<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:34.020> then

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
side took about two minutes and then

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.750 
side took about two minutes and then
about<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.350> minute<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.710> half<00:03:34.740> and<00:03:35.220> these

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
about a minute and a half and these

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.120 
about a minute and a half and these
sides<00:03:36.030> maybe<00:03:36.330> 20-30<00:03:37.230> seconds<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:37.830> it's<00:03:37.950> nicely

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
sides maybe 20-30 seconds so it's nicely

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.430 
sides maybe 20-30 seconds so it's nicely
caramelized<00:03:38.750> I'm<00:03:39.750> gonna<00:03:39.930> go<00:03:40.020> ahead<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.290> take

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440
