00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.869 
but obviously the food isn't bad
especially<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:16.829> it's<00:02:16.980> canned<00:02:17.310> or<00:02:17.489> in<00:02:17.579> mylar

concern that I have with what using five
gallon<00:04:49.699> buckets<00:04:50.030> is<00:04:50.770> once<00:04:51.770> you've<00:04:52.009> you<00:04:52.550> know

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
gallon buckets is once you've you know

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.820 
gallon buckets is once you've you know
you<00:04:52.729> put<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.449> lid<00:04:53.629> on<00:04:53.810> it<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.289> it's<00:04:54.620> gonna<00:04:54.740> be

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
you put the lid on it and it's gonna be

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.969 
you put the lid on it and it's gonna be
airtight<00:04:55.750> so<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:56.810> should<00:04:57.050> be<00:04:57.169> good<00:04:57.319> and<00:04:57.530> these

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
airtight so you should be good and these

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.589 
airtight so you should be good and these
are<00:04:58.159> thick<00:04:58.400> food<00:04:58.789> grade<00:04:59.030> buckets<00:04:59.389> so<00:04:59.539> you

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
are thick food grade buckets so you

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.240 
are thick food grade buckets so you
shouldn't<00:04:59.870> have<00:04:59.960> to<00:05:00.020> worry<00:05:00.169> about<00:05:00.349> bugs<00:05:01.009> if

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
shouldn't have to worry about bugs if

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.279 
shouldn't have to worry about bugs if
you've<00:05:01.370> got<00:05:01.520> them<00:05:01.610> stored<00:05:01.849> in<00:05:01.969> the<00:05:02.030> house<00:05:02.289> but

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
you've got them stored in the house but

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:04.659 
you've got them stored in the house but
once<00:05:03.500> you<00:05:03.650> open<00:05:03.680> it<00:05:03.979> up<00:05:04.129> and<00:05:04.310> if<00:05:04.370> you<00:05:04.490> could

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
once you open it up and if you could

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.270 
once you open it up and if you could
just<00:05:04.849> open<00:05:05.240> you<00:05:05.810> know<00:05:05.930> wheat<00:05:06.199> or<00:05:06.500> flour<00:05:06.530> or

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
just open you know wheat or flour or

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.540 
just open you know wheat or flour or
sugar<00:05:07.340> in<00:05:07.940> here<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:09.020> you're<00:05:09.740> having<00:05:09.949> to<00:05:10.159> seal

sugar in here and you're having to seal

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.969 
sugar in here and you're having to seal
it<00:05:10.699> every<00:05:10.909> time<00:05:11.120> it's<00:05:11.360> a<00:05:11.509> it's<00:05:11.780> a<00:05:11.960> real<00:05:12.169> drag<00:05:12.590> to

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
it every time it's a it's a real drag to

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.180 
it every time it's a it's a real drag to
have<00:05:13.190> to<00:05:13.490> pry<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:14.599> lid<00:05:14.930> off<00:05:15.110> every<00:05:15.440> time<00:05:15.620> so

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
have to pry that lid off every time so

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.459
