00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 45 years ago, the takemura family lives 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.649
 flower production 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.599
 the passion that began with his sat on 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.759
 late 60's 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.150
 in fact it has become a great 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.310
 business that is now managed by 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.300
 son if a thing that is in the blood I 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:26.400
 I think it's a culture that is 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.590
 involving the whole family and there is already a good 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.220
 time will start with this for over 40 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.289
 years 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.079
 and all this here great future future 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.050
 Well, you can not start there. 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.629
 there we entered the diversification of 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.050
 small property of 5 hectares houses 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.390
 15 greenhouses and flowers of various types 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.360
 but the very same is the production of 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.640
 chrysanthemums and desert rose this 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.100
 last species is one of the passions of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.800
 sandro takemura who researched during 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.980
 two years until the beginning of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.949
 plant that is single rustic and blooms 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.100
 basically the whole year except for the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.710
 periods of intense cold for more or 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.869
 At least two years I just studied that 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:16.380
 plant only studied is the tract cultivation 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:20.759
 climate temperature substrate as 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.340
 produce is a bit like 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.009
 market rose production of 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.500
 desert started six years ago 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.140
 today the plants are sold for the whole 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.119
 brazil especially in fairs and 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.000
 agricultural expositions 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.659
 prices vary according to the age 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.479
 coloration and the shape of the flower to 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.329
 from 5 reais and adult plants 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.700
 between one thousand and two thousand reais 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.799
 plants that the producer does not 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.250
 sells for no price 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.460
 these are part of his collection are 10 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.820
 a thousand desert roses between the ages of 15 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.219
 and 30 years old was in the warta district in 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.700
 London we found one of the largest 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.459
 brazil producers of desert rose 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.679
 here sandro takemura grows 150 thousand 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.020
 changes of the species that despite being 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.310
 native of the desert areas of western 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.920
 africa and peninsular 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.989
 the season ended up adapting to the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.060
 northern region of ParanÃ¡ to 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.360
 improvement of takemura plants 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.910
 uses multiplication techniques with 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.760
 artificial pollination, for example the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.450
 producer obtains new varieties with 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.569
 colors sizes and different formats 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.730
 already grafted it is possible to make copies 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.459
 of selected plants 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.120
 in addition there is a year producer of flowers 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.580
 aims to multiply by many rare 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.010
 of cloning so he sought a partnership 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.180
 with the state university of londrina 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.760
 one of the goals of this partnership is up 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.980
 plants that are different because the 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.200
 flower market always seeks what it is 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.510
 different and how it has some 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.239
 variations on the flower some that are 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.260
 yellow or even with sizes 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.930
 larger 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.790
 there is interest in cloning and how 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.810
 After all, we have a 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.400
 cloning 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.010
 we are developing 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.070
 protocols to multiply these 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.840
 Rare plants in large quantity 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.060
 If you leave home, you're charmed by 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.299
 this rare beauty flower and want to learn 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.120
 to grow her the wife of sandro rita 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.430
 takemura explains what care the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.250
 plant requires water is the only thing that 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.180
 You can mark this plant so I always 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.690
 I say so is soft well but with little 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.389
 frequency then goes a lot of common sense 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.519
 that old old idea of 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:52.019
 put your hand on earth the earth also 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.639
 dry wets if not not and nutrient 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.010
 so sometimes the person buys a 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.650
 of a producer and always speaks to the 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.590
 My people bought my plant, I bought it beautiful and never 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.620
 But I bloom because because you have to 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.569
 besides being careful to remember that 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.639
 she needs nutrients then 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.889
 when to throw a fertilizer that you 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.790
 you find in any 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:16.019
 floriculture and the sun the sun is fundamental 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.750
 so much that the first thing that people 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.010
 Speak to people, do not be afraid to leave. 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.010
 this plant in full sun
