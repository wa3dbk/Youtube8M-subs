00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello friends with you kind of raslov and we 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.830
 continue to look for me home in everything 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.110
 azerote 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.240
 the first place I watched it 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.009
 Dalaran is that I would like for a long time 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.550
 settle but unfortunately how much am i not 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.720
 ran how many did not fly how many not 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.100
 spent time in this glorious capital 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.400
 of course here from the tavern you can 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.609
 spend the night, you can spend the night right here 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.890
 so on the street on the pavement but the houses here 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.160
 residential I did not find and just buy here 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.600
 nothing so dalaran disappears however 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.829
 the following place was recommended to me 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.100
 jade forest 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.140
 great beautiful big house i don't know 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.050
 What kind of town hall I do not know what to call 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.219
 such Podgorensky house inside some 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.649
 strange drugs but worth enough 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.510
 expensive but very near there is a house 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.629
 Cheaper looked less expensive 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.180
 epic but its owners seem 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.120
 a bit general this house is already definitely not 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.070
 but need a domain or that no 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.300
 they left 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.500
 the next place is the tavern which is me 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.510
 I very much would like it 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.519
 settle down because it looks easy 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.119
 fine naturally need to bring 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.939
 the order 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.520
 although the beds are generally pretty but also 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.260
 the permanent inhabitants of this place 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.600
 will have to kick out but unfortunately it 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.310
 the place is not for sale but to become 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.210
 the owner of the tavern will have to marry here 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.770
 on this female 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.320
 Another cool place is in 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.530
 Kostroma joules not far from 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.049
 angler camps and really beautiful 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.509
 nice air but it's high enough 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.970
 and I'm afraid that many of my pets here 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.939
 just won't get however kind of very 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.070
 epic beautiful but calm again 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.689
 but here's a problem to deliver here 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.970
 the mammoth will need the help of several 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.840
 experienced magicians and it will cost not 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.880
 very cheap ok all for today 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.970
 perhaps rest in my favorite tavern in 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.860
 tent type I listen to an excellent group and in 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.670
 The next issue will continue the adventure and 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.670
 finding an apartment
