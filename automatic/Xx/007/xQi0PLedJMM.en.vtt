I'm just going to be talking about why I

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.750 
I'm just going to be talking about why I
think<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.570> theory<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.500> bad<00:00:56.039> idea<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.579> change

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
think in theory is a bad idea to change

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.330 
think in theory is a bad idea to change
this<00:00:57.000> sin<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.780> will<00:00:58.140> link<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> changes<00:00:59.129> in

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
this sin but I will link the changes in

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.529 
this sin but I will link the changes in
the<00:00:59.430> description<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.239> want<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> read

the description so if you want to read

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.569 
the description so if you want to read
them<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:00.809> me<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.289> yourself<00:01:01.440> that's<00:01:02.370> why

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
them for me for yourself that's why

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.609 
them for me for yourself that's why
they'll<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.910> summarized<00:01:03.840> reasoning<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.439> why

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
they'll be summarized reasoning for why

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.170 
they'll be summarized reasoning for why
they<00:01:04.799> wanted<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> change<00:01:05.519> these<00:01:05.670> sinners<00:01:06.060> that

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
they wanted to change these sinners that

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.149 
they wanted to change these sinners that
they<00:01:06.330> feel<00:01:06.600> he<00:01:07.110> has<00:01:07.260> too<00:01:07.439> much<00:01:07.530> power<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
they feel he has too much power in the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.620 
they feel he has too much power in the
early<00:01:08.310> game<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.670> he<00:01:08.850> has<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> ability<00:01:09.240> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
early game and he has the ability to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.929 
early game and he has the ability to
really<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.470> stomp<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.860> game<00:01:11.040> by<00:01:11.280> himself<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
really to stomp a game by himself and

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.539 
really to stomp a game by himself and
then<00:01:12.540> he<00:01:12.810> falls<00:01:13.020> off<00:01:13.260> too<00:01:13.500> hard<00:01:13.770> later<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.310> now

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
then he falls off too hard later on now

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.700 
then he falls off too hard later on now
kind<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.909> thing<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.270> theory<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.320> isn't

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
kind of thing in theory this isn't

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.890 
kind of thing in theory this isn't
necessarily<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.549> bad<00:01:17.700> idea<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.450> mean<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> don't

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
necessarily a bad idea I mean you don't

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.440 
necessarily a bad idea I mean you don't
want<00:01:19.140> someone<00:01:19.439> being<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.520> know<00:01:20.610> I'm<00:01:20.820> counter

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
want someone being you know I'm counter

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.359 
want someone being you know I'm counter
ibly<00:01:21.720> stronger<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.439> saves<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.950> game<00:01:23.130> and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
ibly stronger one saves of the game and

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.010 
ibly stronger one saves of the game and
then<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.700> being<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.119> know<00:01:24.150> useless<00:01:24.840> in

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
then just being you know useless in

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.320 
then just being you know useless in
comparison<00:01:25.650> later<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.850> don't<00:01:26.939> really

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
comparison later on but I don't really

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.359 
comparison later on but I don't really
think<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:28.110> firstly<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.860> don't<00:01:29.040> really<00:01:29.220> think

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
think that firstly I don't really think

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.100 
think that firstly I don't really think
that<00:01:29.460> that's<00:01:29.610> necessarily<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> case<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that that's necessarily the case and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.170 
that that's necessarily the case and
secondly<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> don't<00:01:32.430> necessarily<00:01:32.549> feel<00:01:33.060> like

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
secondly I don't necessarily feel like

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.270 
secondly I don't necessarily feel like
this<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.479> even<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.049> bad<00:01:34.350> thing<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.890> think<00:01:35.130> that'd

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
this is even a bad thing I think that'd

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.700 
this is even a bad thing I think that'd
be<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:36.180> know<00:01:36.270> issues<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.110> riot<00:01:37.380> have

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710

they're<00:01:40.500> doing<00:01:40.740> these<00:01:40.860> changes<00:01:41.310> aren't<00:01:41.549> even

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
they're doing these changes aren't even

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.789 
they're doing these changes aren't even
really<00:01:42.090> issues<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.689> all<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.110> my<00:01:43.259> opinion<00:01:43.649> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
really issues at all in my opinion I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.280 
really issues at all in my opinion I
think<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.399> fair<00:01:44.670> way<00:01:44.909> for<00:01:45.540> Leeson<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.110> be

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
think it's a fair way for Leeson to be

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.440 
think it's a fair way for Leeson to be
to<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.890> constructed<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.610> think<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.850> think<00:01:48.299> that's

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
to be constructed I think I think that's

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.969 
to be constructed I think I think that's
fine<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.899> fact<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.229> someone<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.530> very<00:01:49.770> good

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
fine the fact that someone is very good

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.490 
fine the fact that someone is very good
early<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.579> then<00:01:51.090> weaker<00:01:51.689> later<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.290> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
early on and then weaker later on and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.440 
early on and then weaker later on and
for<00:01:53.220> most<00:01:53.430> players<00:01:53.759> as<00:01:54.000> well

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
for most players as well

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.660 
for most players as well

one of the high school caps in the game
I'll<00:01:58.380> everybody<00:01:58.710> think<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.189> can

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
I'll everybody think that you can

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.679 
I'll everybody think that you can
disagree<00:01:59.729> with<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.090> not<00:02:00.270> I've<00:02:00.329> seen<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.600> few

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
disagree with it I'm not I've seen a few

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.090 
disagree with it I'm not I've seen a few
comments<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.079> my<00:02:01.170> videos<00:02:01.439> where<00:02:01.649> people<00:02:01.680> say

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
comments on my videos where people say

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.740 
comments on my videos where people say
you<00:02:02.159> know<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.640> don't<00:02:03.119> think<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.360> sends<00:02:03.570> that

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
you know I don't think this sends that

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.510 
you know I don't think this sends that
hard<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:04.770> quite<00:02:04.890> easy<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.280> play

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
hard I think it's quite easy to play

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.370 
hard I think it's quite easy to play
actually<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.110> disagree

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
actually and I just have to disagree

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.800 
actually and I just have to disagree
with<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.740> because<00:02:07.979> if<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.239> think<00:02:09.450> listen<00:02:09.720> is

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
with that because if you think listen is

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.610 
with that because if you think listen is
easy<00:02:10.020> then<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.590> must<00:02:10.860> think<00:02:10.979> everywhere

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
easy then you must think everywhere

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.410 
easy then you must think everywhere
the<00:02:11.920> game<00:02:12.099> is<00:02:12.220> easy<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.580> mean<00:02:12.790> fair<00:02:13.060> enough<00:02:13.269> you

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
the game is easy I mean fair enough you

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.729 
the game is easy I mean fair enough you
don't<00:02:13.540> find<00:02:13.750> these<00:02:13.870> in<00:02:14.049> hard<00:02:14.290> but<00:02:14.500> then<00:02:14.620> you

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
don't find these in hard but then you

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.440 
don't find these in hard but then you
can't<00:02:15.040> find<00:02:15.220> anyone<00:02:15.580> else<00:02:15.730> hard<00:02:15.970> either<00:02:16.269> in

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
can't find anyone else hard either in

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.259 
can't find anyone else hard either in
the<00:02:16.540> game<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.989> I<00:02:17.950> mean<00:02:18.640> if<00:02:18.790> that's<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.090> case

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
the game and I mean if that's the case

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.610 
the game and I mean if that's the case
and<00:02:19.510> just<00:02:19.659> look<00:02:19.780> at<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:19.930> comparatively

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
and just look at it comparatively

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.009 
and just look at it comparatively
comparatively<00:02:21.580> Leeson<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.269> a<00:02:22.299> hard<00:02:22.629> champion

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
comparatively Leeson is a hard champion

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.530 
comparatively Leeson is a hard champion
to<00:02:23.140> play<00:02:23.319> so<00:02:24.250> for<00:02:24.640> most<00:02:24.849> players<00:02:25.090> they<00:02:25.360> won't

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
to play so for most players they won't

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.300 
to play so for most players they won't
even<00:02:25.840> really<00:02:26.080> be<00:02:26.319> at<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.590> point<00:02:26.920> where<00:02:27.190> they

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
even really be at the point where they

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.430 
even really be at the point where they
can<00:02:27.519> stomp<00:02:28.030> those<00:02:28.269> early<00:02:28.720> games<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:29.110> mean<00:02:29.230> only

into<00:03:05.560> mastering<00:03:06.159> him<00:03:06.370> all<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.269> hard<00:03:07.540> work

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
into mastering him all of that hard work

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.899 
into mastering him all of that hard work
is<00:03:07.840> being<00:03:07.989> paid<00:03:08.290> off<00:03:08.500> by<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.099> being<00:03:09.489> able<00:03:09.700> to

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
is being paid off by you being able to

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.380 
is being paid off by you being able to
stomp<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.750> dominate<00:03:11.319> that<00:03:11.980> early<00:03:12.370> game<00:03:12.579> and<00:03:12.760> I

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
stomp and dominate that early game and I

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.970 
stomp and dominate that early game and I
think<00:03:13.599> it's<00:03:13.720> only<00:03:13.870> fair<00:03:14.230> that<00:03:14.440> he<00:03:14.560> falls<00:03:14.829> off<00:03:14.920> a

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
think it's only fair that he falls off a

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.650 
think it's only fair that he falls off a
really<00:03:15.220> hard<00:03:15.519> later<00:03:15.730> on<00:03:15.940> because<00:03:16.180> if<00:03:16.299> he<00:03:16.389> can't

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
really hard later on because if he can't

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.720 
really hard later on because if he can't
have<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:16.989> much<00:03:17.109> impact<00:03:17.319> early<00:03:17.739> on<00:03:18.010> then<00:03:18.549> of

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
have that much impact early on then of

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.830 
have that much impact early on then of
course<00:03:18.970> he's<00:03:19.120> not<00:03:19.269> going<00:03:19.389> to<00:03:19.419> be<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.569> strong

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
course he's not going to be a strong

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.629 
course he's not going to be a strong
late<00:03:20.019> on<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.260> mean<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.590> think<00:03:20.829> that's<00:03:21.099> fair<00:03:21.370> and

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
late on I mean I think that's fair and

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.640 
late on I mean I think that's fair and
so<00:03:22.150> if<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.419> have<00:03:22.660> stomped<00:03:22.930> early<00:03:23.260> game<00:03:23.440> then

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
so if you have stomped early game then

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.020 
so if you have stomped early game then
you're<00:03:23.769> not<00:03:23.859> going<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.099> feel<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.579> effects<00:03:24.910> of

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
you're not going to feel the effects of

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.640 
you're not going to feel the effects of
that<00:03:25.180> falling<00:03:25.450> off<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:25.930> much<00:03:26.139> which<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.470> what

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
that falling off so much which is what

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.960 
that falling off so much which is what
you<00:03:26.739> want<00:03:26.919> to<00:03:27.069> happen<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:27.489> know<00:03:27.609> the<00:03:27.760> better

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
you want to happen you know the better

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.539 
you want to happen you know the better
you<00:03:28.060> do<00:03:28.269> early<00:03:28.690> then<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.530> easier<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.160> is<00:03:30.220> for

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
you do early then the easier it is for

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.750 
you do early then the easier it is for
you<00:03:30.970> to<00:03:31.829> not<00:03:32.829> struggle<00:03:33.099> through<00:03:33.459> that<00:03:33.609> lake

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
you to not struggle through that lake

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.750 
you to not struggle through that lake
for<00:03:34.269> -<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:35.049> can't<00:03:35.440> speak<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:36.310> better<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:36.639> too

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
for - I can't speak the better you too

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.629 
for - I can't speak the better you too
early<00:03:37.060> basically<00:03:37.569> then<00:03:38.139> the<00:03:38.769> easier<00:03:39.489> your

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
early basically then the easier your

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.460 
early basically then the easier your
late<00:03:39.849> game<00:03:40.060> becomes<00:03:40.389> that's<00:03:40.900> really<00:03:41.199> how<00:03:41.349> it

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
late game becomes that's really how it

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.589 
late game becomes that's really how it
goes<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.919> I'm<00:03:42.040> just<00:03:42.310> looking<00:03:42.430> at<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:42.879> win

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
goes and I'm just looking at the the win

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.289 
goes and I'm just looking at the the win
ratios<00:03:44.019> on<00:03:44.169> Lee<00:03:44.319> Seon<00:03:44.560> in<00:03:44.739> general<00:03:45.190> his<00:03:46.060> win

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
ratios on Lee Seon in general his win

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.330 
ratios on Lee Seon in general his win
rate<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:46.750> around<00:03:47.019> 48<00:03:47.590> percent<00:03:47.980> so<00:03:48.129> it's<00:03:48.250> not

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
rate is around 48 percent so it's not

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.610 
rate is around 48 percent so it's not
even<00:03:48.549> a<00:03:48.730> 50%<00:03:49.359> win<00:03:49.540> ratio<00:03:49.780> so<00:03:50.109> it's<00:03:50.260> not<00:03:50.410> like<00:03:50.590> a

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
even a 50% win ratio so it's not like a

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.080 
even a 50% win ratio so it's not like a
lot<00:03:50.859> of<00:03:50.889> people<00:03:51.099> are<00:03:51.340> stomping<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.849> early

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
lot of people are stomping the early

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.970 
lot of people are stomping the early
game<00:03:52.299> when<00:03:52.810> they're<00:03:52.989> playing<00:03:53.260> Lee<00:03:53.440> sin<00:03:53.769> and

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
game when they're playing Lee sin and

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.500 
game when they're playing Lee sin and
just<00:03:54.190> because<00:03:54.400> he<00:03:54.489> has<00:03:54.579> the<00:03:54.730> potential<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.329> do

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
just because he has the potential to do

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.539 
just because he has the potential to do
that<00:03:55.750> do<00:03:56.199> you<00:03:56.349> really<00:03:56.650> then<00:03:56.829> have<00:03:57.010> to<00:03:57.129> change

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
that do you really then have to change

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.270 
that do you really then have to change
him<00:03:57.879> so<00:03:58.269> he<00:03:58.480> can't<00:03:58.780> do<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:58.959> anymore<00:03:59.230> like<00:04:00.129> I

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
him so he can't do that anymore like I

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.349 
him so he can't do that anymore like I
say<00:04:00.459> I<00:04:00.639> don't<00:04:00.730> think<00:04:01.000> that's<00:04:01.120> a<00:04:01.180> good<00:04:01.269> idea

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
say I don't think that's a good idea

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:02.909 
say I don't think that's a good idea
especially<00:04:01.780> when<00:04:02.079> you're<00:04:02.260> considering<00:04:02.560> the

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
especially when you're considering the

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.159 
especially when you're considering the
fact<00:04:03.190> that<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:04.090> whole<00:04:04.239> reason<00:04:04.419> you<00:04:04.660> can<00:04:04.900> stomp

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
fact that the whole reason you can stomp

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.979 
fact that the whole reason you can stomp
early<00:04:05.379> game<00:04:05.620> is<00:04:05.829> a<00:04:05.889> reward<00:04:06.699> it's<00:04:07.299> a<00:04:07.389> reward<00:04:07.810> for

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
early game is a reward it's a reward for

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.240 
early game is a reward it's a reward for
the<00:04:08.169> hard<00:04:08.379> work<00:04:08.440> you<00:04:08.650> put<00:04:08.680> into<00:04:09.099> learning

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
the hard work you put into learning

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.819 
the hard work you put into learning
listen<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:10.510> second<00:04:10.810> reason<00:04:10.930> why<00:04:11.079> I<00:04:11.169> rethink

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
listen the second reason why I rethink

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.099 
listen the second reason why I rethink
that<00:04:11.980> this<00:04:12.549> is<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.940> good<00:04:13.150> change<00:04:13.389> in<00:04:13.660> general

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
that this is a good change in general

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.170 
that this is a good change in general
you<00:04:14.500> know<00:04:14.590> making<00:04:15.129> his<00:04:15.310> early<00:04:15.730> not<00:04:16.000> so

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
you know making his early not so

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.150 
you know making his early not so
impactful<00:04:16.419> making<00:04:17.049> his<00:04:17.199> late<00:04:17.410> not<00:04:17.680> so<00:04:17.889> hot

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
impactful making his late not so hot

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.009 
impactful making his late not so hot
it's<00:04:18.789> because<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.090> think<00:04:19.269> it's<00:04:19.599> just<00:04:19.659> strategy

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
it's because I think it's just strategy

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.380 
it's because I think it's just strategy
you<00:04:20.530> know<00:04:20.650> there<00:04:21.519> are<00:04:21.579> lower<00:04:21.760> chambers<00:04:22.180> in<00:04:22.300> the

you know there are lower chambers in the

game of rock-paper-scissors except
slightly<00:04:33.250> more<00:04:33.460> complex<00:04:33.820> because<00:04:34.330> they're

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
slightly more complex because they're

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.530 
slightly more complex because they're
like<00:04:34.660> you<00:04:34.780> know<00:04:34.870> over<00:04:35.170> a<00:04:35.320> hundred<00:04:35.380> champions

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
like you know over a hundred champions

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.690 
like you know over a hundred champions
so<00:04:37.540> these<00:04:38.140> sin<00:04:38.380> is<00:04:38.500> strong<00:04:38.740> early<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:39.250> week

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
so these sin is strong early and week

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.390 
so these sin is strong early and week
later<00:04:39.970> on<00:04:40.270> so<00:04:40.930> think<00:04:41.830> about<00:04:42.010> it<00:04:42.100> this<00:04:42.190> way<00:04:42.370> you

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
later on so think about it this way you

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.070 
later on so think about it this way you
know<00:04:42.550> if<00:04:42.640> you<00:04:42.760> were<00:04:42.850> to<00:04:43.000> watch<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.360> LCS<00:04:43.750> and

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
know if you were to watch the LCS and

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.690 
know if you were to watch the LCS and
one<00:04:44.440> team<00:04:44.650> picks<00:04:44.950> a<00:04:45.040> really<00:04:45.340> really<00:04:45.550> good

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
one team picks a really really good

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.760 
one team picks a really really good
late-game<00:04:46.000> team<00:04:46.510> come<00:04:46.720> and<00:04:46.930> so<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.650> other

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
late-game team come and so the other

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.470 
late-game team come and so the other
team<00:04:48.070> thinks<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.640> know<00:04:48.760> in<00:04:48.910> to<00:04:49.030> counter<00:04:49.330> this

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
team thinks you know in to counter this

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.120 
team thinks you know in to counter this
we're<00:04:49.840> gonna<00:04:50.020> have<00:04:50.200> to<00:04:50.320> pick<00:04:50.500> either<00:04:50.710> a<00:04:50.860> good

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
we're gonna have to pick either a good

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.740 
we're gonna have to pick either a good
late-game<00:04:51.370> team<00:04:51.730> comp<00:04:52.000> ourselves<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:52.720> just

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
late-game team comp ourselves and just

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.870 
late-game team comp ourselves and just
hope<00:04:52.960> that<00:04:53.050> we<00:04:53.170> can<00:04:53.320> outplay<00:04:53.650> them<00:04:53.890> or<00:04:54.250> we're

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
hope that we can outplay them or we're

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.790 
hope that we can outplay them or we're
gonna<00:04:54.970> pick<00:04:55.300> a<00:04:55.480> early<00:04:55.990> game<00:04:56.140> team<00:04:56.350> comp<00:04:56.620> and

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
gonna pick a early game team comp and

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.560 
gonna pick a early game team comp and
hope<00:04:56.920> that<00:04:57.100> we<00:04:57.310> can<00:04:57.490> snowball<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.300> pressure

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
hope that we can snowball and pressure

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.600 
hope that we can snowball and pressure
the<00:04:58.810> early<00:04:59.020> game<00:04:59.169> enough<00:04:59.530> that<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.310> doesn't

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
the early game enough that it doesn't

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.370 
the early game enough that it doesn't
reach<00:05:00.790> late-game<00:05:01.030> so<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.570> enemy<00:05:01.870> team<00:05:02.080> can

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
reach late-game so the enemy team can

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.620 
reach late-game so the enemy team can
reach<00:05:02.590> their<00:05:02.800> full<00:05:02.980> potential<00:05:03.480> that<00:05:04.480> is

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
reach their full potential that is

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.830 
reach their full potential that is
strategy<00:05:05.050> that<00:05:05.800> is<00:05:05.950> them<00:05:06.360> strategizing<00:05:07.360> their

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
strategy that is them strategizing their

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.790 
strategy that is them strategizing their
picks<00:05:08.200> in<00:05:08.560> order<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:09.010> best<00:05:09.430> win<00:05:09.850> that<00:05:10.240> game<00:05:10.800> so

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
picks in order to best win that game so

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.550 
picks in order to best win that game so
say<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.340> early<00:05:12.550> game<00:05:12.760> team<00:05:13.390> comp<00:05:13.720> goes<00:05:14.140> into

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
say the early game team comp goes into

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.290 
say the early game team comp goes into
the<00:05:14.680> game<00:05:14.860> and<00:05:15.100> they<00:05:15.490> stomp<00:05:15.820> the<00:05:15.970> late<00:05:16.120> game

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
the game and they stomp the late game

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.000 
the game and they stomp the late game
team<00:05:16.510> comp<00:05:16.780> because<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.320> know<00:05:17.440> early<00:05:17.830> game

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
team comp because you know early game

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.470 
team comp because you know early game
they<00:05:18.160> have<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.520> pressure<00:05:18.760> and<00:05:19.060> so<00:05:19.240> they<00:05:19.450> just

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
they have the pressure and so they just

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.810 
they have the pressure and so they just
destroy<00:05:19.990> them<00:05:20.169> now<00:05:20.740> is<00:05:21.160> it<00:05:21.340> really<00:05:21.580> fair<00:05:21.790> for

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
destroy them now is it really fair for

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.460 
destroy them now is it really fair for
you<00:05:22.030> to<00:05:22.060> say<00:05:22.180> oh<00:05:22.360> no<00:05:22.810> we<00:05:22.960> don't<00:05:23.110> want<00:05:23.260> that<00:05:23.290> to

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
you to say oh no we don't want that to

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.990 
you to say oh no we don't want that to
happen<00:05:23.620> we<00:05:23.890> don't<00:05:24.070> want<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:24.280> early<00:05:24.520> game<00:05:24.700> you

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
happen we don't want the early game you

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.700 
happen we don't want the early game you
know<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.540> early<00:05:25.930> game<00:05:26.080> team<00:05:26.260> had<00:05:26.440> too<00:05:26.560> much

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
know the early game team had too much

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.500 
know the early game team had too much
pressure<00:05:26.950> late<00:05:27.190> early<00:05:27.340> on<00:05:27.669> and<00:05:27.910> the<00:05:28.270> late-game

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
pressure late early on and the late-game

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.880 
pressure late early on and the late-game
team<00:05:28.840> come<00:05:29.020> didn't<00:05:29.290> really<00:05:29.500> have<00:05:29.650> enough

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
team come didn't really have enough

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.830 
team come didn't really have enough
power<00:05:30.100> already<00:05:30.460> on<00:05:30.669> is<00:05:31.120> that<00:05:31.390> you<00:05:31.600> know<00:05:31.720> is

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
power already on is that you know is

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.300 
power already on is that you know is
that<00:05:31.930> a<00:05:31.990> bad<00:05:32.260> thing<00:05:32.290> I<00:05:32.710> don't<00:05:32.800> think<00:05:32.979> that's<00:05:33.250> a

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
that a bad thing I don't think that's a

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.090 
that a bad thing I don't think that's a
bad<00:05:33.460> being<00:05:33.760> I<00:05:33.850> think<00:05:33.910> that's<00:05:34.210> a<00:05:34.419> strategy

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
bad being I think that's a strategy

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.350 
bad being I think that's a strategy
likewise<00:05:36.100> if<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.370> early<00:05:36.610> game<00:05:36.760> team<00:05:36.940> comp<00:05:37.210> had

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
likewise if the early game team comp had

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.540 
likewise if the early game team comp had
gone<00:05:37.510> into<00:05:37.660> that<00:05:37.810> game<00:05:38.110> and<00:05:38.320> they<00:05:38.470> had<00:05:38.770> not

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
gone into that game and they had not

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.390 
gone into that game and they had not
stomped<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.479> early<00:05:40.720> game<00:05:40.900> and<00:05:41.080> no<00:05:41.890> then<00:05:42.190> gone

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
stomped the early game and no then gone

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.490 
stomped the early game and no then gone
into<00:05:42.610> a<00:05:42.669> late<00:05:42.850> game<00:05:43.030> fight<00:05:43.390> and<00:05:43.600> just<00:05:44.290> got

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
into a late game fight and just got

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.320 
into a late game fight and just got
obliterated<00:05:44.680> because<00:05:45.400> that's<00:05:45.669> that<00:05:45.940> team

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
obliterated because that's that team

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.850 
obliterated because that's that team
comp<00:05:46.570> isn't<00:05:46.780> very<00:05:46.930> good<00:05:46.960> later<00:05:47.290> on<00:05:47.470> the<00:05:47.680> enemy

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
comp isn't very good later on the enemy

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.620 
comp isn't very good later on the enemy
team<00:05:47.890> company<00:05:48.340> it's<00:05:48.430> good<00:05:48.610> later<00:05:48.790> on<00:05:49.000> I<00:05:49.180> mean

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
team company it's good later on I mean

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.030 
team company it's good later on I mean
can<00:05:49.810> you<00:05:49.900> then<00:05:50.020> say<00:05:50.080> oh<00:05:50.290> yeah<00:05:50.680> this<00:05:50.830> early

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
can you then say oh yeah this early

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.469 
can you then say oh yeah this early
games<00:05:51.280> in<00:05:51.460> Compton<00:05:51.820> really<00:05:52.120> have<00:05:52.270> enough

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
games in Compton really have enough

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.030 
games in Compton really have enough
power<00:05:52.720> later<00:05:52.990> on<00:05:53.350> I<00:05:53.530> don't<00:05:53.620> think<00:05:53.770> that's

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
power later on I don't think that's

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.330 
power later on I don't think that's
really<00:05:54.310> fair<00:05:54.580> I<00:05:54.850> mean<00:05:55.330> I<00:05:55.830> don't<00:05:56.830> know<00:05:57.130> I<00:05:57.160> don't

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
really fair I mean I don't know I don't

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.010 
really fair I mean I don't know I don't
really<00:05:57.610> like<00:05:57.880> that<00:05:58.150> that<00:05:58.510> thing<00:05:58.750> in<00:05:58.870> general

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
really like that that thing in general

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.840 
really like that that thing in general
now<00:05:59.320> I<00:05:59.350> know<00:05:59.470> that<00:05:59.710> example<00:06:00.010> I<00:06:00.280> just<00:06:00.310> gave<00:06:00.669> was

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
now I know that example I just gave was

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.900 
now I know that example I just gave was
a<00:06:00.880> bit<00:06:01.090> extreme<00:06:01.390> and<00:06:01.540> wasn't<00:06:01.660> necessarily

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
a bit extreme and wasn't necessarily

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.909 
a bit extreme and wasn't necessarily
100%<00:06:03.910> true<00:06:04.540> to<00:06:04.750> what<00:06:04.930> these<00:06:05.140> these<00:06:05.440> these<00:06:05.650> sin

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
100% true to what these these these sin

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.409 
100% true to what these these these sin
changes<00:06:06.310> are<00:06:06.490> but<00:06:06.669> it's<00:06:06.790> it's<00:06:07.120> the<00:06:07.210> same

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
changes are but it's it's the same

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.180 
changes are but it's it's the same
concept<00:06:07.660> you<00:06:07.960> know<00:06:08.080> why<00:06:08.320> would<00:06:08.560> you<00:06:08.650> why<00:06:08.950> would

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
concept you know why would you why would

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.320 
concept you know why would you why would
you<00:06:09.310> want<00:06:09.490> to<00:06:09.580> do<00:06:09.729> that<00:06:09.910> I<00:06:10.030> mean<00:06:10.150> I<00:06:10.240> don't

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
you want to do that I mean I don't

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.719 
you want to do that I mean I don't
necessarily<00:06:10.540> feel<00:06:10.870> as<00:06:11.200> though<00:06:11.410> it's<00:06:12.280> that<00:06:12.520> bad

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
necessarily feel as though it's that bad

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.100 
necessarily feel as though it's that bad
thing<00:06:13.000> of<00:06:13.030> releasing<00:06:13.479> to<00:06:13.630> be<00:06:13.720> released<00:06:13.990> from

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
thing of releasing to be released from

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.020 
thing of releasing to be released from
early<00:06:14.410> on<00:06:14.530> and<00:06:14.800> then<00:06:14.950> be<00:06:15.160> not<00:06:15.340> so<00:06:15.550> strong

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
early on and then be not so strong

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.600 
early on and then be not so strong
later<00:06:16.270> on<00:06:16.740> that's<00:06:17.740> kind<00:06:17.890> of<00:06:17.979> my<00:06:18.160> opinion<00:06:18.490> but

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
later on that's kind of my opinion but

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.460 
later on that's kind of my opinion but
the<00:06:18.729> biggest<00:06:19.060> point<00:06:19.419> I<00:06:19.720> want<00:06:20.050> to<00:06:20.110> make<00:06:20.290> it's

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
the biggest point I want to make it's

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.980 
the biggest point I want to make it's
just<00:06:20.530> the<00:06:20.710> whole<00:06:20.830> thing<00:06:20.890> of<00:06:21.720> leasing<00:06:22.720> is<00:06:22.810> hard

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
just the whole thing of leasing is hard

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.960 
just the whole thing of leasing is hard
to<00:06:23.080> play<00:06:23.260> and<00:06:23.500> the<00:06:23.860> reason<00:06:24.160> why<00:06:24.250> he<00:06:24.370> sums<00:06:24.610> games

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
to play and the reason why he sums games

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.909 
to play and the reason why he sums games
is<00:06:25.240> because<00:06:25.570> people<00:06:25.900> take<00:06:26.380> the<00:06:26.560> time<00:06:26.740> to

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
is because people take the time to

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.010 
is because people take the time to
master<00:06:27.100> him<00:06:27.460> and<00:06:27.669> to<00:06:27.820> learn<00:06:28.030> him<00:06:28.210> I<00:06:28.419> already

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
master him and to learn him I already

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.110 
master him and to learn him I already
think<00:06:29.169> there<00:06:29.380> is<00:06:29.470> much<00:06:29.770> of<00:06:29.950> a<00:06:30.040> case<00:06:30.400> in<00:06:30.669> arguing

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
think there is much of a case in arguing

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.760 
think there is much of a case in arguing
that<00:06:31.270> Lee<00:06:31.479> sin<00:06:31.780> is<00:06:31.900> overpowered<00:06:32.470> and<00:06:32.620> mean<00:06:32.740> a

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
that Lee sin is overpowered and mean a

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.110 
that Lee sin is overpowered and mean a
lot<00:06:32.979> of<00:06:33.160> professional<00:06:33.640> players<00:06:33.789> and<00:06:34.060> the

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
lot of professional players and the

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.180 
lot of professional players and the
community<00:06:34.570> say<00:06:34.870> that<00:06:35.110> these<00:06:35.740> things<00:06:35.950> were<00:06:36.099> on

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
community say that these things were on

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.620 
community say that these things were on
the<00:06:36.220> most<00:06:36.490> balanced<00:06:37.060> champions

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
the most balanced champions

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.030 
the most balanced champions
the<00:06:37.690> game<00:06:37.900> I<00:06:37.930> mean<00:06:38.110> even<00:06:38.380> scar<00:06:38.680> who<00:06:38.890> pretty

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040 
the game I mean even scar who pretty

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.070 
the game I mean even scar who pretty
quite<00:06:39.310> nicely<00:06:39.520> said<00:06:39.970> that<00:06:40.300> when<00:06:40.870> you<00:06:40.960> get

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
quite nicely said that when you get

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.870 
quite nicely said that when you get
destroyed<00:06:41.380> by<00:06:41.560> Lee<00:06:41.740> sin<00:06:42.040> it<00:06:42.280> feels<00:06:42.610> more<00:06:42.820> like

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
destroyed by Lee sin it feels more like

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.090 
destroyed by Lee sin it feels more like
you<00:06:43.330> are<00:06:43.450> getting<00:06:43.780> outplayed<00:06:44.230> as<00:06:44.620> opposed<00:06:44.980> to

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
you are getting outplayed as opposed to

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.650 
you are getting outplayed as opposed to
you<00:06:45.310> thinking<00:06:45.760> that<00:06:45.910> that<00:06:46.060> champion<00:06:46.540> is

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
you thinking that that champion is

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.300 
you thinking that that champion is
overpowered<00:06:47.140> which<00:06:47.380> i<00:06:47.440> think<00:06:47.500> is<00:06:47.800> probably

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
overpowered which i think is probably

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.680 
overpowered which i think is probably
the<00:06:48.520> best<00:06:48.580> way<00:06:48.910> you<00:06:48.940> won't<00:06:49.210> think<00:06:49.360> to<00:06:49.570> be

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
the best way you won't think to be

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.020 
the best way you won't think to be
looking<00:06:49.990> at<00:06:50.110> things<00:06:50.350> so<00:06:51.130> if<00:06:51.430> it's<00:06:51.670> not<00:06:51.790> broken

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
looking at things so if it's not broken

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.480 
looking at things so if it's not broken
in<00:06:52.270> that<00:06:52.420> sense<00:06:52.750> why<00:06:53.140> why<00:06:53.770> is<00:06:53.830> right<00:06:54.100> trying<00:06:54.400> to

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
in that sense why why is right trying to

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.520 
in that sense why why is right trying to
fix<00:06:54.700> it<00:06:54.910> and<00:06:55.660> that's<00:06:55.840> basically<00:06:56.170> what<00:06:56.320> I<00:06:56.350> want
