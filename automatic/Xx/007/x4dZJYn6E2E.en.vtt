00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.700
 I thought what went well 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:09.149
 this afternoon trips dear borrowed none 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.149
 weekly 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.720
 we won I have 2 goals 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.520
 convenience, especially those first slide and made 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.170
 the interplay of the mine with Pelliano 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.390
 bowling on you taking it with you 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.780
 head a delicious full 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.490
 teagle is fantastic though it certainly was 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.890
 a beautiful villages 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.720
 I think the first one was finished 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.390
 a little searching with peeling but two 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.339
 Deaf people always do well in it 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.899
 yes more or less played the position where 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:39.850
 Normally lex stands and all that 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.199
 close as possible to peel how 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.449
 I liked that because what a different one 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.249
 another interpretation to a red midfield 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.550
 as you normally have 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:50.949
 yes that's why i just gave up even though sometimes 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.609
 I have to adjust it so that I take courses 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:57.399
 left-handed but it went 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.989
 nice and light this your more has this 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.030
 actually maybe yes because you prefer 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.679
 therefore comes more often in a scoring 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.989
 position 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.810
 no that's because now I saw that 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.280
 lex te that can also fill in very well and 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.960
 club 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.070
 I saw what it was but your rebellion 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.450
 and craft the trainer or a luxury 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.140
 choice for that matter him to someone you 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.950
 much that just as good if not better at it 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.780
 then nice bus left hand in it then 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.460
 if if we have tons or one after this afternoon 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.689
 critical note 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.460
 you are the first same gentleman and 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.229
 master but stand by the rest signal 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.200
 not before that gives then maybe still 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.109
 think and something to improve 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.409
 No less continue clay dressing 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:44.079
 everyone has each other on and that we do 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.810
 good feeling and yes everyone told you 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.369
 that we just had to go ahead and that 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.640
 we still had your way with three points 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.859
 to go 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.270
 and that succeeded what actually had to 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.770
 though I am number last from a club like 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.450
 feyenoord should just be there 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.520
 simply even inside 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.439
 no every game is different so that is 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.210
 with all due respect , the two of you want you so whole 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:09.039
 well so you go towards the trainer 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.930
 express a preference where we are 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.520
 less is the preferred condition 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.650
 You also say what you just got here 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.250
 I said running is just on 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.600
 trimming but you can have a preference 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.830
 have it for yourself from yes there 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.020
 I feel the best where I am 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.280
 floor played in the youth no that 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.920
 I don't want to say 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.940
 stuff everywhere which is fine so that is 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.230
 no problem 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.150
 and if you even picture like today the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.270
 it also doesn't matter where you stand 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.270
 to the ear that we congratulated
