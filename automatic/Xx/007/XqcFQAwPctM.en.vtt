00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.430
 since tuesday it is fixed the 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.199
 previous u 15 trainer remigius ehlert 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.630
 succeeds Thomas Meggle 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.250
 as head coach of the U23 kiez kicker 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.779
 on 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.280
 on Wednesday we went to the first 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.610
 unit on the artificial turf at the 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.610
 Kollaustraße 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.710
 yes cool is inc first time for me 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.500
 scary on wrestling i'm going that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.699
 of course with yes with energy to me 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.680
 look forward to the task scary 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.629
 then come intact team will the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.210
 taken away the yes thomas meggle 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.749
 yes he has leveled us he had her 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.129
 started now 23 and so on 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.289
 successfully led by boller 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.679
 and stanley before we bug 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.350
 Going there are really many guys 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:57.260
 hopefully someday also look around that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.120
 is the ultimate goal 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.649
 before that, st pauli had a primeval fabian 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.199
 boll the kicker for four games 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.820
 cared for on an interim basis 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.680
 after a remarkable series of 10 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.900
 Score from four games is the number 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.630
 17, however, as co-coach again 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.630
 to be able to move into the second limb 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.790
 clearly the task itself has great 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.630
 a lot of fun but that's one 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.130
 she has to be a little bit of that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.360
 romantic notions separate that 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.560
 As a trainer u23 only for riding 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.930
 training and game operation 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.940
 is responsible but just when 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.710
 with maggie 60 70 hours per week 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.030
 dropped out and deleted without replacement 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.830
 Stay for four weeks if stays 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.680
 course many track premier has 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.600
 technically correct what on the palette and 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.130
 because it can be good for me only in 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.960
 a learning phase now the next two 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.090
 years to watch many things from me and 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.680
 then someday my own 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.300
 create portfolio 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.240
 As I said, I can only from 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.120
 profit and always from remy 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.000
 certainly that another 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.440
 could write it out 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.270
 for the new chine coach quite 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.550
 easier tasks for getting started 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.500
 give because on saturday it goes directly 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.360
 to the previously unbeaten top rider 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.679
 the regional league north of u 23 of hsv 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.620
 Despite the impressive balance of the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.709
 red roses from nine wins and one draw 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.230
 the coaching team pays off chances 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.880
 tableprimus have already said a lot 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.560
 strong team where we actually 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.040
 not to lose in the reason about it 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.530
 the easiest game for us with yes 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.730
 Identification courage and passion that 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.250
 We will also go back to retrieve 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.610
 and look forward to come with us 17 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.750
 people from the nlz the identity that 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.580
 heart-blood that can in his game 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.950
 be decisive and of course 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.730
 they fight as well as they can and about it 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.580
 Of course , there is football too 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.670
 to play weeks and why should one yes 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.350
 even as winner of the place before the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.200
 little derby plan the coaching team 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.120
 but also personalsorgen striker 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.130
 Erdogan Pini may be due to a yellow 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.200
 red card from the game in Munster only 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.269
 watch and because of the numerous 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.310
 failures among the professionals need more 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.519
 player in the second Bundesliga 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.200
 help out 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.820
 Of course that's great for the guys 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.680
 is who collects their professional experience 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.340
 can be for us as a coaching team 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.010
 of course a difficult working though 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.690
 one both short lectures units so 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.730
 sometime with the last weekend 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.370
 arrival must now travel in Münster 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.950
 who else has two field players and one 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.120
 goalkeeper on substitute bench so novum in the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.739
 Club history could not do more 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.180
 Change operators make it like that 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.130
 professionals stop us from pretending 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.970
 make it close to the fine small 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.160
 circle to quote it and so on 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.709
 how is that going to be here with us? 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.019
 we will already be close together and 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.780
 Actually, that can still be ours 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.650
 Strengthen than when it's so bad 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.540
 I optimistic 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.950
 courage should also kick the kicker 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.849
 last clash with the 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.040
 red roses 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.349
 in february they were still victorious at the time 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.010
 Thomas Meggle trained eleven away 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.010
 with 2 to 0
