now<00:03:41.360> let's<00:03:41.600> say<00:03:41.780> you've<00:03:41.930> got<00:03:41.960> a<00:03:42.110> care<00:03:42.380> and<00:03:42.530> it's

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
now let's say you've got a care and it's

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.290 
now let's say you've got a care and it's
got<00:03:42.770> a<00:03:42.800> flat<00:03:43.040> tire<00:03:43.070> and<00:03:43.550> you<00:03:43.940> want<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.150> get<00:03:44.270> a

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
tire filled or you've got to make sure

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.920 
tire filled or you've got to make sure
you've<00:03:46.280> got<00:03:46.310> more<00:03:46.640> air<00:03:46.910> going<00:03:47.240> into<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.720> tire
