00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.090

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:06.840
 the beautiful may to me 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.579
 enjoying a beautiful day 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:12.629
 edit to start a series of articles of types of videos 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.880
 to get closer and to feel what we are together we are on the court 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.609
 per cent can keep things very simple very brief let's exhaust 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.029
 different types of articles with tips 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.859
 very precise and very simple to apply to students and us 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.419
 same also to improve the jogs 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:31.849
 yes let's talk today 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.910
 in the first delivery of the hostages 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.480
 the crips in the forehand 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.290
 and only in the stroke of fortune are we going to focus on the right cut 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.640
 Saturdays forge in English right 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.240
 in Spanish 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.020
 by the way let's talk about the basic brits the names of the crimes I'm going 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.620
 to show with my hand to 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.510
 here is a visual reference that is the most important in visual tennis what 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.440
 visual 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.040
 more like the most recommended times to hit him cuts of that sacrifice 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.920
 who in the east of the united states where we support the palm of the hand in the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.030
 Sien and Corrado, we put our hands down 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.259
 the crit and there we close it also meditate shake hands 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.840
 In the person we finish that the doll is perfectly located at 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.790
 side stand 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.020
 giorgi as we can see 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.020
 putting it in a very comfortable position to be able to execute blows 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.220
 in different heights 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.520
 the only difficulty is that after being the caracas balls 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.890
 because they see that the position of the doll is a little 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.060
 apparently uncomfortable there and would favor more 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.070
 complicated a bit more extremes where we move the hand 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.140
 a little more 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.380
 inward out 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.380
 and there we have a cry called extra hermigua 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.480
 there yes the doll beds underneath 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.570
 and then the tel the grip that is a little complicated that is beloved westerns 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.170
 we put the palm of our hand under the pri 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.600
 i is to sink quite complicated that if it favors the coup d'etat I felt the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.780
 very high impact 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.430
 the position of the scream 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.790
 will affect the racket's plight 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.570
 the point of contact where we hit the ball and also an important element 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.570
 keep in mind that it is the position of cobos 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.919
 percent the old tennis school 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.939
 it taught that back in the sixties seventy you could hit with it and 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.409
 continental 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.739
 in the grec that is used for the volley for him is more 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.909
 for the service for the former lanÃºs 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.719
 yes but now that's it is already practically not used then 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:34.819
 let's go instantly 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.819
 and the point of contact is slightly in front 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.689
 before 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.569
 at the height of the improsa waist promotes a very clean contact very 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.759
 clear without any effort you can hit also counted 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.299
 you can not throw the ball pla 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:54.670
 finally we have in Madrid 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.230
 that no no and we create the teachers but the players and the 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.139
 Mr. called Roger Federer 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:01.260
 he has brought it 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.949
 in our beautiful sport called 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.100
 hybrid that is a combination 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.409
 between 15 2% 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.279
 and he is equal 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:15.129
 and that good in the middle and it's a very comfortable grip 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.319
 very easy 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.359
 and that promotes acceleration and all types of contact in different high 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:23.670
 that exists for me 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.269
 in my opinion it is the cry the future the dt we should say to the children 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:31.039
 and also adults is very easy to achieve 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.659
 good many thanks this was all for today we will be back soon with martins 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.519
 already talking about vacancies 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.069
 adding things
