know about that so I just use it to take
tricks<00:01:21.580> outside<00:01:21.790> and<00:01:22.540> it's<00:01:23.530> super<00:01:24.100> nice

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.840 
now I know a lot of people do this but
just<00:01:41.470> make<00:01:41.680> sure<00:01:41.710> that<00:01:41.950> your<00:01:42.220> grass<00:01:42.520> isn't

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.080 

also<00:02:26.620> taking<00:02:27.010> your<00:02:27.219> rabbit<00:02:27.579> from<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.909> house

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
also taking your rabbit from the house

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.509 
also taking your rabbit from the house
to<00:02:28.749> the<00:02:28.959> outdoors<00:02:29.349> for<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.010> first<00:02:30.249> time<00:02:30.489> I

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
to the outdoors for the first time I

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.339 
to the outdoors for the first time I
would<00:02:30.730> suggest<00:02:31.030> using<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.689> carrier<00:02:32.139> just

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
would suggest using a carrier just

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.500 
would suggest using a carrier just
because<00:02:32.739> there's<00:02:33.280> bling<00:02:33.579> gets<00:02:33.819> in<00:02:33.939> it<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.299> if

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
because there's bling gets in it and if

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.970 
because there's bling gets in it and if
your<00:02:34.659> rabbit<00:02:34.959> doesn't<00:02:35.170> like<00:02:35.409> the<00:02:35.530> outside

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
your rabbit doesn't like the outside

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.129 
your rabbit doesn't like the outside
then<00:02:36.969> your<00:02:37.090> rabbit<00:02:37.359> can<00:02:37.480> just<00:02:37.659> stay<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:37.900> there

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139 
then your rabbit can just stay in there

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.319 
then your rabbit can just stay in there
just<00:02:38.349> open<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.769> up<00:02:38.920> for<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.670> small<00:02:39.819> enclosed

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
just open it up for the small enclosed

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.199 
just open it up for the small enclosed
area<00:02:40.719> and<00:02:40.989> let<00:02:41.379> your<00:02:41.530> rabbit<00:02:41.859> kamo<00:02:42.189> on<00:02:42.430> his<00:02:43.000> or

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
area and let your rabbit kamo on his or

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.959 
area and let your rabbit kamo on his or
her<00:02:43.239> own<00:02:43.389> because<00:02:44.250> well<00:02:45.250> yeah<00:02:45.609> it's<00:02:45.790> the

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:45.969
