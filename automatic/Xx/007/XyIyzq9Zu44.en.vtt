just<00:05:26.910> like<00:05:27.090> mother<00:05:27.690> didn't<00:05:28.229> used<00:05:28.410> to<00:05:28.470> make

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
just like mother didn't used to make

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.529 
just like mother didn't used to make
yeah<00:05:30.840> actually<00:05:31.650> it<00:05:32.370> may<00:05:32.550> look<00:05:32.850> questionable

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
yeah actually it may look questionable

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.670 
yeah actually it may look questionable
then<00:05:33.930> I<00:05:34.140> guess<00:05:34.380> a<00:05:34.560> lot<00:05:34.800> of<00:05:34.919> meat<00:05:35.070> loads<00:05:35.280> do

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
then I guess a lot of meat loads do

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.820 
then I guess a lot of meat loads do
but<00:05:36.419> actually<00:05:37.419> that's<00:05:37.630> really<00:05:37.810> good<00:05:38.050> it's

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
but actually that's really good it's

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.430 
but actually that's really good it's
like<00:05:38.889> a<00:05:39.009> giant<00:05:39.430> meatball<00:05:39.639> I<00:05:40.259> could<00:05:41.259> do<00:05:41.350> with

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
like a giant meatball I could do with

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.950 
like a giant meatball I could do with
some<00:05:41.789> tomato<00:05:42.789> sauce<00:05:42.940> really<00:05:43.240> it's<00:05:43.660> a<00:05:43.750> girl

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
some tomato sauce really it's a girl

so yeah everything's fine so not much

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.779 
so yeah everything's fine so not much
else<00:06:21.849> to<00:06:21.940> say<00:06:22.349> it<00:06:23.349> all<00:06:23.590> depends<00:06:24.070> on<00:06:24.190> what

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
else to say it all depends on what

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.370 
else to say it all depends on what
happens<00:06:24.820> at<00:06:25.180> the<00:06:25.300> end<00:06:25.330> of<00:06:25.449> the<00:06:25.539> week<00:06:25.690> really<00:06:25.900> if

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
happens at the end of the week really if

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.249 
happens at the end of the week really if
the<00:06:27.070> scales<00:06:27.400> say<00:06:27.580> anything<00:06:27.820> different

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 
the scales say anything different

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:32.210 
the scales say anything different
hopefully<00:06:29.259> they<00:06:29.380> do<00:06:29.550> but<00:06:30.550> if<00:06:30.789> they<00:06:30.910> don't<00:06:31.150> I

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
hopefully they do but if they don't I

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.550 
hopefully they do but if they don't I
guess<00:06:33.220> it<00:06:33.370> just<00:06:33.479> dispels<00:06:34.479> any<00:06:35.310> sort<00:06:36.310> of<00:06:37.560> claim

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
guess it just dispels any sort of claim

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.310 
guess it just dispels any sort of claim
that<00:06:38.860> it's<00:06:39.310> a<00:06:39.430> miracle<00:06:39.669> weight<00:06:40.479> loss<00:06:40.690> tool<00:06:42.210> so

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
that it's a miracle weight loss tool so

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:53.770 
that it's a miracle weight loss tool so
yeah<00:06:44.970> bring<00:06:45.970> on<00:06:46.090> day<00:06:46.210> three

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.840 

you
