00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.320
 so has already got to a new one 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.150
 video thanks for turning my name 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.880
 is mehrstetten today 's something new 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.100
 a lot to see on the battle as one 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.189
 art mini initiative started it 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.430
 to deal specifically with the hd that is 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.949
 you want the on screen overlays 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.810
 try the dear named nature the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.730
 reduce cluster fact 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.640
 the first changes reduce it 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.739
 not the age the smooth but maybe 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.630
 in France you have when you as a medic 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.969
 Something too late tried someone 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.010
 to revive in principle is the new 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.989
 change nothing but one 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.300
 countdown for players still 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.219
 reviving can be quite interesting 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.200
 also that the idea or the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.870
 suggestion as said by a community 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.270
 member came, however, that was already in 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.000
 the time to battlefield 3 as the still 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.530
 The latest was the principle I think 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.840
 I really help because you get away with it 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.879
 prioritize his patients or the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.320
 time left for a better one 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.820
 revival can use 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.130
 furthermore, I find it special 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.869
 useful if you're a bit further away 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.850
 that means you can be so easy 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.280
 Assess whether you are away and risk 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.200
 worth it at all if you already have it anyway 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.880
 but there are several players nearby 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.530
 then you have fallen over with the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.189
 Change the big advantage of its time 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.119
 and reallocate revival correctly 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.490
 time management is a matter of fact 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.920
 which can really be important everywhere 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.840
 the usual reviving bugs the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.360
 sometimes occur when a player 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.040
 somewhere sliding down is that is 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.960
 unfortunately not fixed yet and that is 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.570
 a little annoying but I really think so 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.880
 cool that the idea of ​​the revive trias of 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.820
 comes from a community member and now 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.680
 was even installed or at least 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.659
 currently being tested 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.240
 which I do not think so well 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.799
 is the current judy cluster fuck like 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.450
 I already called him before and 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.880
 I'm curious what else 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.829
 is changed because the new change of 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.659
 The countdown does not have the trick in it 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.680
 least for the reduction in but 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.049
 rather the opposite 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.390
 The fat circle should therefore not 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.879
 standing directly on the fallen player 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.950
 but maybe something else happens next to it 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.100
 namely, if there is an enemy up there 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.230
 the position of the player is the man 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.060
 still want to revive the right 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.590
 It will be hard to see that 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.560
 especially on longer distances 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.740
 to and he will become your virtual life 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.990
 end end I will be the video here 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.310
 also because I'm here only once finished 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.440
 what do you think about the new changes? 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.690
 that said i can find it down to a few 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.120
 details very helpful and I am pleased 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.340
 to see that even such relative 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.500
 small details are changed 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.720
 something will change with me 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.580
 but probably never the thing that I 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.680
 me over a thumbs up and a 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.480
 abo of you would be very happy 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.870
 thanks for watching and until the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.870
 next time
