that<00:02:57.700> all<00:02:57.850> is<00:02:58.000> one<00:02:58.120> last<00:02:58.330> thing<00:02:58.540> this<00:02:58.660> little

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
that all is one last thing this little

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.199 
that all is one last thing this little
tiny<00:02:59.140> dot<00:02:59.620> here<00:02:59.830> I'll<00:03:00.549> show<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:00.819> that<00:03:01.000> that's

tiny dot here I'll show you that that's

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.880 
tiny dot here I'll show you that that's
where<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.630> year<00:03:01.930> we<00:03:02.380> fill<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.799> LPG<00:03:03.280> tank<00:03:03.310> up

where the year we fill the LPG tank up

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.880 
where the year we fill the LPG tank up
so<00:03:05.890> when<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.069> take<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.519> a<00:03:06.549> garish<00:03:06.940> LPG

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
so when you take it to a garish LPG

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.949 
so when you take it to a garish LPG
there's<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.980> little<00:03:09.360> attachment<00:03:10.360> there's<00:03:10.930> a

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
there's a little attachment there's a

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.240 
there's a little attachment there's a
couple<00:03:11.140> of<00:03:11.260> minutes<00:03:11.500> either<00:03:11.620> value<00:03:11.920> just

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
couple of minutes either value just

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.729 
couple of minutes either value just
screw<00:03:12.430> in<00:03:12.549> there<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.000> then<00:03:13.180> Philip<00:03:13.510> LPG<00:03:14.200> and

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
screw in there and then Philip LPG and

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.880 
screw in there and then Philip LPG and
we've<00:03:15.280> never<00:03:15.489> been<00:03:15.700> refused<00:03:16.150> in<00:03:17.109> two<00:03:17.440> years<00:03:17.709> of

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
we've never been refused in two years of

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.860 
we've never been refused in two years of
driving<00:03:18.310> around<00:03:18.400> Europe<00:03:18.820> I<00:03:21.090> think<00:03:22.090> that's

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
driving around Europe I think that's

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.800 
driving around Europe I think that's
that<00:03:23.019> oh<00:03:23.609> yeah<00:03:24.640> that's<00:03:24.880> just<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.239> just<00:03:25.720> the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
that oh yeah that's just it's just the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.210 
that oh yeah that's just it's just the
step<00:03:26.079> there<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.440> see<00:03:26.620> I'll<00:03:26.829> show<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:27.100> that
