00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.110
 a person who speaks without hairs in the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.000
 language and that's why I like to talk with 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.769

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.059
 also that they collaborated in my new 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.949
 album that will be released in January 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.949

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.340

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.200

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.700
 in your solo career because it's me 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.760
 what they think a single swallow 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.430
 it does not make spring 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.970
 and I think I have enough 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.040
 energy like to do it with my career 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.800

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.720
 Dominican Republic and your past disc 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.530
 the world pencil which was your greatest 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.770
 good satisfaction and very resident of 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.170
 album 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.440
 one of the things that I 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.110
 they give me 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.470
 in a market I liked something 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.880
 that resurface half as an artist inside 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.740
 of society with one more concept 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.510
 clean and I realized that what also 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.850
 we can do without having to say very 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.700
 obscene words without having to have 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.660
 controversy with nobody simply 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.460
 making music as we are doing 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.800
 now for all the females we go to 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.290
 michelle to more than 10 million view in 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.500
 the 5 videos that we did we are going to have 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:20.330
 the port video and we are recently 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.280
 playing the video with somalia release of 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.420
 a song that is titled uncontrolled 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.970
 direct the bellows if terrero 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.580
 and that comes for the somalia album 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.860
 Gray 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.770
 and nothing I feel very happy with what 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.810
 this year has happened with my career because 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:42.180
 I did not really know that I could 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.150
 crossover now I am a sex symbol 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.430
 and modest that is man then he 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.920
 can say that the pencil has matured in 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.070
 his career if he had to mature 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.420
 although I know that the woman left it bounced 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:02.890
 because I wanted a mature man the 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.020
 obligation of the boy and tell me about his 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.700
 interaction with this character that 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.320
 I imagine he has a personality like that 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.110
 as well strong also when it comes to 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.180
 to make songs or to coordinate 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.160

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.480
 aware since the main figure of 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.890
 this genre and that apart from the music 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.840
 personally we take ourselves extremely 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.190
 well and I want it to take him and 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.500
 the love he has shown me 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.890
 so that I continue being of him 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.540

 cameras I feel grateful 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.650
 work with the conscious one to a 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.569
 person who is shaking hands with 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.340
 talent here I understand republic 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.069
 Dominican that something that is important already 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.140
 that there is so much talent we find 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.989
 working what the album will not whistle 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.510
 my February cheese production launched 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.519
 he understands the issue will come as a boom 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.500
 boom team institute for me and we're already 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.970
 working the single that we sing that 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.370
 another way 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.140
 17 boys of little time more to 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.060
 forward they want to do their project in 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.870
 lonely like they're going to take that 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.400
 also because he hears something what is what 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.229
 establishes the contract that they have 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.539
 with me is that I 'm going to take your 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:24.260
 race makes a point where if they 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:26.000
 they decide that they want to continue that they want 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.070
 continue working with my hand 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.979
 company can do it but also 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.250
 You can put your your your store part 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.050
 because to them what we are 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.700
 tracing the reference that over 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.600
 young people also trust what 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.150
 we 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.880
 the result that others have already obtained 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.800
 young what has made them 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.540
 trust me too because they do not 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.120
 they are the first thing that come from the hand of 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.070
 conscious pencil has not been witnesses so is 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.110
 if that is true and I wanted to make you another 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.050
 ask you know that last Tuesday 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.240
 it was the premiere lotoman 2.0 and there 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.130
 there were many artists among them 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.080
 she was venya carolina she of a 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.050
 statement that he would now be a 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.240
 program aimed at another audience and where 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.280
 I was going to make the word 'god' known 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.050
 but otherwise what do you think that already 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.210
 that you and they already see how to create you certain 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.070
 point to work a world because it already gave 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.770
 support for all that urban genre during 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.290
 a great time your program was like the 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.880
 flagship program of this clear genre 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:27.070
 if I do it very well because you know 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:30.450
 that really at the end 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:33.640
 we have to look for god and me 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:36.340
 it will be time for me to preach 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.130
 what the word of God already within the 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:43.000
 Christian world I do not see it that I 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.220
 then that always someday yes but 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.680
 at the moment there is not an average song 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:52.410
 let us be the supreme being 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.370
 daddy god where wherever wherever 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.080
 we arrived with our projects 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.380
 I always commend him first 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.389
 then that fanatic that are the 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.539
 people who support what we 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:09.060
 we do and that every day that goes by they say 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:12.380
 we are voting what they are doing 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.380
 because it's good 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.380
 that's why we 're not going to continue listening 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.380
 the music of the
