00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 let's see these are the components we see 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:12.090
 a little the geforce gtx 7 70 gigabytes cm 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:18.570
 53 187 other sign of the Masses 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:22.470
 g.skill ares inter lei seven 170 and la 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.090
 its the new processor is the cooler 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.630
 master power supplies 190 watts and 20 watts 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:35.820
 720 8 well now we will start the editing 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:38.719
 we use with an msi 187 motherboard 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.719
 g40 treats 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:54.690
 but if necessary we use it as 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.690
 layer of material also static 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.580
 some nice looks at how nice it 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:13.200
 tool that cannot be missed by whom 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:18.110
 splits has from instruction manual with 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.110
 collective guarantee ok 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.900
 let's return to socket protection 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.820
 we buy the software and go think 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.820
 the processor 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.490
 we want to close the socket 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.070
 It is not so 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.500
 now increase me to investigator 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.440
 we have all chosen a solution 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.300
 intel desktop standard is the male 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.250
 regarding the situation but there 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.840
 We are content 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.990
 as you can see here there is already applied 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.550
 fine pasta I have to do other than 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.820
 place st jammer on 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.820
 processor 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.310
 disassemble it document of the project that 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.310
 it's trouble for you 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.290
 we are the fan team 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.500
 thermocontrolled at the end of the card 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:44.600
 mother at the moment four films that goes 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:48.580
 bad then you always do in how many me 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:53.030
 I recommend a frequency of 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.190
 1600 a mega hertz dr3 mode timing a3 a 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.780
 technicians at 9 then now in the 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.580
 we place on the motherboard in 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.580
 dual channel optical modes 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.600
 so what followed and colors 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.580
 then there are those that are the colors 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.610
 your faithful to the instructions so that 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.130
 if the first one we break the that there 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:20.090
 we have forgotten a hard disk from a 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:27.350
 7200 rpm terabytes can be raitre 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:32.720
 green and then noticed in the area of high 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:36.560
 of the zone d1a 17.1 card thanks to this 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.670
 that he was master pearl, what is it? 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.440
 pipe cleaner 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:55.760
 the purpose that the panel regulates applies to the 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:55.760
 motherboard come in this bulb 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:06.709
 then then saw that the limiter 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:09.859
 modular remembered the subtlety in 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:13.939
 these cases vote hi give up from 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:15.739
 swimmer I would let you pass behind 700 i 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.340
 of faces to allow him the highest facts of 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.359
 plastic 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.930
 he asked this nice method of 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.509
 extraction of the trolley hard disk 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.930
 now your friend locked in there 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:35.960
 will show with cart then we do 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:38.840
 see slaughterhouse besides the slaughterhouse like 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.020
 we have settled the cases so we have 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.250
 exploited the thinness of the cables 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.250
 Modular food would make them 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.949
 pass behind a hole in the case so 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.949
 such that now they are all hidden 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:54.979
 behind the side bulkhead of the case that 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.539
 will come out of this point here to 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.360
 go to position on the various companions 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.949
 to be feeling good is screwing 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.530
 the power supply after doing it 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:06.139
 dismount twice after which we will go to 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.870
 place the card no before the 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:12.680
 motherboard we go to put the 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.610
 fan 140 mm of the food area the shark 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.370
 blue led 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.530
 we will have to place the water on the mission 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.539
 from bottom to top to take advantage of the 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.690
 take advantage of the air chimney effect 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.690
 hot 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:35.699
 Now let's proceed with the installation 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:38.900
 of settled for the motherboard for 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.900
 motherboard support 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.080
 here it is then we make space first badly 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.080
 and now 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:19.590
 now let's take off the usb has held up the 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:19.590
 weight are discounted climate
