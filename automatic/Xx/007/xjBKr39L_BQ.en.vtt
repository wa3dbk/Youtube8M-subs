00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:14.500
Today's Video Blog is related to Deaf Truck Drivers and Commercial Drivers Licenses (CDL). 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.500
My name is Jack Leiker.  I hold a CDL Class A License.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.500
Hello deaf truck drivers.  My name is Brenda Palmigiano.  I have a CDL Class A License.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.100
They (deaf) don't need to use a hearing aid to operate the truck,  

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.900
because the trucks have technologies build in.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.500
They (deaf) can drive without their hearing aids because the eyes have better reception.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.500
The writing test is awful.  I had to go back many times to pass the test. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.500
The writing test took me 9 times to pass.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.500
I was not allowed to have an interpreter for the Pre-Trip Inspection tests for the CDL. 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.500
For that I had to “listen” to listen to a person speak for 10 minutes.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.500
VESID believed that I only needed to get a Class B License. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.500
So, I had to get my trainer to convince VESID that I needed a Class A License.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.500
Brenda and Jack are not alone as there are many others out there like them.  

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.500
This occurs because of a federal regulation. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.500
US Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)  

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.500
Physical and Qualification Examination Requirements number: 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.500
For the past four years, I've been working closely with Brenda about truck drivers.  

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.500
At first, I doubted that this was a problem, because many deaf people have good vision. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.500
I could not understand why deaf people could not drive trucks. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.500
Brenda did her research and came back with a lot more evidence.  

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.500
I had a lot of cool information and I could still not understand why this was a problem.  

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.500
I decided to contact the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) and ask them why Deaf Truck Drivers were banned from driving.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.500
NAD explained that they were aware of the situation and that this was an ongoing problem for the past 20 years.  

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.500
After asking what to do, NAD recommended focusing on intrastate licenses. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.500
I've talked with some truck drivers and they said that these days trucks have special warning lights.  

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.500
They even have a built in camera that helps see behind the vehicle. If there is something wrong, the truck will not move.  

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.500
The person then has to go around and check the truck. There is also other technology that deaf drivers can benefit from.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.900
Hearing drivers admit that they do not understand why someone would need to hear a whisper 5 feet behind the truck.  

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:53.500
In addition, behind the cab is a muffler that is really loud.  Sometimes while driving they can't hear anything. 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.500
So they question why anyone would need to hear a whisper to get their CDL.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.500
In addition, deaf people found a special technology that will allow them to call out with their TTY.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.900
The worst part for them is the ongoing requirements for their audiological examination.  They need to visit too many times.  

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.500
For example, they first have to visit a doctor.  The doctor will speak behind his or her hands. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.500
Because the drivers can't hear they fail. 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.500
Then, the drivers have to visit an audiologist who will give them a test and fail them. 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.500
Then, they have to visit the Department of Transportation for a test in a special audiology room that they have to pass.  

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.500
These steps are more complicated than necessary.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.500
Many deaf people say that there are enough technological resources out there and they have had no problems driving.  

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.500
Remember, the muffler from behind the cab.  

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
That muffler causes driver hearing loss due to the loud noise it makes.  

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.500
Many hearing drivers, as their hearing declines, fear losing their jobs. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.500
Then, they fear losing their licenses.  This really impacts the hearing and hard of hearing communities.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.500
Many deaf people already have been driving around with no problem.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.500
Many people have realized that it's about truck driving skill not hearing. 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.500
We are fighting to remove the hearing requirements of the CDL physical requirements.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.500
The test should be  about driving skill, not hearing.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.500
I chose to approach Assembly member Mark J. F. Schroeder.  

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.500
who used to work for St. Mary School for the Deaf.   

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.500
Second, his former student who used to drive a truck is currently struggling to get his CDL License.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.500
Third, he could sign.  

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.500
I met with him, explained the situation and showed him the evidence.  

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.500
I added that NAD suggested an intrastate law was needed. 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.500
He was willing to help us out by introducing a bill in the NYS Assembly.  

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.500
We need your help once this bill arrives on the floor.  

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.500
Please look for it and support the fact that deaf people can drive trucks in New York State. 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.500
Thank you very much, bye.
