little bigger than normal traditional

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.559 
little bigger than normal traditional
origami<00:01:27.619> paper<00:01:27.979> it's<00:01:28.310> 19<00:01:28.670> by<00:01:28.819> 19<00:01:29.240> centimeters

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
origami paper it's 19 by 19 centimeters

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:32.199 
origami paper it's 19 by 19 centimeters
and<00:01:29.990> that's<00:01:30.740> not<00:01:30.979> actually<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:31.940> know<00:01:32.030> usually

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:32.209 
and that's not actually you know usually

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:34.270 
and that's not actually you know usually
the<00:01:32.599> larger<00:01:32.959> paper<00:01:33.140> is<00:01:33.380> like<00:01:33.500> 17<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.250> half

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
the larger paper is like 17 and a half

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.279 
the larger paper is like 17 and a half
by<00:01:34.819> 17<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:35.300> half<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:35.630> sort<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:35.899> this<00:01:35.990> kind<00:01:36.140> of

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
by 17 a half so sort of this kind of

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.010 
by 17 a half so sort of this kind of
strange<00:01:36.619> in<00:01:36.920> between<00:01:37.220> size<00:01:37.490> but<00:01:37.910> still<00:01:38.810> really

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
strange in between size but still really

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.130 
strange in between size but still really
cool<00:01:39.349> and<00:01:39.619> I<00:01:39.979> just<00:01:40.490> love<00:01:40.789> the<00:01:41.000> texture<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:41.750> I

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
cool and I just love the texture so I

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.949 
cool and I just love the texture so I
wanted<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.679> show<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:42.890> guys<00:01:43.039> how<00:01:43.220> pretty<00:01:43.700> it<00:01:43.849> is

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.570 

now<00:01:47.959> the<00:01:48.080> nice<00:01:48.289> thing<00:01:48.319> about<00:01:48.619> it<00:01:48.979> is<00:01:49.099> that<00:01:49.130> it's

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
now the nice thing about it is that it's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.359 
now the nice thing about it is that it's
not<00:01:49.700> thick<00:01:50.660> like<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.349> bazzill<00:01:51.679> paper<00:01:51.950> so<00:01:52.340> you

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
not thick like the bazzill paper so you

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.639 
not thick like the bazzill paper so you
can<00:01:52.490> really<00:01:53.000> fold<00:01:53.569> this<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.170> I<00:01:54.319> don't<00:01:54.380> if<00:01:54.530> you

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
can really fold this and I don't if you

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.859 
can really fold this and I don't if you
guys<00:01:54.830> can<00:01:55.069> see<00:01:55.099> how<00:01:55.580> beautiful<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.420> texture

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
guys can see how beautiful the texture

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.160 
guys can see how beautiful the texture
is<00:01:56.899> of<00:01:57.200> this<00:01:57.580> wow<00:01:58.580> it's<00:01:58.789> gorgeous<00:01:59.030> it's<00:01:59.840> almost

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
on the other side with the fiber and

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.730

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
it's a nice thick weight paper I would

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.250 
it's a nice thick weight paper I would
think<00:02:34.040> if<00:02:34.400> once<00:02:34.820> once<00:02:35.240> it<00:02:35.360> gets<00:02:35.510> humid<00:02:35.690> here<00:02:36.080> it

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
think if once once it gets humid here it

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.510 
think if once once it gets humid here it
will<00:02:36.320> kind<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.620> hold<00:02:36.860> its<00:02:37.040> weight<00:02:37.220> kind<00:02:37.460> of

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
will kind of hold its weight kind of

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.360 
will kind of hold its weight kind of
like<00:02:37.640> regular<00:02:37.970> wha<00:02:38.540> she<00:02:38.600> does<00:02:39.190> there's<00:02:40.190> this

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
like regular wha she does there's this

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.270 
like regular wha she does there's this
nice<00:02:40.720> paper<00:02:41.720> here<00:02:42.320> and<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.710> is<00:02:42.740> double-sided

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
nice paper here and it is double-sided

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.730 
nice paper here and it is double-sided
but<00:02:43.700> it's<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.330> same<00:02:44.570> pattern<00:02:44.990> both<00:02:45.200> sides<00:02:45.500> but

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
but it's the same pattern both sides but

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.250 
but it's the same pattern both sides but
the<00:02:45.920> slight<00:02:46.220> difference<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:46.930> this<00:02:47.930> is

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
the slight difference is that this is

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.310 
the slight difference is that this is
more<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.740> like<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.610> printed<00:02:50.300> remains<00:02:50.750> and

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
more of like the printed remains and

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.230 
more of like the printed remains and
then<00:02:51.470> this<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.890> actual<00:02:52.040> embossed<00:02:52.760> side

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
then this is the actual embossed side

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.160 
then this is the actual embossed side
and<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:55.160> almost<00:02:55.310> kind<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:55.820> looks<00:02:56.030> like<00:02:56.170> you

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
and it almost kind of looks like you

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.600 
and it almost kind of looks like you
know<00:02:57.320> like<00:02:58.720> mold<00:02:59.720> like<00:03:00.080> moss<00:03:00.770> or<00:03:01.070> something<00:03:01.460> is

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
know like mold like moss or something is

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.220

because<00:05:27.440> the<00:05:27.560> paper<00:05:27.740> is<00:05:27.950> a<00:05:28.130> little<00:05:28.490> higher

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
because the paper is a little higher

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.880 
because the paper is a little higher
quality<00:05:29.120> a<00:05:29.180> little<00:05:29.390> thicker<00:05:29.660> the<00:05:30.290> creases<00:05:30.710> are
