00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.020 
program mode and when you get the amount
of<00:01:58.560> milk<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.890> want<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.219> there<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.670> push<00:01:59.880> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
of milk you want in there you push the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.790 
of milk you want in there you push the
button

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
button

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.340 
button
then<00:02:00.980> when<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.160> go<00:02:01.310> through<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.940> shot<00:02:02.180> it<00:02:03.170> will

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
then when I go through the shot it will

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.990 
then when I go through the shot it will
automatically<00:02:03.920> go<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.400> shop<00:02:04.610> when<00:02:04.940> you

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
automatically go to the shop when you

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.090 
automatically go to the shop when you
get<00:02:05.120> the<00:02:05.240> amount<00:02:05.420> of<00:02:05.630> shot<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:06.080> want<00:02:06.230> espresso

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
in there push the button again and that

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.730 
in there push the button again and that
is<00:02:08.930> program

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
is program

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.830 
is program
I<00:02:09.770> see<00:02:10.070> so<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.670> hold<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.270> down<00:02:11.390> until<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.750> goes

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
I see so you hold it down until it goes

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.570 
I see so you hold it down until it goes
into<00:02:12.110> programming<00:02:12.260> mode<00:02:12.620> then<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.160> just<00:02:13.340> kind

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
into programming mode then you just kind

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.160 
into programming mode then you just kind
of<00:02:13.670> step<00:02:13.880> back<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.390> then<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.810> hit<00:02:15.020> it<00:02:15.110> again

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
of step back and then you hit it again

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.600 
of step back and then you hit it again
when<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.590> want<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.920> stop<00:02:16.100> for<00:02:16.280> milk<00:02:16.430> and

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
when you want it to stop for milk and

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.500 
when you want it to stop for milk and
that's<00:02:16.730> exactly<00:02:16.910> right<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.870> can<00:02:18.050> program

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
that's exactly right and you can program

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.690 
that's exactly right and you can program
these<00:02:20.510> are<00:02:20.570> coffee<00:02:21.530> drinks<00:02:21.920> over<00:02:22.040> here<00:02:22.130> uh-huh

and<00:02:23.000> whatever<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.750> program<00:02:24.140> into<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:24.560> one<00:02:24.860> I

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
and whatever you program into this one I

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.470 
and whatever you program into this one I
mean<00:02:25.460> you<00:02:25.550> can<00:02:25.670> program<00:02:25.850> whatever<00:02:26.240> you<00:02:26.330> want

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
mean you can program whatever you want

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.830 
mean you can program whatever you want
to<00:02:26.750> those<00:02:26.900> all<00:02:27.290> right<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:28.100> these<00:02:29.030> are<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.330> milk

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
you said you had a little trick that you

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.280 
you said you had a little trick that you
well<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.700> noticed<00:02:56.270> that<00:02:56.420> if<00:02:56.570> you<00:02:56.600> push<00:02:57.020> it<00:02:57.170> in

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
well I noticed that if you push it in

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.590 
well I noticed that if you push it in
just<00:02:57.620> slightly<00:02:57.890> off<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.370> number<00:02:59.210> two<00:02:59.390> the

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
just slightly off the number two the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.880 
just slightly off the number two the
foam<00:02:59.780> seemed<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.200> be<00:03:00.320> just<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.620> little<00:03:00.650> bit

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
foam seemed to be just a little bit

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.580 
foam seemed to be just a little bit
better<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.880> better<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.240> little<00:03:02.510> finer<00:03:02.870> yeah

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
better and better a little finer yeah

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.620 
better and better a little finer yeah
okay<00:03:04.070> so<00:03:04.430> you're<00:03:04.910> going<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.060> make<00:03:05.180> us<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.390> latte

right<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:14.900> where's<00:03:15.890> where's<00:03:16.250> water<00:03:16.580> at<00:03:16.880> oh<00:03:17.200> I

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
right and where's where's water at oh I

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.920 
right and where's where's water at oh I
think<00:03:18.410> that's<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:18.739> real<00:03:18.890> water<00:03:19.310> this<00:03:19.640> is<00:03:20.360> no

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
think that's a real water this is no

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.720 
think that's a real water this is no
it's<00:03:21.080> right<00:03:21.230> behind<00:03:21.380> here<00:03:21.709> come<00:03:22.400> try<00:03:22.580> that

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.230 
we figured that out mm-hmm it's got the
bypass<00:06:11.260> doser<00:06:11.590> I<00:06:12.160> would<00:06:12.490> say<00:06:12.670> the<00:06:12.850> only<00:06:13.060> thing

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
bypass doser I would say the only thing

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.930 
bypass doser I would say the only thing
that<00:06:13.390> I<00:06:13.420> would<00:06:13.540> like<00:06:13.990> to<00:06:14.140> see<00:06:14.320> more<00:06:14.590> on<00:06:14.950> this<00:06:15.640> is

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
that I would like to see more on this is

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.120 
that I would like to see more on this is
that<00:06:16.150> it<00:06:16.330> would<00:06:16.480> grind<00:06:16.690> more<00:06:17.230> grams<00:06:17.650> of<00:06:17.890> coffee

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
that it would grind more grams of coffee

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.470 
that it would grind more grams of coffee
to<00:06:18.340> be<00:06:18.430> brewed<00:06:18.700> through<00:06:18.910> to<00:06:19.060> make<00:06:19.180> it<00:06:19.210> a<00:06:19.330> little

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
to be brewed through to make it a little

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.200 
to be brewed through to make it a little
bit<00:06:19.600> stronger<00:06:19.840> okay<00:06:20.290> all<00:06:21.100> right<00:06:21.280> cool

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
bit stronger okay all right cool

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.000 
bit stronger okay all right cool
you<00:06:22.330> can<00:06:22.480> just<00:06:22.630> cut<00:06:22.810> back<00:06:22.840> on<00:06:23.140> the<00:06:23.230> water<00:06:23.380> yeah

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
you can just cut back on the water yeah

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.650 
you can just cut back on the water yeah
but<00:06:24.580> that<00:06:24.760> would<00:06:24.910> be<00:06:24.940> the<00:06:25.030> one<00:06:25.210> thing<00:06:25.390> I<00:06:25.510> guess

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
but that would be the one thing I guess

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.530 
but that would be the one thing I guess
I<00:06:25.780> would<00:06:25.810> take<00:06:26.140> a<00:06:26.410> little<00:06:26.740> stronger<00:06:27.120> coffee<00:06:28.120> or

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 
I would take a little stronger coffee or

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.090 
I would take a little stronger coffee or
stronger<00:06:28.900> more<00:06:29.020> grams<00:06:29.290> okay<00:06:29.710> now<00:06:30.010> on<00:06:30.070> the

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.100 
stronger more grams okay now on the

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.800 
stronger more grams okay now on the
bypass<00:06:30.460> dose<00:06:30.730> you<00:06:30.910> can<00:06:31.030> only<00:06:31.180> put<00:06:31.390> one<00:06:31.540> scoop

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
bypass dose you can only put one scoop

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.330 
bypass dose you can only put one scoop
in<00:06:32.020> and<00:06:32.170> that's<00:06:32.290> typical<00:06:32.800> except<00:06:33.130> for<00:06:33.280> the
