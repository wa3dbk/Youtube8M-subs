00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.660
 we show you a three times mask today 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.340
 and a simple peeling for the summer 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.590
 have on quite a lot of products now 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.400
 uses the really good for your skin 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.380
 if you are maybe a 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.600
 have a bit of sunburn or a little bit 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.600
 just want more relaxation and 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.369
 for our feeling we have now 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.260
 decided once grow coffee powder 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.079
 coffee powder simply known for that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.120
 The skin is so vitalized 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.879
 Give her a bit more energy 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.129
 Then we come again sugar 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.969
 and sugar is just great for 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.860
 this feeling effect he takes yours 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.320
 old skin scales just off the well 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.600
 tend to be easy on the skin from 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.340
 to store and inspire 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.350
 so that's really good for you 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.180
 just the old skin off properly 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.640
 spits and these two things 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.909
 we still have one to unite 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.330
 Serve a bit with olive oil and olive oil 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.470
 now for the first time as a binder for both 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.689
 additions and of course for 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.700
 Moisture you can open your skin 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.159
 no case too dry out but 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.140
 just trying since so good to degree 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.689
 find between the clean and 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.000
 Nevertheless, the moisture of that 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.530
 our three ingredients for the peeling and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.200
 we also know you directly on mission 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.049
 So you know the quantity information 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.030
 on a tablespoon oriented and indeed 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.750
 I take here for two tablespoons of 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.750
 the sugar 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.010
 that's three tablespoons of the cafÃ© 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.110
 About 50 believe you have to go there 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.720
 Look how exactly you usually do it 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.640
 but I'll take three here 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:57.920
 tablespoon and then I still use of 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.110
 about 1 tablespoon and olive oil 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.410
 mix the whole thing into a homogeneous one 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.410
 Dimensions 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.590
 if you should notice that the mass 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.600
 The former las would not work out well 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.700
 then do not be afraid, just have one more 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.440
 bit more uni wants to make pure 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.140
 You just have to look that you have one 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.660
 good mass and all ingredients 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.459
 are well mingled with each other and theirs 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.459
 can apply to just on face 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.570
 So when you 're done and everyone 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.970
 ingredients then mixed together 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.180
 your mass should look like 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.130
 just that a little 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.780
 is moistened and good on the face 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.330
 or stick to the skin 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.310
 stays and yes as soon as we did that 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.200
 We can already have started 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.530
 Just smeared it like that 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.650
 celebrated game comes to the face 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.019
 still how much a mask made that is 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.690
 also quite simply needed only first 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.940
 so good or quad we have it now 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.870
 greek yogurt and that gives 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.549
 just the skin a bit 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.040
 Moisture that really means now 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.680
 great and then you can either 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.890
 practice coconut 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.439
 and wish that into the mask with three 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.030
 that it could be very caring and that too 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.670
 also just on your lips between 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.099
 Give cattle or am under the eyes 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.689
 It is also very vitalizing and you 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.489
 But if you do not have that, you can 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.659
 Coconut oil 's just not in the 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.579
 supermarket to buy 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.040
 also just use a bit of honey 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.739
 instead of the coconut oil had the 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.019
 balancing effect for the skin and also 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.170
 do a little bit of moisture like this 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.260
 which only now fetches and needs of it 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.810
 you just put two tablespoons in it 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.069
 to give a bowl 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.220
 First of all, it's really important simply because 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.950
 actually only needs three ingredients and 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.540
 Coconut oil is now too 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.359
 a bit liquid because they are the 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:57.879
 partly very warm the animal just two 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:59.500
 teaspoon and if you want you can 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.389
 have a bit of sugar to give 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.540
 then this mask also has an easy one 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.540
 pine effect as you already peeling 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.040
 You really do not need to do that 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.250
 and now just compared it all 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.250
 No 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.150
 yummy is never good 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.740
 that is all 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.639
 actually been and now has one 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.439
 very delicious the mask under me me 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.460
 now the same as on face 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.979
 apply 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.499
 So we are now our finished 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.610
 Peel our finished mask once 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:40.009
 apply 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.689
 We do it best with our hands 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.610
 were and then a better feeling 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.770
 simply has the thickness on the already 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.939
 the skin is lying and where something is missing 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.020
 and it just gets better 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.330
 to distribute 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:05:04.729
 and yes I would say just understand 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:05:06.830
 directly it is the most I hold 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.680
 pretty cool all the time even if this 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:13.479
 a bit of sunburn has projects 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.479
 equipped scanners 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:25.310
 peeling feels very good 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:28.490
 That made us very good on the skin 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.830
 also think that the coffee grains just 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.919
 give an additional effect so 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.839
 Now not only the dogs sugar exactly 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:41.389
 that's why I think that's a real one 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:43.639
 mission also the peeling and the mask 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:46.819
 like to apply on your decollete 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:50.020
 that can also do quite well if 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:52.520
 like you and do let their cash 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.500
 what you do with the peeling back then 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.930
 You can just do it at the end 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.689
 a bit about your lips over to 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.029
 go 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:02.699
 Just the dead ones are one 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:05.009
 to remove something really good 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.979
 pouty mouth and just a super soft 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:10.769
 skin will give and this mask can 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.399
 you move in so now 15 minutes 

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:14.249
 to let 

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:16.019
 after that , just wash it off so 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.939
 wise I am synonymous with the video we 

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:20.639
 let that work a little bit now 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:23.099
 and then wash it off and 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.829
 You can find more here below 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.569
 two more videos and you can 

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:30.779
 Send it as well if you can 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:33.050
 should imitate and see us as 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.050
 Bank
