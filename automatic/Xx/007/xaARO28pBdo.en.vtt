00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.620 

what<00:06:40.170> take<00:06:41.170> that<00:06:41.320> as<00:06:41.440> a<00:06:41.470> yes<00:06:42.210> he<00:06:43.210> talked<00:06:43.540> about

him<00:06:44.050> a<00:06:44.430> lot<00:06:45.490> I<00:06:46.950> guess<00:06:47.950> he<00:06:48.250> had<00:06:48.550> an<00:06:48.700> antibody

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270

him a lot I guess he had an antibody
that<00:06:49.540> could<00:06:49.690> fight<00:06:49.960> off<00:06:50.170> any<00:06:50.380> virus

that could fight off any virus
