00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
same ones that we saw working earlier on

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.800 
same ones that we saw working earlier on
let's<00:02:07.520> try<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:08.479> hard<00:02:08.690> drive<00:02:08.959> first<00:02:09.789> placing

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
let's try the hard drive first placing

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.129 
let's try the hard drive first placing
use<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.049> flash<00:02:13.010> drive<00:02:13.340> goes<00:02:13.579> in<00:02:13.730> here<00:02:16.120> now

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:17.139 
use the flash drive goes in here now

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:19.720 
use the flash drive goes in here now
heart<00:02:18.139> that's<00:02:18.889> how<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.190> works

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
heart that's how this works

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.690 
heart that's how this works
or<00:02:20.480> rather<00:02:21.489> doesn't<00:02:22.489> work<00:02:23.230> they<00:02:24.230> do

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
or rather doesn't work they do

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
play any normal avi through yes Toshiba

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.990 
play any normal avi through yes Toshiba
and<00:03:14.139> very<00:03:15.139> pure<00:03:15.440> Toshiba<00:03:16.400> won't<00:03:16.579> do<00:03:16.700> anything

and very pure Toshiba won't do anything

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.240 
and very pure Toshiba won't do anything
about<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:18.620> think<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.980> they're

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
about it and I think that they're

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.789 
about it and I think that they're
completely<00:03:20.239> out<00:03:20.420> of<00:03:20.540> order<00:03:20.780> these<00:03:21.560> are

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
completely out of order these are

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.819 
completely out of order these are
ordinary<00:03:22.370> avi<00:03:23.030> files<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:23.689> you<00:03:23.900> now<00:03:24.079> would

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
ordinary avi files that you now would

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.179 
ordinary avi files that you now would
