00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
built and it works like this you can

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.190 
built and it works like this you can
scrap<00:01:04.880> items<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> world<00:01:06.360> for<00:01:06.600> materials

and<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:07.500> use<00:01:07.890> those<00:01:08.220> materials<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.990> build

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
and then use those materials to build

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.640 
and then use those materials to build
the<00:01:10.560> way<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.770> want<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:15.140> one<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> great

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
can plant food water and even power

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
can plant food water and even power
generators<00:02:10.890> alright<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.430> generators

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
generators alright so the generators

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.510 
generators alright so the generators
will<00:02:13.480> power<00:02:13.750> things<00:02:14.380> through<00:02:14.710> switches<00:02:15.280> that

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
will power things through switches that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.940 
will power things through switches that
require<00:02:15.880> power<00:02:16.120> lights<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.110> other<00:02:17.230> items<00:02:17.500> and

require power lights and other items and

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.460 
require power lights and other items and
then<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.550> run<00:02:18.790> wires<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.780> connect<00:02:20.170> them<00:02:20.350> all

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
then you run wires that connect them all

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.990 
then you run wires that connect them all
and<00:02:20.710> again<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.640> just<00:02:21.940> works<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:24.730> can<00:02:24.880> also

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
and again it just works you can also

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.360 
and again it just works you can also
build<00:02:25.270> your<00:02:25.480> own<00:02:25.510> terminals<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.800> hook<00:02:27.130> to

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
build your own terminals that hook to

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.950 
build your own terminals that hook to
this<00:02:27.490> power<00:02:28.060> grid<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.660> then<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.840> could

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
this power grid and then you could

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.680 
this power grid and then you could
control<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:30.490> various<00:02:30.940> things<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.390> tweak

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
control the various things and tweak

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.440 
control the various things and tweak
them<00:02:31.960> all<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.790> power<00:02:33.970> lines<00:02:34.330> are

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
them all that the power lines are

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.370 
them all that the power lines are
connected<00:02:34.900> to

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:50.540 

this<00:02:39.190> includes<00:02:39.550> things<00:02:39.820> like<00:02:39.970> turrets

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.540 

because<00:02:51.550> you<00:02:51.670> do<00:02:51.850> want<00:02:51.880> to<00:02:52.150> build<00:02:52.300> defenses

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
because you do want to build defenses

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.830 
because you do want to build defenses
because<00:02:54.550> your<00:02:54.730> settlements<00:02:55.240> can<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.720> will

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
because your settlements can and will

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:11.010 
because your settlements can and will
get<00:02:56.020> attacked<00:02:56.320> by<00:02:57.190> Raiders

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.630 

so<00:03:12.020> it's<00:03:12.260> fun<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.770> build<00:03:12.980> up<00:03:13.220> something

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
so it's fun to build up something

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.250 
so it's fun to build up something
yourself<00:03:13.760> in<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.330> game<00:03:14.510> that<00:03:14.540> usually<00:03:15.080> you'll

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260
