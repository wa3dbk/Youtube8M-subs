order to record what happens in response
to<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.640> recall<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.660> this<00:03:30.840> is<00:03:30.960> a<00:03:30.990> real<00:03:31.230> test

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
to the recall so this is a real test

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.950 
to the recall so this is a real test
because<00:03:32.220> as<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:32.730> say<00:03:32.880> there's<00:03:33.120> three<00:03:33.330> dogs<00:03:33.570> one

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
because as I say there's three dogs one

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.320 
because as I say there's three dogs one
of<00:03:34.050> them<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.290> six-and-a-half<00:03:34.710> months<00:03:35.070> old<00:03:35.400> and
