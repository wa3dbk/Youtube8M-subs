00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
bought the groceries that he had claimed

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.130 
bought the groceries that he had claimed
to<00:03:35.030> bought<00:03:35.440> but<00:03:36.440> that<00:03:36.650> would<00:03:36.860> mean<00:03:37.900> at<00:03:38.900> that

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
to bought but that would mean at that

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:57.069 
to bought but that would mean at that
time<00:03:39.380> they<00:03:39.620> would<00:03:39.739> have<00:03:39.829> gone<00:03:39.950> bad<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.870> looks

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
time they would have gone bad it looks

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.490 
time they would have gone bad it looks
like<00:03:57.290> we<00:03:57.530> have<00:03:57.769> a<00:03:57.799> match<00:03:59.470> and<00:04:00.879> what's<00:04:01.879> this

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
like we have a match and what's this

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:12.069 
like we have a match and what's this
clerks<00:04:09.310> wondering<00:04:10.310> I<00:04:10.630> think<00:04:11.630> he's<00:04:11.810> onto

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
clerks wondering I think he's onto

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.949 
clerks wondering I think he's onto
something

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
something

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.580 
something
look<00:04:14.959> at<00:04:15.079> that<00:04:16.690> that<00:04:17.690> means<00:04:18.049> that<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.440> only

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
look at that that means that the only

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.610 
look at that that means that the only
person<00:04:18.919> who<00:04:19.070> cooked<00:04:19.340> on<00:04:19.519> this<00:04:20.350> was<00:04:21.350> Dean

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
person who cooked on this was Dean

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.409 
person who cooked on this was Dean
there's<00:04:22.280> no<00:04:22.400> way<00:04:22.550> could<00:04:22.729> have<00:04:22.849> been<00:04:23.000> that<00:04:23.210> way

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
there's no way could have been that way

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.930 
there's no way could have been that way
because<00:04:23.630> his<00:04:24.349> ski<00:04:24.710> ticket<00:04:25.070> has<00:04:25.310> a<00:04:25.340> time<00:04:25.639> stamp

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
because his ski ticket has a time stamp

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.150 
because his ski ticket has a time stamp
which<00:04:26.330> proves<00:04:26.660> he<00:04:26.870> wasn't<00:04:27.169> there<00:04:27.320> that's<00:04:27.950> just

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
which proves he wasn't there that's just

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.250 
which proves he wasn't there that's just
coincidence<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:29.470> don't<00:04:30.470> think<00:04:30.680> so<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:33.080> see

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
coincidence I don't think so you see

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.210 
coincidence I don't think so you see
here<00:04:34.419> the<00:04:35.419> victim<00:04:35.720> left<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:35.990> dying<00:04:36.229> message<00:04:36.470> to

spot where the lighter belonged is the
