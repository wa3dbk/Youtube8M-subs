00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
method of displaying 3d is the glasses

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.520 
method of displaying 3d is the glasses
are<00:00:48.640> far<00:00:48.940> less<00:00:49.149> expensive<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:49.899> the<00:00:50.200> TV

in<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.450> box

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
in the box

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.650 
in the box
the<00:00:53.710> disadvantage<00:00:54.309> of<00:00:54.430> passive<00:00:54.850> 3d<00:00:55.270> is<00:00:55.449> that

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
the disadvantage of passive 3d is that

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.750 
the disadvantage of passive 3d is that
it's<00:00:55.809> only<00:00:55.989> half<00:00:56.469> the<00:00:56.710> resolution<00:00:57.280> of<00:00:57.399> active

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
it's only half the resolution of active

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.760 
it's only half the resolution of active
3d<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:58.360> thus<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.690> 3d<00:00:58.989> picture<00:00:59.170> should<00:00:59.590> have

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
3d and thus the 3d picture should have

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.970 
3d and thus the 3d picture should have
less<00:01:00.219> depth<00:01:00.730> effect<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:02.140> noted<00:01:02.530> some<00:01:02.770> blurring

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
less depth effect we noted some blurring
