00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.410 
quarter-square triangle borders I've cut
all<00:00:22.650> my<00:00:22.769> triangles<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:23.460> my<00:00:23.580> border<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.240> I'm

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
all my triangles for my border so I'm

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.999 
all my triangles for my border so I'm
ready<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.900> piece<00:00:25.080> them<00:00:25.230> together<00:00:25.349> but<00:00:25.740> first

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
ready to piece them together but first

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.800 
ready to piece them together but first
thing<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.340> do<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.670> mark<00:00:27.060> them<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.570> want

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
thing to do is mark them and what I want

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.259 
thing to do is mark them and what I want
to<00:00:27.929> do<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.259> mark<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.189> point<00:00:29.609> at<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
to do is mark a point at the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.849 
to do is mark a point at the
intersection<00:00:30.839> of<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> quarter<00:00:31.439> inch<00:00:31.589> for

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
intersection of the quarter inch for

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.980 
intersection of the quarter inch for
that<00:00:32.040> seam<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.400> that<00:00:32.790> seam<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.300> then<00:00:33.840> what<00:00:33.960> I

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 
that seam and that seam and then what I

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.230 
that seam and that seam and then what I
can<00:00:34.080> do<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.560> I<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:34.830> match<00:00:35.280> those<00:00:35.790> when<00:00:36.210> I

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.240 
can do is I can match those when I

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.840 
can do is I can match those when I
stitch<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.050> will<00:00:37.350> get<00:00:37.560> a<00:00:37.770> perfect<00:00:38.550> match

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
stitch so I will get a perfect match

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.230 
stitch so I will get a perfect match
this<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> trick<00:00:40.160> you<00:00:41.160> can<00:00:41.340> use<00:00:41.490> any<00:00:41.760> tool

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 
this is the trick you can use any tool

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.390 
this is the trick you can use any tool
that<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.630> like<00:00:42.810> but<00:00:42.990> I<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.650> prep<00:00:44.130> tool

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
that you like but I like this prep tool

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.340 
that you like but I like this prep tool
made<00:00:44.700> by<00:00:44.730> guidelines<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.570> quilting<00:00:45.990> because

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
made by guidelines for quilting because

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.710 
made by guidelines for quilting because
it<00:00:46.890> has<00:00:47.130> this<00:00:47.310> little<00:00:47.580> edge<00:00:47.790> these<00:00:48.330> little

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
it has this little edge these little

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.810 
it has this little edge these little
guys<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> edge<00:00:49.470> that<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.220> just<00:00:50.520> line<00:00:50.790> up

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
guys on the edge that you just line up

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.450 
guys on the edge that you just line up
they<00:00:51.210> they're<00:00:51.690> thicker<00:00:52.440> than<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.980> plastic

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
they they're thicker than this plastic

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.490 
they they're thicker than this plastic
part<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.820> they<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.270> right<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> raw

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
part so they but right up to the raw

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.470 
part so they but right up to the raw
edge<00:00:55.740> of<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:55.980> fabric<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.330> really

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
edge of the fabric and so it's really

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.330 
edge of the fabric and so it's really
easy<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.810> place<00:00:58.110> and<00:00:58.410> then<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.890> mark<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
easy to place and then you just mark a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.010 
easy to place and then you just mark a
line<00:00:59.490> there<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.000> there's<00:01:00.240> my<00:01:00.480> point<00:01:00.810> I

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
line there and so there's my point I

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.440 
line there and so there's my point I
will<00:01:01.830> mark<00:01:02.070> all<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.610> these<00:01:02.790> and<00:01:03.120> I'll<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
will mark all of these and I'll do the

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.109 
will mark all of these and I'll do the
corner<00:01:03.870> actually<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.830> exact<00:01:05.250> same<00:01:05.549> way<00:01:05.790> let

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
corner actually the exact same way let

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.219 
corner actually the exact same way let
me<00:01:06.150> pull<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.420> down<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:06.930> you

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
me pull that down for you

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.899 
me pull that down for you
I'll<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:08.009> that<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> same<00:01:08.460> way<00:01:08.520> because<00:01:08.820> I'll

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
I'll do that the same way because I'll

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.800 
I'll do that the same way because I'll
just<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.329> like<00:01:09.539> that<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.880> like<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.329> then

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
just do like that and like this and then

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.109 
just do like that and like this and then
I<00:01:12.840> know<00:01:12.990> exactly<00:01:13.170> where<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.909> there

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
I know exactly where that is right there

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.490 
I know exactly where that is right there
and<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.329> make<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.630> little<00:01:15.750> darker<00:01:16.020> because

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and to make this a little darker because

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.080 
and to make this a little darker because
you're<00:01:16.619> not<00:01:16.679> be<00:01:16.799> able<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.429> now<00:01:17.939> I'm

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
you're not be able to see it and now I'm

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.849 
you're not be able to see it and now I'm
ready<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.390> put<00:01:18.659> two<00:01:18.810> pieces<00:01:19.170> together<00:01:19.380> in

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:19.859 
ready to put two pieces together in

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:22.429 
ready to put two pieces together in
order<00:01:20.429> to<00:01:20.549> get<00:01:20.700> them<00:01:20.850> ready<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.210> sew<00:01:21.420> now<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
order to get them ready to sew now the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.230 
order to get them ready to sew now the
first<00:01:22.740> thing<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.880> my<00:01:23.939> head<00:01:24.210> on

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
first thing I do is get my head on

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.239 
first thing I do is get my head on
straight<00:01:24.359> I'm<00:01:25.079> going<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.469> lay<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.799> out<00:01:26.039> just

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:26.249 
straight I'm going to lay this out just

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:27.889 
straight I'm going to lay this out just
that<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.789> sure<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.299> I'm<00:01:27.390> doing<00:01:27.689> things

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
that I can be sure that I'm doing things

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.620 
that I can be sure that I'm doing things
correctly<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.909> shows<00:01:30.179> you<00:01:30.299> three<00:01:30.539> of

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
correctly and that shows you three of

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.969 
correctly and that shows you three of
them<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:30.929> you<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.049> see<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> way<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.560> board<00:01:31.859> is

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
them so you can see the way the board is

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.919 
them so you can see the way the board is
going<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> progress<00:01:32.460> along<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.479> I'll<00:01:33.569> take<00:01:33.780> my

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
going to progress along so I'll take my
