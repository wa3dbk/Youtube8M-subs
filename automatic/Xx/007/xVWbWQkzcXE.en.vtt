think<00:02:27.870> evolution<00:02:28.230> stone<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.830> make<00:02:29.250> them<00:02:29.459> find

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
think evolution stone to make them find

evolution stone but mega evolution stone
so<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.489> evolve<00:02:32.670> into<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.150> type<00:02:33.480> of

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
so you can evolve into that type of

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.510 
so you can evolve into that type of
priority<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.260> pokemon<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.340> course

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
priority of the pokemon and of course

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
priority of the pokemon and of course
you<00:02:35.610> got<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.850> probably<00:02:36.120> build<00:02:36.360> up<00:02:36.510> your

you got to probably build up your
friendship<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.020> that's<00:02:37.230> probably<00:02:37.380> where<00:02:37.620> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
friendship and that's probably where the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.050 
friendship and that's probably where the
poke<00:02:37.860> amount<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.190> meat<00:02:38.340> thing<00:02:38.550> comes<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:38.910> handy

poke amount of meat thing comes in handy

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.150 
poke amount of meat thing comes in handy
with<00:02:39.330> super<00:02:39.690> training<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.709> there's<00:02:40.920> that

with super training so there's that

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.340 
with super training so there's that
we're<00:02:41.730> less<00:02:41.940> than<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.150> fucking<00:02:42.480> month<00:02:42.630> away<00:02:42.989> for

we're less than a fucking month away for
x<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.650> y<00:02:43.830> less<00:02:44.400> than<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.610> month<00:02:44.730> or<00:02:44.970> around<00:02:45.180> the

x and y less than a month or around the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.990 
x and y less than a month or around the
month<00:02:45.510> doesn't<00:02:46.110> matter<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:47.130> that's<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.670> and

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
month doesn't matter so that's that and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.130 
month doesn't matter so that's that and
that's<00:02:48.269> all<00:02:48.420> i<00:02:48.450> wanted<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.750> tell<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:48.930> by<00:02:49.019> him

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
and I guess the Y version was the one I

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.080 
and I guess the Y version was the one I
look<00:02:50.700> like<00:02:50.880> Jesse<00:02:51.269> with<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.600> tail<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.530> 10<00:02:53.090> so

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
look like Jesse with the tail and 10 so

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.630 
look like Jesse with the tail and 10 so

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
about Meg again garner mega gengar is a

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.039 
about Meg again garner mega gengar is a
lot<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:59.010> speculation<00:02:59.580> by<00:02:59.730> him<00:03:00.049> possibly

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
lot of speculation by him possibly

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.229 
lot of speculation by him possibly
having<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.380> left<00:03:01.590> yeah<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.250> mega<00:03:02.549> evolution<00:03:03.120> or

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
having a left yeah a mega evolution or

having a left yeah a mega evolution or
not<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.690> think<00:03:04.470> he<00:03:04.590> probably<00:03:04.769> will<00:03:05.130> because<00:03:05.250> if

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
not I think he probably will because if

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.250 
not I think he probably will because if
he<00:03:05.519> didn't<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.570> wouldn't<00:03:06.720> be<00:03:06.780> shown<00:03:07.049> these

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
he didn't that wouldn't be shown these
