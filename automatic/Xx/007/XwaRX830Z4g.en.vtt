00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
out the fish the evil perch in action

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
out the fish the evil perch in action

here he is making his way along okay I
played<00:00:36.430> about<00:00:36.610> to<00:00:36.790> be<00:00:36.880> a<00:00:36.910> scary<00:00:37.270> guy<00:00:37.480> but<00:00:37.720> it'll

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
played about to be a scary guy but it'll

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.750 
played about to be a scary guy but it'll
take<00:00:38.050> him<00:00:38.140> about<00:00:38.350> 20<00:00:38.650> minutes<00:00:38.950> to<00:00:39.220> cross<00:00:39.730> the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
take him about 20 minutes to cross the

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.730 
take him about 20 minutes to cross the
street<00:00:40.240> but<00:00:40.420> there<00:00:40.600> he<00:00:40.660> goes<00:00:40.840> he<00:00:41.350> uses<00:00:41.620> these

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740 
street but there he goes he uses these

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.910 
street but there he goes he uses these
little<00:00:41.980> spine<00:00:42.370> like<00:00:43.270> spikes<00:00:44.170> which<00:00:44.500> get<00:00:44.740> into

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
little spine like spikes which get into

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.260 
little spine like spikes which get into
the<00:00:45.010> ground<00:00:45.220> and<00:00:45.430> it<00:00:45.550> that<00:00:45.760> allows<00:00:46.030> him<00:00:46.240> to

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
the ground and it that allows him to

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.650 
the ground and it that allows him to
kind<00:00:46.510> of<00:00:46.600> waddle<00:00:47.320> his<00:00:47.530> way<00:00:47.740> through<00:00:48.660> and

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
kind of waddle his way through and

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.500 
kind of waddle his way through and
that's<00:00:49.840> perhaps<00:00:50.079> what<00:00:51.000> one<00:00:52.000> of<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.180> reasons

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
that's perhaps what one of the reasons

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.970 
that's perhaps what one of the reasons
why<00:00:52.720> this<00:00:53.020> fish<00:00:53.230> actually<00:00:53.530> poses<00:00:53.860> a<00:00:53.890> threat

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
why this fish actually poses a threat

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.020 
why this fish actually poses a threat
one<00:00:54.700> because<00:00:55.270> it<00:00:55.600> can<00:00:55.870> do<00:00:56.650> the<00:00:57.430> ocean<00:00:57.790> it<00:00:57.910> can

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
one because it can do the ocean it can

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.240 
one because it can do the ocean it can
do<00:00:58.120> land<00:00:58.390> as<00:00:58.570> well<00:00:58.690> it<00:00:59.079> can<00:00:59.170> live<00:00:59.590> for<00:00:59.950> a<00:00:59.980> week

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
do land as well it can live for a week

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.520 
do land as well it can live for a week
out<00:01:00.460> of<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.850> water<00:01:01.090> which<00:01:01.360> is<00:01:01.570> incredible<00:01:02.470> it

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
out of the water which is incredible it

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.710 
out of the water which is incredible it
can<00:01:02.649> live<00:01:02.800> in<00:01:02.890> saltwater<00:01:03.430> freshwater<00:01:04.030> it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
can live in saltwater freshwater it

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.420 
can live in saltwater freshwater it
could<00:01:04.839> live<00:01:04.989> in<00:01:05.080> six<00:01:05.350> months<00:01:05.770> in<00:01:05.950> muddy

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
could live in six months in muddy

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.740 
could live in six months in muddy
marshes<00:01:06.850> so<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.000> doesn't<00:01:07.180> have<00:01:07.330> to<00:01:07.390> be<00:01:07.479> fully

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
marshes so it doesn't have to be fully

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.030 
marshes so it doesn't have to be fully
submerged<00:01:07.960> in<00:01:08.260> water<00:01:08.290> if<00:01:08.530> it's<00:01:08.650> got<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:08.800> little

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
submerged in water if it's got a little

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.950 
submerged in water if it's got a little
bit<00:01:09.250> of<00:01:09.340> mud<00:01:09.580> moisture<00:01:10.120> it<00:01:10.390> can<00:01:10.659> live<00:01:10.810> there

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
bit of mud moisture it can live there

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.780 
bit of mud moisture it can live there
for<00:01:11.170> months<00:01:11.320> on<00:01:11.530> end<00:01:11.890> that's<00:01:12.490> reason<00:01:12.760> number

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
for months on end that's reason number

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.270 
for months on end that's reason number
one<00:01:13.090> reason<00:01:13.659> number<00:01:13.780> two<00:01:14.080> why<00:01:14.350> ecologists<00:01:15.190> are

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
one reason number two why ecologists are

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.690 
one reason number two why ecologists are
terrified<00:01:15.760> by<00:01:15.790> this<00:01:16.000> tiny<00:01:16.390> two<00:01:16.659> inch<00:01:16.840> fish<00:01:17.110> is

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
terrified by this tiny two inch fish is

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.090 
terrified by this tiny two inch fish is
because<00:01:18.700> if<00:01:19.120> it's<00:01:19.479> swallowed<00:01:19.990> by<00:01:20.290> a<00:01:20.620> different

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
because if it's swallowed by a different

because if it's swallowed by a different
different<00:01:22.000> animal<00:01:22.240> like<00:01:22.330> a<00:01:22.360> bird<00:01:22.600> or<00:01:22.870> a<00:01:23.170> turtle

or even another fish or a turtle bird I
said<00:01:26.409> it<00:01:27.070> blows<00:01:27.670> up<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.330> it<00:01:28.750> gets<00:01:28.840> big<00:01:29.110> like<00:01:29.290> a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
said it blows up and it gets big like a

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.200 
said it blows up and it gets big like a
puffer<00:01:29.740> fish<00:01:29.770> inside<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:30.729> that<00:01:30.820> animals

die the second and get swallowed he
blows<00:01:43.390> up<00:01:43.600> sometimes<00:01:44.229> they<00:01:44.409> can<00:01:44.560> get<00:01:44.650> out

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
blows up sometimes they can get out

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.130 
blows up sometimes they can get out
they'll<00:01:45.040> survive<00:01:45.280> if<00:01:45.610> not<00:01:45.850> they're<00:01:46.750> both<00:01:46.900> dead

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
they'll survive if not they're both dead

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.789 
they'll survive if not they're both dead
so<00:01:47.439> that<00:01:48.189> can<00:01:48.460> potentially<00:01:49.590> devastate<00:01:50.590> the

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
so that can potentially devastate the

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.130 
so that can potentially devastate the
wildlife<00:01:51.250> in<00:01:51.490> Australia<00:01:52.119> I<00:01:52.270> mean<00:01:53.020> it's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
wildlife in Australia I mean it's

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.840 
wildlife in Australia I mean it's
fascinating<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.890> evolution<00:01:54.369> of<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.580> fish

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
fascinating the evolution of this fish

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.429 
fascinating the evolution of this fish
bird<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.330> be<00:01:55.420> able<00:01:55.510> to<00:01:55.630> survive<00:01:55.990> out<00:01:56.290> of<00:01:56.320> water

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
bird to be able to survive out of water

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.499 
bird to be able to survive out of water
to<00:01:57.130> walk<00:01:57.430> I<00:01:57.640> mean<00:01:57.670> these<00:01:57.880> are<00:01:58.030> all<00:01:58.150> things<00:01:58.420> that

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
to walk I mean these are all things that

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.230 
to walk I mean these are all things that
is<00:01:58.810> really<00:01:59.229> amazing<00:02:00.070> but<00:02:00.189> it's<00:02:00.369> stupid<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.030> to

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
is really amazing but it's stupid and to

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.820 
is really amazing but it's stupid and to
be<00:02:01.360> able<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.570> survive<00:02:01.869> it's<00:02:02.200> basically

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
be able to survive it's basically

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.100 
be able to survive it's basically
protecting<00:02:03.490> itself<00:02:03.850> if<00:02:04.240> anybody<00:02:04.659> does<00:02:04.869> eat

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
protecting itself if anybody does eat

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.899 
protecting itself if anybody does eat
them<00:02:05.259> that<00:02:05.290> essentially<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:06.310> going<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.490> die<00:02:06.640> so

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
them that essentially is going to die so

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.509 
them that essentially is going to die so
it's<00:02:07.390> fascinating<00:02:07.659> that<00:02:08.140> this<00:02:08.319> fish<00:02:09.069> has<00:02:09.279> been

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
it's fascinating that this fish has been

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.929 
it's fascinating that this fish has been
able<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.319> become<00:02:11.319> so<00:02:11.680> powerful<00:02:11.980> but<00:02:12.549> it's<00:02:12.700> sad

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:12.939 
able to become so powerful but it's sad

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.300 
able to become so powerful but it's sad
too<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.239> guess<00:02:13.419> because<00:02:13.719> it<00:02:14.049> could

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
too I guess because it could

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.650 
too I guess because it could
hurt<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.610> lot<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.910> other<00:02:15.030> animals<00:02:15.239> in<00:02:15.599> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
hurt a lot of other animals in the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.660 
hurt a lot of other animals in the
process<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.319> mean<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.099> natural<00:02:17.550> though

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
process I mean it is natural though

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.610 
process I mean it is natural though
right<00:02:17.910> these<00:02:18.209> migrations<00:02:18.810> bird<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.410> might

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
right these migrations bird you might

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.580 
right these migrations bird you might
think<00:02:20.040> but<00:02:20.430> it's<00:02:20.580> not<00:02:20.880> they<00:02:21.450> are<00:02:21.720> now<00:02:22.020> in<00:02:22.230> Papua

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
think but it's not they are now in Papua

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.260 
think but it's not they are now in Papua
New<00:02:22.620> Guinea<00:02:22.920> right<00:02:23.340> which<00:02:23.520> is<00:02:23.670> not<00:02:23.819> very<00:02:24.030> far

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
New Guinea right which is not very far

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.630 
New Guinea right which is not very far
from<00:02:24.300> Australia<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.650> fish<00:02:25.890> itself<00:02:26.220> cannot

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
from Australia the fish itself cannot

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.820 
from Australia the fish itself cannot
swim<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.239> far<00:02:27.540> they<00:02:27.810> can't<00:02:28.050> migrate<00:02:28.620> on

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
swim that far they can't migrate on

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.190 
swim that far they can't migrate on
their<00:02:29.010> own<00:02:29.130> although<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.239> bright<00:02:31.140> orange

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
their own although the the bright orange

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.589 
their own although the the bright orange
is<00:02:31.650> pop<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:31.950> your<00:02:32.040> guinea<00:02:32.220> below<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.300> obviously

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
is pop on your guinea below it obviously

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.180 
is pop on your guinea below it obviously
Australia<00:02:33.720> they<00:02:34.080> can't<00:02:34.290> migrate<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.860> far

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
Australia they can't migrate that far

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.120 
Australia they can't migrate that far
but<00:02:35.580> they're<00:02:36.060> thinking<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:37.260> crafty

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
but they're thinking that this crafty

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.400 
but they're thinking that this crafty
perch<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.790> come<00:02:39.330> on<00:02:39.540> fishing<00:02:39.840> boats<00:02:40.140> they<00:02:40.290> can

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
perch can come on fishing boats they can

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.720 
perch can come on fishing boats they can
stick<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.769> bottom<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.190> fishing<00:02:41.519> boats

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
stick to the bottom of fishing boats

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.210 
stick to the bottom of fishing boats
they'll<00:02:42.599> even<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:42.930> caught<00:02:43.230> as<00:02:43.440> live<00:02:43.890> bait<00:02:44.190> and

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
they'll even be caught as live bait and

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.680 
they'll even be caught as live bait and
then<00:02:44.489> when<00:02:44.580> they<00:02:44.670> see<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.940> small<00:02:45.420> little

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
then when they see a small little

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.090 
then when they see a small little
partial<00:02:45.870> discarded<00:02:46.620> they'll<00:02:46.769> throw<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.010> off

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
partial discarded they'll throw it off

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.729 
partial discarded they'll throw it off
the<00:02:47.250> boat<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.660> does<00:02:48.989> have<00:02:49.230> means<00:02:49.530> of

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
the boat so it does have means of

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.530 
the boat so it does have means of
getting<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.069> Australia<00:02:50.459> they<00:02:50.580> found<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.970> few<00:02:51.269> in

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
getting to Australia they found a few in

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.240 
getting to Australia they found a few in
the<00:02:51.630> vicinity<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.380> they're<00:02:52.709> thinking<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
the vicinity and they're thinking the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.009 
the vicinity and they're thinking the
numbers<00:02:53.580> might<00:02:53.790> grow<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.299> once<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.660> happens

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
numbers might grow and once that happens

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.390 
numbers might grow and once that happens
we'll<00:02:55.170> see<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.319> huge<00:02:55.590> decline<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:56.100> things<00:02:56.310> like

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
we'll see a huge decline in things like

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.940 
we'll see a huge decline in things like
turtles<00:02:56.819> other<00:02:57.360> certain<00:02:57.810> fish<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.260> even

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
turtles other certain fish and even

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.039 
turtles other certain fish and even
birds<00:02:59.220> according<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.299> one<00:03:00.450> expert<00:03:00.569> he<00:03:01.019> said

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
birds according to one expert he said

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.360 
birds according to one expert he said
when<00:03:01.380> they<00:03:01.470> populate<00:03:01.860> an<00:03:01.980> area<00:03:02.220> they're<00:03:02.340> not

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
when they populate an area they're not

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.009

disrupt<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.890> entire<00:03:05.040> balance<00:03:05.819> of<00:03:05.970> that

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
disrupt the entire balance of that
