pretty good and you can see it has this

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.679 
pretty good and you can see it has this
little<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.530> this<00:01:10.530> oil<00:01:10.860> paint<00:01:11.189> effect<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.000> it

little like this oil paint effect and it

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.330 
little like this oil paint effect and it
