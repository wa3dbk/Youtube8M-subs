about stage length i think it feels

about stage length i think it feels
about<00:00:47.760> right<00:00:47.820> honestly<00:00:48.270> not<00:00:48.660> too<00:00:48.870> short<00:00:49.140> not

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
about right honestly not too short not

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.680 
about right honestly not too short not
too<00:00:49.530> long<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.010> think<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.520> good<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
too long I think it's good and the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.869 
too long I think it's good and the
number<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.989> checkpoints<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.770> exactly<00:00:53.670> what

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
number of checkpoints is exactly what

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.670 
number of checkpoints is exactly what
you'd<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.570> classic<00:00:54.930> series<00:00:55.320> 1

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
you'd have in the classic series 1

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.410 
you'd have in the classic series 1
mid-stage<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:56.940> at<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> end<00:00:57.180> right

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
mid-stage and one at the end right

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.689 
mid-stage and one at the end right
before<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.809> boss<00:00:58.250> some<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> checkpoints

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
before the boss some of the checkpoints

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.569 
before the boss some of the checkpoints
are<00:01:00.180> maybe<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> bit<00:01:00.719> questionably<00:01:01.469> placed<00:01:01.980> but

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
are maybe a bit questionably placed but

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.880 
are maybe a bit questionably placed but
other<00:01:03.180> than<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:03.989> didn't<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.830> a

not true at all the difficulty curve in
the<00:02:31.080> game<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.980> one<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.340> trickier<00:02:32.700> games

like<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.420> said<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.720> would<00:02:33.930> compare<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.470> Mega

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
like I said I would compare it to Mega

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.740 
like I said I would compare it to Mega
Man<00:02:34.860> 9<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.370> takes<00:02:35.970> some<00:02:36.210> learning<00:02:36.600> and

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
Man 9 it takes some learning and

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.140 
Man 9 it takes some learning and
honestly<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.470> enjoy<00:02:38.070> that<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.580> think<00:02:38.880> that's<00:02:39.000> a

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
honestly I enjoy that I think that's a

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.970 
honestly I enjoy that I think that's a
good<00:02:39.270> thing<00:02:39.330> what<00:02:40.140> would<00:02:40.290> be<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.440> fun<00:02:40.590> if<00:02:40.890> you

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
could just blazed through the game the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.870 
could just blazed through the game the
first<00:02:42.510> time<00:02:42.750> no<00:02:42.990> problem<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.590> know<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.890> think

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
first time no problem you know I think

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.670 
first time no problem you know I think
it's<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.120> very<00:02:45.240> fair<00:02:45.600> difficulty<00:02:46.170> it's<00:02:46.350> hard

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
it's a very fair difficulty it's hard

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.020 
it's a very fair difficulty it's hard
but<00:02:47.160> doable<00:02:47.370> it's<00:02:47.760> learnable<00:02:48.560> um<00:02:49.970> kind<00:02:50.970> of

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030

just uninstalled the game instead of the
rational<00:03:00.450> response<00:03:00.570> of<00:03:01.140> okay<00:03:01.860> take<00:03:02.430> some<00:03:02.640> time

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
rational response of okay take some time

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.090 
rational response of okay take some time
out<00:03:03.000> sit<00:03:03.330> back<00:03:03.570> from<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.930> game<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.140> bit<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.560> go

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
out sit back from the game a bit and go

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.560 
out sit back from the game a bit and go
back<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.580> later<00:03:05.730> with<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.030> fresh<00:03:06.330> mind<00:03:06.360> I

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
back to it later with a fresh mind I

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.660 
back to it later with a fresh mind I
think<00:03:09.570> there's<00:03:09.870> just<00:03:10.110> too<00:03:10.770> much<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.280> a

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
think there's just too much of a

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.360 
think there's just too much of a
predisposition<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:13.200> rage<00:03:13.410> quit<00:03:13.770> here<00:03:14.130> and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
predisposition to rage quit here and

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.520 
predisposition to rage quit here and
it's<00:03:14.580> kind<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.030> saddening<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.930> they<00:03:16.110> don't

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
it's kind of saddening that they don't

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.080 
it's kind of saddening that they don't
really<00:03:16.709> give<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.160> game<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.640> chance<00:03:17.910> it

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
really give the game the chance it

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.140 
really give the game the chance it
deserves<00:03:19.220> there's<00:03:20.220> also<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.580> comment<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.090> I

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
deserves there's also a comment that I

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.199

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
tonight hopefully i can get at least one

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.230 
tonight hopefully i can get at least one
more<00:05:27.539> up<00:05:27.750> we<00:05:27.960> shall<00:05:28.139> see<00:05:28.639> at<00:05:29.639> this<00:05:29.789> point<00:05:30.000> I<00:05:30.150> at

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
more up we shall see at this point I at

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.640 
more up we shall see at this point I at
least<00:05:30.360> don't<00:05:30.600> have<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.840> record<00:05:31.080> anymore<00:05:31.320> so

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
least don't have to record anymore so

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.589 
least don't have to record anymore so
it's<00:05:31.860> fully<00:05:32.130> an<00:05:32.310> editing<00:05:32.669> phase<00:05:32.849> from<00:05:33.240> here<00:05:33.450> on

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
it's fully an editing phase from here on

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.390 
it's fully an editing phase from here on
in<00:05:33.780> so<00:05:34.050> it<00:05:34.139> should<00:05:34.320> go<00:05:34.349> a<00:05:34.470> lot<00:05:34.680> faster<00:05:34.919> a<00:05:35.190> lot

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
in so it should go a lot faster a lot

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.969 
in so it should go a lot faster a lot
more<00:05:35.550> cleanly<00:05:35.880> and<00:05:36.320> i<00:05:37.320> look<00:05:37.560> forward<00:05:37.590> to

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
more cleanly and i look forward to

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.310 
more cleanly and i look forward to
getting<00:05:38.580> more<00:05:38.760> of<00:05:38.849> the<00:05:38.940> videos<00:05:39.210> up<00:05:39.450> for<00:05:40.200> those

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
getting more of the videos up for those

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.680 
getting more of the videos up for those
wondering<00:05:40.590> i<00:05:40.919> do<00:05:41.250> actually<00:05:41.729> plan<00:05:42.240> to<00:05:42.270> at<00:05:42.539> some

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
wondering i do actually plan to at some

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.180 
wondering i do actually plan to at some
point<00:05:42.750> go<00:05:43.110> back<00:05:43.260> and<00:05:43.470> try<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:43.680> perfect<00:05:44.039> run

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
point go back and try and perfect run

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.390 
point go back and try and perfect run
this<00:05:44.310> i<00:05:44.460> think<00:05:44.669> it's<00:05:44.820> very<00:05:44.880> doable<00:05:45.300> and

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
this i think it's very doable and

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.320 
this i think it's very doable and
believe<00:05:47.400> it<00:05:47.460> or<00:05:47.520> not<00:05:47.639> I<00:05:47.700> actually<00:05:47.820> think

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
believe it or not I actually think

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.790 
believe it or not I actually think
rainbow<00:05:48.840> man<00:05:49.050> is<00:05:49.169> going<00:05:49.320> to<00:05:49.380> be<00:05:49.500> one<00:05:49.650> of<00:05:49.680> the

rainbow man is going to be one of the

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.290 
rainbow man is going to be one of the
easier<00:05:49.830> stages<00:05:50.580> now<00:05:50.700> that<00:05:50.880> I<00:05:50.910> know<00:05:51.000> where<00:05:51.180> all
