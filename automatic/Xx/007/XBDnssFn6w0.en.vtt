00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.250
 our diet its high contribution in 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.559
 vitamins and their low fat content 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.690
 It is ideal to enjoy it during 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.070
 our menu and have a feed 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.920
 balanced however if you want to know 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.800
 How many calories does the egg have? 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.630
 keep in mind that this information 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.660
 it will vary depending on the way 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.030
 have to cook this food 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.910
 the composition of the egg the first thing to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.399
 keep in mind if you want to know how many 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.280
 Calorie has the egg is that is not what 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.890
 same the yolk that the egg white the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.890
 orange part is the most fat 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.440
 has and the clear the least 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.989
 Studies have shown that the yolk of the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.140
 egg are a great nutritional source 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.460
 with abundant vitamins a and b as well as 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.420
 iron and riboflavin however is the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.820
 part that has more fat and therefore 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.680
 the least suitable in the diets for 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.840
 to lose 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.090
 the area of ​​the egg white is the one 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.600
 has fewer calories since its 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.110
 composition is mainly made to 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.540
 protein base this does that when 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.330
 the egg white is swallowed 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.690
 increase the feeling of satiety without 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.630
 increase fat consumption if 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.600
 you are on a diet you can take the egg 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.290
 putting aside the yolk and enjoy recipes 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.780
 like the omelet of egg whites 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.120
 Hard egg however, just like you 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.270
 we have indicated at the beginning of this 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.970
 article to know how many calories 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.210
 has the egg greatly influences the way 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.760
 in which you cook this food if you opt 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.460
 for cooking hard-boiled eggs you should know that 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.340
 the initial amount of calories from 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.370
 egg almost not affected after 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.800
 have cooked what will influence 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.500
 in the amount of calories will be the 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.110
 Egg size is not the same 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.810
 eat one smaller than another 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.750
 extra big 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.900
 to summary mode in a how we offer you 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.069
 this caloric table with respect to the egg 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.970
 hard boiled egg oversize 80 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:30.080
 lime egg hard large size 72 cal 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:34.370
 hard egg medium size 63 carl egg 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.550
 hard small size 54 lime fried egg 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.220
 when we fry an egg the amount of 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.180
 calories of this food increases from 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.910
 considerable amount excessive 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.430
 of oil and cooking it in a fried way 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.850
 makes the egg's calories look 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.430
 increased and therefore not a 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.130
 food suitable for people who 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.489
 want to maintain your line or lose weight 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.250
 in the previous point we have specified 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:08.420
 that the calories of an extra egg 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.519
 large are 80 cal however if this 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.099
 egg what you do fried you must have in 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:17.750
 realize that your calories can reach 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:20.540
 increase the double 160 cal the fried egg 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.110
 what the amount of calories will depend on 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.470
 of this recipe because of the amount of 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.440
 oil with which you cook the egg is not 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.860
 the same thing put a splash of oil that 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.800
 fill the whole pan therefore of 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.170
 general way we can say that the 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.390
 calories from a fried egg can 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.370
 oscillate from 5 to 160 cal 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.700
 tortilla or scrambled egg calories 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.010
 of an egg will not be the same as 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.090
 if this egg is cooked as a 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.209
 Tortilla why because unlike 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.330
 the two previous options when cooking 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.150
 a tortilla a scrambled egg or if you use 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.450
 oil but moderately so 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.820
 so much to take egg in tortilla yes that 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.610
 It is recommended in diets and 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:17.480
 food methods designed to 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.940
 lose weight as we have already pointed out 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.940
 if you want to reduce the amount of 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.900
 Egg calories as recommended 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.560
 is 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.740
 the yolk of the clear and avoid thus avoid 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.470
 take the fats from the yolk when 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.750
 we make an omelet the amount of 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.120
 The oil we use is less than 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.970
 to do it or fried because the recipe of the 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.520
 tortilla needs just a jet of 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.030
 oil to wet the pan a little 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.669
 for this reason the calories of the egg 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.900
 they are slightly increased 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:56.210
 regarding their calories in fresh state 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.030
 roughly we can indicate that the 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.970
 calories from an omelette made with 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:05.630
 an egg can oscillate between 90 cal 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:10.180
 at 110 cal depending on the amount 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.180
 of oil that you use to cook it
