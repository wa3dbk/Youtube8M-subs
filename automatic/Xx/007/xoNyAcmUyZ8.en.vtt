00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.770
 here is going to take with the round what 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.750
 we have the chain in position 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.510
 correct but it would simply have to 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.539
 remove the sheave again we are going to 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.990
 test if it fits well in its place and if 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.119
 you have aim to see if there is marksmanship 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.260
 and it seems that this has to walk 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.260
 more or less there 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.450
 now we introduce the intern that 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:36.140
 It is both screw and through shaft 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.540
 you have to screw the first part and if 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.040
 everything is synchronized on the other side 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.040
 I should catch the thread 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.670
 students help us a little bit and with the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:55.460
 another hand in there would go in to see if it is threaded 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:59.059
 and more or less to it coils 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.960
 and squeeze with a very normal grip 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.460
 no need here not over tighten 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.800
 it's because I could even strangle 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.009
 ian go out and not turn there you can 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.690
 check with the chain already free before 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.550
 nothing, maybe it turns easily 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.680
 you also have to look at the sheave 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.540
 before riding it if they have arrows of 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.670
 rotation that some yes that have it 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.300
 apart from being inferior higher if 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.700
 has arrows now is not the case 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.710
 it is also important to add here that 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.450
 that is of course a sheave 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.150
 compatible in the case that we do not buy 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.730
 the original because it depends if they have 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.490
 chains of opinion is a 9 that already almost 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.460
 your pencil and have with 9 make sure that 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.500
 they are perfectly valid and do not forget 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.350
 make clip that thanks to this clip there 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.150
 here it is necessary to tighten the screw as 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.710
 a crazy good as we had said before 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.050
 it was dangerous the operation could not be 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.510
 to fall the piece is the truth is that it is 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.720
 quite difficult the casting to fall 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.750
 we go for a second try to support it and 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.670
 with a little resolved even with the nail 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.119
 with my fingernail in my case to see if it can 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.459
 get to enter 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.490
 which is not the case so we have to 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.320
 ask for help from a screwdriver 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.020
 if we can place it in its place 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.790
 First 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.790
 that is a little bit scrappy here 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.450
 and I do not go out to take is good in this case 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.790
 as we have placed one of the two is 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.370
 saying not to release both at the same time is a 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.590
 bit easier because in the case of 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.410
 change the second one also to have 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.170
 access to the screw is to do the 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.239
 exactly the same operation what is 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.850
 can put here is a will open a rubber 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.019
 to have the change here to access 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.220
 to the screw that is here and do 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.980
 exactly the same operation is is 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.100
 pretty simple and once it 's 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.340
 touched they placed it to assure us what the 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.140
 chain is right that everything turns 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.319
 perfectly 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.970
 and when everything is tight 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.970
 we just put the wheel back 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.220
 on your site 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.830
 introduced the disc 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.240
 between the pills 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.770
 we squeeze 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:42.719
 and so that it comes out a little strong and 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.999
 logically we see that the change is going 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:47.879
 exactly as before and there is no 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:49.170
 reason why it does not work exactly 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:53.250
 same because the truth is that we have not 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.590
 changed any position of stops neither 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.230
 tensions of cables and covers 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.209
 adjustment screws logically there's no 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.370
 to play for nothing so it would be a 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.870
 completely independent operation of 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.139
 what are the adjustments of the change 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.719
 back so there's no reason to 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:12.689
 bring the famous solanas min and those 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:14.579
 that look like knives not when they're 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.949
 worn out they look like 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.620
 effectively a lethal weapon of a girl 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:22.289
 or shark teeth as we can 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.940
 observe in the new the tooth is 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.070
 pretty square and when they're 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.370
 worn is not very easy to check 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:33.000
 because they would have shark teeth 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.400
 the change is imprecise enough in front 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.350
 everything between the slack and the teeth 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.770
 of shark logically does not change anything 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.260
 ok but be careful because this 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.449
 operation is usually an operation 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.030
 that is done on a par with chain and 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.130
 pine nuts could even be changed 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.380
 Rolled or individual because they are 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.020
 3 plastic always make sure that the 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.419
 chain is in condition and the chain 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.150
 almost always you have to change together with 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.770
 rear sprockets and maybe the plate that 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.430
 more we use that is only the plate 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.430
 medium good with the famous strips 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:12.320
 new we said goodbye to this program and here 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.290
 with a champion's bike that's 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.240
 and be attentive to the best a bike 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.300
 just like this could become the 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.910
 world champion with a daisy and 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.480
 they will have the perfect sheaves for sure 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.940
 for that test 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.860
 in the next program we are going to do 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.930
 the reverse operation a program 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.670
 previous does not change 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.980
 put camera cover on a wheel 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.770
 Stable is an operation that also 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.620
 It's been a long time since the rim 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.980
 of you see to mount covers and cameras 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.490
 until very soon and keep walking in 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.490
 friends bike 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.150
 to me
