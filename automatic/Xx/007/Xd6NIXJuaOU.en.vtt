I<00:03:59.380> hope<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:04.790> this<00:04:05.060> is<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.270> arm<00:04:05.750> just

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.120 

connecting<00:04:09.550> pieces<00:04:10.550> together<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.710> already

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
connecting pieces together and I already

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.720 
connecting pieces together and I already

Frog<00:04:25.610> is<00:04:25.790> almost<00:04:26.090> completed<00:04:26.600> just<00:04:26.900> position

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:38.380 

know<00:04:31.130> just<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:36.350> to<00:04:37.340> add<00:04:37.550> a<00:04:37.850> little<00:04:38.120> bit

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
know just and to add a little bit

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:46.869 
know just and to add a little bit
decoration<00:04:38.990> I<00:04:39.230> will<00:04:39.500> make<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:39.710> crown<00:04:40.040> for<00:04:40.460> her

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:49.199 

and<00:04:47.419> this<00:04:47.659> is<00:04:47.779> one<00:04:48.020> way<00:04:48.229> of<00:04:48.379> doing<00:04:48.529> it<00:04:48.800> just

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:49.209 
and this is one way of doing it just

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:54.809 
and this is one way of doing it just
attaching<00:04:50.860> drop<00:04:51.860> shaped<00:04:52.659> pieces<00:04:53.659> together

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:54.819 
attaching drop shaped pieces together

00:04:54.819 --> 00:05:04.089 
attaching drop shaped pieces together
roll<00:04:55.819> them<00:04:56.089> over<00:05:02.379> so<00:05:03.379> they<00:05:03.619> are<00:05:03.740> really

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
roll them over so they are really

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:11.579 
roll them over so they are really
connected<00:05:04.610> now<00:05:07.119> and<00:05:08.119> connect<00:05:08.659> both<00:05:09.139> sides

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:11.589 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:22.389
