00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:18.539
 I will detail the configuration 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.949
 that I use on the digi f550 so the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.760
 machine as we just said it's 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.390
 a dj f550 on which is mounted a go-kart 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.810
 stabilization nasa mv2 so this is the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.590
 latest version with the update this 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.260
 drone it is powered by a battery is 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.770
 is in charge but I have a battery a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.160
 4s 5000 million father after 5000 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.870
 emilie on the ground in 35 c I made the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.270
 tests it works very well there is 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:55.370
 no worries in flight order I weighed 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.890
 so it's 2 kg 150 it's 2 kg 150 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.570
 knowing that we have the digi 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.659
 four feet and then 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.200
 a stabilization set says it 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:13.930
 gisÃ¨le mus for the gopro I'll go 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:16.360
 to show his voice the voice in front of there we have 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.670
 so the gopro that is on its support of 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.440
 stabilization so here it's not in 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.880
 it's not working, but when it's 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.590
 March to stabilize to sow right 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.130
 automatically then we can 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.930
 control all the way down just that's 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.850
 only on two axes one can 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.869
 control and up and down on the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.840
 since the radio control so that's a 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.149
 real more on this drone so we have 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.770
 installed a spv system so to see 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.090
 a ground picture return a video return 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.149
 on the ground 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.750
 so here we have for the fpv the transmitter 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.490
 kitty video that is fed to him by a 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.600
 battery in thousand milliamperes 1 that 's 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.890
 cdu 3s mines millions term 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.340
 here is the cu we use one for the 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.119
 ftv module 1 it's a u13 hack and semi 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.070
 half loses a 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:08.170
 impro tronic of pro day flesh sold 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.149
 in addition to the visual material all 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.060
 it is found at aerovision except the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.140
 gopro so it's we have at home 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.000
 main good there he is in charge 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.280
 the main reception is coming to 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.320
 above it but this one above and that 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.840
 connect to these 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.989
 so for the fpv this is the gopro 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.820
 which is used as the main camera 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.160
 so when we did the tests we 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.829
 did not start by doing fpv 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.360
 naturally we looked to see 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.070
 autonomy we are at about 9 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.940
 minutes of flight in this configuration 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.730
 good knowing will dispute their grandma the 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.160
 the 8-inch propellers are the propellers 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.790
 which are planned for 4s after we can 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.630
 put nine or ten we will test on 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.579
 waited we wait for the propellers in 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.070
 push the propellers strengthen 10 inches 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.720
 10 gige to fill not tilted will do 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.019
 save a little bit and she 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.910
 gave more flight time 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.890
 so the presently if not at the level of 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.430
 the radio we are in 2 gigas 4 5 years did not 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.160
 nothing changed 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.600
 we will then try with the ehf module 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.980
 to see what this gives trial to have 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.780
 a little more doors and perhaps 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.670
 but according to the use that we use 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.380
 made 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.380
 in 2004 is already well go
