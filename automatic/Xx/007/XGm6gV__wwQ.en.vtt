00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.840 
think there's a couple reasons for this
you<00:01:16.770> know<00:01:16.860> peer<00:01:17.159> pressure

part<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> reason<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:31.020> want<00:01:31.259> people<00:01:31.470> to

part of the reason is you want people to

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.289 
part of the reason is you want people to
like<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.220> want<00:01:32.549> people<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.909> trust<00:01:33.119> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
and in American society one of the ways

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.210 
and in American society one of the ways
you<00:01:35.790> get<00:01:36.270> people<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.780> trust<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.979> say

and I'm a god-fearing American and that

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.230 
and I'm a god-fearing American and that
means<00:01:43.350> even<00:01:43.619> religious<00:01:44.369> Americans<00:01:45.060> who

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
means even religious Americans who

means even religious Americans who
believe<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.960> thou<00:01:46.140> shalt<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:46.649> bear

false<00:01:46.979> witness<00:01:47.399> will<00:01:48.360> happily<00:01:48.899> fudge<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
false witness will happily fudge the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.350 
false witness will happily fudge the
truth<00:01:49.860> when<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.310> comes<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.670> how<00:01:50.790> often<00:01:51.030> they<00:01:51.329> go

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
truth when it comes to how often they go

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.780 
truth when it comes to how often they go
to<00:01:51.659> church<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.619> when<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> remove<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.369> human

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
to church but when you remove that human

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.789 
to church but when you remove that human
element<00:01:53.909> from<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.540> survey<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.200> truth<00:01:55.470> seems

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
element from this survey the truth seems

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.950 
element from this survey the truth seems
to<00:01:56.009> come<00:01:56.250> pouring<00:01:56.700> out<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.869> is

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
to come pouring out and this is

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.660 
to come pouring out and this is
something<00:01:58.170> I've<00:01:58.380> suspected<00:01:58.740> for<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.130> long<00:01:59.340> time

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
something I've suspected for a long time

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.789 
something I've suspected for a long time
that<00:01:59.850> people<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.719> don't<00:02:00.990> go<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> church<00:02:01.350> as

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
that people really don't go to church as

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.859 
that people really don't go to church as
often<00:02:02.159> as<00:02:02.310> they<00:02:02.460> claim<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.299> number<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
often as they claim to the number the

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.539 
often as they claim to the number the
percent<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.469> people<00:02:04.560> who<00:02:04.979> go<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.159> church<00:02:05.399> is

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
percent of people who go to church is

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.969 
percent of people who go to church is
actually<00:02:05.969> much<00:02:06.270> lower<00:02:06.659> than<00:02:07.259> we<00:02:07.469> think<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.950> is

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
actually much lower than we think it is

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.589 
actually much lower than we think it is
and<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.610> also<00:02:08.759> think<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> number<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
and I also think the number the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.300 
and I also think the number the
percentage<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.140> people<00:02:10.410> who<00:02:10.679> believe<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:10.979> God

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
percentage of people who believe in God

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.309 
percentage of people who believe in God
is<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.670> lot<00:02:12.239> lower<00:02:12.569> than<00:02:12.930> we

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
is a lot lower than we

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.289 
is a lot lower than we
say<00:02:13.469> it<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.799> but<00:02:14.280> people<00:02:14.310> don't<00:02:14.760> always<00:02:14.969> want

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
say it is but people don't always want

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.089 
say it is but people don't always want
to<00:02:15.329> admit<00:02:15.719> that<00:02:16.109> they<00:02:16.319> are<00:02:16.349> atheist<00:02:16.950> they

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
to admit that they are atheist they

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.229 
to admit that they are atheist they
don't<00:02:17.249> want<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.459> admit<00:02:17.609> that<00:02:17.790> they<00:02:17.999> don't

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
don't want to admit that they don't

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.239 
don't want to admit that they don't
believe<00:02:18.450> in<00:02:18.629> God<00:02:18.810> they<00:02:19.260> feel<00:02:19.560> weird<00:02:19.980> like

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:20.249 
believe in God they feel weird like

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:21.679 
believe in God they feel weird like
there's<00:02:20.430> something<00:02:20.700> wrong<00:02:20.939> with<00:02:21.239> them<00:02:21.510> if

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
there's something wrong with them if

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.780 
there's something wrong with them if
they<00:02:22.139> tell<00:02:22.439> someone<00:02:22.799> even<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.069> stranger<00:02:23.310> that

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
they tell someone even a stranger that

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.089 
they tell someone even a stranger that
they're<00:02:24.030> atheists<00:02:24.659> and<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.439> think<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.739> survey

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
they're atheists and I think the survey

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.550 
they're atheists and I think the survey
is<00:02:26.310> also<00:02:26.790> some<00:02:26.969> evidence<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.689> the<00:02:27.930> Internet

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
is also some evidence that the Internet

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.520 
is also some evidence that the Internet
is<00:02:28.739> where<00:02:29.010> faith<00:02:29.370> goes<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:30.060> die<00:02:30.359> it's<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.319> lot

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
is where faith goes to die it's a lot

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.410 
is where faith goes to die it's a lot
easier<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.069> have<00:02:32.219> honest<00:02:32.670> discussions<00:02:32.790> about

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
easier to have honest discussions about

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.809 
easier to have honest discussions about
God<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.260> faith<00:02:34.709> when<00:02:35.280> you're<00:02:35.430> behind<00:02:35.670> a

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
God and faith when you're behind a

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.280 
God and faith when you're behind a
computer<00:02:35.969> screen<00:02:36.629> when<00:02:36.959> you're<00:02:37.109> hiding

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
computer screen when you're hiding

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.920 
computer screen when you're hiding
behind<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.889> veil<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.549> anonymity<00:02:38.670> than<00:02:39.629> it<00:02:39.780> is

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
behind this veil of anonymity than it is

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.959 
behind this veil of anonymity than it is
when<00:02:40.169> someone's<00:02:40.620> asking<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.129> directly<00:02:41.579> what

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
when someone's asking you directly what

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.390 
when someone's asking you directly what
you<00:02:42.150> believe<00:02:42.419> on<00:02:42.599> these<00:02:42.749> issues<00:02:43.139> I<00:02:43.379> wish<00:02:43.980> none

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
you believe on these issues I wish none

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.920 
you believe on these issues I wish none
of<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.549> were<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.819> case<00:02:44.939> by<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.359> way<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.540> wish

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
of this were the case by the way I wish

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.199 
of this were the case by the way I wish
more<00:02:46.200> people<00:02:46.409> were<00:02:46.680> just<00:02:47.010> open<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.700> honest

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
more people were just open and honest

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.610 
more people were just open and honest
about<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.599> fact<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.989> they<00:02:49.200> don't<00:02:49.409> go<00:02:49.560> to

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
about the fact that they don't go to

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.559 
about the fact that they don't go to
church<00:02:49.739> or<00:02:50.219> more<00:02:50.549> importantly<00:02:50.969> that<00:02:51.419> they

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
church or more importantly that they

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.659 
church or more importantly that they
don't<00:02:51.780> believe<00:02:52.049> in<00:02:52.230> God<00:02:52.439> I<00:02:52.769> think<00:02:53.430> if<00:02:53.549> they

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
don't believe in God I think if they

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.550 
don't believe in God I think if they
were<00:02:53.730> more<00:02:53.939> open<00:02:54.299> about<00:02:54.419> it<00:02:54.719> it<00:02:54.930> would<00:02:55.260> help

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
were more open about it it would help

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.099 
were more open about it it would help
decrease<00:02:56.129> that<00:02:56.459> social<00:02:56.939> stigma<00:02:57.419> against<00:02:57.959> it

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
decrease that social stigma against it

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.509 
decrease that social stigma against it
and<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.319> think<00:02:58.560> more<00:02:58.680> people<00:02:58.859> would<00:02:59.189> then<00:02:59.370> be

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
and I think more people would then be

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.699 
and I think more people would then be
willing<00:02:59.730> to<00:03:00.090> admit<00:03:00.269> yeah<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:00.959> don't<00:03:01.319> go<00:03:01.650> to

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
willing to admit yeah I don't go to
