00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Here we are and welcome back to my channel 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.049
 resume with watch docs 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.790
 let's continue the multiplayer issues that 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.759
 I wanted to see guys after 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:17.039
 online tracking and online king 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:21.420
 come on I already did a training match and I did it 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.490
 I see enough toast then we read 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.119
 together the guide ie the operation e 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.460
 uil also explain why practically 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.579
 we must first hack the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.370
 a fixer's phone once 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.230
 We rarely need to install a backdoor 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.390
 installed this back door we must 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.879
 wait that one hundred percent filled 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.590
 one hundred every 25 percent of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.539
 completion of the bar goes 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.920
 reducing the search circle 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.219
 so it's pretty much easier 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.270
 for the opponent we find this a bit 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.620
 here camouflage among the people deceive 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.090
 your opponent who, by mythicizing himself 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.680
 in Chicago locations it can be detected 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.879
 difficult try to find a group of 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.530
 people who are chatting and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.990
 behave as if he were one of them 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.869
 remember to react in the same way e 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.600
 so having the circle much more 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.000
 restricted is easier for the opponent 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.689
 that is, look for 50 percent more 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.210
 so 50 above all 75 from 75 to 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.790
 100 is much more complicated I have been 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.229
 caught if I 'm not mistaken at 78 something 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.140
 I was just stuffed into it 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.680
 a corner but I saw myself I have to look 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.560
 a little 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:41.620
 prevails you have to find it form the data of the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:44.550
 bring it back to us, it's perfect 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.550
 here we go 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.909
 damn we install st breaks though 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.909
 ok they ate the neighborhood 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.939
 ok installiamolo open we have to do 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:05.179
 then catch from the character then 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:09.489
 let's play slowly let's pretend to go 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:14.900
 on the street and we walk four pacts 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:20.840
 we are a bit the people here to say yes 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:23.540
 sgama slowly 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.280
 we follow we see what the hell it is doing 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.079
 it is a lot playing with the car 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.090
 good 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.700
 so I would say that it is fantastic as a thing 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.410
 because he is playing with the car for 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.630
 other later more the il decreases 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.060
 circle that rushes to the net already is 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.950
 narrow here is the car that continues 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.170
 to go by the go go play with the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.920
 car that so at least us there 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.500
 fun 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.150
 after what the hell you run or where 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.010
 go where you go 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.889
 that does not make you stand out from the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.269
 character or better from the target 1 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.190
 he practically found us inside 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.220
 to the corner that he really did 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.660
 dried boys and you can understand me and been 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.459
 fantastic where that guy san was 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.720
 ciro still with the car possible 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:15.410
 that does not come down does not come looking for me 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:17.269
 promise waits that we see at 49 and 50 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.850
 now how does the narrows again? 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.819
 kids circle is happening to it 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.739
 everyone is killing someone 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.350
 look at the circle as it is tight or 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.910
 beware of this, here it is here 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.640
 guys is killing people 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.500
 gradually gradually on the other side 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.490
 killing people to find us 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.170
 boys gradually on the other side 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.100
 let's go now it shrinks 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.330
 the circle roadway again 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.940
 so we hope that now we are back 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.180
 more the other inside not too much 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.040
