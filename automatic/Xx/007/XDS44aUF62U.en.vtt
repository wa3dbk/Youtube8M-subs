notice there's nothing growing on this
path<00:00:47.260> that's<00:00:48.260> because<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.890> ants<00:00:49.309> have

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
path that's because the ants have

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.060 
path that's because the ants have
totally<00:00:50.180> cleared<00:00:50.870> it<00:00:51.080> they<00:00:51.530> travel<00:00:51.980> along

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
totally cleared it they travel along

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.420 
totally cleared it they travel along

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
lines far into the forest searching for

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.220 
lines far into the forest searching for
new<00:00:55.580> leaves<00:00:55.940> they<00:00:56.930> are<00:00:57.110> on<00:00:57.350> a<00:00:57.379> mission<00:00:57.890> to

communicate the ants touch and penny and
instead<00:01:03.290> of<00:01:03.500> using<00:01:03.710> our<00:01:04.010> eyes<00:01:04.190> they<00:01:04.970> use<00:01:05.239> their

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
instead of using our eyes they use their

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.020 
instead of using our eyes they use their
antennae<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.350> smell<00:01:06.890> their<00:01:07.220> way<00:01:07.250> around
