00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.070
 learn to knit socks best on 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.150
 an example of the most ordinary socks 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.259
 stocking knit 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.970
 look how interesting it looks 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.970
 melange yarn in the product 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.460
 if you are an experienced knitter and want 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.270
 tie some pattern then executes it 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.260
 top sock on 1 2 needles on the third and 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.550
 fourth needle 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:57.970
 performed heel we'll see 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:59.400
 how to make two heel options remember 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.660
 when knitting socks 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.010
 necessarily the first loop when 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.460
 knit with knitting needles 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.690
 it is necessary to pull the working thread should not 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.690
 there are no holes 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.700
 and so we get to work to start 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.190
 knitting socks we need 5 knitting needles 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.130
 knitting needles best to take fools aluminum 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.530
 they are light and not so glide to 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.850
 getting out of knitting is very important for 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.430
 Beginners strings better to take harder 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.760
 such threads will not wipe quickly 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.729
 socks well i have baby socks i 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.540
 I can take a thread softer 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:55.259
 thread consumption for one pair of women's socks 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:57.630
 table 120 grams for men 120 150 children 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.759
 seventy-eighty foot measurement 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.190
 produce and ankles further along 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.220
 control sample is calculated 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.110
 the number of loops for knitting it 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.730
 must be divisible by 4 and 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:18.040
 Starting a set of loops best 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.010
 Italian way to gain the set 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.220
 there is a first loop we recruit as 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.299
 usually the next loop we dial 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.489
 from under the strings 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:38.549
 coming from the index finger and so 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:38.549
 I have 32 loops next 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.570
 we type the last loop as usual 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:59.350
 next take the second knitting needle first loop 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.350
 it will be our face 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.330
 about knitting her facial socks we knit 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.900
 classic loops 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:20.830
 next we will have a purl 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:24.470
 classic then facial purl u 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.570
 me 32 loops knitting means must be 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.250
 eight loops on each needle 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.910
 that is, now I will tie on the right knitting needle 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.910
 8 loops 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.250
 7 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:54.390
 and 8 so further we take the next knitting needle 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:13.620
 tighten the first loop as well 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.620
 knit 8 loops
