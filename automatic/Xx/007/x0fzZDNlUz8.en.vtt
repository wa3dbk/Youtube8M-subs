00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
won't really I mean maybe the next two

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.600 
won't really I mean maybe the next two
days<00:04:37.479> it<00:04:37.690> won't<00:04:37.810> look<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.080> same<00:04:38.410> this<00:04:39.069> will<00:04:39.430> be

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.740 
it out I don't like this that much
sometimes<00:04:44.199> because<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:45.210> leaves<00:04:46.210> my<00:04:46.389> hair<00:04:46.539> kind

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750

of<00:04:46.900> dries<00:04:47.199> and<00:04:47.470> I<00:04:47.560> say<00:04:47.770> notice<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:48.370> it<00:04:48.789> also

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
of dries and I say notice and it also

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.170 
of dries and I say notice and it also
leaves<00:04:49.900> like<00:04:50.080> a<00:04:50.139> residue<00:04:50.680> which<00:04:51.069> I<00:04:51.370> hate<00:04:51.669> so

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
leaves like a residue which I hate so

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.270 
leaves like a residue which I hate so
like<00:04:52.539> I<00:04:52.569> hate<00:04:52.900> residue<00:04:53.409> none<00:04:54.039> of<00:04:54.069> my<00:04:54.159> other

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
like I hate residue none of my other

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.670 
like I hate residue none of my other
products<00:04:54.880> leave<00:04:55.030> residue<00:04:55.449> but<00:04:55.990> this<00:04:56.139> one<00:04:56.349> does

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
products leave residue but this one does

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.740 
products leave residue but this one does
have<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.979> set<00:04:57.310> white<00:04:57.639> flake<00:04:58.090> it<00:04:58.389> leaves<00:04:58.659> behind

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
have to set white flake it leaves behind

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.080 
have to set white flake it leaves behind
whenever<00:04:59.380> I<00:04:59.470> use<00:04:59.500> it<00:04:59.889> so<00:05:00.460> that's<00:05:00.729> like<00:05:00.909> the

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
whenever I use it so that's like the

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.640 
whenever I use it so that's like the
least<00:05:01.330> of<00:05:01.659> my<00:05:01.690> favorites<00:05:02.139> but<00:05:02.319> I<00:05:02.349> still<00:05:02.590> have

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
least of my favorites but I still have

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.740 
least of my favorites but I still have
one<00:05:02.979> included<00:05:03.490> because<00:05:03.639> I've<00:05:03.849> used<00:05:04.090> it<00:05:04.330> for

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
one included because I've used it for

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.430 
one included because I've used it for
years<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.440> it<00:05:06.370> has<00:05:06.639> men<00:05:07.300> I<00:05:07.479> think<00:05:07.780> it's<00:05:07.900> out<00:05:08.380> of

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
years and it has men I think it's out of

years and it has men I think it's out of
these<00:05:08.830> products<00:05:09.250> i<00:05:09.340> think<00:05:09.550> it's<00:05:09.669> been<00:05:09.819> the

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
these products i think it's been the

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.240 
these products i think it's been the
oldest<00:05:10.569> part<00:05:10.810> of<00:05:10.900> that<00:05:11.020> i've<00:05:11.139> used<00:05:11.409> and<00:05:11.710> just

oldest part of that i've used and just

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.649 
oldest part of that i've used and just
because<00:05:12.490> this<00:05:12.610> really<00:05:12.789> cheap<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:13.240> convenient

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
because this really cheap and convenient

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:15.570 
because this really cheap and convenient
sometimes<00:05:14.319> like<00:05:14.620> if<00:05:14.830> i<00:05:14.949> need<00:05:15.159> it<00:05:15.190> it's<00:05:15.430> right
