at<00:00:25.740> Nationals<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.060> I'm<00:00:27.840> he<00:00:28.140> thought<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.830> he

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
at Nationals and I'm he thought that he

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.439 
at Nationals and I'm he thought that he
didn't<00:00:29.279> like<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.429> way<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.670> felt<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.240> he

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
didn't like the way this felt so he

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.330 
didn't like the way this felt so he
ruined<00:00:31.260> get<00:00:31.380> rid<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.830> actually<00:00:31.949> turns

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
ruined get rid of it it actually turns

ruined get rid of it it actually turns
very<00:00:32.520> well<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.540> little<00:00:33.809> sluggish<00:00:34.079> because

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
very well it's a little sluggish because

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.400

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
I put lube in it and it's kind of gummy

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.780 
I put lube in it and it's kind of gummy
which<00:00:37.590> I'm<00:00:37.710> getting<00:00:37.950> ready<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.160> take<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.520> apart

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
pudding suggested that i put way sooo

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.290 
pudding suggested that i put way sooo
soft<00:00:51.210> Springs<00:00:51.660> inside<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.300> I

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
soft Springs inside of here and I

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.090 
soft Springs inside of here and I
ordered<00:00:54.899> some<00:00:54.960> from<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> cubicle<00:00:55.770> because<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
ordered some from the cubicle because I

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.119 
ordered some from the cubicle because I
saw<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.059> swings<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.890> actually<00:00:58.890> put<00:00:58.980> my

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
saw on the swings and actually put my

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.459 
saw on the swings and actually put my
hair<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.430> what<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.820> what<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.210> does<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:01.140> my

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
hair and what it what it does is not my

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.439 
hair and what it what it does is not my
cubes<00:01:01.859> not<00:01:02.039> very<00:01:02.250> tight<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.239> pretty

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
cubes not very tight I think it's pretty

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.899 
cubes not very tight I think it's pretty
loose<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.860> my<00:01:04.979> kids<00:01:05.189> loser<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.670> allows

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
loose I like my kids loser but allows

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.050 
loose I like my kids loser but allows
you<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.330> your<00:01:06.540> cube<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.049> little<00:01:07.290> bit

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
you to have your cube a little bit

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.090 
you to have your cube a little bit
tighter<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.390> still<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.320> fast<00:01:10.590> inner<00:01:10.860> layers

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
tighter and still have fast inner layers

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.289 
tighter and still have fast inner layers
and<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:12.240> speeds<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> Cuba<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.229> time<00:01:14.299> just

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
and it just speeds the Cuba a time just

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.789 
and it just speeds the Cuba a time just
with<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> Oh<00:01:15.540> Susan<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.229> my<00:01:16.409> inner<00:01:16.590> layers

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
with the Oh Susan like my inner layers

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.740 
with the Oh Susan like my inner layers
are<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.159> sluggish<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:18.299> middle<00:01:18.540> layers

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
are kind of sluggish the middle layers

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.060 
are kind of sluggish the middle layers
are<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> lot<00:01:19.200> faster<00:01:19.740> um<00:01:20.750> vs<00:01:21.750> here<00:01:24.799> still<00:01:25.799> pretty

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
are a lot faster um vs here still pretty

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.660 
are a lot faster um vs here still pretty
fast<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.909> nearly<00:01:27.210> i<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.659> i'm<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
fast but not nearly i think i'm going to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.130 
fast but not nearly i think i'm going to
redo<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.820> one<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.299> put<00:01:30.479> wasted<00:01:30.900> salt

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
redo this one and put wasted salt

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.260 
redo this one and put wasted salt
springs<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> cube<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:33.000> moves

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
springs in it but the cube just moves

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.260 
springs in it but the cube just moves
you<00:01:33.450> really<00:01:33.840> really<00:01:33.990> nice<00:01:34.850> i'm<00:01:35.850> really<00:01:36.150> glad

it just seems kind of sluggish my just
wasn't<00:01:46.860> very<00:01:46.890> smooth<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.790> seemed<00:01:48.000> i<00:01:48.270> lubed<00:01:49.020> it

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
wasn't very smooth it seemed i lubed it

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.899 
wasn't very smooth it seemed i lubed it
just<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:49.979> nothing<00:01:50.250> else<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.460> could<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.759> with

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
it so as I having to change the springs

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.960 
it so as I having to change the springs
I<00:01:52.920> don't<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.159> anything<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.460> lose<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:53.820> it's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
I don't have anything to lose but it's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.420 
I don't have anything to lose but it's
just<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.450> much<00:01:54.479> faster<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> middle<00:01:56.219> layers

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
just so much faster in the middle layers

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.609 
just so much faster in the middle layers
and<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:57.090> my<00:01:57.270> four<00:01:57.540> by<00:01:57.659> four<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:57.960> really<00:01:58.409> like

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
and on my four by four I really like

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.240 
and on my four by four I really like
that<00:01:59.240> it's<00:02:00.240> still<00:02:00.479> very<00:02:00.540> soon

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
that it's still very soon

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.810 
that it's still very soon
I'm<00:02:02.150> not<00:02:02.360> lucky<00:02:02.600> at<00:02:02.810> all<00:02:02.930> a<00:02:03.700> lot<00:02:04.700> of<00:02:04.730> people

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
I'm not lucky at all a lot of people

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.720 
I'm not lucky at all a lot of people

tried mine and national 2014 and they

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.790 
tried mine and national 2014 and they
really<00:02:08.030> really<00:02:08.240> like<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.600> home<00:02:09.320> in<00:02:09.530> like

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.300 
fulfilling I don't know why but I did
this<00:02:14.810> one<00:02:15.050> this<00:02:15.680> one<00:02:15.860> here<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.070> just<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.280> little

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
this one this one here is just a little

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.730 
this one this one here is just a little
too<00:02:16.670> company<00:02:16.970> for<00:02:17.150> my<00:02:17.270> liking<00:02:17.600> but<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:18.560> feels

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
too company for my liking but this feels

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.440 
too company for my liking but this feels
great<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.400> i<00:02:19.550> know<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.760> once<00:02:20.120> i<00:02:20.209> put<00:02:20.330> the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
great and i know that once i put the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.730 
great and i know that once i put the
sauce<00:02:20.630> springs<00:02:20.990> in<00:02:21.140> here<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:21.440> will<00:02:21.590> probably

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
sauce springs in here this will probably

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.170 
sauce springs in here this will probably
be<00:02:21.860> awesome<00:02:22.280> too<00:02:22.459> so<00:02:22.730> that's<00:02:22.910> what<00:02:23.030> i'm<00:02:23.090> going

be awesome too so that's what i'm going
to<00:02:23.390> do<00:02:24.670> but<00:02:25.670> yeah<00:02:25.880> it's<00:02:26.690> just<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:27.770> much

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
to do but yeah it's just so so much

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.400 
to do but yeah it's just so so much
smoother<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.640> just<00:02:28.820> glides<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.660> i<00:02:30.230> don't

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
smoother and just glides and i don't

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.500 
smoother and just glides and i don't
really<00:02:30.560> get<00:02:30.740> a<00:02:30.800> lot<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.010> lockups<00:02:31.520> especially

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.199 
really get a lot of lockups especially
in<00:02:32.570> those<00:02:32.660> middle<00:02:33.020> layers<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:37.000> it's<00:02:38.000> pretty

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
in those middle layers and it's pretty

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.060 
in those middle layers and it's pretty
nice<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:38.930> that's<00:02:39.380> just<00:02:39.440> something<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.800> want<00:02:39.980> to
