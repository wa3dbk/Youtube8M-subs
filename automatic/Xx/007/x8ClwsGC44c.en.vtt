more<00:02:19.390> connector<00:02:20.020> with<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.550> shifting<00:02:21.930> so

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
more connector with the shifting so

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.210 
more connector with the shifting so
better<00:02:23.200> for<00:02:23.590> his<00:02:23.830> expression<00:02:24.489> okay<00:02:25.200> yeah<00:02:26.220> yes
