 Dr 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:14.290
 Hello my dear Advent Sunday and a new raffle in Chassis way 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.920

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.060
 June and Beltz Verlag 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.000
 because there are three books Severin Freund still time a factual with the book 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.650
 I think that would be very nice from the point of view of his technique 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.579
 If the contents of the book are good, then I will not know for long in this case either 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.140
 but only hold books that I already know and recently found great 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.710
 finds 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.700
 now where can I not see otherwise we have so far a lot of good 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.900
 was expected 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.999
 it was us 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:42.999
 Shrek's tricks should be her 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.690
 he has 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.010
 Kilian Mengkofen 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.920
 There are in the Rheinische Sophie Wepper in the test 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.280
 Special about this book is not only that's great looking St 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.910
 that the author 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.500
 you can not really recognize now so that's the name 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.440
 is on the 8th 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.850
 He must compensate immediately Merkel that it is so important the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.370
 Original signature has not only little checkout carbon pencil try as I only 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.890
 can 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.920
 of course the author is very rare and so special and so 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.820
 something especially Henze and Taktieren's world 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.700
 Vintage Andy Walker is excited 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.140
 known the series 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.190
 He still has to say locally that I do not know myself as proven 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.640
 they act or five books this time 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.260
 it is also a teenager 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.780
 I think so 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.240
 and honestly, Ines says that the construction hunt Ketz is mine 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.470
 but that many many children and adolescents and instead of intercept and 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.979
 there is certainly certainly in the cave let you get that plenty 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.100
 terrible portrayed a t-shirt Wood Bella Thorne received 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.210
 Zambia will be Oracle Sun and two cats on the whole chat otherwise 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.220
 Black both are in the coal 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.610
 ZTE 11 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.870
 There is something to win matching the t-shirt, he of course also gives the BoE 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.250
 Arquette not as a cove but as an audiobook 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.159
 I enjoy 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.439
 but still in his chalet worst special edition 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.439
 and who's included 28 CDs 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.779
 Kelly Campbell Sorry 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:19.539
 28 CDs devil is and thus 34 hours 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.059
 At that time, one percent of the year went by 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.700
 Unzen as I said I do not know the story itself Hartings of it 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:32.719
 plagued and I think it fits carl-philipp for the children at VfL 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.039
 for the youth among you without adults and adolescents have children 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.669
 is this raffle I think 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.459
 Gallen 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.060
