on<00:04:18.820> screen<00:04:19.060> which<00:04:19.570> is<00:04:19.859> set<00:04:20.859> apartment<00:04:21.430> blocks

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
on screen which is set apartment blocks

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.110 
on screen which is set apartment blocks
with<00:04:22.330> fire<00:04:23.050> on<00:04:23.260> top<00:04:23.440> of<00:04:23.590> them<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:23.889> these<00:04:24.880> are<00:04:25.090> a

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
with fire on top of them and these are a

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.650 
with fire on top of them and these are a
set<00:04:25.270> of<00:04:25.330> popping<00:04:25.720> blocks<00:04:25.930> that<00:04:26.590> are<00:04:27.660> being

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
set of popping blocks that are being

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.469 
set of popping blocks that are being
attacked<00:04:29.440> by<00:04:29.979> of<00:04:30.250> UF<00:04:30.520> o--<00:04:30.699> which<00:04:31.060> you<00:04:31.210> can't

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
attacked by of UF o-- which you can't

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.159 
attacked by of UF o-- which you can't
quite<00:04:31.810> see<00:04:32.020> some<00:04:32.229> picture<00:04:32.620> right<00:04:32.770> now<00:04:32.919> but<00:04:33.430> and

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
quite see some picture right now but and

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.420 
quite see some picture right now but and
basically<00:04:35.169> as<00:04:35.350> you<00:04:35.500> need<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.770> glasses<00:04:35.919> around

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
basically as you need the glasses around

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.840 
basically as you need the glasses around
and<00:04:36.820> as<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.150> move<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.949> the<00:04:38.949> page<00:04:39.220> rank<00:04:39.610> up

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
and as you move the the page rank up

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.230 
and as you move the the page rank up
there<00:04:40.060> is<00:04:40.360> this<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.870> flying<00:04:41.650> saucer<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.280> so

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
there is this the flying saucer and so

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.760 
there is this the flying saucer and so
it's<00:04:43.419> just<00:04:43.539> re-enacting<00:04:43.960> a<00:04:44.229> little<00:04:44.560> tiny

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
it's just re-enacting a little tiny

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.219 
it's just re-enacting a little tiny
story<00:04:45.130> from<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.370> book<00:04:45.580> but<00:04:46.419> popping<00:04:46.960> out<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.169> the

three-dimensional effect that's

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.100 
three-dimensional effect that's
fascinating<00:05:30.580> say<00:05:31.240> obviously<00:05:31.419> this<00:05:31.690> is<00:05:31.840> just<00:05:31.900> a

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
fascinating say obviously this is just a

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.080 
fascinating say obviously this is just a
fun<00:05:32.289> little<00:05:32.320> kind<00:05:32.800> of<00:05:32.860> gamey<00:05:33.370> one<00:05:33.700> but<00:05:33.940> there's

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
fun little kind of gamey one but there's

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.480 
fun little kind of gamey one but there's
not<00:05:34.210> potential<00:05:34.750> but<00:05:35.020> yeah<00:05:35.710> how<00:05:35.919> the<00:05:35.979> world's

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
not potential but yeah how the world's

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.330 
not potential but yeah how the world's
works<00:05:36.789> explaining<00:05:37.630> NASA<00:05:38.200> me<00:05:38.560> just<00:05:39.099> lots<00:05:39.250> of

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
works explaining NASA me just lots of

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.070 
works explaining NASA me just lots of
educational<00:05:40.000> very<00:05:40.690> much<00:05:40.900> so<00:05:40.960> yeah<00:05:41.440> I<00:05:41.470> mean

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
educational very much so yeah I mean

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.080 
educational very much so yeah I mean
this<00:05:44.080> technology<00:05:44.710> has<00:05:44.740> a<00:05:45.280> massive

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
this technology has a massive

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.320 
this technology has a massive
opportunity<00:05:46.930> in<00:05:47.229> vertical<00:05:47.770> markets<00:05:48.190> if<00:05:49.180> you

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
opportunity in vertical markets if you

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.240 
opportunity in vertical markets if you
look<00:05:49.450> at<00:05:49.599> the<00:05:49.660> b2b<00:05:49.990> if<00:05:50.380> we<00:05:50.500> look<00:05:50.650> at<00:05:50.770> the<00:05:50.889> design

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
look at the b2b if we look at the design

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.610 
look at the b2b if we look at the design
market<00:05:51.820> the<00:05:52.240> architects<00:05:53.550> everybody<00:05:54.550> wants<00:05:54.910> to

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
market the architects everybody wants to

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.990 
market the architects everybody wants to
see<00:05:56.620> their<00:05:56.800> products<00:05:57.190> in<00:05:57.250> three<00:05:57.490> dimension

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
see their products in three dimension

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.879 
see their products in three dimension
there<00:05:58.210> so

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 
there so

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.969 
there so
if<00:06:01.419> if<00:06:02.419> I<00:06:02.569> was<00:06:02.719> a<00:06:02.749> motor<00:06:02.960> manufacturer<00:06:03.710> and<00:06:03.889> I

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
if if I was a motor manufacturer and I

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.670 
if if I was a motor manufacturer and I
was<00:06:04.129> launching<00:06:04.490> a<00:06:04.580> new<00:06:04.729> engine<00:06:05.650> normally<00:06:06.650> I

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
was launching a new engine normally I

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.369 
was launching a new engine normally I
would<00:06:06.979> have<00:06:07.159> to<00:06:07.400> have<00:06:08.060> lots<00:06:08.539> of<00:06:08.689> spare<00:06:08.990> engines

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:09.379 
would have to have lots of spare engines

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:11.379 
would have to have lots of spare engines
supply<00:06:09.740> mechanics<00:06:10.669> would<00:06:10.789> have<00:06:10.939> to<00:06:11.090> strip

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
supply mechanics would have to strip

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.869 
supply mechanics would have to strip
those<00:06:11.569> engines<00:06:12.050> to<00:06:12.710> learn<00:06:12.889> exactly<00:06:13.129> how<00:06:13.520> all

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:13.879 
those engines to learn exactly how all

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.510 
those engines to learn exactly how all
the<00:06:14.029> moving<00:06:14.210> parts<00:06:14.360> work<00:06:14.840> if<00:06:15.830> I<00:06:15.979> was<00:06:16.159> able<00:06:16.310> to

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
the moving parts work if I was able to

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.080 
the moving parts work if I was able to
provide<00:06:16.759> them<00:06:16.969> with<00:06:16.999> a<00:06:17.150> manual<00:06:17.539> and<00:06:17.810> a<00:06:18.620> pair<00:06:18.860> of

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
provide them with a manual and a pair of

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.019 
provide them with a manual and a pair of
our<00:06:20.090> glasses<00:06:20.360> and<00:06:20.840> the<00:06:21.379> AR<00:06:21.710> technology<00:06:22.029> then

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:23.029 
our glasses and the AR technology then

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:24.489 
our glasses and the AR technology then
they<00:06:23.240> would<00:06:23.419> be<00:06:23.539> able<00:06:23.629> to<00:06:23.749> see<00:06:24.050> all<00:06:24.259> the

00:06:24.489 --> 00:06:24.499 
they would be able to see all the

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:26.110 
they would be able to see all the
elements<00:06:24.770> of<00:06:25.069> that<00:06:25.219> engine<00:06:25.580> in<00:06:25.789> three
