00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
them so I like the fact that they have a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.469 
them so I like the fact that they have a
heel<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:55.829> them<00:01:56.250> what<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> little<00:01:57.240> bit<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
heel on them what a little bit of a

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.359 
heel on them what a little bit of a
wedge<00:01:57.659> heel<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.439> kind<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.920> makes<00:01:59.130> them<00:01:59.310> a

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
wedge heel so that kind of makes them a

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.130 
wedge heel so that kind of makes them a
