00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
this two ways of making them I ones the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.530 
this two ways of making them I ones the
simple<00:00:34.980> way<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.340> slightly<00:00:35.820> harder<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:36.480> still

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
simple way one slightly harder but still

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.840 
simple way one slightly harder but still
really<00:00:37.170> easy<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.160> slightly

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
really easy so this is the slightly

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.459 
really easy so this is the slightly
harder<00:00:39.239> one<00:00:39.270> look<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.750> actually<00:00:40.079> shuts<00:00:40.290> up

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
harder one look it actually shuts up

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.040 
harder one look it actually shuts up
button<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.579> can<00:00:41.760> open<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.239> up<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.690> then<00:00:42.960> you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
button you can open it up and then you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.740 
button you can open it up and then you
go<00:00:43.399> what's<00:00:44.399> inside<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:47.750> other

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
create these flaps at the bottom so

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.840 
create these flaps at the bottom so
that's<00:01:52.409> what<00:01:52.619> what<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.490> one's<00:01:53.700> quite

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
that's what what the this one's quite

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.639 
that's what what the this one's quite
good<00:01:54.119> for<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.600> bonus<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.350> really

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
good for but it's bonus it really

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.289 
good for but it's bonus it really
doesn't<00:01:55.860> matter<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.820> use<00:01:57.060> what

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
doesn't matter just you just use what

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.999 
doesn't matter just you just use what
you<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.960> they're<00:01:58.469> really<00:01:58.649> easy<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.890> make

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
you have and they're really easy to make

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.510 
you have and they're really easy to make
now<00:01:59.640> first<00:02:00.450> thing<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:02.070> pick<00:02:02.280> them

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
now I went from really bright colors I

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980 
now I went from really bright colors I
thought<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.340> would<00:02:05.460> be<00:02:05.579> really<00:02:05.729> fun<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.689> today

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
four kids already mixed and although I

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.170 
four kids already mixed and although I
have<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.739> say<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.250> do<00:02:17.310> quite<00:02:17.610> like<00:02:17.670> using

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
have to say I do quite like using

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.300 
have to say I do quite like using
acrylics<00:02:18.569> which<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:18.989> one<00:02:19.230> acrylics<00:02:20.130> just

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
acrylics which is this one acrylics just

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.880 
acrylics which is this one acrylics just
have<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.459> slightly<00:02:20.730> smoother<00:02:21.390> finish<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.800> I

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
have a slightly smoother finish and I

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.500 
have a slightly smoother finish and I
just<00:02:23.040> think<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.220> overall<00:02:23.520> effects<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.180> little

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
just think the overall effects a little

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.110 
just think the overall effects a little
bit<00:02:24.630> nicer<00:02:25.020> but<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.319> be<00:02:25.380> honest<00:02:25.819> it<00:02:26.819> doesn't

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
bit nicer but to be honest it doesn't

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.640 
bit nicer but to be honest it doesn't
matter<00:02:27.300> especially<00:02:28.050> if<00:02:28.140> they<00:02:28.230> only<00:02:28.349> gift

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
matter especially if they only gift

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.770 
matter especially if they only gift

so<00:02:43.260> basically<00:02:43.800> paint<00:02:44.130> all<00:02:44.340> round<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.880> find<00:02:45.569> with

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
so basically paint all round I find with

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.229 
so basically paint all round I find with
these<00:02:45.840> luminous<00:02:46.290> paints<00:02:46.739> that<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:46.890> have<00:02:47.220> when<00:02:48.209> I

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
these luminous paints that I have when I

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.880 
these luminous paints that I have when I
apply<00:02:48.690> them<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.380> look<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.620> little<00:02:49.800> bit

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
apply them and look a little bit

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.320 
apply them and look a little bit
see-through<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.459> worry<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:51.030> it's<00:02:51.180> not

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
see-through and I worry that it's not

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.789 
see-through and I worry that it's not
going<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.510> look<00:02:51.630> very<00:02:51.690> good<00:02:51.989> but<00:02:52.319> actually

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
going to look very good but actually

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.970 
going to look very good but actually

can<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:42.930> see<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.900> then<00:03:46.109> you<00:03:46.380> do<00:03:46.530> the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
can you see that and then you do the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.080 
can you see that and then you do the
same<00:03:46.829> on<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.010> other<00:03:47.070> side<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.549> just<00:03:47.579> tuck<00:03:47.940> it

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
same on the other side you just tuck it

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.580 
same on the other side you just tuck it
over<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:49.230> creating<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:50.280> sort<00:03:50.519> of<00:03:50.549> curve<00:03:51.590> there

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
over to creating the sort of curve there

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.740 
over to creating the sort of curve there
we<00:03:52.709> go<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.400> there<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.910> have<00:03:53.970> your<00:03:54.180> little<00:03:54.390> cat

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
we go and there you have your little cat

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.900 
we go and there you have your little cat
ears<00:03:55.049> obviously<00:03:55.859> before<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.579> do<00:03:56.700> that<00:03:56.850> I

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
ears obviously before you do that I

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.099 
ears obviously before you do that I
didn't<00:03:57.090> do<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:57.269> time<00:03:57.329> you<00:03:57.540> can<00:03:57.690> check<00:03:57.900> if

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
didn't do it this time you can check if

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.900 
didn't do it this time you can check if
there's<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.380> side<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.040> prefer<00:03:59.489> more<00:03:59.760> than

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
there's a side that you prefer more than

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.130 
there's a side that you prefer more than
another<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:00.359> for<00:04:00.390> example<00:04:00.750> here<00:04:00.870> I've<00:04:00.930> got<00:04:01.109> a

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
another so for example here I've got a

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.349 
another so for example here I've got a
line<00:04:01.319> running<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.980> this<00:04:02.670> is<00:04:02.790> smoother

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
line running and this is smoother

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.390 
line running and this is smoother
actually<00:04:04.350> let's<00:04:04.500> just<00:04:04.530> swap<00:04:04.799> it<00:04:05.040> so<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.250> can

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
actually let's just swap it so you can

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.940 
actually let's just swap it so you can
swap<00:04:05.670> it<00:04:05.819> around<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:07.440> have<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.709> neater

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
swap it around you have the neater

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.940 
swap it around you have the neater
groove<00:04:08.450> showing<00:04:09.450> up<00:04:09.569> now<00:04:10.109> to<00:04:10.380> make<00:04:10.650> this

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
groove showing up now to make this

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.349 
groove showing up now to make this
bottom<00:04:11.400> bit<00:04:11.989> what<00:04:12.989> you'll<00:04:13.170> need<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.410> do<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:14.359> is

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
bottom bit what you'll need to do is is

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.009 
bottom bit what you'll need to do is is
if<00:04:15.989> you<00:04:16.139> can<00:04:16.910> you're<00:04:17.910> going<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.150> hold<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:18.870> like

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
if you can you're going to hold it like

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.339 
if you can you're going to hold it like
this<00:04:19.760> like<00:04:20.760> that<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.299> then<00:04:21.780> in<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:21.989> opposite

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
this like that and then in the opposite

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.700 
this like that and then in the opposite
direction<00:04:22.470> again

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
direction again

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.370 
direction again
so<00:04:24.370> you<00:04:24.460> kind<00:04:24.669> of<00:04:24.699> have<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.930> square<00:04:25.930> at<00:04:26.350> the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
so you kind of have a square at the

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.950 
so you kind of have a square at the
bottom<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.949> see<00:04:26.979> that<00:04:27.250> square<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:28.690> the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
bottom you see that square and the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.060 
bottom you see that square and the
square<00:04:29.550> should<00:04:30.550> be<00:04:31.259> aligned<00:04:32.259> then<00:04:32.740> you<00:04:32.889> cut

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
square should be aligned then you cut

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.200 
square should be aligned then you cut
about<00:04:34.650> it's<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.830> centimeter<00:04:36.430> in<00:04:36.729> depending

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
about it's the centimeter in depending

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.999 
about it's the centimeter in depending
on<00:04:37.270> your<00:04:37.389> how<00:04:37.930> big<00:04:38.139> your<00:04:38.320> toilet<00:04:38.650> roll<00:04:38.800> is

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
on your how big your toilet roll is

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:40.920 
on your how big your toilet roll is
obviously<00:04:39.970> as<00:04:40.180> you're<00:04:40.330> cutting<00:04:40.660> this<00:04:40.750> you're

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
obviously as you're cutting this you're

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.719 
obviously as you're cutting this you're
going<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.110> end<00:04:41.169> up<00:04:41.410> with<00:04:41.620> a<00:04:41.680> slightly<00:04:42.039> shorter

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
going to end up with a slightly shorter

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.610 
going to end up with a slightly shorter
cut<00:04:43.139> and<00:04:44.139> then<00:04:44.289> here<00:04:44.440> goes<00:04:44.560> is<00:04:44.889> your<00:04:45.009> fold<00:04:45.280> over

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
cut and then here goes is your fold over

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:58.230 
cut and then here goes is your fold over
each<00:04:47.620> one<00:04:54.990> make<00:04:55.990> a<00:04:56.020> nice<00:04:56.320> little<00:04:56.590> crease<00:04:57.240> and

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
each one make a nice little crease and

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.469 
each one make a nice little crease and
then<00:04:58.810> you<00:04:59.229> want<00:04:59.410> glugging<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.740> packing<00:05:00.099> box<00:05:00.479> you

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
then you want glugging a packing box you

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:09.330 
then you want glugging a packing box you
want<00:05:01.599> them<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:01.960> just<00:05:03.000> alternate<00:05:08.070> you<00:05:09.070> have<00:05:09.310> a

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
want them to just alternate you have a

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.189 
want them to just alternate you have a
little<00:05:09.729> seal<00:05:10.330> box<00:05:10.599> and<00:05:10.750> then<00:05:10.840> if<00:05:10.930> you<00:05:10.990> want<00:05:11.139> it

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
to be able to stand up you literally

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.969 
to be able to stand up you literally
just<00:05:12.970> have<00:05:13.060> to<00:05:13.270> give<00:05:14.050> it<00:05:14.080> a<00:05:14.229> good<00:05:14.349> crease<00:05:14.560> and

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
just have to give it a good crease and

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.339 
just have to give it a good crease and

now you're ready to decorate now I don't

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.560 
now you're ready to decorate now I don't
know<00:05:17.590> about<00:05:17.680> you<00:05:17.979> but<00:05:18.250> sometimes<00:05:19.210> I<00:05:19.509> have

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
know about you but sometimes I have

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.680 
know about you but sometimes I have
these<00:05:19.900> little<00:05:20.050> creative<00:05:20.560> panics<00:05:21.190> and<00:05:21.940> that's

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
these little creative panics and that's

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.900 
these little creative panics and that's
good<00:05:22.960> to<00:05:23.440> draw<00:05:23.650> where<00:05:23.979> shall<00:05:24.099> I<00:05:24.220> start<00:05:24.280> and

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
good to draw where shall I start and

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.850 
good to draw where shall I start and
then<00:05:25.360> this<00:05:25.840> is<00:05:26.050> in<00:05:26.139> a<00:05:26.199> little<00:05:26.560> and<00:05:26.680> you<00:05:26.740> can

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
then this is in a little and you can

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.100 
then this is in a little and you can
throw<00:05:27.039> it<00:05:27.130> away<00:05:27.190> and<00:05:27.370> start<00:05:27.490> again<00:05:27.789> and<00:05:28.389> if

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
throw it away and start again and if

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.689 
throw it away and start again and if
you're<00:05:29.500> really<00:05:29.650> worried<00:05:30.070> just<00:05:30.460> to<00:05:30.580> practice

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
you're really worried just to practice

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.909 
you're really worried just to practice
only<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.150> piece<00:05:31.360> of<00:05:31.389> paper<00:05:31.510> first<00:05:31.930> and<00:05:32.289> then

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
only a piece of paper first and then

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.189 
only a piece of paper first and then
copy<00:05:33.580> it<00:05:33.789> and<00:05:34.000> that<00:05:34.150> I<00:05:34.180> find<00:05:34.539> is<00:05:34.690> really<00:05:34.990> easy

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
copy it and that I find is really easy

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.100 
copy it and that I find is really easy
non<00:05:35.560> stressful<00:05:35.889> way<00:05:36.280> of<00:05:36.690> decorating<00:05:37.690> your

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
non stressful way of decorating your

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.219 
non stressful way of decorating your
blue<00:05:38.620> rolls<00:05:38.889> and<00:05:39.220> other<00:05:40.210> times<00:05:40.539> I<00:05:40.750> just<00:05:40.780> draw

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
blue rolls and other times I just draw

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.659 
blue rolls and other times I just draw
and<00:05:41.440> I'm<00:05:41.560> really<00:05:41.770> happy<00:05:41.949> with<00:05:42.159> who<00:05:42.280> I'm<00:05:42.460> done

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
and I'm really happy with who I'm done

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
today I'm going to just draw the one

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.689 
today I'm going to just draw the one
similar<00:05:45.729> to<00:05:45.789> below<00:05:46.860> you<00:05:47.860> have<00:05:47.889> the<00:05:48.070> nose<00:05:48.370> a<00:05:48.520> bit
