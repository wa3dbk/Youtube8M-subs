00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.480 
and you can actually have it set up so
that<00:02:16.150> it'll<00:02:17.150> automatically<00:02:17.750> dial<00:02:18.100> for<00:02:19.100> you<00:02:19.250> or

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
that it'll automatically dial for you or

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.550 
that it'll automatically dial for you or
you<00:02:19.520> can<00:02:20.060> confirm<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.600> as<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:20.750> have<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.230> just<00:02:21.410> in

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
you can confirm it as I have it just in

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.680 
you can confirm it as I have it just in
case<00:02:21.800> as<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.640> said<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:24.170> vocal<00:02:25.690> recognition

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
case as I said the the vocal recognition

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.860 
case as I said the the vocal recognition
system<00:02:27.050> can<00:02:27.590> be<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.740> little<00:02:27.980> off<00:02:28.160> depending<00:02:28.520> on

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
system can be a little off depending on

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.280 
system can be a little off depending on
if<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:29.990> have<00:02:30.170> names<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.710> are<00:02:30.890> similar<00:02:31.240> as<00:02:32.240> in

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.940 

Dennis<00:02:36.290> or<00:02:36.500> Denise<00:02:36.800> you<00:02:37.670> know<00:02:38.470> Pat<00:02:39.470> or<00:02:39.740> cat

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
Dennis or Denise you know Pat or cat

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.690 
Dennis or Denise you know Pat or cat
things<00:02:40.340> like<00:02:40.490> that<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:42.170> seems<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.190> recognize

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
things like that it seems to recognize

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.800 
things like that it seems to recognize
more<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:46.490> residents<00:02:47.150> of<00:02:47.210> your<00:02:47.330> voice<00:02:47.570> or

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
more so the residents of your voice or

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.360 
more so the residents of your voice or
the<00:02:47.840> pitchi<00:02:48.080> a<00:02:48.230> voice<00:02:48.470> as<00:02:48.770> opposed<00:02:49.190> to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
the pitchi a voice as opposed to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.610 
the pitchi a voice as opposed to
actually<00:02:52.450> corresponding<00:02:53.450> with<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:54.080> letters

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
actually corresponding with the letters

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.690 
actually corresponding with the letters
of<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.770> alphabet<00:02:54.830> the<00:03:00.310> when<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.400> comes<00:03:01.580> to

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
of the alphabet the when it comes to

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.580 
of the alphabet the when it comes to
applications<00:03:02.240> as<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.840> can<00:03:02.959> see<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.320> actually

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
applications as you can see I actually

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.270 
applications as you can see I actually
have<00:03:03.920> my<00:03:04.550> my<00:03:05.000> pages<00:03:05.620> right<00:03:06.620> up<00:03:06.800> front<00:03:07.070> and

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
have my my pages right up front and

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.090 
have my my pages right up front and
filled<00:03:08.080> which<00:03:09.080> is<00:03:09.230> easier<00:03:09.800> than<00:03:09.860> actually

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
filled which is easier than actually

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.610 
filled which is easier than actually
going<00:03:10.430> into<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:11.510> application<00:03:11.660> list<00:03:12.230> itself

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
going into the application list itself

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.870 
going into the application list itself
as<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:13.040> can<00:03:13.160> see<00:03:13.310> it's<00:03:13.459> right<00:03:13.550> here<00:03:13.700> in<00:03:13.760> the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
as you can see it's right here in the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.470 
as you can see it's right here in the
middle<00:03:13.910> if<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:14.720> go<00:03:14.900> down<00:03:14.930> now<00:03:16.060> if<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.180> want<00:03:17.390> to

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.890 
pull one of these out and up under one
of<00:03:19.760> your<00:03:19.880> pages<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:20.300> you<00:03:20.390> don't<00:03:20.540> have<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.780> go

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
of your pages so you don't have to go

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.840 
of your pages so you don't have to go
searching<00:03:21.110> for<00:03:21.320> them<00:03:21.650> basically<00:03:22.610> what<00:03:22.760> you

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
is basically almost the same thing you

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.250 
is basically almost the same thing you
hold<00:03:43.550> down<00:03:43.790> on<00:03:44.090> it<00:03:44.239> what's<00:03:44.750> going<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:44.959> happen

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
hold down on it what's going to happen

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.890 
hold down on it what's going to happen
is<00:03:45.410> this<00:03:46.040> is<00:03:46.160> good<00:03:46.300> if<00:03:47.300> you<00:03:47.420> notice<00:03:47.660> down<00:03:47.780> the
