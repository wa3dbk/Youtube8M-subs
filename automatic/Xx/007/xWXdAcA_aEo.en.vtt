my<00:02:41.090> process<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.870> composing<00:02:43.780> mostly<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:44.840> write

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
my process of composing mostly I write

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.250 
my process of composing mostly I write
at<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.410> piano<00:02:45.770> sometimes<00:02:46.630> I'll<00:02:47.630> come<00:02:47.960> up<00:02:48.080> with

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
at the piano sometimes I'll come up with

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.540 
at the piano sometimes I'll come up with
titles<00:02:48.740> and<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:50.600> composition<00:02:51.230> will<00:02:51.680> come<00:02:51.950> as

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
titles and the composition will come as

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.580 
titles and the composition will come as
a<00:02:52.610> result<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.360> time

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.900 

and<00:02:57.190> usually<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.819> improvise<00:02:59.610> you<00:03:00.610> know<00:03:00.760> the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
and usually I improvise you know the

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.229 
and usually I improvise you know the
melodies<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.810> chords<00:03:02.319> and<00:03:02.530> I<00:03:02.800> find

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
melodies of a chords and I find

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.970 
melodies of a chords and I find
something<00:03:04.239> that<00:03:04.540> grabs<00:03:04.810> me<00:03:05.140> then<00:03:05.500> I'll<00:03:05.650> move

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
something that grabs me then I'll move

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.860 
something that grabs me then I'll move
around

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.070 
you know I'm like a colorist on the
drums<00:03:18.640> I<00:03:18.910> think<00:03:19.150> of<00:03:19.239> myself<00:03:19.360> more<00:03:19.629> as<00:03:19.810> the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
drums I think of myself more as the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.520 
drums I think of myself more as the
colours<00:03:20.440> like<00:03:20.800> a<00:03:20.860> painter<00:03:21.629> so<00:03:22.629> you<00:03:23.019> know<00:03:23.140> I<00:03:23.170> can

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
colours like a painter so you know I can

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.160 
colours like a painter so you know I can
work<00:03:23.739> within<00:03:24.099> time<00:03:24.519> but<00:03:25.000> I<00:03:25.030> can<00:03:25.269> also<00:03:25.450> be<00:03:25.720> free

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
work within time but I can also be free

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.479 
work within time but I can also be free
of<00:03:26.319> it<00:03:26.489> more<00:03:27.489> elastic<00:03:28.180> in<00:03:29.140> that<00:03:29.410> sense<00:03:29.769> and

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
of it more elastic in that sense and

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:42.470 
of it more elastic in that sense and
piano<00:03:30.879> is<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.120> same<00:03:31.390> way

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.979
