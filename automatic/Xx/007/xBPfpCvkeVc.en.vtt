00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
totally good wild edible and the only

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.009 
totally good wild edible and the only
reason<00:03:38.250> I'm<00:03:38.340> showing<00:03:38.549> it<00:03:38.790> but<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:39.630> wait<00:03:39.810> till

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
reason I'm showing it but you wait till

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.920 
reason I'm showing it but you wait till
fall<00:03:40.260> once<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:41.010> above-ground<00:03:42.000> plant<00:03:42.390> starts

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
fall once the above-ground plant starts

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.470 
fall once the above-ground plant starts
dying<00:03:43.170> back<00:03:43.549> that's<00:03:44.549> when<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:44.910> harvest<00:03:45.180> it

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
dying back that's when you harvest it

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.060 
dying back that's when you harvest it
and<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.049> only<00:03:46.170> reason<00:03:46.380> I'm<00:03:46.590> showing<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.040> to

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
and the only reason I'm showing it to

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.039 
and the only reason I'm showing it to
you<00:03:47.340> now

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
you now

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.539 
you now
is<00:03:49.049> because<00:03:49.470> I'm<00:03:49.620> going<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.920> mow<00:03:50.100> this<00:03:50.280> field

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
is because I'm going to mow this field

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:51.979 
is because I'm going to mow this field
and<00:03:50.790> this<00:03:50.910> is<00:03:51.060> all<00:03:51.209> going<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.450> get<00:03:51.540> mowed<00:03:51.780> off

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
and this is all going to get mowed off

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.940 
and this is all going to get mowed off
so<00:03:52.910> you<00:03:53.910> won't<00:03:54.090> be<00:03:54.180> able<00:03:54.360> to<00:03:54.420> see<00:03:54.570> this<00:03:54.720> and

so you won't be able to see this and

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.850 
so you won't be able to see this and

wild parsnip and they don't even put a
dent<00:04:13.049> in<00:04:13.260> it<00:04:13.350> this<00:04:13.530> is<00:04:13.709> one<00:04:13.890> of<00:04:14.010> those<00:04:14.130> plants

about<00:04:24.599> invasives<00:04:25.349> five<00:04:26.310> six<00:04:26.729> thousand<00:04:27.180> people

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
about invasives five six thousand people

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.120 
about invasives five six thousand people
could<00:04:27.660> live<00:04:27.840> off<00:04:28.110> of

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
could live off of

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.840 
could live off of
a<00:04:29.480> field<00:04:30.480> of<00:04:30.690> these<00:04:30.840> things<00:04:31.140> and<00:04:31.410> not<00:04:31.850> destroy

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
a field of these things and not destroy

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.760 
a field of these things and not destroy
the<00:04:33.000> field<00:04:33.210> it'll<00:04:33.630> still<00:04:34.020> come<00:04:34.200> up<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.500> next

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
the field it'll still come up the next

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.770 
the field it'll still come up the next
year<00:04:34.950> now<00:04:35.160> is<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.520> boring<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:36.000> eat<00:04:36.150> nothing<00:04:36.570> but

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
year now is it boring to eat nothing but

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.950 
year now is it boring to eat nothing but
wild<00:04:37.020> parsnips<00:04:37.590> yeah<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:39.240> certainly<00:04:39.720> would<00:04:39.930> be

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
wild parsnips yeah it certainly would be

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.680 
wild parsnips yeah it certainly would be
but<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:40.950> is<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.160> wild<00:04:41.550> food<00:04:41.880> that<00:04:42.150> is<00:04:42.360> available

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
but it is a wild food that is available

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.760 
but it is a wild food that is available
and<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.710> more<00:04:43.890> Frost's<00:04:44.580> you<00:04:44.820> can<00:04:45.210> get<00:04:45.480> between

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
and the more Frost's you can get between

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.110 
and the more Frost's you can get between
the<00:04:47.060> plants<00:04:48.060> being<00:04:48.360> alive<00:04:48.990> like<00:04:49.260> this<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:50.120> the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
the plants being alive like this and the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.090 
the plants being alive like this and the
time<00:04:51.330> you<00:04:51.480> harvest<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.380> better<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:52.710> tastes

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
time you harvest it the better it tastes

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.880 
time you harvest it the better it tastes
so<00:04:53.610> if<00:04:53.790> like<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.390> plant<00:04:54.630> dies<00:04:54.840> back<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.560> you

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
so if like the plant dies back and you

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.280 
so if like the plant dies back and you
get<00:04:56.070> three<00:04:56.460> or<00:04:56.550> four<00:04:56.610> Frost's<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.450> you<00:04:57.960> dig<00:04:58.170> it

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
get three or four Frost's and you dig it

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.650 
get three or four Frost's and you dig it
up<00:04:58.380> it's<00:04:58.680> going<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:58.920> be<00:04:58.980> a<00:04:59.070> sweeter<00:04:59.460> flavor<00:04:59.660> if

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
up it's going to be a sweeter flavor if

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.690 
up it's going to be a sweeter flavor if
you<00:05:00.750> can<00:05:01.110> wait<00:05:01.320> till<00:05:01.560> spring<00:05:01.740> to<00:05:02.220> dig<00:05:02.400> it<00:05:02.550> up

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
you can wait till spring to dig it up

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.180 
you can wait till spring to dig it up
just<00:05:03.030> before<00:05:03.210> it<00:05:03.450> starts<00:05:03.870> coming<00:05:04.620> rolling

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
just before it starts coming rolling

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.560 
just before it starts coming rolling
again<00:05:05.490> that<00:05:05.760> will<00:05:05.940> be<00:05:05.970> when<00:05:06.240> it's<00:05:06.390> at<00:05:06.540> its

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
again that will be when it's at its

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.140 
again that will be when it's at its
sweetest<00:05:07.200> but<00:05:08.190> it<00:05:08.280> stores<00:05:08.550> it's<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:08.970> good

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
sweetest but it stores it's a good

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.120 
sweetest but it stores it's a good
source<00:05:09.390> of<00:05:09.540> starch<00:05:09.810> it's<00:05:10.050> a<00:05:10.110> good<00:05:10.290> source<00:05:10.890> of

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
source of starch it's a good source of

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.250 
source of starch it's a good source of
vitamin<00:05:11.370> C<00:05:12.180> it's<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:12.390> good<00:05:12.570> it's<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.230> good

vitamin source I'm not too thrilled with

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.900 
vitamin source I'm not too thrilled with
it<00:05:16.740> at<00:05:16.920> this<00:05:17.250> time<00:05:17.490> of<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:17.700> year
