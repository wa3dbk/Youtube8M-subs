00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.650
 the words will take away the wind, the one 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:30.829
 what answers I teach in 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.260
 football players to those who work with me to those who 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.449
 he attends that the answers always on the 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.199
 field because the field does justice 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.199
 always 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.140
 they are a team that you are 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.610
 proving very strong they play a nice game 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.620
 soccer put us a lot in 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.110
 difficulties and we were good at 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.489
 take advantage of the right opportunities and then 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.800
 in short, after the expulsion in the match 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.800
 it got a lot better for us 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.330
 we knew that the rome would grant it 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.159
 Starting spaces becomes devastating not 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.520
 were very good at occupying the 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.520
 spaces 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.760
 but maybe not good looking at it 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.100
 normal ranking we have many points 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.090
 of advantage however there are still many 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.600
 you start so I think that whoever is still a 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.050
 long journey surely is now standing 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.050
 much to us 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.250
 this year on the eve he had said that 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.370
 she would have to talk on the field 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.200
 liked the speech he made but me 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.290
 I think the field should always talk 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.700
 in all situations a juventus 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.070
 for two and a half years now 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.540
 opening to speak the field also in 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.020
 important way sometimes even in 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.020
 sensational manner 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.069
 Well
