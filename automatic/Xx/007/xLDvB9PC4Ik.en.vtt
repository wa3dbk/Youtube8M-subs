left with and I'm just going to top coat

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.980 
left with and I'm just going to top coat
that<00:06:30.670> I'm<00:06:30.850> probably<00:06:31.060> know<00:06:31.360> so<00:06:31.600> this<00:06:31.750> is<00:06:31.900> the

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
that I'm probably know so this is the

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.990 
that I'm probably know so this is the
finish<00:06:32.260> now<00:06:32.470> I've<00:06:32.980> taken<00:06:33.280> it<00:06:33.460> out<00:06:33.580> of<00:06:33.640> the<00:06:33.820> lamp

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
finish now I've taken it out of the lamp

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000 
finish now I've taken it out of the lamp
and<00:06:34.240> I've<00:06:34.570> wiped<00:06:34.870> the<00:06:35.140> inhibition<00:06:35.620> layer<00:06:35.800> and

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
and I've wiped the inhibition layer and

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.530 
and I've wiped the inhibition layer and
as<00:06:36.160> you<00:06:36.280> can<00:06:36.430> see<00:06:36.460> it's<00:06:36.760> a<00:06:36.820> very<00:06:36.850> subtle<00:06:37.240> design

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
as you can see it's a very subtle design

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.380 
as you can see it's a very subtle design
you<00:06:38.230> could<00:06:38.410> do<00:06:38.530> so<00:06:38.800> you<00:06:39.250> could<00:06:39.550> do<00:06:39.880> this<00:06:40.030> over

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
you could do so you could do this over

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.390 
you could do so you could do this over
the<00:06:40.480> whole<00:06:40.690> nail<00:06:40.930> and<00:06:41.260> obviously<00:06:41.890> these<00:06:42.100> color

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
the whole nail and obviously these color

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.520 
the whole nail and obviously these color
pops<00:06:42.610> a<00:06:42.700> huge<00:06:42.970> so<00:06:43.210> I've<00:06:43.750> done<00:06:44.020> it<00:06:44.140> on<00:06:44.230> the<00:06:44.350> sort

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
pops a huge so I've done it on the sort

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.260 
pops a huge so I've done it on the sort
of<00:06:44.620> an<00:06:44.710> angle<00:06:45.010> just<00:06:45.190> to<00:06:45.280> show<00:06:45.460> you<00:06:45.550> something<00:06:46.090> a

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
of an angle just to show you something a

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.240 
of an angle just to show you something a
bit<00:06:46.360> different<00:06:46.560> and<00:06:47.560> as<00:06:47.680> you<00:06:47.770> can<00:06:47.890> tell<00:06:47.920> by<00:06:48.070> the

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
bit different and as you can tell by the

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.620 
bit different and as you can tell by the
mess<00:06:48.460> in<00:06:48.580> the<00:06:48.670> background<00:06:49.090> I'm<00:06:49.210> having<00:06:49.480> one<00:06:49.600> of

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
mess in the background I'm having one of

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.210 
mess in the background I'm having one of
those<00:06:49.750> days<00:06:50.050> where<00:06:50.380> the<00:06:50.410> stamp<00:06:50.770> just<00:06:50.980> wouldn't

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
those days where the stamp just wouldn't

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.680 
those days where the stamp just wouldn't
pick<00:06:51.370> up<00:06:51.490> so<00:06:51.700> it<00:06:51.790> to<00:06:51.910> actually<00:06:52.120> took<00:06:52.420> me<00:06:52.570> about

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
pick up so it to actually took me about

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.750 
pick up so it to actually took me about
five<00:06:52.990> goes<00:06:53.260> to<00:06:53.500> get<00:06:53.650> the<00:06:53.800> image<00:06:54.190> on<00:06:54.370> the<00:06:54.430> stamp

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:54.760 
five goes to get the image on the stamp

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.930 
five goes to get the image on the stamp
but<00:06:55.180> we<00:06:55.390> got<00:06:55.570> there<00:06:55.720> eventually<00:06:56.430> okay<00:06:57.430> guys<00:06:57.640> so

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
but we got there eventually okay guys so
