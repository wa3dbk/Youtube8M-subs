 torremendo is a fiction is a fiction 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.420
 almost almost a vice because when we are 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.480
 engaged in making a house of these 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.910
 it really is that you do not even leave the end of 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.980
 week when you arrive from work and you leave and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.720

 no art school or anything 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.390
 we really are a little bit like you can 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.100
 see self taught the first are very 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.289
 simple and with time they go 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.240
 evolving in this exhibition it 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.929
 reflect 20 years of work of the 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.750

 torremendo dollhouses to which no 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.380
 they lack any detail is life 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:47.259
 everyday of the early 20th century and 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.360
 there is also some personal stamp of the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.479
 authors for example in the famous house of 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.929
 13 Rue barnacle here it works 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.929
 the elevator 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.610
 but if outside they are a real gem 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.380
 inside any minimal detail leaves 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.299
 with mouths open to visitors 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.649

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.799
 gone because the decoration is in accordance 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.590
 with the majesty of these mansions 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.870

 Alicante is not in the market in 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.069
 miniature then I made a carved tile 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.969
 in miniature in plaster 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.730
 on that tile I took out silicone molds 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:11.219
 and then about 2500 reproductions of nothing 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.409
 six months of work leads to each 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.569
 of these houses made of wood with 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.730
 clay tiles designed by this

 in carving every border of this Belgian house 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.989
 or in the stained glass windows and the arches of this 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.090
 another Portuguese a hobby that started 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.069
 two decades ago when I did not know what 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.919

 does not have no value has no value 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.099
 I mean, I would not know how to value it 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.919
 because it would hurt a lot to get rid of 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:50.340
 she selling the I do not know no I'm not able 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:53.010
