stranded in a winter situation and so

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.990 
stranded in a winter situation and so
I'm<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> go<00:00:47.430> through<00:00:47.670> each<00:00:47.700> of

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
I'm just going to go through each of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.630 
think that's really important to kind of
keep<00:00:51.899> everything<00:00:52.260> together<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.399> you're<00:00:53.550> not

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
the video you know having a good scraper

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.210 
the video you know having a good scraper
is<00:02:18.900> important<00:02:19.440> not<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:19.920> while<00:02:20.100> you're

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
is important not just while you're

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.040 
is important not just while you're
leaving<00:02:20.580> your<00:02:20.670> home<00:02:20.850> in<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.060> mornings<00:02:21.480> but

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
leaving your home in the mornings but

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.690

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
you can get stuck in a situation where

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.580 
you can get stuck in a situation where
your<00:02:23.940> windshield<00:02:24.330> wipers<00:02:24.660> get<00:02:24.930> frozen<00:02:25.260> and

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
your windshield wipers get frozen and

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.130 
your windshield wipers get frozen and
you<00:02:26.400> really<00:02:26.670> are<00:02:26.700> getting<00:02:27.180> iced<00:02:27.540> over<00:02:27.930> your

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
you really are getting iced over your

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.480 
you really are getting iced over your
windshield<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.100> will<00:02:29.250> really<00:02:29.370> help

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
windshield and so this will really help

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.910 
windshield and so this will really help
to<00:02:29.790> scrape<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.270> off<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:31.080> keep<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.410> clean

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
to scrape it off and to keep it clean

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.860 
to scrape it off and to keep it clean
now<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.310> course<00:02:32.370> I'm<00:02:32.760> assuming<00:02:32.880> also<00:02:33.690> that

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870

you can use this to signal rescue now
one<00:05:50.100> important<00:05:50.550> tool<00:05:50.700> I<00:05:50.760> think<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:51.240> have<00:05:51.390> is

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
one important tool I think to have is

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.900 
one important tool I think to have is
when<00:05:52.260> a<00:05:52.290> shovel<00:05:52.919> of<00:05:53.010> some<00:05:53.220> sort<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:53.669> I<00:05:53.729> think

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
when a shovel of some sort and I think

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.270 
when a shovel of some sort and I think
these<00:05:54.060> military<00:05:54.540> shovels<00:05:55.020> they<00:05:55.200> pack<00:05:55.440> really

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
these military shovels they pack really

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.440 
these military shovels they pack really
easily<00:05:56.970> and<00:05:58.040> you<00:05:59.040> can<00:05:59.070> really<00:05:59.460> stow<00:06:00.240> these

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
easily and you can really stow these

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.560 
easily and you can really stow these
away<00:06:00.810> and<00:06:01.169> yet<00:06:01.410> they<00:06:01.620> are<00:06:01.650> very<00:06:02.070> effective<00:06:02.640> you

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
away and yet they are very effective you

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.570 
away and yet they are very effective you
can<00:06:03.720> even<00:06:03.870> use<00:06:04.140> them<00:06:04.290> as<00:06:04.440> an<00:06:04.560> axe<00:06:04.800> to<00:06:05.130> cut<00:06:05.160> with

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
can even use them as an axe to cut with

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.850 
can even use them as an axe to cut with
if<00:06:06.240> you<00:06:06.390> need<00:06:06.540> to<00:06:06.720> but<00:06:06.900> a<00:06:07.110> great<00:06:07.380> shovel

necessarily going to be walking with and
using<00:06:21.180> a<00:06:21.240> lot<00:06:21.419> it<00:06:21.660> just<00:06:21.870> can<00:06:21.990> stay<00:06:22.200> in<00:06:22.290> your

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
using a lot it just can stay in your

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.620 
using a lot it just can stay in your
vehicle<00:06:22.470> and<00:06:22.979> so<00:06:23.610> keeping<00:06:24.120> it<00:06:24.240> all<00:06:24.419> together

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
vehicle and so keeping it all together

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.200 
vehicle and so keeping it all together
in<00:06:25.140> one<00:06:25.169> little<00:06:25.740> area<00:06:25.979> I<00:06:26.310> think<00:06:26.400> is<00:06:26.910> really

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
in one little area I think is really

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.360 
in one little area I think is really
important<00:06:27.660> and<00:06:27.870> you<00:06:27.930> know<00:06:28.650> when<00:06:28.830> spring<00:06:29.190> comes

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
important and you know when spring comes

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.550 
important and you know when spring comes
along<00:06:29.700> you<00:06:29.850> can<00:06:30.000> pull<00:06:30.180> this<00:06:30.330> out<00:06:30.540> or<00:06:31.200> you<00:06:31.410> can

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
along you can pull this out or you can

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.500 
along you can pull this out or you can
exchange<00:06:31.770> it<00:06:32.070> for<00:06:32.100> other<00:06:32.310> items<00:06:32.550> now<00:06:33.360> this

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
exchange it for other items now this

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.300 
exchange it for other items now this
doesn't<00:06:33.720> necessarily<00:06:33.890> change<00:06:34.890> your

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
doesn't necessarily change your

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.909 
doesn't necessarily change your

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
this emergency car kit and this is a

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.650 
this emergency car kit and this is a
little<00:07:01.710> more<00:07:01.889> complete<00:07:02.580> with<00:07:02.880> first<00:07:03.180> aid<00:07:03.419> and
