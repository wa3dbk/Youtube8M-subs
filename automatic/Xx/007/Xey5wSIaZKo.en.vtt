to reassemble the armrest after you

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.830 
to reassemble the armrest after you
replace<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.230> parts<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.650> want<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.860> replace

replace the parts you want to replace

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.189 
replace the parts you want to replace
the<00:00:12.840> hinge<00:00:13.349> they<00:00:14.009> spring<00:00:14.639> on<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.750> hinges<00:00:16.080> are

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
the hinge they spring on the hinges are

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.910 
the hinge they spring on the hinges are
a<00:00:16.230> little<00:00:16.470> tricky<00:00:17.600> and<00:00:18.619> it's<00:00:19.619> something<00:00:19.770> I

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
a little tricky and it's something I

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.710 
a little tricky and it's something I
realized<00:00:20.070> after<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.520> fact<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.210> there<00:00:21.539> are

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
realized after the fact that there are

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.060 
realized after the fact that there are
you<00:00:22.020> there<00:00:22.710> pretty<00:00:23.699> much<00:00:24.350> assigned<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.920> each

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
you there pretty much assigned to each

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.670 
you there pretty much assigned to each
side<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.820> can't<00:00:27.060> swap<00:00:27.449> sides<00:00:27.869> when<00:00:28.590> you

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
side so you can't swap sides when you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.759 
side so you can't swap sides when you
put<00:00:28.830> them<00:00:28.920> back<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.449> think<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.230> goes<00:00:31.439> on

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
put them back I think this one goes on

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.880 
put them back I think this one goes on
this<00:00:32.130> side<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.759> because<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:34.260> goes<00:00:34.500> back

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
this side here because of it goes back

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.580 
this side here because of it goes back
into<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.250> groove<00:00:35.570> there<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.600> then<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.050> clips<00:00:37.410> in

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
into a groove there and then it clips in

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.860 
into a groove there and then it clips in
so<00:00:37.739> I'm<00:00:37.800> going<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.980> show<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.399> real<00:00:38.640> quick

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.530 
parts that I'm not going to use sex toys
right<00:01:09.030> back<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.450> clips<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:11.360> again<00:01:12.360> these

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
right back in it clips in again these

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.750 
right back in it clips in again these
things<00:01:12.780> there's<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> groove<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> top<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.610> it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
things there's a groove at the top so it

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.310 
things there's a groove at the top so it
only<00:01:14.880> goes<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.630> way

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
only goes in one way

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.039 
only goes in one way
with<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.130> groove<00:01:17.369> facing<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.210> there's

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
with the groove facing up and there's

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.390 
with the groove facing up and there's
like<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> little<00:01:19.409> clicky<00:01:19.830> thing<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.310> bottom

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
like a little clicky thing on the bottom

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.200 
like a little clicky thing on the bottom
next<00:01:20.820> time<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.530> think<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.880> spring

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
next time so I think this is the spring

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.819 
next time so I think this is the spring
you<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.750> see<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.369> it<00:01:26.780> sort<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.810> faces<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.439> way

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
you can see on it sort of faces that way

tightens<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.850> turn<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.320> spring

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
tightens it so you turn it so the spring

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.220 
tightens it so you turn it so the spring
gets<00:02:14.420> tighter<00:02:15.420> sorry

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
gets tighter sorry

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.280 
gets tighter sorry
my<00:02:16.440> pliers<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:17.040> stuck<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.820> this<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.660> real<00:02:19.020> easy

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
my pliers is stuck and this is real easy

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.730 
my pliers is stuck and this is real easy
easier<00:02:19.980> than<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.220> looks<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:21.500> I'm<00:02:22.500> going<00:02:22.680> to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
easier than it looks and I'm going to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.000 
easier than it looks and I'm going to
turn<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.100> with<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.490> pliers<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:25.380> just<00:02:25.650> force

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
turn it with the pliers and just force

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.540 
turn it with the pliers and just force
it<00:02:26.130> back<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.520> there<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.420> that's<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.130> then

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
it back in there and that's it and then

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.460 
it back in there and that's it and then
even<00:02:30.210> though<00:02:30.390> my<00:02:30.600> hinge<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:30.990> broken<00:02:31.230> right

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
even though my hinge is broken right

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.300 
even though my hinge is broken right
there<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:32.670> still<00:02:32.970> goes<00:02:33.150> back<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:33.540> there<00:02:34.310> and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
there it still goes back in there and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.510 
there it still goes back in there and
we'll<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.120> do<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.390> other<00:02:36.510> side<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:38.220> show<00:02:38.460> you

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
we'll just do the other side to show you

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.620 
we'll just do the other side to show you
guys<00:02:38.760> real<00:02:39.060> quick<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:41.700> again<00:02:41.970> my<00:02:42.180> groove<00:02:42.450> is

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
guys real quick so again my groove is

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.480 
guys real quick so again my groove is
facing<00:02:43.050> up<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.850> my<00:02:44.900> little<00:02:45.900> M<00:02:46.190> anchor<00:02:47.190> clip

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
facing up and my little M anchor clip

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.020 
facing up and my little M anchor clip
faces<00:02:48.060> down<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:51.390> this<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:51.990> really<00:02:52.350> easy

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
faces down so so this is really easy

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.810 
faces down so so this is really easy
equiping<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.270> hear<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.540> clip<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.700> again<00:02:56.700> we

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
equiping you hear that clip and again we

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.300 
equiping you hear that clip and again we
have<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.060> spring<00:02:57.390> for<00:02:57.960> this<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:58.860> driver's

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
have the spring for this is the driver's

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.410 
have the spring for this is the driver's
side<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.390> armrest<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:02.240> again<00:03:03.240> you<00:03:03.390> see

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
side of the armrest and again you see

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
side of the armrest and again you see
how<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.690> lines<00:03:04.170> up<00:03:05.270> facing<00:03:06.270> in<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.140> we<00:03:07.230> put

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
how that lines up facing in so we put

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.449 
how that lines up facing in so we put
that<00:03:07.470> in<00:03:07.620> there<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:10.590> I'll<00:03:10.680> just<00:03:10.860> slip<00:03:11.280> right

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
that in there and I'll just slip right

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.470 
that in there and I'll just slip right
in<00:03:11.610> there<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:11.910> then<00:03:12.000> you'll<00:03:12.120> take<00:03:12.330> your

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
in there and then you'll take your

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.900 
in there and then you'll take your
pliers<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:14.060> you'll<00:03:15.060> grab<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:17.190> guess<00:03:17.580> we'll

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
pliers and you'll grab the I guess we'll

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.120 
pliers and you'll grab the I guess we'll
call<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.270> like<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.780> bridge<00:03:19.080> of<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.770> spring

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
call this like the bridge of the spring

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.870 
call this like the bridge of the spring
the<00:03:20.340> Center<00:03:21.209> bridge<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:22.370> once<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.489> grab<00:03:23.700> it

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
the Center bridge and once you grab it

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.199 
the Center bridge and once you grab it
you'll<00:03:24.360> feel<00:03:24.630> like<00:03:24.780> one<00:03:25.050> way<00:03:25.200> loosens<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:26.209> like

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
you'll feel like one way loosens it like

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.620 
you'll feel like one way loosens it like
turn<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.600> this<00:03:27.720> way<00:03:27.780> loosens<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.410> turning<00:03:28.800> it

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
turn it this way loosens it turning it

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.479 
turn it this way loosens it turning it
this<00:03:30.630> way<00:03:30.870> tightens<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:32.220> we're<00:03:32.340> going<00:03:32.430> to

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
this way tightens it so we're going to

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.990 
this way tightens it so we're going to
tighten<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.209> then<00:03:33.920> it'll<00:03:34.920> fit<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.730> bridge

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
tighten it and then it'll fit the bridge

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.620 
tighten it and then it'll fit the bridge
part<00:03:36.510> of<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.750> spring<00:03:37.050> see<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:39.120> bridge<00:03:39.330> part

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
part of the spring see the bridge part

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.520 
part of the spring see the bridge part
of<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.840> spring<00:03:40.140> will<00:03:40.590> fit<00:03:40.890> right<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:42.660> where<00:03:43.440> it

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
of the spring will fit right in where it

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.280 
of the spring will fit right in where it
belongs<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.330> they'll<00:03:45.330> clip<00:03:45.690> writing<00:03:46.050> here

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
belongs and they'll clip writing here

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.040 
belongs and they'll clip writing here
the<00:03:46.320> clip<00:03:46.620> when<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.640> goes<00:03:47.790> in<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.180> you'll

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
the clip when it goes in and you'll

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.620 
the clip when it goes in and you'll
release<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.620> pliers<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.269> you<00:03:51.269> see<00:03:51.420> how<00:03:51.570> that

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
release the pliers and you see how that

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.170 
release the pliers and you see how that
works<00:03:52.050> so<00:03:52.350> it<00:03:53.130> goes<00:03:53.340> right<00:03:53.519> into<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.910> grooves

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
works so it goes right into the grooves

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.720 
works so it goes right into the grooves
right<00:03:54.420> there<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.110> bridge<00:03:55.320> part<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.800> the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
right there the bridge part of the

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.970 
right there the bridge part of the
spring<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.510> center<00:03:57.840> part<00:03:58.080> of<00:03:58.290> it

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
spring the center part of it

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:10.800 
spring the center part of it
and<00:03:59.459> that's<00:03:59.880> it<00:04:00.090> an<00:04:00.180> armrest<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:01.140> reassembled

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.270 

and<00:04:11.810> then<00:04:12.250> as<00:04:13.250> real<00:04:13.550> easy<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:14.390> do<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:14.960> and

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
and then as real easy to do this and

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.280 
and then as real easy to do this and
again<00:04:16.280> this<00:04:16.579> is<00:04:16.820> you<00:04:17.480> know<00:04:17.600> sort<00:04:17.810> of<00:04:17.930> relevant

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
again this is you know sort of relevant

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.460 
again this is you know sort of relevant
to<00:04:18.410> anyone<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.799> wants<00:04:18.920> to<00:04:19.190> just<00:04:19.340> replace<00:04:19.609> one

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
to anyone that wants to just replace one

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.130 
to anyone that wants to just replace one
part<00:04:21.470> of<00:04:21.709> the<00:04:22.070> armrest<00:04:22.400> I<00:04:23.180> just<00:04:23.840> looked<00:04:23.960> online

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
part of the armrest I just looked online

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.160 
part of the armrest I just looked online
the<00:04:24.800> upper<00:04:25.100> lid<00:04:25.340> it<00:04:25.580> does<00:04:25.790> have<00:04:26.510> its<00:04:26.690> own<00:04:26.840> parts

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
the upper lid it does have its own parts

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.230 
the upper lid it does have its own parts
number<00:04:27.530> four<00:04:28.370> I<00:04:28.400> guess<00:04:28.610> if<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:28.850> want<00:04:29.030> leather

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
number four I guess if you want leather

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.710 
number four I guess if you want leather
cloth<00:04:29.690> or<00:04:29.930> vinyl<00:04:29.960> final<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:32.240> can<00:04:32.390> replace

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
cloth or vinyl final you can replace

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.620 
cloth or vinyl final you can replace
that<00:04:32.750> at<00:04:33.200> I<00:04:33.500> guess<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.860> dealership<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:34.630> I

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
that at I guess the dealership and I

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.940 
that at I guess the dealership and I
think<00:04:35.840> they<00:04:35.930> run<00:04:36.050> about<00:04:36.290> two<00:04:36.590> hundred<00:04:36.710> dollars

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
think they run about two hundred dollars
