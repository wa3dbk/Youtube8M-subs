00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.640
 hello everyone I find you 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.799
 today rather who yesterday because 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.450
 I have a small technical problem but 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.360
 good we end up to make a 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.519
 chicken fajita recipe so for 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.519
 we will need three peppers 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.180
 we will also need lease 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.500
 and also referrals of chickens and 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.500
 go out 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:10.300
 season with chicken stock 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:15.120
 will then mix 30 at home with 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.120
 a tabasco madman and our haye 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.479
 we will pour the mixture into our squires 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.479
 from peeled 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.970
 we put a little oil in our stove 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.970
 then our peppers 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.259
 add our essential bouillon 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.570
 Poultry 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.299
 after about 10 minutes of cooking you 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.540
 can add your needles 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.540
 chicken 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.940
 and if like me you find that your 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.870
 sauce does not have enough taste you can 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:21.160
 still add pepper salt and for 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.890
 me it will be the chicken broth 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.220
 then let it simmer for 5 to 10 minutes 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.150
 minutes while stirring very often and 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.430
 to cook your chicken so that's the 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.140
 result I hope this video has you 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.150
 more and he was fast enough 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.910
 I make you big kisses I tell you 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.870

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.870
