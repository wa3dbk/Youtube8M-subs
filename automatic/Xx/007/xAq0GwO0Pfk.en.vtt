presentation is a quick start over view
to<00:00:05.790> creating<00:00:05.940> your<00:00:06.210> first<00:00:06.270> running<00:00:06.720> course<00:00:07.340> ok

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
to creating your first running course ok

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.640 
to creating your first running course ok
first<00:00:09.059> we<00:00:09.269> need<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.450> zoom<00:00:10.080> into<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.349> location

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
first we need to zoom into the location

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.020 
first we need to zoom into the location
of<00:00:10.889> where<00:00:11.099> we're<00:00:11.280> going<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.460> create<00:00:11.670> our<00:00:11.820> run

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
of where we're going to create our run

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.999 
of where we're going to create our run
so<00:00:12.660> i'm<00:00:12.750> going<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.960> zoom<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.500> i'm<00:00:13.799> going<00:00:13.950> to
