George's club I think it's important for
for<00:00:05.790> two<00:00:05.940> reasons<00:00:06.120> one<00:00:06.540> it<00:00:06.690> sort<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.410> gets<00:00:07.710> you

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
for two reasons one it sort of gets you

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.370 
for two reasons one it sort of gets you
away<00:00:08.010> from<00:00:08.460> from<00:00:08.880> Colin<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.840> know<00:00:09.900> we're

away from from Colin and I know we're

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.450 
away from from Colin and I know we're
