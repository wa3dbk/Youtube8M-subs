what<00:00:50.149> I<00:00:50.180> think<00:00:50.300> is<00:00:50.660> one<00:00:50.810> of<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.050> most<00:00:51.260> exciting

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
what I think is one of the most exciting

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.069 
what I think is one of the most exciting
things<00:00:51.980> about<00:00:52.100> this<00:00:52.489> game<00:00:52.820> is<00:00:53.090> that<00:00:53.899> it

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
things about this game is that it

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.470 
things about this game is that it
actually<00:00:54.350> has<00:00:54.770> gyroscopic<00:00:55.579> controls<00:00:55.730> which

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
actually has gyroscopic controls which

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.030 
actually has gyroscopic controls which
means<00:00:56.780> as<00:00:57.020> you<00:00:57.290> pick<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.620> tab<00:00:57.800> up<00:00:57.950> and<00:00:59.590> as<00:01:00.590> you

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
means as you pick the tab up and as you

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.920 
means as you pick the tab up and as you
move<00:01:01.430> it<00:01:01.610> from<00:01:01.760> left<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.180> right<00:01:02.270> your<00:01:02.630> view

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
move it from left to right your view

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.509 
move it from left to right your view
changes<00:01:03.320> from<00:01:03.500> left<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.770> right<00:01:03.829> where<00:01:04.370> you

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
changes from left to right where you

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.010 
changes from left to right where you
point<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.879> tab<00:01:05.150> you<00:01:06.110> will<00:01:06.140> point<00:01:06.530> you're<00:01:06.770> good

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
point the tab you will point you're good

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.230 
point the tab you will point you're good
so<00:01:09.020> that<00:01:09.170> makes<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.590> one<00:01:10.430> of<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.640> easiest

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
so that makes it one of the easiest

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.590 
so that makes it one of the easiest
first<00:01:11.659> person<00:01:12.110> shoots<00:01:12.409> to<00:01:12.680> control<00:01:13.540> on<00:01:14.540> a

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
first person shoots to control on a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.250 
first person shoots to control on a
portable<00:01:15.530> device<00:01:16.270> easier<00:01:17.270> than<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.450> PSP<00:01:17.960> even

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
portable device easier than a PSP even

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.060 
portable device easier than a PSP even
I'd<00:01:18.380> say

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.080 

it<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:27.320> makes<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.830> very<00:01:29.090> immersive

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
it just makes it a very immersive

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.820 
it just makes it a very immersive
gameplay<00:01:30.390> experience<00:01:31.200> what<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.680> the
