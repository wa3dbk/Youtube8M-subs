00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.729
 Good morning, good night, good afternoon 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.740
 good morning I'm vampire bill day 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:09.800
 I'm going to show you how light works 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.019
 in a simple and fast way good what 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.240
 First, this is going to look like a 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.170
 fish in the 1st 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.670
 brading that appears to us and we are going to give it 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.230
 select and we will appear a 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.760
 low box for now I do not have the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.150
 possibility of doing it so I'm going to 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.419
 spend 5 gold in the second option 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.760
 to use it as they will realize it's going to 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.910
 appear this fish and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.800
 Choose 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:46.850
 the fish tank appears and you tell them to be 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.220
 click on this two fish appear 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.950
 Y 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.950
 the first shot is free 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.360
 if you want if it's the fish that came out 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.260
 down did not like you can give a new 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.960
 click and it will change you once you 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.540
 the fish that is there and has you 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.170
 liked the elections and you put it 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.170
 cultivate 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.979
 once you have captured these 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.930
 I recommend you not to spend gold on 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.360
 this nothing else I did to do the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.060
 presentation of the video if you are going to spend 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.760
 gold I recommend you spend them using 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.430
 the bubbles if it's a good fish and what 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.480
 you protect yourself from being robbed 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.550
 we have two other possibilities of 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.580
 make catch fish daily 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.790
 In total there are 3 we also have the option 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.910
 support in times players 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.890
 we have the extreme side bar 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.750
 straight 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.440
 players that appear to us with a 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.580
 heart we can support in your time 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:02.980
 to make it faster in this case 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.980
 it decreased 30 minutes the time 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.220
 when a player runs out of 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.530
 waiting time for these fish and no 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.269
 have the protection bubble one can 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.540
 capture them and how we will realize 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.519
 of in the upper right bar we are going to 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.040
 have our list of players as 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:24.790
 I said earlier that we will appear 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.920
 this option to capture them we click on 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.920
 the hook and that's our 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.750
 Now when you're already level 90 and they're 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.290
 they passed the necessary mission we have the 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.579
 option d 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:47.099
 extract materials to get better 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:50.750
 equipment or as they say swords shields 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:53.840
 and armament 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.110
 and we have five opportunities for each 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.110
 one 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.660
 is a 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.840
 that's another way now we turn to 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.460
 how to change them is usually going to 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.569
 put the maximum number that is going to be 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.640
 change the ad and you already have it 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.810
 when you do not have it, the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.810
 option to change them 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:32.210
 how to realize how many materials 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:36.070
 you need to be back from chan origin 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.840
 jake and you have two teams are made 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.290
 I recommend that you have level 85 and 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:48.640
 be easier or you will notice the 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:51.340
 last one that looks like I have 13 30 days 31 35 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.700
 so for 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.000
 and complete it I still need some 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.150
 pieces 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.650
 if it is in red desk you are missing 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.470
 If they are green you already have it and already 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.880
 you can use that material for that 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:14.090
 team 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.090
 but that's all friends see you later
