00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 it was really discovering him a new 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.910
 universe and an atmosphere that was 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.109
 totally new to me even though 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.849
 we are a working regiment 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.030
 in the cold and the snow there the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.309
 conditions are increased tenfold indeed 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.190
 half a year half of Veolia 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.380
 an existence a survival exercise in 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.830
 winter environment but in general it was 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.869
 went well and we were able to learn to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.460
 manage all these factors there these factors 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.349
 important climate and then we 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.750
 we're all back so it's a good 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.420
 thing but at a young age you were very 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.890
 pleased with the performance of my men 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.579
 as well as French people who have 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.110
 much impressed 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.110
 I think it was an experience for me 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.460
 really unique we could actually see 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.100
 but my category 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.320
 compare that everything was a bit of a 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.690
 little different it's true that there 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.750
 a sergeant actually is quite fit 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.670
 to get a job as a deputy head of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.190
 platoon or maybe even sometimes 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.930
 a little bit more and that's the thing that 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.390
 me for me the most marked is the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.340
 competence of these categories 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.739
 there when we heard that they were going 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.760
 be attached to us what we our 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.500
 techniques the ways to work 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.460
 it's really different but 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 does what was called in the course of 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.159
 exercise 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.600
 that we do a lot of things the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.460
 same way we just have names 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.950
 different for the tables but they get 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.810
 are very quickly adapted to our 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.119
 organization and another way to do 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.270
 things that's really the partnership 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.430
 and everyday life in a turret 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.799
 from there with my Canadian partner who 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.140
 on a daily basis actually always gave me 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.000
 tips and tricks on on how to 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.570
 fight in a middle ground 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.400
 really arid and it was us a 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.049
 great help on the network 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.329
 radio when I heard the orders in 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.259
 Quebecois where the accent was sometimes 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.460
 difficult to understand 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.560
 honestly I was impressed by 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.030
 their skill 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.619
 to adapt because we 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.079
 Canadians are used to it and then 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.180
 thought they would give in to the 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.180
 give up but they held up the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.369
 sharing that was also to maintain 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.149
 the morale of the troops since men 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.159
 who were in the back did not have 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.720
 the fighting habit landed and that's 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.399
 a whole culture of a doctrine in fact 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.470
 that the Canadian taught us 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.360
 day to day and we managed to simulate 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.599
 to accomplish our mission of 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.599
 best of the ways
