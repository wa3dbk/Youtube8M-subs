00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
part about this is that it catches so

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.679 
part about this is that it catches so
you<00:01:19.770> know<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.070> maybe<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.939> day<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.200 
want to like separate them and whatnot I
guess<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.770> kind<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:27.090> you

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
guess it's kind of like that but you

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.399 
guess it's kind of like that but you
know<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.330> mean<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.780> kind<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:28.320> of

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
know I mean it's kind of it's kind of

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.530 
know I mean it's kind of it's kind of
convenient<00:01:28.820> just<00:01:29.820> because<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.420> know

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
convenient just because like you know

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
times Kevin oying I actually use this

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.700 
times Kevin oying I actually use this
recently<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:38.070> break<00:01:38.250> that's<00:01:38.400> pretty<00:01:38.759> nice

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
recently for break that's pretty nice

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.620 
recently for break that's pretty nice
between<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.159> signature<00:01:41.549> bag<00:01:41.759> there

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
between this and the signature bag there

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.240 
between this and the signature bag there
really<00:01:42.780> isn't<00:01:42.990> much<00:01:43.140> difference<00:01:43.740> besides<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
really isn't much difference besides the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.020 
really isn't much difference besides the
fact<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:47.310> middle<00:01:47.579> part<00:01:47.790> can

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
fact that it can the middle part can

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.690 
fact that it can the middle part can
detach<00:01:50.030> but<00:01:51.030> yeah<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:53.070> don't

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
detach but yeah and like like I don't

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.819 
detach but yeah and like like I don't
know<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.149> could<00:01:54.420> about<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.869> taking<00:01:55.110> either<00:01:55.350> I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829

could go with taking either of them like

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.999 
could go with taking either of them like
line<00:01:58.290> travel<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.250> really<00:01:59.460> depends<00:01:59.820> um

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
line travel it just really depends um

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.179 
line travel it just really depends um
sounds<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.909> like<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.329> though<00:02:03.360> um<00:02:04.189> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
sounds that I do like it though um the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.710 
sounds that I do like it though um the
second<00:02:05.490> one<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.640> got<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
second one I got with the

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.090 
second one I got with the
elf<00:02:06.870> train<00:02:07.530> case<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:09.899> think<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
elf train case and I think this is the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.220 
elf train case and I think this is the
train<00:02:11.280> case<00:02:11.430> yes<00:02:11.670> train<00:02:12.030> case<00:02:12.180> this<00:02:12.960> isn't

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
train case yes train case this isn't
