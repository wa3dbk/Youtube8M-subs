00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
bottom right which is C sharp and then

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840 
bottom right which is C sharp and then
so<00:01:10.320> we're<00:01:10.500> gonna<00:01:10.619> kind<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.950> answer<00:01:11.369> that's<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
so we're gonna kind of answer that's the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.330 
so we're gonna kind of answer that's the
base<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.150> we're<00:01:12.240> gonna<00:01:12.330> answer<00:01:13.190> call<00:01:14.190> and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
base and we're gonna answer call and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.149 
base and we're gonna answer call and
response<00:01:14.940> kind<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.390> put<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> base<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.899> it<00:01:16.020> so

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.529 

so<00:01:23.159> seven<00:01:23.700> five<00:01:23.970> seven<00:01:24.680> seven<00:01:26.420> just<00:01:27.420> be

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
so seven five seven seven just be

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:28.969 
so seven five seven seven just be
thinking<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.440> be<00:01:28.560> easiest<00:01:28.710> way<00:01:28.890> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
thinking of it the be easiest way to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.560 
thinking of it the be easiest way to
think<00:01:29.100> about<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.580> that<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:29.880> C<00:01:30.270> sharp

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
think about it is that it's just C sharp

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.200 
think about it is that it's just C sharp
minor<00:01:30.780> right<00:01:31.110> there<00:01:31.970> right<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:36.060> thinking

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
minor right there right so be thinking

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.080 
minor right there right so be thinking
that<00:01:36.509> AC<00:01:37.229> minor<00:01:37.500> or<00:01:37.950> C<00:01:38.100> sharp<00:01:38.399> minor

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that AC minor or C sharp minor

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.090 
that AC minor or C sharp minor
pentatonic<00:01:39.479> notes<00:01:39.929> right<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.259> there<00:01:40.409> makes<00:01:40.950> it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
pentatonic notes right in there makes it

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100 
pentatonic notes right in there makes it
easy<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.399> think<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.789> so<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> got<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.929> first

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
easy to think of so you got the first

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.469 
easy to think of so you got the first
part<00:01:43.640> we're<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.759> gonna<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:47.149> ninth<00:01:48.149> fret

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
part we're just gonna go so ninth fret

part we're just gonna go so ninth fret
on<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:48.750> g<00:01:49.080> string<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.950> root<00:01:50.130> note<00:01:50.340> right<00:01:50.600> F

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
on the g string to the root note right F

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:06.020 
on the g string to the root note right F
sharp<00:01:51.990> there<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.289> they<00:01:52.380> let<00:01:52.560> 11<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.250> the<00:02:05.030> just

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
sharp there and they let 11 of the just

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.400 
sharp there and they let 11 of the just
two<00:02:06.240> notes<00:02:08.030> from<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.179> sound<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.630> them<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.140> mean

from the nine to the eleven of the nine
right<00:02:12.600> that's<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> E

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.290 

anyways<00:02:21.070> so<00:02:21.700> that's<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:21.940> groove<00:02:22.120> right<00:02:22.240> there

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
anyways so that's a groove right there

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.730 
anyways so that's a groove right there
and<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.600> can<00:02:22.750> just<00:02:22.780> put<00:02:23.050> in<00:02:23.200> whatever<00:02:23.410> look

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740

and you can just put in whatever look
you<00:02:23.770> got

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.390 

the<00:02:37.140> other<00:02:37.590> thing<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.830> wanted<00:02:38.040> there<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.190> make

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
the other thing you wanted there to make

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.560 
the other thing you wanted there to make
it<00:02:38.550> groove<00:02:38.880> right<00:02:40.610> never<00:02:41.610> got<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.910> main<00:02:42.060> verse

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:31.780 

we're<00:06:09.430> doing<00:06:09.700> that

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:31.790 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.000 

yeah<00:06:32.790> I<00:06:32.820> think<00:06:33.150> that's<00:06:33.419> it<00:06:33.630> and<00:06:34.080> you<00:06:34.710> can<00:06:34.860> you

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
yeah I think that's it and you can you

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.140 
yeah I think that's it and you can you
know<00:06:35.040> it's<00:06:35.250> gonna<00:06:35.370> sound<00:06:35.460> a<00:06:35.639> lot<00:06:35.760> better<00:06:35.820> if

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
know it's gonna sound a lot better if

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.980 
know it's gonna sound a lot better if
you<00:06:36.270> can<00:06:36.389> put<00:06:36.540> some<00:06:37.430> fuzz<00:06:38.430> or<00:06:38.870> distortion<00:06:39.870> on

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
you can put some fuzz or distortion on

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.370 
you can put some fuzz or distortion on
there<00:06:40.199> and<00:06:40.470> then<00:06:41.190> I<00:06:42.020> think<00:06:43.020> one<00:06:43.199> thing<00:06:43.350> that

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
there and then I think one thing that

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.290 
there and then I think one thing that
sounds<00:06:43.680> pretty<00:06:43.830> cool<00:06:43.949> is<00:06:44.250> if<00:06:44.580> you<00:06:44.910> have<00:06:45.060> like<00:06:45.270> a

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
sounds pretty cool is if you have like a

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.180 
sounds pretty cool is if you have like a
chorus<00:06:46.050> or<00:06:47.419> some<00:06:48.419> type<00:06:48.570> of<00:06:48.600> buy<00:06:48.900> B<00:06:49.110> pedal<00:06:49.350> use

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
chorus or some type of buy B pedal use

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.310 
chorus or some type of buy B pedal use
that<00:06:50.460> for<00:06:50.699> those<00:06:50.820> lead<00:06:51.150> lines<00:06:51.449> so<00:06:51.960> just<00:06:52.139> use

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
that for those lead lines so just use

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.400 
that for those lead lines so just use
the<00:06:52.710> over<00:06:53.010> another<00:06:53.310> amp<00:06:53.910> for<00:06:54.270> the<00:06:54.449> main<00:06:55.110> group

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.410 
the over another amp for the main group

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.600 
the over another amp for the main group
but<00:06:55.560> then<00:06:55.680> when<00:06:55.800> you<00:06:55.860> throw<00:06:56.040> in<00:06:56.190> those<00:06:56.280> lines

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
but then when you throw in those lines

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.280
