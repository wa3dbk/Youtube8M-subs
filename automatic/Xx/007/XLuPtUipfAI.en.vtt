created

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
created

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.859 
created
then<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> 3d<00:01:56.820> background<00:01:57.330> color<00:01:57.600> and

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
then we have the 3d background color and

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.200 
then we have the 3d background color and
this<00:01:58.080> will<00:01:58.260> be<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.560> color<00:01:58.799> behind<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.790> 3d

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
this will be the color behind the 3d

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.630 
this will be the color behind the 3d
rendering<00:02:00.659> area<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.830> we're<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.430> use

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
rendering area so we're going to use

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.399 
rendering area so we're going to use
white<00:02:02.940> so<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.540> blends<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.050> with<00:02:04.350> the
