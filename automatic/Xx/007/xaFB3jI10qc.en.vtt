 Hello, how are you today? 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:08.870
 new tutorial on this occasion 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.990
 I bring 7 themes for your good windows as well 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.750
 be windows starter home basic ultimate 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.779
 and professional I think many do not know 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.339
 than the starter and home basic edition 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.710
 they are not customizable 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.749
 but there in the description left them a 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.699
 small program so they can 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.550
 pat your windows and thus be able to 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.949
 customize how we see these 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.960
 topics are very good I recommend them 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.460
 for its originality and quality 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.840
 appearance xd 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.840
 good let's start with the video 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.890
 good after downloading the file 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.050
 Right click on it and extract here 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.650
 we will wait until the 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.650
 archive 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.010
 I was already extracted xd 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.260
 after extracting the files them 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.420
 will come out a folder we open it 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.840
 will come seven folders each with two 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.360
 files or the theme and a file 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.300
 Text with instructions is important 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.970
 that they read it 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.550
 are seven very elegant themes and also 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.280
 customizable so we can put 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.200
 anyone who looks at us good xd 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.510
 the description will also leave you a 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.030
 program to download it and they can 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.270
 edit your topics or also ask me the 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.270
 video 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.090
 good to install the themes alone 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.780
 they copy the two files that are in the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.979
 folders 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.979
 they go to systems 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.670
 they go to the folder called windows 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.030
 and they look for a folder called resources 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.100
 and then a month call or topics 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.100
 xd 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.830
 we open it and there we paste the theme that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.390
 we have chosen 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.390
 we give in continue 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.460
 and the subject will be copying the 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.460
 folder then we can use it 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.020
 we update the folder and we can now 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.420
 close good we give you right click and 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.970
 customize we can choose the theme 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.120

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.050
 installed good I will show you the view 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.050

 what are the topics we are going with the theme 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.490
 annihilation you already know the steps to 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.800
 install it x of these steps will be 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.790
 inside the text file in case 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.860
 they knew it 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.840
 within that txt will be the 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.570
 instructions so they're not saying 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.120
 who do not know how to install the topics that 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.430
