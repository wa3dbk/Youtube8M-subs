deal<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:38.309> same<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.780> 101<00:00:39.780> high<00:00:40.050> carbon

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
deal is the same as this 101 high carbon

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.770 
deal is the same as this 101 high carbon
tool<00:00:40.649> steel<00:00:40.890> which<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> preference<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.600> many

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
tool steel which is a preference to many

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.779 
tool steel which is a preference to many
people<00:00:43.170> because<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.920> easy<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.340> shop<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
people because it's easy to shop and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.880 
people because it's easy to shop and
holds<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.149> good<00:00:45.270> edge<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.530> relatively

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
holds a good edge and is relatively

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.160 
holds a good edge and is relatively
strong<00:00:47.329> one<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.480> things<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.809> would<00:00:48.930> find

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
strong one of the things I would find

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.690 
strong one of the things I would find
very<00:00:49.260> interesting<00:00:49.649> about<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.100> life<00:00:50.370> are

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
very interesting about this life are

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.569 
very interesting about this life are
scales<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.739> was<00:00:52.860> opposed<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
scales and I was opposed to on the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.520 
scales and I was opposed to on the
larger<00:00:53.910> model<00:00:54.180> where<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.780> scales<00:00:55.079> are<00:00:55.289> made

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
larger model where the scales are made

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.040 
larger model where the scales are made
of<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.800> believe<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.129> walnuts<00:00:56.550> these<00:00:57.239> are<00:00:57.570> made

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
of I believe it's walnuts these are made

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.130 
of I believe it's walnuts these are made
from<00:00:58.289> carbon<00:00:58.649> fiber<00:00:59.090> carbon<00:01:00.090> fiber<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> very

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
from carbon fiber carbon fiber is a very

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.219 
from carbon fiber carbon fiber is a very
light<00:01:01.410> yet<00:01:01.859> strong<00:01:01.890> material<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.960> as<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.110> can

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
light yet strong material and as you can

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.840 
light yet strong material and as you can
see<00:01:04.260> here<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> gives<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.189> really<00:01:05.670> nice

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
see here it gives up a really nice

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.940 
see here it gives up a really nice
aesthetic<00:01:06.299> effect<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:07.409> very<00:01:07.560> very<00:01:07.799> very

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
aesthetic effect it's very very very

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.660 
aesthetic effect it's very very very
sort<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:09.140> tactical<00:01:10.140> feel<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.740> knife<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
sort of tactical feel on this knife you

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.300 
sort of tactical feel on this knife you
know<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.850> think<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.540> brilliant<00:01:13.010> you<00:01:14.010> must

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
know I think it's brilliant you must

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.929 
know I think it's brilliant you must
hear<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.610> larger<00:01:15.060> pin<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:16.200> film<00:01:16.380> center

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
hear this larger pin just film center

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.510 
hear this larger pin just film center
that<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.090> actually<00:01:18.509> glow<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.200> dark<00:01:19.530> so

you've got the two little crosses just

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.960 
you've got the two little crosses just
there<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> when<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.400> are<00:01:23.520> walking<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.909> this

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
there and when you are walking to this

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
there and when you are walking to this
knife<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.330> night<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.049> these<00:01:25.500> two<00:01:25.680> will<00:01:25.799> blow

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
knife at night and these two will blow

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.249 
knife at night and these two will blow
up<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.030> also<00:01:27.150> makes<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.869> drop<00:01:28.049> your

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
up and it also makes so if you drop your

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.679 
up and it also makes so if you drop your
knife<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> woods<00:01:29.390> finding<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.540> lot

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
knife in the woods finding it a lot

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.840 
knife in the woods finding it a lot
easier<00:01:30.720> scales<00:01:31.590> are<00:01:31.799> fitted<00:01:32.130> extremely

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
easier scales are fitted extremely

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.429 
easier scales are fitted extremely
precisely<00:01:33.320> there's<00:01:34.320> no<00:01:35.720> uneven<00:01:36.720> angles<00:01:37.079> here

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
precisely there's no uneven angles here

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.310 
precisely there's no uneven angles here
everything's<00:01:38.340> even<00:01:38.729> everything's<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.960> line

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
everything's even everything's in line

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.569 
everything's even everything's in line
but<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> tang<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.369> knife

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
but that with the tang of the knife

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.850 
but that with the tang of the knife
never<00:01:42.030> better<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.540> knife<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.350> same<00:01:43.590> as

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
never better this knife is the same as

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.609 
never better this knife is the same as
on<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.340> larger<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.290> Duncan's

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
on the larger one it's a one of Duncan's

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.530 
on the larger one it's a one of Duncan's
flan<00:01:46.890> d<00:01:47.040> Grimes<00:01:47.310> which<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.119> essentially<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
flan d Grimes which is essentially a

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.170 
flan d Grimes which is essentially a
hybrid<00:01:48.960> between<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.320> full<00:01:49.619> flat<00:01:49.860> grind<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.430> ask

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
hybrid between a full flat grind and ask

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.480 
hybrid between a full flat grind and ask
and<00:01:51.299> grind<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:52.829> he's<00:01:52.920> done<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:53.340> is

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
and grind so what he's done here is

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.840 
and grind so what he's done here is
basically<00:01:54.090> he's<00:01:54.390> ground<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:56.310> full<00:01:56.490> flap

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
basically he's ground the full flap
