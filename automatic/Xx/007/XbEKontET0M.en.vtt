00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
there's endless replayability there the

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.600 
there's endless replayability there the
fact<00:06:05.050> that<00:06:05.200> the<00:06:05.410> map<00:06:05.590> tiles<00:06:05.890> it's<00:06:06.160> got<00:06:06.280> so<00:06:06.490> many

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
fact that the map tiles it's got so many

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
map tiles that are beautifully done and

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.000 
map tiles that are beautifully done and
they're<00:06:09.370> all<00:06:09.520> different<00:06:10.290> it's<00:06:11.290> you<00:06:11.800> know<00:06:11.890> the

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
they're all different it's you know the

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.260 
they're all different it's you know the
maps<00:06:12.190> gonna<00:06:12.400> be<00:06:12.520> different<00:06:12.700> no<00:06:12.910> matter<00:06:13.060> what

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
maps gonna be different no matter what

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.490 
maps gonna be different no matter what
scenario<00:06:13.390> you're<00:06:13.750> playing<00:06:13.990> you<00:06:14.140> can<00:06:14.230> play<00:06:14.350> the

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
scenario you're playing you can play the

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.070 
scenario you're playing you can play the
same<00:06:14.650> scenario<00:06:15.130> many<00:06:16.030> many<00:06:16.210> many<00:06:16.450> times<00:06:16.660> and

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
same scenario many many many times and

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.800 
same scenario many many many times and
it's<00:06:17.560> still<00:06:17.860> going<00:06:18.730> to<00:06:18.940> be<00:06:19.060> different<00:06:19.510> so<00:06:19.780> I

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
it's still going to be different so I

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.840 
it's still going to be different so I
guess<00:06:20.140> my<00:06:20.410> my<00:06:20.770> final<00:06:21.130> thought<00:06:21.250> is<00:06:21.280> thank<00:06:21.700> you
