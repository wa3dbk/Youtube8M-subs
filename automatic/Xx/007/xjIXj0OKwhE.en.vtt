00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
advantage in most of the gangs you

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.230 
advantage in most of the gangs you
should<00:02:38.350> be<00:02:38.500> stronger<00:02:38.980> than<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.880> lands<00:02:40.120> at

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
should be stronger than the lands at

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.270 
should be stronger than the lands at
your<00:02:40.360> ganking<00:02:40.720> it's<00:02:41.410> just<00:02:41.860> kind<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.040> how<00:02:42.160> it
