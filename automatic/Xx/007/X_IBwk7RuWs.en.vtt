00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.000 
point but in the second season when we
did<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:05.239> bottle<00:03:05.659> episode<00:03:06.109> on<00:03:06.379> our<00:03:06.680> first

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
did the bottle episode on our first

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.800 
did the bottle episode on our first
bottle<00:03:07.190> episode<00:03:07.849> I<00:03:08.090> felt<00:03:08.269> like<00:03:08.359> that<00:03:08.510> was<00:03:08.569> a

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
bottle episode I felt like that was a

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.339 
bottle episode I felt like that was a
bond

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
bond

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.930 
bond
another<00:03:09.590> bonding<00:03:10.129> episode<00:03:10.489> because<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.819> was

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
another bonding episode because it was

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.780 
another bonding episode because it was
that<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:12.109> an<00:03:12.409> even<00:03:12.769> greater<00:03:12.799> extent<00:03:13.190> like

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
that to an even greater extent like

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.569 
that to an even greater extent like
people<00:03:14.180> saying<00:03:14.359> we<00:03:14.599> all<00:03:14.720> hang<00:03:14.989> out<00:03:15.109> on<00:03:15.260> set<00:03:15.579> but

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
focusing and rehearsals in line we had

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.170 
focusing and rehearsals in line we had
to<00:03:38.959> learn<00:03:39.169> like<00:03:39.500> longer<00:03:39.889> chunks<00:03:40.489> of<00:03:40.699> dialogue

for<00:03:41.329> that<00:03:41.480> bottle<00:03:41.840> episode<00:03:41.959> because<00:03:42.650> we<00:03:42.859> would

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
for that bottle episode because we would

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.129 
for that bottle episode because we would
instead<00:03:43.699> of<00:03:43.819> doing<00:03:44.060> like<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.209> two<00:03:44.569> page<00:03:44.780> scene

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
instead of doing like a two page scene

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.890 
instead of doing like a two page scene
and<00:03:45.470> we<00:03:45.889> basically<00:03:46.129> won<00:03:46.549> never<00:03:46.910> a<00:03:47.030> yeah<00:03:47.299> it<00:03:47.750> was

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
and we basically won never a yeah it was

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.599 
and we basically won never a yeah it was
the<00:03:48.019> whole<00:03:48.139> episode<00:03:48.590> definitely<00:03:49.040> felt<00:03:49.250> more

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
the whole episode definitely felt more

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.970

like<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.060> play<00:03:50.569> doing<00:03:51.079> that<00:03:51.290> because<00:03:51.560> we<00:03:51.859> were

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
like a play doing that because we were

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.159 
like a play doing that because we were
doing<00:03:52.400> much<00:03:52.669> bigger<00:03:53.060> chunks<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.659> the<00:03:53.750> episode
