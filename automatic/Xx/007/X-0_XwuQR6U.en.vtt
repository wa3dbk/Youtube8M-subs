41 pounds so technically she doesn't
even<00:03:56.390> need<00:03:56.900> this<00:03:57.500> back<00:03:57.890> which<00:03:58.790> would<00:03:59.000> mean

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
even need this back which would mean

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.449 
even need this back which would mean
this<00:03:59.750> would<00:03:59.989> be<00:04:00.110> cutting<00:04:00.410> up<00:04:00.739> into<00:04:01.069> her<00:04:01.220> neck

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
this would be cutting up into her neck

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.949 
this would be cutting up into her neck
so<00:04:02.209> this<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:02.930> according<00:04:03.769> to<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:05.390> guidelines

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.080 
so this is according to the guidelines
of<00:04:06.080> car<00:04:06.290> seats<00:04:06.530> this<00:04:06.860> is<00:04:07.069> what<00:04:07.220> she<00:04:07.459> can<00:04:07.730> be<00:04:07.940> in

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
of car seats this is what she can be in

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
would lock in a moving car but she still

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.969 
would lock in a moving car but she still
has<00:04:17.419> a<00:04:17.450> lot<00:04:17.720> more<00:04:17.750> motion<00:04:18.290> lead<00:04:18.530> back<00:04:18.680> for<00:04:18.889> me

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.159 

yeah<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:29.000> even<00:04:29.690> if<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:31.190> hold<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:31.870> move<00:04:32.870> your<00:04:33.020> car

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
seat side to side so even with the seat

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.379 
seat side to side so even with the seat
belt<00:04:38.720> locked<00:04:39.200> there's<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.590> much<00:04:39.979> larger<00:04:40.910> range

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
belt locked there's a much larger range

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.480 
belt locked there's a much larger range
of<00:04:41.570> motion<00:04:42.139> there's<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:42.740> lot<00:04:42.889> less<00:04:43.070> security

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
of motion there's a lot less security

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.000 
of motion there's a lot less security
this<00:04:44.000> seat<00:04:44.270> is<00:04:44.450> not<00:04:44.690> hooked<00:04:44.930> down<00:04:45.169> in<00:04:45.470> any<00:04:45.740> way

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
shape or form so this is the final

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.840 
shape or form so this is the final
option<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:48.770> you<00:04:48.889> have<00:04:49.100> when<00:04:49.400> you're<00:04:49.430> looking
