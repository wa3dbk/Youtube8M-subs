00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 what happened 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.660
 Y 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.310
 do not 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.330
 as a result of my last job which 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.160
 I leave here for you to take a look 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.630
 Many people have asked me how it is 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.260
 precisely this cutting effect 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.140
 good although a little complex and 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.019
 requires a series of skills in 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.480
 as to drawing and good a series of 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.129
 things I think the truth that a theme 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.300
 quite interesting to bring it to 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.890
 channel especially because so far 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.470
 we have only seen techniques 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.870
 and a series of things but we have never 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.820
 seen how to perform some effect with 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.019
 photoshop and I think it 's pretty 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.019
 interesting not only because of the effect 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.570
 but for everything there is to understand 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.100
 to do this and I think it's a 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.780
 pretty good opportunity to explain 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.520
 many of the things that photoshop has 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.560
 that can be useful to make another 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.890
 kind of things or if you want it for 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.930
 perform this same effect then I 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.430
 I want you to see right now this would be 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.920
 the final result of the photograph that 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.380
 I have used and as you can see then good 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.140
 here is if I had stuck a couple 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.810
 of the chest 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.950
 I do not know this this effect consists of several 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.600
 steps and good one is especially 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.930
 analyze what is the lighting that 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.999
 there is in the scene if we do not do 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.009
 consistent lighting effect with 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:42.310
 the scene is going to look that's 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.950
 a painted or something like that is not going to 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.090
 seem really a cut and good as 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.140
 I have already said a series of 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.580
 notions for drawing relationships 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.260
 to be able to do this but if any 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.150
 of you do not know how to draw good 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.370
 you do not have to worry either because the 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.220
 technique that I developed allows 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.750
 do it semiautomatically and good 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.130
 It makes things a lot easier for 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.020
 those that do not have viability 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.729
 drawing so nothing we're going to let's 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.280
 it and well first of all I'm going to 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.649
 explain something that you have to have in 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.890
 account before performing this effect of 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.959
 cultural well imagine that what I 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.560
 I'm going to draw is this part of the arm 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.360
 OK 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.700
 would be the skin of the forearm imagine that 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.250
 we're going to cut it there and good because 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.600
 we have the anything goes in the part of 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:32.239
 above the elbow the forearm drawing and 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.239
 here would be the doll with the hand is worth 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.880
 if I and if a cut in this regard 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.760
 the first thing that would obviously occur 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.670
 would be that the skin opens up not 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.430
 happens with eyes like this then this 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.469
 here we would lose it 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.840
 but at the same time the skin does not open 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:55.510
 cleanly but leaves as a 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.640
 kind of small pieces of skin that are left 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.170
 opened and also processed any 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.620
 injury to the body what happens to 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.769
 he loses it around and in the area in 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.060
 general is that it is inflamed therefore this 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.040
 part of here you would not only be here 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.859
 but it would be a little more bloated than 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.859
 the account and it would produce a thing like that 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.190
 with this I would be a little inflamed but 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.390
 what is it like 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.500
 from above 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:33.100
 it would be the arm the wrist and the hand in 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.959
 such and it would look one thing but that 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.030
 cut the penalty and everything then 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.470
 within the skin is brave meat 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.230
 which is going to have a texture that 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.180
 we are going to have to apply here 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.120
 we will apply good considering 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.790
 that the light bile is on this side then 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.010
 there would be shadow on this side not all this 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.180
 part would be in shadow this part what 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.410
 that would be the filter this of the of the 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.120
 skin that will be illuminated throughout this area 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.930
 would have more and more more shadow not from 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.290
 that part up here because final what 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.959
 opposite and in this place instead 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.470
 it would be illuminated is worth then 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.840
 we would have there then a strange thing 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.530
 ok with a good series of volumes 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.130
 I am right now it seems 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.540
 so 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.540
 I will not erase if there is a child 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.289
 so basically we have that in 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.729
 the cutting area is going to produce a 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.379
 shadow within the cut occurs a 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.939
 shadow a shadow area and another one 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:41.430
 shine but at the same time it's going to 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:42.840
 produce the opposite effect outside of itself 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.699
 is where here shine on the side 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.310
 opposite to the shadow and where there is shadow 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.449
 on the outside part more brightness then 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.849
 this is something that we have to 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.020
 keep in mind when painting it 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.870
 because not only are we going to have to 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.670
 make the cut but then knowing 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.710
 this 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:03.350
 it does not work anymore 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.350
 We do not go to the photograph itself
