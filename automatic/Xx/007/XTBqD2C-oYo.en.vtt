00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
any of the other LMGs they somewhat felt

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.940 
any of the other LMGs they somewhat felt
more<00:01:27.090> powerful<00:01:27.660> but<00:01:27.810> also<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.080> bit<00:01:28.289> slower<00:01:28.649> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
more powerful but also a bit slower and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
more powerful but also a bit slower and
heavy<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.759> don't<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.149> that<00:01:30.330> with<00:01:30.479> this

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
heavy and you don't have that with this

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.880 
heavy and you don't have that with this
web<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.929> it's<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.319> said<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.619> my<00:01:31.649> previous

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
web and it's like I said in my previous

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.070 
web and it's like I said in my previous
video<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.429> feels<00:01:32.789> like<00:01:33.000> you're<00:01:33.209> playing<00:01:33.509> with

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
video it feels like you're playing with

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.559 
video it feels like you're playing with
the<00:01:34.229> frickin<00:01:34.560> m416<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> support<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:36.539> I

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
the frickin m416 as a support now I

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:38.480 
the frickin m416 as a support now I
don't<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:37.110> any<00:01:37.350> stats<00:01:37.649> for<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:37.920> guys<00:01:38.100> those

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
don't have any stats for you guys those

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.070 
don't have any stats for you guys those
unfortunately<00:01:39.060> aren't<00:01:39.300> available<00:01:39.539> just<00:01:39.990> yet

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
unfortunately aren't available just yet

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.809 
unfortunately aren't available just yet
so<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.530> by<00:01:40.740> no<00:01:40.800> means<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.340> weapon<00:01:41.670> review

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
so this is by no means a weapon review

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:44.600 
so this is by no means a weapon review
but<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:43.080> can<00:01:43.289> definitely<00:01:43.500> expect<00:01:44.009> one<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> very

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
but you can definitely expect one a very

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.219 
but you can definitely expect one a very
very<00:01:44.910> soon<00:01:45.119> once<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> stats<00:01:45.720> released<00:01:46.080> for

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
very soon once the stats released for

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.809 
very soon once the stats released for
this<00:01:46.319> gun<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.709> once<00:01:47.069> I<00:01:47.250> haven't<00:01:47.459> locked<00:01:47.610> all

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
I have a feeling it might just get

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.910 
I have a feeling it might just get
nerfed<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.080> don't<00:02:16.290> really<00:02:16.500> think<00:02:16.709> it's

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
nerfed I don't really think it's

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.309 
nerfed I don't really think it's
overpowered<00:02:17.550> but<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.120> would<00:02:18.360> say<00:02:18.599> it's<00:02:18.959> more<00:02:19.140> of

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
overpowered but I would say it's more of

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.350 
overpowered but I would say it's more of
a<00:02:19.500> best<00:02:19.800> all-around<00:02:20.160> weapon<00:02:20.459> in<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:20.970> lmg

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
a best all-around weapon in the lmg

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.600 
a best all-around weapon in the lmg
Department<00:02:21.989> sort<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.470> ace23<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.400> in

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610

Department sort of like the ace23 is in
the<00:02:24.000> assault<00:02:24.270> class<00:02:24.510> now<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.750> only

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
the assault class now the only

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.530 
the assault class now the only
difference<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.620> it's<00:02:26.220> really<00:02:26.880> really

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
difference is it's really really

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.290

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
are you to play now I'm not really all

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.900 
are you to play now I'm not really all
that<00:02:44.750> excited<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.320> be<00:02:45.470> honest<00:02:45.800> I'm<00:02:46.220> afraid<00:02:46.790> the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
that excited to be honest I'm afraid the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.220 
that excited to be honest I'm afraid the
maps<00:02:47.060> are<00:02:47.210> all<00:02:47.330> going<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.570> be<00:02:47.660> variants<00:02:48.050> of

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
maps are all going to be variants of

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.230 
maps are all going to be variants of
personal<00:02:48.710> store<00:02:48.950> which<00:02:49.100> is<00:02:49.250> fine<00:02:49.490> I<00:02:49.790> like<00:02:50.090> the

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
personal store which is fine I like the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.210 
personal store which is fine I like the
methanol<00:02:50.600> that<00:02:50.810> they're<00:02:51.410> not<00:02:51.650> really<00:02:51.860> into

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
methanol that they're not really into

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.010 
methanol that they're not really into
boats<00:02:52.460> and<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.850> whole<00:02:53.000> naval<00:02:53.330> combat<00:02:53.600> scene

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
boats and the whole naval combat scene

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.200 
boats and the whole naval combat scene
in<00:02:54.170> general<00:02:54.530> maybe<00:02:54.710> it's<00:02:54.920> just<00:02:55.010> my<00:02:55.340> fear<00:02:55.730> for

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
in general maybe it's just my fear for

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.150 
in general maybe it's just my fear for
big<00:02:56.420> fish<00:02:56.690> taken<00:02:56.930> in<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.290> don't<00:02:57.470> know<00:02:57.620> I'm<00:02:58.100> just

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
big fish taken in I don't know I'm just

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.770 
big fish taken in I don't know I'm just
afraid<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.730> matches<00:02:59.210> will<00:02:59.330> depend<00:02:59.600> too<00:02:59.750> much

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
afraid that matches will depend too much

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.870 
afraid that matches will depend too much
on<00:03:00.110> who<00:03:00.320> has<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.500> most<00:03:00.830> attack<00:03:01.310> boats<00:03:01.520> up<00:03:01.730> and

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
on who has the most attack boats up and

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.910 
on who has the most attack boats up and
I'm<00:03:01.940> not<00:03:02.060> really<00:03:02.210> a<00:03:02.510> big<00:03:02.870> fan<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.620> attack

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
I'm not really a big fan of the attack

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.530 
I'm not really a big fan of the attack
boats<00:03:04.160> I<00:03:04.310> mean<00:03:04.430> they're<00:03:04.580> fine<00:03:04.850> when<00:03:05.240> you're<00:03:05.390> in

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
boats I mean they're fine when you're in

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.210 
boats I mean they're fine when you're in
them<00:03:05.720> they're<00:03:05.870> great<00:03:06.050> but<00:03:06.860> if<00:03:06.950> you're<00:03:07.100> on

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220
