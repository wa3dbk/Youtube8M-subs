the plant can be grown is renewable but

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.139 
the plant can be grown is renewable but
petroleum<00:01:44.009> there's<00:01:44.399> only<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:44.700> much<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:45.000> there

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
petroleum there's only as much as there

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.600 
petroleum there's only as much as there
is<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.689> really<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.470> an<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.920> products

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
is and really it's just an in products

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.030
