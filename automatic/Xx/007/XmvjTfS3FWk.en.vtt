00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello, I want to tell you about 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.410
 main types of modern operational 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.990
 memory ddr1 ddr2 ddr3 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.570
 It looks like ddr1 works on voltage 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.320
 two and a half volts consumed 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.010
 power 527 milliwatts has 184 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.550
 contact 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.470
 92 with me and 92 on the other hand memory 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.980
 of this type depending on the model 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.310
 can operate at a frequency of 200 to 400 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.510
 megahertz and can be called for example 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.739
 ddr400 maximum throughput 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.500
 ability ranges from 1600 to 3200 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.070
 megabytes per second so it can still 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.860
 be called for example pc3200 given memory 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.430
 has eight types each 32 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.450
 megabytes total volume 256 megabytes volume 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.329
 maybe more 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.120
 Depending on the models ddr1 now 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.850
 ddr2 does not look like this 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.370
 powered by 18 volts 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.090
 power consumption 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.640
 247 world watts has 240 pins 120 1 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.680
 and 120 on the other hand the memory of such 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.500
 type depending on the model may 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.490
 operate at a frequency of 400 to 1200 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.170
 megahertz 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.090
 and may be called for example ddr2 667 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.299
 maximum throughput 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.610
 varies from 3200 to 9600 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.369
 megabytes per second so it can still 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.530
 be called for example pisi 25 thousand three hundred 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.680
 This memory has eight types. 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.549
 they are smaller than ddr1 each 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.049
 64 megabytes total amount of 512 megabytes 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.170
 volume may be more 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.950
 Depending on the model ddr2 already removed from 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.350
 production 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.409
 It looks like ddr3 works on voltage 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.070
 one and a half volts power consumption 170 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.560
 milliwatt has 240 contacts 120 s 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.119
 one side and the other 120 memory 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.439
 of this type depending on the model 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.130
 can operate at a frequency of 800 to 2133 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.969
 megahertz 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.790
 and may be called for example ddr3 1333 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.099
 maximum throughput 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:12.120
 varies from 6 thousand 400 megabytes to 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.960
 second to 17000 66 interrupts second 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.050
 so 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.210
 still be called for example pisi 3 10600 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.150
 This memory has eight types. 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.510
 they are smaller than ddr2 each 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.950
 256 megabytes total 2 gigabytes 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.710
 volume may be more depending 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.990
 from the model currently being produced 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.480
 and most sold every bar 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.460
 has a key hole in different types 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.190
 in a different place so you can't 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.440
 confuse to put the wrong type of memory 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.570
 motherboard slot exists and 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.390
 newer memory model 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.810
 This is ddr4 but it is still 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.850
 rarely where is sold and will go mass in 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:56.360
 producing massive sales only 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.360
 somewhere in 2015 this is all for now
