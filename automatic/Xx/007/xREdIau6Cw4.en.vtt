00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.979
 Sao Paulo 

00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.580
 and the middle of stamps with bagasse 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.100
 and was born in 2002 well gaining consistency with each new 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.789
 version 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:13.349
 but this time progress has slowed down, which shows that 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.300
 maybe the franchise has reached its limit yet it says goodbye to the current 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.489
 honest generation 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.319
 as the name suggests ogami walks side by side with the version for psp 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.029
 Barreto remembers the two 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.149
 the events of both are intertwined 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.030
 in addition the new only compare these are two finally behind the expected 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.650
 online cooperative campaign mode 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.610
 but in the other areas mainly in the competitive mode there was almost no 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.400
 no changes 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.980
 with traditional traditional shop / marketing first passed the membership creditor 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.280
 personnel can be enriched 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.960
 as usual the game is more strategic than the shooting wines 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.620
 focused on action 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.089
 here the frantic shooting only brings disadvantages 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.839
 so planning and caution are the most important aspects 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.920
 the operation takes place in August of this year a fictitious country between the 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.570
 pakistan and afghanistan 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.800
 where a group of paramilitaries track the enslavement of the population and 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.550
 resources through illicit activities such as arms 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.540
 drugs 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.530
 it is here that softbank enters the special operations group of the Navy 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.030
 American 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.480
 well nobody there 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.480
 in her 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.120
 controls can be tricky for police officers simply 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.300
 all buttons have some utility 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.160
 at least there is a tutorial explaining each of the functions in a way 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.230
 didactic 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.770
 in the war proper the order to make the arrests and clear the thesis was 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.899
 almost the first phase is always the same 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.310
 but it looks like a set of operations to choose from 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.750
 finished all other series becomes available 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.940
 Altogether there are 18 million with a good variety of henrique lima 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.489
 country be small 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.669
 to try to extend the life of the campaign, enabled farms can 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:18.099
 be played again for different purposes 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.420
 the objectives are quite varied involve rescue elimination of opponents 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.020
 obtaining information for the intelligence sector 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.990
 situation recognitions and so on. 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.400
 an interesting feature is the cross plays which makes the versions with bagasse and was 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.380
 balanced 2 integrate through the cable sp 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:42.129
 to be submitted in the phases that influence the counterparty as in 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.540
 united nations law 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.870
 playstation 2 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.099
 and goals in this search here 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.779
 they are the first of each of the platforms 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:51.719
 if it happens in the same region 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:56.160
 if the attending team eliminates all enemies of a certain area 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.759
 the brave fighting troop 2 will find none of the opponents in the mission 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:03.409
 the age swap can also unlock new characters 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.289
 equipment videos music and other states 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.979
 in the game the player is evaluated for being positive because I will try to provoke 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:13.900
 less deaths than necessary 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.180
 moreover, frank confrontation is often the fastest way to the screen 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.509
 of 15 there was that speed of opponents in that situation 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:23.569
 realist 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.419
 few 'shots' stick to carry a mate to the ground 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:31.849
 the player controls an exchange of four members and the good news that the 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.849
 give orders to subordinates is better said 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.689
 with a simplified mode and those of the sou botafogo 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:42.089
 would it be that the artificial intelligence of the comrades did not accompany the 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:44.099
 market elegance 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.449
 the enemies are not very smart there and in the distance even if a 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.179
 companion has been slaughtered they do not seek shelter 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:57.479
 looking sideways and middle from side to side but nothing to protect like this 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.959
 and that the folder 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.649
 in the mutirÃ£o will involve activated the alert one of the soldiers of the group can be 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:04.529
 controlled by a player 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:08.360
 the competitive mode is good too but it does not bring news 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.740
 at least it is compatible with the previous edition 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.589
 I am against them then we 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.219
 Several days but they can play together. 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:17.519
 the visual continues with the younger 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.870
 there is much that last year because it shows signs of age 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.950
 still beautiful 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.630
 with many objects on the screen he knows how to make thought-provoking 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.689
 such as various accidents and maps 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.409
 the excellent soundtrack-a typical song for war movies 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.380
 said he was skeptical about all 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.860
 back to the crisis 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.729
 the sound surgery does not stay calm 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.009
 but it is of high quality blending noise from bells and extortions a person 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:44.550
 common 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.349
 it is not only if the fighting is very volatile in relation to the 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:49.070
 predecessor 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.240
 but maintain the quality that made the series fame 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.600
 brings an excellent novelty multiple in cooperative my campaign even for 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.080
 one player 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.199
 good fun 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.520
 only with low with or in double beans 2
