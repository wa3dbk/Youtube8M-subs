00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
and we're hoping maybe for a goalkeeper

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.460 
and we're hoping maybe for a goalkeeper
to<00:03:33.949> improve<00:03:34.639> our<00:03:35.000> defense<00:03:35.959> even<00:03:36.199> if<00:03:36.409> the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
to improve our defense even if the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.349 
to improve our defense even if the
difference<00:03:36.799> is<00:03:36.980> going<00:03:37.370> pretty<00:03:37.609> well<00:03:38.000> at<00:03:38.180> this

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
difference is going pretty well at this

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:43.210

moment<00:03:40.060> we<00:03:41.060> get<00:03:41.449> a<00:03:41.480> goalkeeper<00:03:41.870> but<00:03:42.530> it's<00:03:42.859> not

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
moment we get a goalkeeper but it's not

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.640 
moment we get a goalkeeper but it's not
what<00:03:43.609> we<00:03:43.879> need<00:03:44.150> it's<00:03:44.449> from<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.169> Turkish
