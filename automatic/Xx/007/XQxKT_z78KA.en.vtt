walked me into the operating room and

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.639 
walked me into the operating room and
introduced<00:01:14.630> me<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.780> everybody<00:01:15.049> there<00:01:15.500> and

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
introduced me to everybody there and

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.800 
introduced me to everybody there and
even<00:01:16.640> explained<00:01:17.000> you<00:01:17.180> know<00:01:17.299> what<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:17.630> mask

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
even explained you know what the mask

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.920 
even explained you know what the mask
was<00:01:17.990> for<00:01:18.320> and<00:01:18.710> put<00:01:18.920> me<00:01:19.009> completely<00:01:19.340> at<00:01:19.490> ease

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
was for and put me completely at ease

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.029 
was for and put me completely at ease
and<00:01:20.930> I<00:01:21.560> think<00:01:22.219> that<00:01:22.340> experience<00:01:22.880> was<00:01:23.149> very

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
and I think that experience was very

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.340 
and I think that experience was very
very<00:01:25.039> important<00:01:25.549> in<00:01:25.640> my<00:01:25.729> life<00:01:25.759> and<00:01:26.359> and<00:01:27.229> to

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
very important in my life and and to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.469 
very important in my life and and to
this<00:01:27.439> day<00:01:27.680> I<00:01:27.710> still<00:01:28.130> refer<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.880> him<00:01:29.060> as<00:01:29.210> as

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
this day I still refer to him as as

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.209 
this day I still refer to him as as
really<00:01:30.079> the<00:01:30.109> they're<00:01:30.439> probably<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:31.009> main

really the they're probably the main

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.700 
really the they're probably the main
reason<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:31.789> chose<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.090> go<00:01:32.450> into<00:01:32.530> as<00:01:33.530> the

reason that I chose to go into as the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.270 
reason that I chose to go into as the
field<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:34.039> medicine<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:35.570> as<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.469> great<00:01:36.710> role

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
certainly over the years other

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.130 
certainly over the years other
experiences<00:01:46.549> with<00:01:46.820> patients<00:01:47.479> have<00:01:47.659> shaped<00:01:47.960> my

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
experiences with patients have shaped my

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.219 
experiences with patients have shaped my

practice and my approach my style with
folks<00:01:52.240> more<00:01:53.240> recently<00:01:53.630> I<00:01:54.670> had<00:01:55.670> some<00:01:56.149> fairly

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
folks more recently I had some fairly

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.989 
folks more recently I had some fairly
serious<00:01:56.810> medical<00:01:57.560> issues<00:01:58.189> come<00:01:58.429> up<00:01:58.520> about<00:01:58.789> two

00:01:58.989 --> 00:01:58.999 
serious medical issues come up about two

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:02.440 
serious medical issues come up about two
years<00:01:59.179> ago<00:01:59.649> and<00:02:00.649> need<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.670> undergo<00:02:02.030> some<00:02:02.270> very

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
years ago and need to undergo some very

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.620 
years ago and need to undergo some very
sophisticated<00:02:03.219> diagnostic<00:02:04.299> testing<00:02:05.299> and

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
sophisticated diagnostic testing and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.190 
sophisticated diagnostic testing and
ultimately<00:02:06.409> some

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
ultimately some

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.309
