00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
extended those wires had some plastic

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.750 
extended those wires had some plastic
pieces<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:05.230> venetian<00:03:06.230> blind<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:07.040> used<00:03:07.459> that

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
pieces of venetian blind and used that

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.550 
pieces of venetian blind and used that
to<00:03:08.030> raise<00:03:09.040> this<00:03:10.040> part<00:03:10.400> of<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.819> frame

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
to raise this part of the frame

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.670 
to raise this part of the frame
since<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:13.160> deck<00:03:13.720> brought<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.900> entire<00:03:15.260> frame

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
since the deck brought the entire frame

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.860 
since the deck brought the entire frame
up<00:03:16.810> added<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.870> couple<00:03:18.110> of<00:03:19.180> small<00:03:20.180> black<00:03:20.480> silver

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
up added a couple of small black silver

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.140 
up added a couple of small black silver
straws<00:03:21.550> so<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:22.580> could<00:03:22.880> sticking<00:03:23.600> my<00:03:24.080> Flags

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
straws so I could sticking my Flags

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.930 
straws so I could sticking my Flags
south<00:03:26.150> carolina<00:03:26.630> flag<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.700> little<00:03:28.700> diver

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
south carolina flag and a little diver

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.170 
south carolina flag and a little diver
flag<00:03:29.330> just<00:03:29.690> for<00:03:29.870> effect<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:30.850> this<00:03:31.850> over<00:03:32.150> here

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
antenna on the 2.4 gig i just felt

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.559 
antenna on the 2.4 gig i just felt
better<00:03:38.299> about<00:03:38.450> getting<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:40.239> antenna<00:03:41.239> to<00:03:41.330> the

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
better about getting the antenna to the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.259 
better about getting the antenna to the
outside<00:03:42.019> and<00:03:42.560> if<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:43.459> look<00:03:43.610> real<00:03:43.819> close<00:03:44.239> you

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
outside and if you look real close you

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.809 
outside and if you look real close you
can<00:03:44.569> actually<00:03:44.930> see<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.380> glow<00:03:45.799> coming<00:03:46.190> from<00:03:46.519> the

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
can actually see a glow coming from the

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.220 
can actually see a glow coming from the
receiver<00:03:47.680> that's<00:03:48.680> laying<00:03:48.920> down<00:03:49.220> in<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.489> box<00:03:49.730> I

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
receiver that's laying down in the box I

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.330 
receiver that's laying down in the box I
did<00:03:51.230> notice<00:03:51.560> that<00:03:51.590> there<00:03:51.799> were<00:03:51.890> a<00:03:51.920> couple<00:03:52.010> of

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
did notice that there were a couple of

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.850 
did notice that there were a couple of
places<00:03:52.610> that<00:03:53.239> needed<00:03:53.660> some<00:03:53.870> additional<00:03:54.260> hot

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
places that needed some additional hot

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.840 
places that needed some additional hot
glue<00:03:55.220> just<00:03:55.549> for<00:03:55.730> waterproofing<00:03:56.510> it's<00:03:57.109> just<00:03:57.850> it

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
glue just for waterproofing it's just it

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.280 
glue just for waterproofing it's just it
looked<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.150> me<00:03:59.209> like<00:03:59.299> water<00:03:59.660> could<00:03:59.959> get<00:04:00.109> in

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
looked to me like water could get in

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.170 
looked to me like water could get in
there<00:04:00.410> so<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:00.680> went<00:04:00.920> ahead<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.160> ran<00:04:01.430> a<00:04:01.459> beetle

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
there so I went ahead and ran a beetle

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.349 
there so I went ahead and ran a beetle
water<00:04:02.420> there<00:04:02.690> my<00:04:03.650> action<00:04:04.040> figures<00:04:04.459> or<00:04:04.730> velcro

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
water there my action figures or velcro

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.670 
water there my action figures or velcro
tin<00:04:05.660> so<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:05.930> can<00:04:06.109> take<00:04:06.290> them<00:04:06.470> out<00:04:06.590> at<00:04:06.769> any<00:04:06.950> time

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.509 

that's<00:04:11.099> about<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:12.019> had<00:04:13.019> raised<00:04:13.379> the<00:04:13.680> basic

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
that's about it had raised the basic

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.300 
that's about it had raised the basic
cage<00:04:14.790> up<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.329> side<00:04:15.569> of<00:04:15.719> the<00:04:15.780> rail<00:04:16.310> which

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
cage up to the side of the rail which

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.749 
cage up to the side of the rail which
also<00:04:17.759> meant<00:04:18.389> that<00:04:18.509> I<00:04:18.660> had<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:19.609> add<00:04:20.609> some

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 
also meant that I had to add some

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.390 
also meant that I had to add some
sections<00:04:23.759> of<00:04:24.080> plastic<00:04:25.080> back<00:04:25.259> here<00:04:25.620> so<00:04:26.100> I<00:04:26.130> could

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
sections of plastic back here so I could

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.600 
sections of plastic back here so I could
get<00:04:26.580> this<00:04:26.759> brace<00:04:27.120> here<00:04:27.449> that<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:29.370> rudder

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
get this brace here that the rudder

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.480 
get this brace here that the rudder
mounts<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.150> get<00:04:30.449> it<00:04:30.600> up<00:04:30.720> in<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.960> air<00:04:31.490> but

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
mounts to get it up in the air but

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.260 
mounts to get it up in the air but
basically<00:04:32.970> for<00:04:33.389> mounting<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.960> motor

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
basically for mounting the motor

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.570 
basically for mounting the motor
everything<00:04:36.270> was<00:04:36.449> taken<00:04:36.660> out<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.430> there<00:04:38.430> was

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
everything was taken out and there was

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.580 
everything was taken out and there was
no<00:04:39.539> problem<00:04:39.840> with<00:04:40.289> using<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:41.160> four<00:04:42.590> screws

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
no problem with using the four screws

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.620 
no problem with using the four screws
that<00:04:43.919> come<00:04:44.130> with<00:04:44.190> these<00:04:44.520> typically<00:04:45.270> come<00:04:45.479> with

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
that come with these typically come with

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.180 
that come with these typically come with
these<00:04:45.720> motors<00:04:46.139> where<00:04:46.320> you<00:04:46.440> normally<00:04:46.590> have<00:04:46.949> the

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
these motors where you normally have the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.370 
these motors where you normally have the
X<00:04:47.520> brace<00:04:47.880> that<00:04:47.910> goes<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.570> your<00:04:48.690> motor<00:04:48.930> mount<00:04:49.050> on

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
X brace that goes to your motor mount on

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.830 
X brace that goes to your motor mount on
your<00:04:49.410> firewall<00:04:50.009> I<00:04:50.280> just<00:04:51.030> used<00:04:51.270> those<00:04:51.509> same

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
your firewall I just used those same

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.570 
your firewall I just used those same
four<00:04:52.110> screws<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.650> go<00:04:52.800> through<00:04:53.039> the<00:04:53.130> back<00:04:53.340> of

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
four screws to go through the back of

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.300 
four screws to go through the back of
the<00:04:53.699> existing<00:04:54.240> motor<00:04:54.389> mount<00:04:54.750> I<00:04:55.039> hope<00:04:56.039> you<00:04:56.160> can

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
the existing motor mount I hope you can

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.339 
the existing motor mount I hope you can
see<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:58.220> there<00:04:59.220> was<00:04:59.340> a<00:04:59.840> u-shaped<00:05:00.840> black

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
see that and there was a u-shaped black

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.469 
see that and there was a u-shaped black
piece<00:05:01.680> of<00:05:01.860> plastic<00:05:02.340> that<00:05:02.370> was<00:05:02.699> back<00:05:03.180> here

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
piece of plastic that was back here

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.350 
piece of plastic that was back here
holding<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:03.960> longer<00:05:04.410> brushed<00:05:04.740> motor<00:05:05.099> I<00:05:05.400> just

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
holding the longer brushed motor I just

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.800 
holding the longer brushed motor I just
simply<00:05:06.690> left<00:05:06.960> that<00:05:07.139> off<00:05:07.430> but<00:05:08.570> basically<00:05:09.570> used

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
simply left that off but basically used

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.649 
simply left that off but basically used
everything<00:05:10.139> that<00:05:10.380> I<00:05:10.740> had<00:05:10.979> before<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:12.510> of

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
everything that I had before and of

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.670 
everything that I had before and of
course<00:05:12.870> with<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.110> little<00:05:13.409> bit<00:05:13.530> longer<00:05:13.940> screws

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
course with a little bit longer screws

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.560 
course with a little bit longer screws
because<00:05:16.680> of<00:05:17.010> the<00:05:17.280> depth<00:05:17.820> that<00:05:18.030> it<00:05:18.180> had<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.419> go

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
because of the depth that it had to go

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.779 
because of the depth that it had to go
into<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:19.199> boat<00:05:20.159> deck<00:05:20.720> and<00:05:21.720> that's<00:05:21.840> it

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
into the boat deck and that's it

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.439 
into the boat deck and that's it
mini<00:05:24.389> alligator<00:05:24.839> tour<00:05:25.139> boat<00:05:25.439> with<00:05:26.099> a

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
mini alligator tour boat with a

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.379 
mini alligator tour boat with a
