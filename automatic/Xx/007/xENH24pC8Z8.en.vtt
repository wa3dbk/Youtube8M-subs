more they came like those five the horse
more<00:01:45.660> than<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.900> play<00:01:46.080> a<00:01:46.110> no-limit<00:01:46.470> hold'em<00:01:46.860> but

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
more than I play a no-limit hold'em but

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.530 
more than I play a no-limit hold'em but
I<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:47.670> lot<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.820> experience<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.330> all<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
I have a lot of experience in all the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.810 
I have a lot of experience in all the
games<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.800> like<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.310> fact<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.729> actually

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
games and I like the fact I actually

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.969 
games and I like the fact I actually
like<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.270> no-limit<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.869> then<00:01:52.110> because<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
like the no-limit and then because the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.230 
like the no-limit and then because the
limit<00:01:53.250> was<00:01:53.369> playing<00:01:53.580> a<00:01:53.670> lot<00:01:53.820> bigger<00:01:54.030> than<00:01:54.150> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
limit was playing a lot bigger than the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.969 
limit was playing a lot bigger than the
no<00:01:54.420> limit<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.050> you<00:01:55.080> actually<00:01:55.350> had<00:01:55.590> more<00:01:55.740> play

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
no limit so you actually had more play

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.230 
no limit so you actually had more play
with<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.220> No<00:01:56.340> Limit<00:01:56.640> than<00:01:56.790> all<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.030> little

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
with the No Limit than all the little

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.870 
with the No Limit than all the little
big<00:01:57.330> bet<00:01:57.510> games<00:01:57.720> so<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.800> picked<00:01:59.369> up<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.520> strategy

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
big bet games so I picked up a strategy

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.070 
big bet games so I picked up a strategy
I<00:01:59.910> knew<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.090> was<00:02:00.180> very<00:02:00.390> crucial<00:02:00.780> at<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> end

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
I knew it was very crucial at the end

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.359 
I knew it was very crucial at the end
