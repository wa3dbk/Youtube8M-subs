in<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.850> little<00:02:31.910> bit<00:02:34.510> okay<00:02:35.540> let<00:02:36.260> me<00:02:36.440> first<00:02:36.709> die

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
in a little bit okay let me first die

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:49.960 
in a little bit okay let me first die
simply<00:02:38.450> scratch<00:02:39.080> it<00:02:48.040> there<00:02:49.040> is<00:02:49.220> no<00:02:49.580> such

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
simply scratch it there is no such

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.540 
simply scratch it there is no such
actually<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.200> screen<00:02:51.530> is<00:02:51.650> sensitive<00:02:52.130> on<00:02:52.340> my

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
actually the screen is sensitive on my

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.070 
actually the screen is sensitive on my
knife<00:02:52.850> it's<00:02:53.450> it's<00:02:54.350> really<00:02:55.480> strange<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.810> see

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
knife it's it's really strange to see

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.340 
knife it's it's really strange to see
but<00:02:58.010> this<00:02:58.610> is<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.760> very<00:02:59.030> very<00:02:59.420> sharp<00:02:59.720> knife<00:03:00.020> as

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
but this is a very very sharp knife as

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.640 
but this is a very very sharp knife as
you<00:03:00.380> can<00:03:00.650> see<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:02.570> screen<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:02.959> kind<00:03:03.500> of

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
you can see so the screen is kind of

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.190 
you can see so the screen is kind of
resisting<00:03:04.310> this<00:03:04.459> knife<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.610> might<00:03:08.200> argue

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
resisting this knife so you might argue

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.690 
resisting this knife so you might argue
with<00:03:09.739> me<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.220> am<00:03:10.430> NOT<00:03:11.800> doing<00:03:12.800> very<00:03:13.280> hard

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
with me that I am NOT doing very hard

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.949 
with me that I am NOT doing very hard
but<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:15.230> can<00:03:15.440> let<00:03:16.430> me<00:03:16.489> try<00:03:16.880> with<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.300> very

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
but you can let me try with the very

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.220 
but you can let me try with the very
steel<00:03:18.380> knife<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:20.180> screen<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.630> very<00:03:20.660> very

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
steel knife the screen is very very

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.229 
steel knife the screen is very very
effective<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:23.500> let<00:03:24.500> me<00:03:24.799> clean<00:03:25.700> it<00:03:25.820> up<00:03:25.940> a

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239

effective and let me clean it up a
little<00:03:26.299> bit<00:03:27.250> okay<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:30.530> what<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.010> can<00:03:31.160> say<00:03:31.310> that

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.410 
there is a little let me just turn off
the<00:03:36.140> display<00:03:36.440> as<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:37.549> can<00:03:37.730> see<00:03:37.910> there<00:03:38.120> is<00:03:38.269> a

the display as you can see there is a
little<00:03:38.870> bit<00:03:39.019> of<00:03:39.140> scuff<00:03:39.680> over<00:03:40.190> here<00:03:40.900> just<00:03:41.900> over

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
little bit of scuff over here just over

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.060 
little bit of scuff over here just over
here<00:03:42.290> but<00:03:43.010> not<00:03:43.250> very<00:03:43.580> much<00:03:43.820> let<00:03:44.299> me<00:03:44.510> try<00:03:44.750> again

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.390 

as<00:03:49.070> you<00:03:49.880> can<00:03:50.060> see<00:03:50.269> this<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:51.140> knife<00:03:51.739> is<00:03:52.100> a

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
as you can see this the knife is a

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:00.069 
as you can see this the knife is a
little<00:03:52.700> bit<00:03:52.820> scratching<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.540> screen<00:03:59.079> I'm

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
little bit scratching the screen I'm

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.949 
little bit scratching the screen I'm
putting<00:04:00.650> my<00:04:00.860> all<00:04:01.130> force<00:04:01.670> on<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.180> screen

itself and there is no screen protector

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.800 
itself and there is no screen protector
do<00:04:06.230> remember<00:04:06.650> that<00:04:07.090> so<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.209> screen<00:04:08.540> might

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
do remember that so the screen might

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:21.290 
do remember that so the screen might
splash

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:21.300 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:28.050 

so<00:04:22.300> let<00:04:22.480> me<00:04:22.510> clean<00:04:23.140> this<00:04:25.920> yes<00:04:26.920> there<00:04:27.430> is<00:04:27.820> a

little bit of scratch and it is
permanent<00:04:36.820> so<00:04:37.200> don't<00:04:38.200> try<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:38.560> in<00:04:38.800> your<00:04:38.890> home

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
carry us a sharp knife like this you

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.180 
carry us a sharp knife like this you
might<00:04:54.130> carry<00:04:54.430> some<00:04:54.730> normal<00:04:55.920> keychains<00:04:56.920> or

might carry some normal keychains or
keys

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
keys

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.890 
keys
they<00:04:58.300> might<00:04:58.600> resist<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.890> screen<00:05:00.250> very<00:05:00.550> easily

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
they might resist the screen very easily

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.600 
they might resist the screen very easily
now<00:05:01.900> there<00:05:02.260> are<00:05:02.380> interesting<00:05:02.860> part<00:05:03.190> that<00:05:03.310> is

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
now there are interesting part that is

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:17.149 
now there are interesting part that is
the<00:05:03.820> bending<00:05:04.180> let<00:05:05.140> me<00:05:05.350> zoom<00:05:05.680> again

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:22.949 

okay<00:05:18.330> so<00:05:19.330> let<00:05:19.569> me<00:05:19.779> try<00:05:20.050> to<00:05:20.499> bend<00:05:20.800> it<00:05:20.979> and<00:05:21.300> I<00:05:22.300> am

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:22.959 
okay so let me try to bend it and I am

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:25.769 
okay so let me try to bend it and I am
just<00:05:23.649> holding<00:05:24.189> this<00:05:24.550> like<00:05:24.789> this<00:05:25.089> and<00:05:25.330> the

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:25.779 
just holding this like this and the

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:29.939 
just holding this like this and the
screen<00:05:26.139> is<00:05:26.169> actually<00:05:26.469> on<00:05:27.029> so<00:05:28.589> let<00:05:29.589> me<00:05:29.769> try

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
screen is actually on so let me try

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:34.649 
screen is actually on so let me try
first<00:05:30.309> in<00:05:30.819> this<00:05:31.179> way<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:32.729> I'm<00:05:33.729> very<00:05:33.759> scared

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
first in this way and I'm very scared

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:40.519 
first in this way and I'm very scared
let's<00:05:35.139> see<00:05:36.809> so<00:05:37.809> you<00:05:37.869> might<00:05:38.169> heard<00:05:38.529> a<00:05:38.769> noise<00:05:39.489> of

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:40.529 
let's see so you might heard a noise of

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:45.570 
let's see so you might heard a noise of
creaking<00:05:41.529> and<00:05:41.739> that<00:05:42.159> is<00:05:42.309> true<00:05:42.639> and<00:05:44.129> this<00:05:45.129> green

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
creaking and that is true and this green

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.329 
creaking and that is true and this green
is<00:05:45.610> actually<00:05:46.300> bending<00:05:46.749> you<00:05:47.709> might<00:05:47.919> see<00:05:48.159> in<00:05:48.249> the

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:48.339 
is actually bending you might see in the

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:51.480 
is actually bending you might see in the
video<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:49.209> curvature<00:05:50.139> is<00:05:50.259> there<00:05:50.289> it<00:05:51.099> is<00:05:51.129> a

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
video the curvature is there it is a

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.579 
video the curvature is there it is a
little<00:05:51.729> bit<00:05:51.849> curvature<00:05:52.360> that<00:05:52.539> means<00:05:53.229> the

00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:53.589 
little bit curvature that means the

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:57.329 
little bit curvature that means the
screen<00:05:53.919> is<00:05:54.159> bending<00:05:54.729> and<00:05:55.419> on<00:05:55.659> the<00:05:55.779> front<00:05:56.339> as

00:05:57.329 --> 00:05:57.339 
screen is bending and on the front as

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:00.419 
screen is bending and on the front as
you<00:05:57.399> can<00:05:57.580> see<00:05:57.909> the<00:05:58.629> screen<00:05:59.019> is<00:05:59.050> bending<00:05:59.649> let<00:06:00.309> me

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:00.429 
you can see the screen is bending let me

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:05.009 
you can see the screen is bending let me
turn<00:06:00.490> on<00:06:00.639> the<00:06:00.759> display<00:06:01.059> and<00:06:01.889> there<00:06:02.889> is<00:06:03.129> a<00:06:04.019> thing

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:05.019 
turn on the display and there is a thing

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:06.509 
turn on the display and there is a thing
happening<00:06:05.529> on<00:06:05.679> the<00:06:05.830> middle<00:06:06.129> of<00:06:06.219> the<00:06:06.309> screen

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:06.519 
happening on the middle of the screen

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:08.429 
happening on the middle of the screen
you<00:06:06.729> might<00:06:06.909> not<00:06:07.179> see<00:06:07.419> it<00:06:07.449> but<00:06:07.569> I<00:06:07.899> can<00:06:08.110> see<00:06:08.379> it

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:08.439 
you might not see it but I can see it

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:12.239 
you might not see it but I can see it
and<00:06:09.159> this<00:06:09.550> is<00:06:09.729> I<00:06:09.759> think<00:06:10.169> the<00:06:11.169> LCD<00:06:11.619> is<00:06:11.800> touching

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:12.249 
and this is I think the LCD is touching

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:14.519 
and this is I think the LCD is touching
the<00:06:12.369> digitizer<00:06:12.729> let<00:06:13.449> me<00:06:13.629> put<00:06:13.869> a<00:06:13.989> little<00:06:14.139> bit<00:06:14.409> of

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:14.529 
the digitizer let me put a little bit of

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:19.469 
the digitizer let me put a little bit of
more<00:06:14.800> pressure<00:06:15.099> here<00:06:15.429> so<00:06:17.909> in<00:06:18.909> my<00:06:19.149> hand

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
more pressure here so in my hand

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.109 
more pressure here so in my hand
pressure<00:06:19.719> as<00:06:19.869> you<00:06:19.899> can<00:06:20.169> see<00:06:20.349> my<00:06:20.879> thumb's<00:06:21.879> are

00:06:22.109 --> 00:06:22.119 
pressure as you can see my thumb's are

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:24.509 
pressure as you can see my thumb's are
perfectly<00:06:22.959> red<00:06:23.229> so<00:06:23.529> I<00:06:23.559> am<00:06:23.800> putting<00:06:24.039> a<00:06:24.219> lot<00:06:24.490> of

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:24.519 
perfectly red so I am putting a lot of

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:28.469 
perfectly red so I am putting a lot of
pressure<00:06:24.759> in<00:06:25.029> it<00:06:25.649> so<00:06:26.649> the<00:06:26.919> cone<00:06:27.879> is<00:06:28.149> kind<00:06:28.419> of

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
pressure in it so the cone is kind of

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.199 
pressure in it so the cone is kind of
resisting<00:06:28.990> the<00:06:29.199> my<00:06:29.889> force<00:06:30.159> but<00:06:30.879> it<00:06:31.029> is<00:06:31.179> a

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:31.209 
resisting the my force but it is a

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:34.769 
resisting the my force but it is a
bending<00:06:31.689> a<00:06:31.749> little<00:06:31.839> bit<00:06:32.079> but<00:06:33.449> as<00:06:34.449> you<00:06:34.599> can<00:06:34.719> see

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:34.779 
bending a little bit but as you can see

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:39.029 
bending a little bit but as you can see
the<00:06:35.740> phone<00:06:35.979> is<00:06:36.009> a<00:06:36.339> little<00:06:36.849> bit<00:06:36.939> bender<00:06:37.319> bent<00:06:38.319> so

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 
the phone is a little bit bender bent so

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:43.739 
the phone is a little bit bender bent so
let<00:06:39.219> me<00:06:39.399> push<00:06:40.029> behind<00:06:41.309> so<00:06:42.309> now<00:06:42.519> the<00:06:42.579> phone<00:06:43.269> is<00:06:43.300> I

00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:43.749 
let me push behind so now the phone is I

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:48.719 
let me push behind so now the phone is I
think<00:06:43.990> alright<00:06:44.919> and<00:06:45.129> usable<00:06:45.599> so<00:06:46.599> this<00:06:46.899> is<00:06:47.729> kind

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:48.729 
think alright and usable so this is kind

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:51.540 
think alright and usable so this is kind
of<00:06:48.849> resisting<00:06:49.419> the<00:06:49.719> bending<00:06:50.349> or<00:06:50.559> it<00:06:51.039> is<00:06:51.159> not<00:06:51.369> a

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
of resisting the bending or it is not a

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.600 
of resisting the bending or it is not a
bended<00:06:52.119> issue<00:06:52.360> at<00:06:52.779> all<00:06:53.519> so<00:06:54.519> and<00:06:54.909> it's<00:06:55.209> quite

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
bended issue at all so and it's quite

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.129 
bended issue at all so and it's quite
scratch<00:06:57.610> proof<00:06:57.879> also<00:06:58.119> let<00:06:58.419> me<00:06:58.449> try<00:06:58.839> on<00:06:58.869> the

00:06:59.129 --> 00:06:59.139 
scratch proof also let me try on the

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:07.940 
scratch proof also let me try on the
backside<00:06:59.649> the<00:06:59.949> scratchy

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:07.950 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:15.750 

let<00:07:08.950> me<00:07:09.100> try<00:07:09.280> on<00:07:09.310> the<00:07:09.520> Micromax<00:07:10.000> logo<00:07:13.350> so<00:07:14.760> as

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.760 
let me try on the Micromax logo so as

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.610 
let me try on the Micromax logo so as
you<00:07:15.970> can<00:07:16.090> see<00:07:16.300> there<00:07:16.510> is<00:07:16.840> a<00:07:17.080> little<00:07:17.320> bit<00:07:17.500> of

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
you can see there is a little bit of

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.890 
you can see there is a little bit of
scratch<00:07:17.950> marks<00:07:18.460> over<00:07:18.669> here<00:07:18.910> and<00:07:19.090> they<00:07:19.780> are

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900 
scratch marks over here and they are

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.650 
scratch marks over here and they are
permanent<00:07:20.380> obviously<00:07:20.830> so<00:07:21.730> the<00:07:22.180> Micronauts

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.660 
permanent obviously so the Micronauts

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.600 
permanent obviously so the Micronauts
logo<00:07:22.930> is<00:07:23.050> also<00:07:23.169> scratched<00:07:23.650> let<00:07:24.130> me<00:07:24.310> try<00:07:24.580> to

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
logo is also scratched let me try to

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.310 
logo is also scratched let me try to
scratch<00:07:25.060> this<00:07:25.210> camera<00:07:27.570> there<00:07:28.570> is<00:07:28.660> not<00:07:28.930> a<00:07:28.960> lot

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.320 
scratch this camera there is not a lot

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.750 
scratch this camera there is not a lot
of<00:07:30.840> scratching<00:07:31.840> but<00:07:31.990> here<00:07:32.320> the<00:07:33.100> scratches<00:07:33.580> are

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:33.760 
of scratching but here the scratches are

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:42.659 
of scratching but here the scratches are
permanent<00:07:34.650> death<00:07:35.650> name<00:07:39.780> so<00:07:40.780> this<00:07:41.110> is<00:07:41.520> the<00:07:42.520> end

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:42.669 
permanent death name so this is the end

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:45.210 
permanent death name so this is the end
of<00:07:42.700> the<00:07:42.820> video<00:07:43.060> so<00:07:43.870> this<00:07:44.560> device<00:07:45.010> is<00:07:45.190> not

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:45.220 
of the video so this device is not

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.820 
of the video so this device is not
perfectly<00:07:46.060> scratch<00:07:46.510> proof<00:07:46.810> and<00:07:47.200> it<00:07:47.680> is

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:47.830 
perfectly scratch proof and it is

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.850 
perfectly scratch proof and it is
actually<00:07:48.400> kind<00:07:49.060> of<00:07:49.330> bent<00:07:49.960> proof<00:07:50.320> I<00:07:50.470> would<00:07:50.650> say

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:50.860 
actually kind of bent proof I would say

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.670 
actually kind of bent proof I would say
so<00:07:51.340> that's<00:07:51.610> all<00:07:51.850> for<00:07:52.030> this<00:07:52.150> video<00:07:52.330> and
