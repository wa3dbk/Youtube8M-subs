00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
kind of a little redundant but not

really<00:01:33.460> I<00:01:33.490> mean<00:01:33.550> this<00:01:33.820> thing<00:01:34.030> is<00:01:34.150> gigantic

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
pulling this in and out of this hand

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.450 
pulling this in and out of this hand
right<00:01:40.450> over<00:01:40.479> here<00:01:40.900> is<00:01:41.260> a<00:01:41.650> little<00:01:41.890> tricky<00:01:42.310> but

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
right over here is a little tricky but

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.580 
right over here is a little tricky but
not<00:01:42.729> too<00:01:42.970> bad<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:43.630> just<00:01:43.780> want<00:01:43.960> to<00:01:44.049> jam<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:44.500> all

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
not too bad you just want to jam it all

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.930 
not too bad you just want to jam it all
the<00:01:44.740> way<00:01:44.830> through<00:01:45.100> that's<00:01:45.280> basically<00:01:45.700> how

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
the way through that's basically how

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.730 
the way through that's basically how
that<00:01:45.970> works<00:01:46.420> like<00:01:46.659> take<00:01:46.930> this<00:01:47.049> other<00:01:47.290> one<00:01:47.530> and

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
that works like take this other one and

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.510 
that works like take this other one and
then<00:01:48.310> just<00:01:48.610> you<00:01:49.060> know<00:01:49.200> yeah<00:01:50.200> yeah<00:01:51.100> there<00:01:51.430> it

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
then just you know yeah yeah there it

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.250 
then just you know yeah yeah there it
goes<00:01:51.549> so<00:01:51.970> it's<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.150> little<00:01:52.360> scary<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:52.960> I<00:01:53.049> felt

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
goes so it's a little scary and I felt

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.660 
goes so it's a little scary and I felt
like<00:01:53.409> I<00:01:53.590> was<00:01:53.710> supposed<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.070> kind<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.400> try<00:01:54.610> to

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
like I was supposed to kind of try to

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.340 
like I was supposed to kind of try to
like<00:01:54.880> weave<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.240> through<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.510> hand<00:01:55.780> like<00:01:56.020> peel

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
like weave it through the hand like peel

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.200 
like weave it through the hand like peel
the<00:01:56.590> fingers<00:01:57.130> back<00:01:57.340> but<00:01:57.670> no<00:01:57.790> you<00:01:57.850> don't<00:01:58.060> want

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
the fingers back but no you don't want

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.640 
the fingers back but no you don't want
to<00:01:58.270> do<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:58.479> just<00:01:58.690> jam<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.229> straight<00:01:59.500> through

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
to do that just jam it straight through

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.950 
to do that just jam it straight through
then<00:02:00.190> on<00:02:00.310> this<00:02:00.520> hand<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:01.270> whole<00:02:01.479> peg<00:02:01.690> isn't

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
then on this hand the whole peg isn't

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.870 
then on this hand the whole peg isn't
really<00:02:02.140> big<00:02:02.350> enough<00:02:02.380> for<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:03.250> sword<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.700> hold

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
really big enough for the sword to hold

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.850 
really big enough for the sword to hold
at<00:02:04.000> all<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.510> just<00:02:04.690> uses<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.170> peg<00:02:05.440> that's<00:02:05.680> at

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
at all so it just uses the peg that's at

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.170 
at all so it just uses the peg that's at
the<00:02:05.950> very<00:02:06.100> bottom<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.549> hilt<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.880> blade

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
the very bottom of the hilt of the blade

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.369 
the very bottom of the hilt of the blade
and<00:02:07.390> then<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.600> do<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:07.750> side<00:02:07.960> by<00:02:08.110> side<00:02:08.140> comparison

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
and then to do a side by side comparison

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.410 
and then to do a side by side comparison
you<00:02:09.069> can<00:02:09.220> see<00:02:09.369> one<00:02:09.580> sword<00:02:09.849> is<00:02:09.939> much<00:02:10.119> longer

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
you can see one sword is much longer

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.820 
you can see one sword is much longer
than<00:02:10.629> the<00:02:10.840> other<00:02:10.989> I<00:02:11.080> feel<00:02:11.290> like<00:02:11.349> this<00:02:11.620> one's

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
pretty happy with the paint applications

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.540 
pretty happy with the paint applications
and<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.110> sculpting<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.800> figure<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.190> think

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
and the sculpting of the figure I think

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.800 
and the sculpting of the figure I think
the<00:02:46.640> head<00:02:46.820> sculpt<00:02:47.180> looks<00:02:47.330> pretty<00:02:47.630> good

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
the head sculpt looks pretty good

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.300 
the head sculpt looks pretty good
nothing<00:02:48.170> really<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.560> complain<00:02:48.830> about<00:02:49.010> over

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
nothing really to complain about over

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.770 
nothing really to complain about over
here<00:02:49.340> one<00:02:49.970> thing<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.150> did<00:02:50.270> notice<00:02:50.450> though<00:02:50.750> is

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
here one thing I did notice though is

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.360 
here one thing I did notice though is
that<00:02:50.870> they<00:02:51.020> did<00:02:51.170> sculpt<00:02:51.560> teeth<00:02:51.890> right<00:02:52.160> over

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
that they did sculpt teeth right over

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.650 
that they did sculpt teeth right over
there<00:02:52.490> and<00:02:52.640> they<00:02:52.700> did<00:02:52.790> not<00:02:52.940> paint<00:02:53.240> them<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:53.540> he

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
there and they did not paint them so he

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.840 
there and they did not paint them so he
has<00:02:53.750> flesh<00:02:54.050> colored<00:02:54.470> teeth<00:02:54.800> beside<00:02:55.520> from<00:02:55.700> that

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
has flesh colored teeth beside from that

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.340 
has flesh colored teeth beside from that
I<00:02:55.880> think<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.210> paint<00:02:56.420> applications<00:02:56.960> came<00:02:57.170> out

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
I think the paint applications came out

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.780 
I think the paint applications came out
very<00:02:57.710> clean<00:02:58.040> on<00:02:58.190> this<00:02:58.340> guy

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
very clean on this guy

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.340 
very clean on this guy
and<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:59.120> really<00:02:59.480> liked<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.840> choice<00:03:00.080> for<00:03:00.290> the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
and I really liked the choice for the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.930 
and I really liked the choice for the
flesh<00:03:00.650> tone<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:00.920> think<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.280> flesh<00:03:01.520> tone<00:03:01.760> looks

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
flesh tone I think the flesh tone looks

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.850 
flesh tone I think the flesh tone looks
very<00:03:02.210> nice<00:03:02.390> actually<00:03:02.990> better<00:03:03.440> than<00:03:03.620> some<00:03:03.770> of

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
very nice actually better than some of

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.350 
very nice actually better than some of
the<00:03:03.920> flesh<00:03:04.100> tones<00:03:04.310> we've<00:03:04.460> gotten<00:03:04.790> in<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.090> past

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
the flesh tones we've gotten in the past

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.150 
the flesh tones we've gotten in the past
with<00:03:05.630> Marvel<00:03:06.050> Legends<00:03:06.380> which<00:03:06.560> is<00:03:06.710> actually

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
with Marvel Legends which is actually

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160 
with Marvel Legends which is actually
pretty<00:03:07.430> horrible<00:03:07.700> but<00:03:07.940> he<00:03:08.360> has<00:03:08.450> no<00:03:08.600> X<00:03:08.870> on<00:03:09.050> his

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
pretty horrible but he has no X on his

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.420 
pretty horrible but he has no X on his
belt<00:03:09.410> that's<00:03:09.650> another<00:03:09.860> little<00:03:10.160> thing<00:03:10.340> I

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
belt that's another little thing I

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.370 
belt that's another little thing I
noticed<00:03:10.820> but<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.660> know<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.900> arms<00:03:12.230> and

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
noticed but you know the arms and

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.290 
noticed but you know the arms and
everything<00:03:12.680> else<00:03:12.830> seems<00:03:13.070> to<00:03:13.160> be<00:03:13.340> pretty<00:03:13.640> stock

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
everything else seems to be pretty stock

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.180 
everything else seems to be pretty stock
for<00:03:14.660> these<00:03:14.810> mashers<00:03:15.320> especially<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.010> legs

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
for these mashers especially the legs

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.010 
for these mashers especially the legs
over<00:03:16.430> here<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:17.210> to<00:03:17.300> get<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.480> closer<00:03:17.720> look<00:03:17.960> at

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
over here and to get a closer look at

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.450 
over here and to get a closer look at
the<00:03:18.080> claws<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:18.710> just<00:03:18.860> spin<00:03:19.130> this<00:03:19.310> around

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
the claws and you just spin this around

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.190 
the claws and you just spin this around
and<00:03:19.790> they're<00:03:19.940> kind<00:03:20.240> of<00:03:20.300> short<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.570> stubby<00:03:20.870> but

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
and they're kind of short and stubby but

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.570 
and they're kind of short and stubby but
they<00:03:21.290> match<00:03:21.470> well<00:03:21.770> with<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:21.980> style<00:03:22.310> of<00:03:22.520> the

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
they match well with the style of the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.460 
they match well with the style of the
mashers<00:03:23.090> toy<00:03:23.330> line<00:03:23.570> overall<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.170> it's<00:03:24.320> nothing

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
mashers toy line overall so it's nothing

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.930 
mashers toy line overall so it's nothing
really<00:03:24.710> to<00:03:24.920> complain<00:03:25.130> about<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.580> then<00:03:25.700> here's

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
really to complain about and then here's

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.910 
really to complain about and then here's
the<00:03:26.120> back<00:03:26.300> of<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.540> figure<00:03:26.720> over<00:03:26.870> here<00:03:27.110> and

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
the back of the figure over here and

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.040 
the back of the figure over here and
there's<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:28.250> Wolverine<00:03:28.460> but<00:03:29.150> Wolverine<00:03:29.720> belt

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
there's a Wolverine but Wolverine belt

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.500 
there's a Wolverine but Wolverine belt
Wolverine<00:03:30.470> back<00:03:30.860> so<00:03:31.220> then<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.820> ports<00:03:32.150> we<00:03:32.300> went

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
Wolverine back so then the ports we went

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.730 
Wolverine back so then the ports we went
over<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.750> ones<00:03:32.900> on<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.080> forearms<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.590> then

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
over the ones on the forearms and then

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.470 
over the ones on the forearms and then
on<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:33.950> shins<00:03:34.280> then<00:03:34.760> he<00:03:34.880> has<00:03:34.970> two<00:03:35.150> in<00:03:35.270> the<00:03:35.330> back

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
on the shins then he has two in the back

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.720 
on the shins then he has two in the back
right<00:03:35.720> here<00:03:35.930> then<00:03:36.140> he<00:03:36.200> has<00:03:36.380> one<00:03:36.680> on<00:03:36.830> each<00:03:37.070> bicep

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
right here then he has one on each bicep

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.340 
right here then he has one on each bicep
again<00:03:37.910> for<00:03:38.240> kids<00:03:38.420> toys<00:03:38.660> I<00:03:38.780> think<00:03:39.020> has<00:03:39.170> was

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
again for kids toys I think has was

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.420 
again for kids toys I think has was
really<00:03:39.590> done<00:03:39.740> a<00:03:39.770> good<00:03:39.950> job<00:03:40.010> in<00:03:40.250> the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
really done a good job in the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.550 
really done a good job in the
articulation<00:03:41.150> for<00:03:41.360> kids<00:03:41.600> toys<00:03:41.900> okay<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:42.290> the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
articulation for kids toys okay so the

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.290 
articulation for kids toys okay so the
head<00:03:42.710> moves<00:03:42.920> up<00:03:43.130> quite<00:03:43.520> a<00:03:43.550> bit<00:03:43.790> that's<00:03:43.970> pretty

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
head moves up quite a bit that's pretty

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.180 
head moves up quite a bit that's pretty
nice<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:44.930> moves<00:03:45.080> down<00:03:45.290> rotate<00:03:45.890> side<00:03:46.070> to

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
nice and it moves down rotate side to

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.070 
nice and it moves down rotate side to
side<00:03:46.370> shoulders<00:03:47.030> move<00:03:47.210> outward<00:03:47.660> you<00:03:47.870> can

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
side shoulders move outward you can

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.000 
side shoulders move outward you can
rotate<00:03:48.260> them<00:03:48.500> forward

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
rotate them forward

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.190 
rotate them forward
he<00:03:49.250> has<00:03:49.370> elbows<00:03:49.760> that<00:03:50.000> bend<00:03:50.240> at<00:03:50.390> not<00:03:50.660> quite<00:03:51.020> 90

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
he has elbows that bend at not quite 90

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.690 
he has elbows that bend at not quite 90
degrees<00:03:51.650> that's<00:03:51.980> one<00:03:52.190> thing<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.520> really

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
degrees that's one thing you really

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.460 
degrees that's one thing you really
notice<00:03:53.000> with<00:03:53.270> this<00:03:53.450> particular<00:03:53.960> figure<00:03:54.320> is

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
notice with this particular figure is

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.260 
notice with this particular figure is
that<00:03:54.950> he<00:03:55.040> does<00:03:55.280> have<00:03:55.490> limited<00:03:55.880> elbow

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
that he does have limited elbow

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.420 
that he does have limited elbow
articulation<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:57.230> then<00:03:57.710> he<00:03:57.860> rotates<00:03:58.280> at<00:03:58.400> the

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
articulation and then he rotates at the

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.010 
articulation and then he rotates at the
elbow<00:03:58.520> as<00:03:58.940> well<00:03:59.120> no<00:03:59.570> waist<00:03:59.780> articulation

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
elbow as well no waist articulation

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.960 
elbow as well no waist articulation
that'd<00:04:00.770> be<00:04:00.890> cool<00:04:01.010> if<00:04:01.130> they<00:04:01.250> added<00:04:01.610> that<00:04:01.760> that's

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
that'd be cool if they added that that's

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.700 
that'd be cool if they added that that's
like<00:04:02.120> one<00:04:02.360> major<00:04:02.630> piece<00:04:02.900> of<00:04:03.050> articulation<00:04:03.650> I

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
like one major piece of articulation I

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.270 
like one major piece of articulation I
wish<00:04:03.860> they<00:04:04.040> had

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
wish they had

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.500 
wish they had
he<00:04:04.520> has<00:04:04.610> hips<00:04:04.820> that<00:04:04.940> move<00:04:05.150> all<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.480> way

he has hips that move all the way

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.180 
he has hips that move all the way
outward<00:04:05.750> they<00:04:06.140> move<00:04:06.380> forward<00:04:06.770> so<00:04:06.950> they're<00:04:07.070> on

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
outward they move forward so they're on

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.980 
outward they move forward so they're on
T<00:04:07.400> joints<00:04:07.730> he<00:04:07.820> has<00:04:07.940> an<00:04:08.090> upper<00:04:08.360> thigh<00:04:08.540> swivel

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
really bend all the way down to 90

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.990 
really bend all the way down to 90
degrees<00:04:12.680> as<00:04:12.860> well<00:04:13.070> and<00:04:13.280> he<00:04:13.340> also<00:04:13.460> has<00:04:13.640> angles

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
beautiful ankle pivot in that came apart

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.670 
beautiful ankle pivot in that came apart
and<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:17.510> can<00:04:17.600> take<00:04:17.720> that<00:04:17.750> apart<00:04:18.200> and<00:04:18.380> take

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
and you can take that apart and take

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.600 
and you can take that apart and take
that<00:04:18.799> part<00:04:19.100> and<00:04:19.250> that<00:04:19.489> and<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:20.799> that<00:04:21.799> that<00:04:22.160> and

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
that part and that and and that that and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.340 
that part and that and and that that and
the<00:04:23.090> shoulder<00:04:23.540> come<00:04:23.690> up<00:04:23.810> -<00:04:24.020> I<00:04:24.050> thought<00:04:24.260> the

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
the shoulder come up - I thought the

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.540 
the shoulder come up - I thought the
shoulders<00:04:24.650> came<00:04:24.800> off<00:04:24.920> and<00:04:25.070> then<00:04:25.190> he<00:04:25.280> has<00:04:25.400> no

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
shoulders came off and then he has no

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.670 
shoulders came off and then he has no
head<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:25.970> thought<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:26.630> shoulders<00:04:26.960> came<00:04:27.200> off<00:04:27.350> no

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
head I thought the shoulders came off no

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.260 
head I thought the shoulders came off no
now<00:04:28.220> I<00:04:28.460> don't<00:04:28.610> think<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.820> shoulders<00:04:29.150> are

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
now I don't think the shoulders are

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.880 
now I don't think the shoulders are
coming<00:04:29.360> off<00:04:29.600> on<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.900> shoulders<00:04:30.260> stay<00:04:30.560> so

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
coming off on the shoulders stay so

these things to however you like that's

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.410 
these things to however you like that's
the<00:05:10.370> whole<00:05:10.400> point<00:05:10.790> of<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:10.910> whole<00:05:11.030> thing

the whole point of the whole thing

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.820 
the whole point of the whole thing
and<00:05:11.660> I<00:05:11.810> actually<00:05:11.960> always<00:05:12.230> think<00:05:12.470> it's<00:05:12.590> kind<00:05:12.800> of

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
and I actually always think it's kind of

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.290 
and I actually always think it's kind of
neat<00:05:13.010> seeing<00:05:13.220> wings<00:05:13.490> on<00:05:13.700> all<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:13.910> characters

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
neat seeing wings on all the characters

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.670 
neat seeing wings on all the characters
I<00:05:14.480> think<00:05:14.690> actually<00:05:14.810> this<00:05:15.050> matches<00:05:15.410> up<00:05:15.440> pretty

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
I think actually this matches up pretty

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.020 
I think actually this matches up pretty
well<00:05:15.740> the<00:05:16.040> yellow<00:05:16.280> count<00:05:16.490> goes<00:05:16.700> with<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:16.880> rest

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
well the yellow count goes with the rest

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.220 
well the yellow count goes with the rest
of<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.180> suit<00:05:17.360> that's<00:05:17.630> actually<00:05:17.960> not<00:05:18.050> too<00:05:18.200> bad
