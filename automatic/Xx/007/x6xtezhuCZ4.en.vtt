00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.840
 Let us think together about this issue, 2 on 3 or 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.904
 2/4 hit 4/5 

00:00:11.904 --> 00:00:13.320
 We've seen the previous videos 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.070
 Method of calculating these issues, 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.490
 This issue is equal to ... 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.380
 We must first hit the rugs, 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.970
 Ie 2 hit 4 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.050
 2 hit 4, 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.880
 We do the same thing in the first place, we have to hit these two things, 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.130
 3 hit 5. 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.670
 3 hit 5. 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.400
 Rugs here equals 8, 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.504
 The place is equal to 15. 

00:00:40.504 --> 00:00:42.420
 This output fracture can not be simplified more than this, 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.490
 There are no common factors between numbers 8 and 15 except for number 1. 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.490
 If this is the result, 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.380
 Output break 8/15. 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.880
 but how? Why is this logical? 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.360
 Let's think about it a bit, 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.910
 There are two ways to visualize the issue, 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.966
 Let's draw the fraction 2/3 

00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:01.090
 We will draw 2/3 here ... 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.430
 I will draw it to be fairly large, 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.390
 I will draw 2/3 and take it 4/5 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.440
 2/3, I will draw it as much as I said before 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.600
 Two thirds, 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.590
 As such, 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.140
 This one-third, 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.990
 This two-thirds, 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.770
 I waited for the parts to be drawn evenly, 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.330
 It is not complete, but I will make them somewhat equal. 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.170
 Here is the final drawing, 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.000
 Divided into three. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.400
 I will draw it again, 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.910
 Painted three times here, 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.630
 The fraction represents 2/3, two of these parts 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.720
 Represents as we said two of these three parts, 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.880
 One way to think about the issue is to say 2/3 hit 4/5, 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.720
 What is the fraction of our 4/5 fraction in 2/3? 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.630
 How do we divide the fracture 2/3 to fifths? 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.600
 Let's try to divide one part into five parts. 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.000
 Let's try it together, 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.512
 We will divide as I told you each part of these parts to 5. 

00:02:01.512 --> 00:02:05.958
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.430
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.800
 I can also split the latter part if you like, 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.330
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.180
 We want to take 4/5 of these two parts. 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.760
 How many five are we here? 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.924
 We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 

00:02:24.924 --> 00:02:26.090
 We must look here 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.520
 That these parts are not dark. 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.421
 We have 15 parts here 

00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:30.420
 In this full form. 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.130
 That is to say, how much part of our fifteen part? 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.080
 And so we will get this output. 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.965
 But note 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 

00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:41.840
 And 15. 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.180
 How do you think we got this? 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.219
 I have 3, I have three, 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:46.760
 You divided each third of these three 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.410
 To 5 fifths. 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.710
 We have five times the number of moles, 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.930
 3 hit 5 equals 15 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.150
 But we want 4/5 of these two parts here, 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.220
 This shaded part represents 10/15, 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.530
 Which is equivalent to fraction 2/3. 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.730
 We will take 4/5 of the third one, 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.700
 In the two thirds we have 10 quintiles, that is, we have to determine 8 of these 10 quintiles. 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.280
 We will take if 8 parts, 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:18.440
 For Shadows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.310
 8 parts of 15 parts, ie 8/15. 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.220
 We can think of it differently, 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.230
 Let us start this time with the fifth, not the third, 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.690
 I will draw here 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.250
 I will draw a complete form, 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.220
 Here is the figure, 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.860
 I will try to divide it into five equal parts, 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.440
 as much as I can. 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.770
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.030
 Break 4/5, ie, 4 of these parts. 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.670
 4 of these 5 equal parts. 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.660
 3, 4. 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.980
 Now we want to take 2/3 fraction of this shape. 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.500
 How will we do this? 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.280
 Each of these five parts will be divided into 3 parts. 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.650
 And we have again become 15 part. 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:19.610
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.580
 We want to take the fraction 2/3 or to determine this fraction on this yellow area. 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.330
 We will not take 2/3 of the whole shape 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.910
 But we will take 2/3 of the 4/5. 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.440
 How much part do we have if? 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.660
 We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.610
 If we have 12 form or something, 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.040
 We want to take 2/3 of the yellow area, ie 8 parts. 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:50.970
 We will take 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 8 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.940
 Of 15 parts. 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.290
 In both ways, the answer will be the same. 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.360
 In the first method we will take 4/5 of 2/3, 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.143
 The second way is to take 2/3 of 4/5.
