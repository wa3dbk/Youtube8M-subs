00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
through this floor right here to go

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.730 
through this floor right here to go
around<00:00:54.520> here<00:00:54.880> I<00:00:55.060> did<00:00:55.720> it<00:00:55.840> one<00:00:56.020> attempt<00:00:56.470> I<00:00:56.560> went

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
around here I did it one attempt I went

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.180 
around here I did it one attempt I went
through<00:00:56.980> and<00:00:57.310> ended<00:00:57.760> up<00:00:57.880> falling<00:00:58.720> into<00:00:59.380> the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
through and ended up falling into the

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.000 
through and ended up falling into the
place<00:01:00.790> where<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.120> ICC<00:01:01.630> five<00:01:01.840> hands<00:01:02.110> were<00:01:02.350> and

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
place where the ICC five hands were and

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.560 
place where the ICC five hands were and
that<00:01:03.130> ended<00:01:03.430> up<00:01:03.550> getting<00:01:03.880> me<00:01:04.000> killed<00:01:04.300> from<00:01:04.510> the

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
that ended up getting me killed from the

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.990 
that ended up getting me killed from the
fall<00:01:04.839> damage<00:01:05.230> so<00:01:06.130> just<00:01:06.340> kind<00:01:06.550> of<00:01:06.610> stay<00:01:06.760> over

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
fall damage so just kind of stay over

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.730 
fall damage so just kind of stay over
there<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:08.080> then<00:01:08.170> if<00:01:08.290> you<00:01:08.380> look<00:01:08.500> down<00:01:08.680> here

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
there and then if you look down here

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.000 
there and then if you look down here
there's<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:10.140> square<00:01:11.140> from<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.530> original

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.320 
there's the square from the original
video<00:01:13.050> then<00:01:14.050> we<00:01:14.140> just<00:01:14.320> go<00:01:14.470> through<00:01:14.500> here<00:01:15.330> my

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
video then we just go through here my

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.150 
video then we just go through here my
server<00:01:16.630> when<00:01:16.960> a<00:01:16.990> grasp<00:01:17.290> is<00:01:17.500> actually<00:01:17.890> in

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
server when a grasp is actually in

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.400
