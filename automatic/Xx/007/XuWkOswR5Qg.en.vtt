00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.310
 Y 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.640
 how it has been 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.299
 as mentioned 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.230
 Y 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.230
 good 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.939
 the site 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.150
 it's re 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.830
 F sharp and if all the bikes 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.450
 then listen to what do your 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.459
 points here 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.540
 after about a triad of the sun 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.540
 using in the fourth 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.300
 rossi 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.300
 I am 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.130
 and the subject begins 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.680
 what does it do with low network 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.680
 triad of re major k 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.610
 after triad of greater sun 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.260
 pick up with me 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.670
 and they are 7 towards the tonic where only here 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.670
 the middle 6 and here below 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:19.130
 / doing as a fall of 27 that is 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:22.460
 would be seventh flat with the second 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:26.170
 increased with a minor third we will do 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.170
 the typical chord people 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:37.209
 start with a pentatonic of that 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.209
 with a little wave 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.290
 so minus taking the four strings 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:52.770
 the 7 with the third minor 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.770
 the youngest in this game 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.580
 and start again 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.750
 and 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:14.100
 2 with bass in network with the base 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.960
 that this is false sustained diminished 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.960
 yes 7 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.750
 bye 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.750
 the third 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.470
 and the sixth of love that only 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.680
 s 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.490
 7 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.950
 the seventh with the 3rd 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:36.480
 the chorus stayed with low in network 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:39.800
 Flat 7 with the second piece 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.800
 distribution 27 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.050
 good 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.580
 or if they want to be something 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:33.590

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.590

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.630
 yes 

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.830

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.570
