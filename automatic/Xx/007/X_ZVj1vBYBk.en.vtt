advertisement<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:32.670> looks<00:03:32.880> like<00:03:33.030> this<00:03:33.510> stuff

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
advertisement it looks like this stuff

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.390 
advertisement it looks like this stuff
only<00:03:33.930> comes<00:03:34.290> with<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.530> pro<00:03:34.709> edition<00:03:34.920> but<00:03:35.220> it

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
only comes with the pro edition but it

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.190 
only comes with the pro edition but it
does<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.730> comes<00:03:35.880> with<00:03:35.940> both<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.959> only

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
does it comes with both the only

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.479 
does it comes with both the only
difference<00:03:37.560> is<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:38.010> get<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.280> season

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
difference is that you get the season

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.330 
difference is that you get the season
pass<00:03:38.820> so<00:03:39.180> what<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.780> like<00:03:40.080> is<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.980> kind<00:03:41.250> of

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
pass so what I like is the kind of

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.310 
pass so what I like is the kind of
multicolored<00:03:42.150> weapons<00:03:42.630> down<00:03:42.870> at<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.170> bottom

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
multicolored weapons down at the bottom

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.750 
multicolored weapons down at the bottom
of<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.680> screen<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:44.040> think<00:03:44.340> those<00:03:44.459> are<00:03:44.489> really

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
of the screen I think those are really

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.270 
of the screen I think those are really
cool<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.180> red<00:03:45.390> white<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.870> black<00:03:46.080> theme<00:03:46.500> it

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
cool that red white and black theme it

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.640 
cool that red white and black theme it
just<00:03:47.520> looks<00:03:47.940> really<00:03:48.270> nice<00:03:48.600> i<00:03:48.870> like<00:03:49.020> the<00:03:49.200> pistol

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
just looks really nice i like the pistol

just looks really nice i like the pistol
the<00:03:49.800> pistol<00:03:50.100> looks<00:03:50.250> futuristic<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:51.120> kind<00:03:51.330> of

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
the pistol looks futuristic and kind of

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.920 
the pistol looks futuristic and kind of
nasty<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:52.320> assault<00:03:52.680> rifle<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:53.220> ba<00:03:53.570> l27<00:03:54.570> looks

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
nasty the assault rifle the ba l27 looks

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.290 
nasty the assault rifle the ba l27 looks
very<00:03:55.170> cool<00:03:55.470> they<00:03:56.250> don't<00:03:56.459> show<00:03:56.640> off<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.820> picture

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
very cool they don't show off a picture

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.960 
very cool they don't show off a picture
of<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.780> Atlas<00:03:58.200> Gorge<00:03:58.560> bonus<00:03:59.100> multiplayer<00:03:59.700> map

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
of the Atlas Gorge bonus multiplayer map

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.670 
of the Atlas Gorge bonus multiplayer map
which<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.330> unfortunate<00:04:00.870> but<00:04:01.050> I'm<00:04:01.320> sure<00:04:01.650> we'll

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
which is unfortunate but I'm sure we'll

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.580 
which is unfortunate but I'm sure we'll
see<00:04:01.890> more<00:04:02.250> on<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.640> in<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:03.000> future<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.630> the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
see more on that in the future and the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.340 
see more on that in the future and the
Atlas<00:04:05.070> exoskeleton<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.180> Atlas<00:04:06.660> helmet<00:04:07.200> a

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
Atlas exoskeleton and Atlas helmet a

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.960 
Atlas exoskeleton and Atlas helmet a
both<00:04:07.680> being<00:04:07.890> white<00:04:08.190> they<00:04:08.430> look<00:04:08.610> pretty<00:04:08.760> cool

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
both being white they look pretty cool

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.280 
both being white they look pretty cool
hopefully<00:04:09.300> they'll<00:04:09.630> stand<00:04:09.870> out<00:04:10.080> in

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
hopefully they'll stand out in

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.080 
hopefully they'll stand out in
multiplayer<00:04:10.739> so<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.430> can<00:04:11.610> kind<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.850> show<00:04:12.060> off

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
multiplayer so you can kind of show off

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.530 
multiplayer so you can kind of show off
all<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.540> gear<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:13.080> you<00:04:13.190> collected<00:04:14.190> it<00:04:15.090> also

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
actually now that I'm looking at it a

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.730 
actually now that I'm looking at it a
little<00:05:05.640> closer<00:05:05.940> it<00:05:06.240> doesn't<00:05:06.600> necessarily<00:05:06.840> say

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
little closer it doesn't necessarily say

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.100 
little closer it doesn't necessarily say
that<00:05:08.460> those<00:05:08.730> weapons<00:05:09.000> will<00:05:09.360> be<00:05:09.480> available<00:05:09.780> in

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
that those weapons will be available in

for the single player usually I'm just
picking<00:05:53.940> up<00:05:54.120> whatever<00:05:54.330> weapons<00:05:54.810> dropped<00:05:55.170> on

picking up whatever weapons dropped on
the<00:05:55.440> ground<00:05:55.470> you<00:05:56.130> know<00:05:56.220> I<00:05:56.250> might<00:05:56.400> start<00:05:56.730> with<00:05:56.790> a

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
the ground you know I might start with a

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.550 
the ground you know I might start with a
weapon<00:05:57.150> in<00:05:57.600> the<00:05:57.810> single-player<00:05:58.170> of<00:05:58.380> call<00:05:58.530> of

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
weapon in the single-player of call of

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.170 
weapon in the single-player of call of
duty<00:05:58.860> but<00:05:58.950> normally<00:05:59.310> I<00:05:59.370> run<00:05:59.520> on<00:05:59.640> ammo<00:05:59.970> just

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
duty but normally I run on ammo just

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.300 
duty but normally I run on ammo just
pick<00:06:00.330> up<00:06:00.420> anything<00:06:00.720> so<00:06:01.080> i<00:06:01.260> would<00:06:01.890> think<00:06:02.190> that

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
pick up anything so i would think that

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.800 
pick up anything so i would think that
these<00:06:02.520> are<00:06:02.670> available<00:06:02.820> in<00:06:03.090> multiplayer<00:06:03.480> but

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
these are available in multiplayer but

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.770 
these are available in multiplayer but
it<00:06:04.050> doesn't<00:06:04.410> really<00:06:04.740> say<00:06:05.280> it<00:06:05.460> clearly<00:06:06.060> on<00:06:06.480> this

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
it doesn't really say it clearly on this

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.260 
it doesn't really say it clearly on this
piece<00:06:07.080> of<00:06:07.110> paper<00:06:07.260> so<00:06:08.190> we'll<00:06:08.400> have<00:06:08.610> to<00:06:08.820> see<00:06:08.850> so

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
piece of paper so we'll have to see so

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.270 
piece of paper so we'll have to see so
hopefully<00:06:10.170> this<00:06:10.290> cleared<00:06:10.830> up<00:06:10.920> a<00:06:11.040> lot<00:06:11.070> of

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
hopefully this cleared up a lot of
