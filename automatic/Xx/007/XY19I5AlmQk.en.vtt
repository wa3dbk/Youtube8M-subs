00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.279
 hello everybody is a fraud today we are going to talk about ecological crimes 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.409
 remembering a little that within an ecosystem 

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:12.939
 themes occupying different levels of tropic 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:14.309
 power levels 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.189
 beginning with the producers who are responsible for introducing the 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.720
 energy is not consistent are six self self sesdec erased to obtain 

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:25.509
 your own airplane 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.039
 then we have consumers who are already supposed to have another country that 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.730
 do not have process capability is the food itself so they need 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.230
 culture this risk so that they can get 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:42.760
 nutrients air stayed with the girl will have their life relations of 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.940
 where and when it was classified as primary 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.580
 secondary and successively 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.920
 we will start 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.770
 by the nominee pyramid 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.030
 has a name already talking she will parade to use the amount of lives 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.000
 present in the one who is 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 let's suppose you want to see in a certain area 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.650
 the amount from grass 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.490
 which would be enough to feed the tite support in turn serve to 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.119
 feed the little birds 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.480
 then needed if we can ride 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.520
 as well as in grass hotels serve as food for 704 on a ticket for their 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.270
 Sometimes you have to go where food for the little birds. 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.870
 in this case we have a large normal 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.430
 besides the clown 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.370
 she would embark towards the sea she will narrow side 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.370
 in the name plot we help them land an inversion 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.619
 that means saying 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.120
 had to work closely towards the portion of the lagoon 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.740
 For example, if you cling if you kill yourself 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.050
 capo says that he will think of the families that live there, I might note that in this 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.149
 that there are 500 competitors 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.500
 and eating 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.750
 all were 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.000
 which in turn if I were to examine those lungs I would find 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.160
 parasites in your intestine that would give more or less a total of 30 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.990
 thousand protozoa 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.109
 our second type of pirarucus is the biomass pyramid 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:12.109
 in this case of sandy presenting pieces 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.089
 total 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.120
 consumers and producers only now that it is working 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.139
 with pcc 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.139
 then in this case what causes right 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.299
 if I took eight tons I would 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.420
 mc would see that she would surrender 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.200
 for an entire year 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.199
 fragment with a ton of calves 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:43.750
 who in turn had to face 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.590
 a teenager of 47 500 in this case we can also observe the sea 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.099
 because we could observe this inversion because in fact this measure 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.930
 The target is barely 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.330
 if I can analyze 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.790
 the amount of phytoplankton the port has again overcome 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.860
 I would only observe 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.489
 what their behavior would be similar to them 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.870
 but as I am seeing a particular point in time 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.089
 I can see an inversion of this pyramid 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:17.039
 so in that case what I would realize that I had realized that it is 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:19.210
 the producer is smaller 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.829
 how do I go about that the consumer has more 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.250
 so why is this being possible because the speed at 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:29.220
 multiplication of affection point expressively greater 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.479
 of breaking the stage of multiplication of autumn 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.459
 cashier 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.779
 but we hoped we have aspiring energy I see here none 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:40.859
 take into account the time factor 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:46.499
 so it was not possible to make a desperate reversal now half 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:51.909
 I took into account the time factor and I have the media in the contest 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.299
 present energy 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.090
 in each year 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.499
 therein because of an alimentary relation of an ecosystem 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.829
 therefore I have no possibility to reverse 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.309
 because we knew that the system putsch energy putsch it is to punish 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:07.459
 directional 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.900
 and it will decrease at each own level only 10% will be passed 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.099
 to the next current level 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.809
 then in this case for example 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:20.529
 if I take a certain type of producer 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.729
 I could observe has a certain amount 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.719
 certainly greater 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:27.689
 the ugt 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:33.029
 a year would serve to feed burned consumers if you kill 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:34.180
 an amount 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.090
 much smaller 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.320
 and in turn 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.550
 the consumer the secondary 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.550
 do not forget that normally within these relationships 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:49.210
 we observe stock the eight everton animals are of larger size 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.319
 and what they need to say of a quantity of children 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.160
 to be able to keep its people who are generally of smaller size what it does 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.740
 with which you have seen the mind is actress pimples 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.010
 wider 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.339
 It's good, people, good luck from the entrance exam. 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:08.099
 see you next time
