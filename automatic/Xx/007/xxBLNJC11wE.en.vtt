00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.360

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.990
 I have five if in the girl have passed and 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.869
 Speak like that, do not look, girl. 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.210
 I miss you and I'm finally here 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.490
 to record the last video of the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.830
 because whoever accompanies me here on the channel and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.590
 there blog knows that I was challenged 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.590
 by the company to do the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.559
 treatment for three months and show 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.860
 to you what happened every month and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.160
 this is our video were I think 5 or 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.960
 6 to 6 I showed step by step how everything 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.149
 happened to you and today is the day of 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.570
 reveal the results of telling 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.190
 You all I know how it was and I 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.649
 I already know that who is doing 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.770
 treatment at home I went out to 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.930
 confirm that the business ran 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.359
 first video that actually was not 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.460
 was not so official of the ranking to have 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.170
 plus it was the starting foot tip for everything there 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.760
 four months ago 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.670
 ie do four months when the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.830
 then three months and even taking medicine 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.390
 then four months ago I recorded a 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.360
 video with two friends 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.520
 mano and sÃ¢mia who accompanies the blog knows 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.310
 that I do thinking that they do not speak 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.130
 taking care of the hair but I start the radio 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.409
 We are here again on the beach. 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.689
 contribution you want everything - it's in the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.579
 lounge and in the video we've also talked 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.680
 about the care that people take 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.020
 needed to have a little this year because 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.390
 hair is detonated at this time and in this 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.299
 video as he talked about this problem and 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.740
 What happens after 20 days about 15 more 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.079
 or less I surprised myself with a 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.619
 package arriving in my house the product 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.280
 is this here is the high inter is the shampoo and 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.720
 one pill they sent me is 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.340
 tablets is equivalent to one 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.659
 three-month treatment , which is the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.289
 minimum treatment for 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.450
 5 the result so dem-pa in the face nÃ© 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.149
 and then I received those products I recorded 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.350
 a video saying jeff thanks to the internet 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.629
 the ru 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.890
 I received these products here and I feel 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.049
 challenged 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.060
 I threw the hashtag together for a hair 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.470
 Say is very passage way 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.269
 also entered is accompanying me at 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.360
 treatment and I started taking the 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.670
 and there in that video I spoke what were 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.069
 it was bad to smell him for my 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.900
 surprise despite being a type of 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.549
 treatment is a very good scent I 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.680
 I like it it is not a cleaning shampoo 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.140
 it is not a conventional shampoo it is a 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.060
 treatment shampoo so do not delude yourself 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.069
 that he will not get over foaming that he 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.860
 will not wipe the scalp he does not 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.950
 That's good for a couple of days later. 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.170
 I also invited him there again. 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.459
 to talk because that's how it is 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.799
 I did a video talking that I had 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.500
 received the product already placed in the group 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.349
 I've found the girls know 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.090
 solution then they used are using 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.170
 along with me too, and then I brought 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.060
 fair 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.250
 that three different opinions because 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.230
 are thinking that you have an idea 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.090
 best of how it really works 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.770
 now it's if I'm not mistaken it was blood 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.810
 who said that she felt a lot of difference in 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.670
 The area then does not have much but much more 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.010
 beautiful girls now raise 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.520
 they are short of the later account 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.660
 cut daycare at break of 15 days 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.700
 I was already feeling my nails 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.920
 different and mano also commented on 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.300
 fringe of her that was amazing young 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.160
 put this video before and 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.680
 after the first video was played 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.450
 was above the eye and in the second video 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.190
 that they recorded here with us already 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.560
 was under the eye in a month 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.420
 rafa remembers that she was refugee in 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.510
 letter of drug testing is already going 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.730
 well please put the young scene 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.370
 first video the shortest fringe was 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.650
 at home saw the move and it was not much 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.370
 thing to do when postponing vote 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.799
 test point 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.230
 I invited two people two 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.000
 specialists who know much more than 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.459
 Because I 'm obvious, I'm talking here to 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.980
 You guys, what I think happened. 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.410
 with me in each body reacts in a way 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.959
 so I realize I 'm going to call you two 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.750
 neutral people and not necessarily 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.769
 they are taking a medicine but you know how 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.630
 it works 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.519
 and then I invited Michel the same owner 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.919
 child lives natalie rodriquez of mine 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.609
 nutritionist and we talked about 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.340
 hair on the body at last on the nail 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.289
 the right choice of product causes 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.419
 you've done and the choice of 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.970
 the treatment you are going to do is 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.229
 Neo chemist is very important so 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.900
 that the professional has part of 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.479
 responsibility and the customer at home 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.830
 the inter-agency function was to 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.120
 inside out 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.280
 we even mentioned how important it is 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.680
 supplementation in this case is not my 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.840
 complement and cream and commented on the fact 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.780
 that's the one that you focus on feeding 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.010
 Healthy people are very easy food 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.900
 lost nutrients 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.729
 she commented that a plant when she 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.360
 fall of the foot she already started to lose 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.529
 nutrients 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.529
 obvious that it is extremely 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:00.939
 it is important that you focus on the 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:03.729
 healthy eating and take plenty of 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:06.459
 water and then walking a little bit more 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:11.589
 we went to the last video we recorded 

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:14.709
 what was invited to super special 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:17.199
 I interviewed kring that she works 

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:20.169
 inside will understand that it brings together all 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.939
 doubts that we had all that she 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.979
 answered all of us I have with the 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:29.919
 her audios here her balance has 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.839
 seizure type effects so you 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.579
 get seasick because she 's a reader 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:34.479
 commented on the blog that she was getting 

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:37.629
 of wheels 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:40.139
 they are so hard really hard sometimes 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:42.519
 some people who really are 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.399
 extremely sensitive to the ingestion of 

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:47.199
 any contributed costume she imagines 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:50.109
 who will feel some discomfort and 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.459
 I really felt that everything passed away. 

00:05:50.109 --> 00:05:53.889
 everything all everything same 

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:56.379
 whoever is here on the channel knows that I 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.539
 He was not under its also spoke on the blog 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:00.879
 I could also be in instagram 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.349
 I do not know if you can see there anymore. 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:05.139
 I 'll ask Robinho to put a 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:07.779
 photo some scene showing my streak 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.429
 it's been very big since it struck me 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:11.409
 I can not make arrays as big as it is 

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:13.119
 now that I told you guys 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.249
 beginning of the videos that I would not paint 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:17.139
 the market because I wanted people to 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:19.689
 accompany its growth at the root 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.759
 Because the tips are just like me 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:24.369
 I'm blonde, my hair is all 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:26.199
 these things are moving despite 

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:28.059
 be much stronger in the hair after 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.949
 render more and I found that my root 

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:32.019
 would be a medium thermometer for us 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:34.119
 So that's it, I'm going to ask the young lady. 

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:36.339
 I 've spoken so young here too 

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:38.139
 In this video, my god, an important person. 

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:41.919
 I'll talk in my ear when you hear it too. 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:43.539
 important and dear, but not talking 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:45.789
 seriously I will ask to put young here 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:48.039
 some photos before and after I 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:49.749
 I arrived at the instagram for you to see the 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:50.859
 difference in lack that you feel the 

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:52.160
 Dad is not 

00:06:50.859 --> 00:06:54.950
 Yeah 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.080
 this is it I hope that anyone who has taken 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.390
 will intervene with me that started 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.400
 with me makes sense also all 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.230
 difference that so I assure you 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.300
 that really works because I took and 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.970
 serginho I did the right treatment with 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.130
 shampoo and the pills and today I am 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:13.160
 here for you that the radius works 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:16.370
 a kiss until the next challenges and this 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.110
 was the first of many I hope not 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.110
 I'm going to stop drinking, I'm taking it. 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.060
 Any news and coming back to you. 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.320
 A super kiss until next time and thank you. 

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.520
 who also participated in the challenge 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.520
 races for hair
