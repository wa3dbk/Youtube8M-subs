00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
that I do if you think about what I just

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.010 
that I do if you think about what I just
told<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.570> abnormality<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
told you the abnormality is that the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.200 
told you the abnormality is that the
acne<00:00:52.410> scars<00:00:52.739> are<00:00:52.949> actually<00:00:53.399> lower<00:00:53.730> than<00:00:53.940> the

of<00:00:56.910> managing<00:00:57.390> acne<00:00:58.050> scarring<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.710> go<00:00:58.859> in

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
of managing acne scarring is to go in

of managing acne scarring is to go in
there<00:00:59.039> sand<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.090> down<00:01:00.120> laser<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.050> down<00:01:01.230> and

there sand it down laser it down and
what<00:01:01.620> they're<00:01:01.770> sanding<00:01:02.219> down<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.940> normal

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
what they're sanding down is the normal

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.410 
what they're sanding down is the normal
skin<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.500> reach<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.220> level<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.670> abnormality

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
skin to reach the level of abnormality

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.450 
skin to reach the level of abnormality
now<00:01:06.869> why<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.350> problem<00:01:07.650> well<00:01:07.950> number<00:01:08.250> one

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
little unusual for about three to seven

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.870 
little unusual for about three to seven
days<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.620> having<00:03:58.800> those<00:03:59.010> little<00:03:59.250> areas<00:03:59.490> turn

I've<00:07:20.100> done<00:07:20.310> hundreds<00:07:20.760> of<00:07:20.820> these<00:07:20.880> I<00:07:21.000> get<00:07:21.330> very

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:21.510 
I've done hundreds of these I get very

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.050 
I've done hundreds of these I get very
good<00:07:21.750> results<00:07:22.170> in<00:07:22.260> all<00:07:22.380> skin<00:07:22.650> types<00:07:22.920> and<00:07:23.490> also

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 
good results in all skin types and also

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.330 
good results in all skin types and also
the<00:07:24.270> silicone<00:07:24.750> to<00:07:24.960> let<00:07:25.320> you<00:07:25.440> know<00:07:25.620> you<00:07:26.160> also

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 
the silicone to let you know you also

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.810 
the silicone to let you know you also
see<00:07:26.850> a<00:07:27.210> wider<00:07:27.800> defect<00:07:28.800> and<00:07:29.040> you<00:07:29.160> can't<00:07:29.430> ask<00:07:29.640> the

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:29.820 
see a wider defect and you can't ask the

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.160 
see a wider defect and you can't ask the
treatment<00:07:30.210> that<00:07:30.240> otherwise<00:07:30.660> it<00:07:30.870> actually

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.170 
treatment that otherwise it actually

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.170 
treatment that otherwise it actually
gets<00:07:31.350> worse<00:07:31.650> little<00:07:32.460> treatments<00:07:32.880> that<00:07:33.000> gets

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
gets worse little treatments that gets

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.420 
gets worse little treatments that gets
better<00:07:33.420> bigger<00:07:33.870> treatments<00:07:34.350> worse<00:07:34.560> so<00:07:35.160> what<00:07:35.400> I

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.430 
better bigger treatments worse so what I

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.520 
better bigger treatments worse so what I
do<00:07:35.550> is<00:07:35.850> I<00:07:35.970> use<00:07:36.120> a<00:07:36.150> silicone<00:07:36.660> to<00:07:36.810> actually<00:07:37.230> raise

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:37.530 
do is I use a silicone to actually raise

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.280 
do is I use a silicone to actually raise
all<00:07:38.190> these<00:07:38.550> depressions<00:07:39.240> so<00:07:39.450> hopefully

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:40.290 
all these depressions so hopefully

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.250 
all these depressions so hopefully
