00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
a pick and roll with KD it's going to be

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.099 
a pick and roll with KD it's going to be

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
two options are roll and fade most of

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.230 
two options are roll and fade most of
the<00:00:19.470> time<00:00:19.710> you're<00:00:20.100> wanted<00:00:20.520> gonna<00:00:20.670> do<00:00:20.910> role

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the time you're wanted gonna do role

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.269 
the time you're wanted gonna do role
because<00:00:21.779> katie<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.380> gonna<00:00:22.619> end<00:00:22.800> up<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
because katie is gonna end up in the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.120 
because katie is gonna end up in the
mid-range<00:00:23.490> area<00:00:24.180> which<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.720> his<00:00:25.380> specialty<00:00:25.650> as

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
mid-range area which is his specialty as

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.670 
mid-range area which is his specialty as
well<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.640> think<00:00:27.150> he<00:00:27.449> has<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.570> 90<00:00:28.080> min<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.560> he's

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
well I think he has a 90 min so he's

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.710 
well I think he has a 90 min so he's
prepping<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.010> hit<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.250> most<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.640> time<00:00:29.720> and

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
prepping to hit it most of the time and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.630 
prepping to hit it most of the time and
you<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:31.019> also<00:00:31.140> try<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.470> make<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> lead<00:00:31.949> pass<00:00:32.189> but

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
you can also try to make a lead pass but

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.580 
you can also try to make a lead pass but
that's<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.000> little<00:00:33.090> risky<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.170> up<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.350> you

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
that's a little risky so it's up to you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.040 
that's a little risky so it's up to you
just<00:00:34.860> read<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.610> defense<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.300> make<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.719> right

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
just read the defense and make the right

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.490 
just read the defense and make the right
decision<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.950> also<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.610> pic<00:00:39.570> rub

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
decision but you can also do a pic rub

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.290 
decision but you can also do a pic rub
your<00:00:40.530> guy<00:00:40.739> off<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.950> pic<00:00:41.280> go<00:00:41.640> into<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> mid-range

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
your guy off the pic go into a mid-range

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.600 
your guy off the pic go into a mid-range
jumper<00:00:42.809> Russ<00:00:43.140> that's<00:00:43.649> his<00:00:43.890> specialty<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.430> well

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
jumper Russ that's his specialty as well

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.389 
jumper Russ that's his specialty as well
as<00:00:45.180> an<00:00:45.390> 87<00:00:46.200> or<00:00:46.320> 90<00:00:46.680> min<00:00:46.710> or<00:00:47.039> something<00:00:47.309> like

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
as an 87 or 90 min or something like

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.209 
as an 87 or 90 min or something like
that<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.120> next<00:00:48.149> way<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.870> use<00:00:49.649> him<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
that and the next way I use him is a

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.700 
that and the next way I use him is a
step<00:00:50.670> back<00:00:50.879> way<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.539> r2<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> right

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
step back way the r2 with the right

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.840 
step back way the r2 with the right
trigger<00:00:52.860> down<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.850> creates<00:00:54.180> crazy<00:00:54.629> space<00:00:55.050> and

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
trigger down it creates crazy space and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.520 
trigger down it creates crazy space and
he<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.090> pretty<00:00:57.360> much<00:00:57.570> automatic<00:00:58.379> for

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
he is pretty much automatic for

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.229 
he is pretty much automatic for
mid-range<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.309> mean<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.609> really<00:00:59.640> doesn't<00:01:00.090> miss

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
mid-range I mean it really doesn't miss

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.630 
mid-range I mean it really doesn't miss
it<00:01:00.270> also<00:01:00.960> you're<00:01:01.770> probably<00:01:02.039> hit<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.340> shot

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
it also you're probably hit the shot

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.429 
it also you're probably hit the shot
most<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> time<00:01:03.329> anyway<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.290> just

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
most of the time anyway and this is just

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.200 
most of the time anyway and this is just
a<00:01:04.530> way<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.710> break<00:01:04.979> down<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> Defense<00:01:05.400> now<00:01:05.970> they

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
a way to break down the Defense now they

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.929 
a way to break down the Defense now they
don't<00:01:06.390> bite<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.810> step<00:01:07.140> back<00:01:07.350> I'm<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:08.610> drive

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
don't bite on step back I'm just drive

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.850 
don't bite on step back I'm just drive
towards<00:01:09.479> them<00:01:09.630> try<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.900> attack<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.409> rim<00:01:10.590> they

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
towards them try to attack the rim they

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.370 
towards them try to attack the rim they
do<00:01:11.040> bite<00:01:11.250> same<00:01:11.670> thing<00:01:11.939> as<00:01:12.090> well<00:01:12.299> or<00:01:12.750> run<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> pick

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
do bite same thing as well or run a pick

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.010 
do bite same thing as well or run a pick
a<00:01:13.409> rolled<00:01:13.710> KD<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.430> bail<00:01:14.610> yourself<00:01:14.760> out<00:01:15.180> but

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
a rolled KD to bail yourself out but

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.420 
a rolled KD to bail yourself out but
he's<00:01:16.170> good<00:01:16.350> Robbie<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.680> hit<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> shot<00:01:17.130> most

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
he's good Robbie and hit the shot most

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.219 
he's good Robbie and hit the shot most
of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> time<00:01:17.790> anyway<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.780> next<00:01:19.080> way<00:01:19.200> is

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
of the time anyway the next way is

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.179 
of the time anyway the next way is
pretty<00:01:19.830> nice<00:01:20.070> um<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.030> an<00:01:21.509> r2<00:01:22.020> left<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.040> right

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
pretty nice um it's an r2 left to right

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.580 
pretty nice um it's an r2 left to right
crossover<00:01:23.759> than<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> spin<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.720> standing<00:01:25.259> spin

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
crossover than the spin a standing spin

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.920 
crossover than the spin a standing spin
right<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.310> creates<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.030> much<00:01:27.180> room<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
right it creates so much room you have a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780 
right it creates so much room you have a
driving<00:01:28.200> lane<00:01:28.530> as<00:01:28.680> well<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.159> also<00:01:29.400> change

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
driving lane as well you can also change

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.870 
driving lane as well you can also change
this<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> hop<00:01:30.479> step<00:01:30.750> Euro<00:01:31.740> step<00:01:32.070> or<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> spin

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
this to a hop step Euro step or a spin

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.630 
this to a hop step Euro step or a spin
layup<00:01:33.270> or<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> kick-out<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.200> well<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.799> there's

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
layup or a kick-out as well so there's

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.429 
layup or a kick-out as well so there's
so<00:01:36.000> many<00:01:36.119> options<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.229> make<00:01:37.409> sure

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
so many options with this so make sure

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.770 
so many options with this so make sure
just<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.520> read<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> defense<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.659> can

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
just to read the defense and you can

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.450 
just to read the defense and you can
also<00:01:39.900> break<00:01:40.140> traps<00:01:40.500> with<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:41.100> right

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
also break traps with it as well right

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.580 
also break traps with it as well right
there<00:01:41.700> broca<00:01:42.210> Plumlee<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.170> eric<00:01:43.380> bledsoe
