00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
cover the system in more detail but

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.260 
cover the system in more detail but
that's<00:04:15.160> basically<00:04:15.340> with<00:04:15.610> rumors<00:04:15.880> pointing<00:04:16.180> to

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
that's basically with rumors pointing to

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.880 
that's basically with rumors pointing to
and<00:04:16.360> they're<00:04:16.450> even<00:04:16.480> pointing<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.380> Microsoft

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
and they're even pointing to Microsoft

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.860 
and they're even pointing to Microsoft
doing<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.220> same<00:04:18.370> thing<00:04:18.700> doing<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.660> conference

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
doing the same thing doing a conference

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.560 
doing the same thing doing a conference
before<00:04:20.440> e3<00:04:20.799> then<00:04:21.370> doing<00:04:21.670> III<00:04:22.000> to<00:04:22.120> capitalize

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
before e3 then doing III to capitalize

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.300 
before e3 then doing III to capitalize
on<00:04:22.600> it<00:04:22.870> more<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.260> think<00:04:23.500> March<00:04:23.680> is<00:04:23.830> way<00:04:23.980> too<00:04:24.040> soon

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
on it more I think March is way too soon

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.590 
on it more I think March is way too soon
that<00:04:24.370> sounds<00:04:24.730> a<00:04:24.760> little<00:04:24.970> bit<00:04:25.030> too<00:04:25.270> ludicrous

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
that sounds a little bit too ludicrous

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.080 
that sounds a little bit too ludicrous
to<00:04:25.870> me<00:04:25.900> obviously<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:27.160> think<00:04:27.520> like<00:04:27.700> may<00:04:27.880> would

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
to me obviously I I think like may would

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.070 
to me obviously I I think like may would
probably<00:04:28.390> be<00:04:28.450> good<00:04:28.480> or<00:04:28.720> something<00:04:28.810> like<00:04:29.020> that

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
probably be good or something like that

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.750 
probably be good or something like that
but<00:04:29.650> like<00:04:29.710> basically<00:04:30.190> no<00:04:30.430> matter<00:04:30.580> what

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
but like basically no matter what

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.310 
but like basically no matter what
they're<00:04:30.940> saying<00:04:31.120> like<00:04:31.330> you<00:04:31.600> know<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:32.020> rumor

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
they're saying like you know the rumor

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.600 
they're saying like you know the rumor
would<00:04:32.470> be<00:04:32.620> that<00:04:32.830> they<00:04:33.100> would<00:04:33.250> announce<00:04:33.400> it

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
would be that they would announce it

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.310 
would be that they would announce it
before<00:04:33.880> e3<00:04:34.000> as<00:04:34.390> for<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.810> rumors<00:04:35.050> about<00:04:35.230> the

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320
