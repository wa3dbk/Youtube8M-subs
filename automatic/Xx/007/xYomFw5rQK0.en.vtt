00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
pockets of material in here that are

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.050 
pockets of material in here that are
just<00:02:27.950> not<00:02:30.099> not<00:02:31.099> blended<00:02:31.489> yet<00:02:31.640> I'm<00:02:31.790> gonna<00:02:31.879> have

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
just not not blended yet I'm gonna have

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:59.240 
just not not blended yet I'm gonna have
to<00:02:32.709> do<00:02:33.709> this

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.620 

may<00:03:00.250> have<00:03:00.370> taken<00:03:00.520> out<00:03:00.790> most<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.240> chunks

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
may have taken out most of the chunks

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.650 
may have taken out most of the chunks
one<00:03:02.470> more<00:03:05.520> pulse<00:03:06.520> on<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:07.060> just<00:03:07.330> so<00:03:07.360> we<00:03:07.540> get

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
one more pulse on that just so we get

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.750 
one more pulse on that just so we get
out<00:03:07.920> anything<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.040> might<00:03:09.190> have<00:03:09.280> decided<00:03:09.520> to

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
out anything that might have decided to

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.340 
out anything that might have decided to
float<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.240> past<00:03:10.450> few<00:03:10.660> seconds<00:03:11.080> after<00:03:11.320> I

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
float in the past few seconds after I

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.280 
float in the past few seconds after I
stopped<00:03:11.620> blending<00:03:12.040> take<00:03:12.880> off<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.390> lids<00:03:13.690> and

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
stopped blending take off the lids and

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.740 
stopped blending take off the lids and
we'll<00:03:14.560> do<00:03:14.740> that<00:03:14.920> pour<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:16.060> all-important
