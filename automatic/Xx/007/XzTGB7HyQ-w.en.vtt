00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:16.249 
means it actually works off of solar

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:20.109 
means it actually works off of solar
power<00:01:16.579> so<00:01:17.569> it's<00:01:18.259> got<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:18.829> good<00:01:19.130> battery<00:01:19.549> life<00:01:19.579> if

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
power so it's got a good battery life if

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.389 
power so it's got a good battery life if
it's<00:01:20.389> not<00:01:20.450> exposed<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.079> light<00:01:21.319> but<00:01:22.039> if<00:01:22.159> you

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
it's not exposed to light but if you

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.580 
it's not exposed to light but if you
expose<00:01:22.909> it<00:01:22.939> to<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.600> light<00:01:23.810> it<00:01:23.990> actually<00:01:24.079> tops

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
expose it to to light it actually tops

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.639 
expose it to to light it actually tops
