 for the nervous system in general 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.180
 ingredients we will need 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.020
 2 carrots 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.710
 oil well because it is a seed 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.710
 of sesame 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.610
 soybean oil 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:17.280
 very recurrent 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:20.620
 and of course we also go to the huaca 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.990
 we have to incorporate the algae to this 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.250
 diet the algae and they are full of 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.250
 benefits for the organism 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.769

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.739
 group and specifically have high doses 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.420
 Vitamin B12 Vitamin B12 is 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.550
 necessary to keep blood in 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.530
 three hundred conditions well then 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.709
 we started with the recipe everything always 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.849
 super simple super fast what are we going 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:53.620
 to make is the onion we are going to start 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:56.230
 with the oil that we are going to use is the 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.030
 of linen in this case but we're also going 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.170
 to go down to make those 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.079
 suffering from the onion we will use 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.250
 the flax oil and that one's 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:12.630
 retains the properties better if 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.630
 We consume raw as in the pan 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.120
 we are starting the carrots too 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.770
 in squares or those that decide 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.660
 start this kind of that late nothing you 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.810
 you will find not with many people that you 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.100
 say that it is a barbarity that as 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.040
 you are going to have deficiencies 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.490
 to see when the rest of the people eat 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.490
 of everything 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.580
 it is thought that there is no lack because 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.819
 as he eats of all those who follow this 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.310
 diet as we are precisely concerned 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.950
 have deficiencies we are very interested 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.050
 much of what we eat from the 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.870
 properties that live to the food of 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.870
 how to serve how to compensate 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.840
 sure we have a 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.740
 the food that those who are supposed 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.850
 that with that 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.850
 added the carrot 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.519
 ah 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.140
 the wakame seaweed 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.010
 many types of standard this type of algae 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.010
 we can find it a honey 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.920
 many because they are preserved 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.389
 and water 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.740
 a cup and a half of water as you know 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.640
 Water 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.640
 Marine 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.689
 and we're going to pour the paprika 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.719
 together with the trickle of the sauce 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:43.719
 soy 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.960
 we leave 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.160
 we turn off the fire of the video 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.260
 well if we see what 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.390
 that is too thick for your 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.470
 taste when it happens 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.600
 we add a little more water 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:10.250
 you know that I like soups rather 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.130
 thick things but it's not a matter of 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.230
 add more water when watching how it goes 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.920
 reducing and if it seems too much two 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.920
 small leaves 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:25.690
 the sun, well, we've had the

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:32.050
 serve we are going to take it pending that 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.949
 we lack the oil 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.949
 let's take a spray 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.230
 to 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:14.910
 an abundant trickle that we want 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.910
 finish it also a small seed of wine 

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:23.639
 we want to give a touch of decoration and 

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:23.639
 of flavor we take a little 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:38.390
 a half that madrid because I hope that you 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:41.390
