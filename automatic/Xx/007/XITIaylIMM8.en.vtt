00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
okay so the question winter whoa wait

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.960 
okay so the question winter whoa wait
number<00:00:04.290> 18<00:00:05.279> chromium<00:00:07.130> so4<00:00:08.130> that's<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.490> sulfate

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
number 18 chromium so4 that's a sulfate

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:24.830 
number 18 chromium so4 that's a sulfate
and<00:00:12.410> h35<00:00:14.120> close<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.330> brackets<00:00:17.449> CL<00:00:19.369> okay

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.990 

finding<00:00:25.840> the<00:00:25.929> oxidation<00:00:26.410> state<00:00:26.829> it's<00:00:27.429> always

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
finding the oxidation state it's always

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.390 
finding the oxidation state it's always
you'll<00:00:28.239> see<00:00:28.539> when<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:29.470> oxidation<00:00:30.009> states<00:00:30.250> I

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
you'll see when the oxidation states I

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.700 
you'll see when the oxidation states I
got<00:00:30.550> an<00:00:30.640> easy<00:00:30.880> one<00:00:31.000> medium<00:00:31.750> and<00:00:31.930> a<00:00:31.989> hard<00:00:32.199> this

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
got an easy one medium and a hard this

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.200 
got an easy one medium and a hard this
is<00:00:32.769> the<00:00:32.920> hard<00:00:33.250> one<00:00:33.460> they<00:00:33.670> always<00:00:34.030> look<00:00:34.180> like

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
is the hard one they always look like

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.380 
is the hard one they always look like
this<00:00:34.570> when<00:00:34.780> they're<00:00:34.899> hard<00:00:35.970> once<00:00:36.970> you<00:00:37.090> get<00:00:37.239> the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
this when they're hard once you get the

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.079 
this when they're hard once you get the
idea<00:00:37.719> you'll<00:00:37.930> find<00:00:38.199> it's<00:00:38.440> fairly<00:00:38.800> easy<00:00:39.089> okay

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
idea you'll find it's fairly easy okay

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:46.560 
idea you'll find it's fairly easy okay
oh<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:45.010> is<00:00:45.159> chromium<00:00:45.760> and<00:00:46.059> then<00:00:46.390> in

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
oh this is chromium and then in

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.960 
oh this is chromium and then in
parentheses<00:00:47.230> a<00:00:47.440> sulfate<00:00:47.970> parenthesis

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
parentheses a sulfate parenthesis

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.140 
chlorine
okay<00:00:55.900> so<00:00:56.500> what<00:00:57.010> you<00:00:57.100> do<00:00:57.220> here<00:00:57.250> is<00:00:57.729> take<00:00:57.970> it

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
okay so what you do here is take it

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.460 
okay so what you do here is take it
apart<00:00:58.420> piece<00:00:58.720> by<00:00:58.750> piece

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
apart piece by piece

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.320 
apart piece by piece
so<00:00:59.589> I<00:00:59.619> recommend<00:01:00.070> look<00:01:00.699> at<00:01:00.850> what's<00:01:01.089> outside

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
so I recommend look at what's outside

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.240 
so I recommend look at what's outside
the<00:01:01.659> brackets<00:01:02.049> first<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.799> then<00:01:03.009> move<00:01:03.220> your

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
the brackets first and then move your

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.330 
the brackets first and then move your
way<00:01:03.519> inside<00:01:04.030> parenthesis<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.710> outside<00:01:06.280> the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
way inside parenthesis so outside the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.490 
way inside parenthesis so outside the
brackets<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:07.210> here<00:01:07.750> we<00:01:07.900> want<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.229> know<00:01:08.350> about

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
brackets and here we want to know about

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.289 
brackets and here we want to know about
chrome<00:01:08.950> that's<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.610> one<00:01:09.759> we<00:01:09.909> want<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.150> find

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
chrome that's the one we want to find

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.380 
chrome that's the one we want to find
the<00:01:10.390> charge<00:01:10.630> Oh<00:01:11.130> what's<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.490> typical<00:01:12.970> charge

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
the charge Oh what's the typical charge

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.749 
the charge Oh what's the typical charge
of<00:01:13.810> chlorine<00:01:15.479> minus<00:01:16.479> one<00:01:16.869> okay<00:01:17.560> yeah<00:01:17.950> minus

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
of chlorine minus one okay yeah minus

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.700 
of chlorine minus one okay yeah minus
one<00:01:19.000> so<00:01:19.240> that<00:01:19.420> means<00:01:19.750> all<00:01:20.140> that<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.619> be

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
one so that means all that for it to be

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.469 
one so that means all that for it to be
balanced<00:01:24.189> it<00:01:24.310> had<00:01:24.610> just<00:01:24.909> like<00:01:25.030> sodium

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
balanced it had just like sodium

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.480 
balanced it had just like sodium
chloride

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
chloride

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.840 
chloride
okay<00:01:27.490> now<00:01:29.009> sulfate<00:01:30.009> what's<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.399> charge<00:01:30.609> on

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
okay now sulfate what's the charge on

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.289 
okay now sulfate what's the charge on
sulfate<00:01:31.890> yeah<00:01:32.890> I'll<00:01:33.219> just<00:01:33.280> write<00:01:33.640> minus<00:01:33.880> two

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
sulfate yeah I'll just write minus two

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:35.730 
sulfate yeah I'll just write minus two
what's<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.960> charge

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
what's the charge

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:45.210 
what's the charge
of<00:01:35.939> nh3<00:01:37.710> overall<00:01:38.710> charge

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.200 

for<00:01:45.880> ammonia<00:01:47.760> yeah

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
for ammonia yeah

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.260 
for ammonia yeah
just<00:01:49.600> like<00:01:49.720> water<00:01:49.990> zero<00:01:50.620> is<00:01:50.860> that<00:01:50.950> okay<00:01:51.190> if<00:01:51.520> you

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
just like water zero is that okay if you

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.000 
just like water zero is that okay if you
don't<00:01:52.390> didn't<00:01:52.870> know<00:01:52.930> that<00:01:53.080> before<00:01:53.260> know<00:01:53.800> that

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
don't didn't know that before know that

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.110 
don't didn't know that before know that
ammonia<00:01:54.340> has<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:54.820> zero<00:01:55.180> charge<00:01:56.430> okay<00:01:57.430> so<00:01:57.970> that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
ammonia has a zero charge okay so that

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.050 
ammonia has a zero charge okay so that
means<00:01:58.450> I<00:01:58.980> have<00:01:59.980> a<00:02:00.010> lot<00:02:00.400> less<00:02:00.640> than<00:02:00.850> what<00:02:01.030> I

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
means I have a lot less than what I

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.030 
means I have a lot less than what I
started<00:02:01.450> with<00:02:01.980> chromium<00:02:02.980> and<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:05.110> minus<00:02:05.800> two

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
started with chromium and then minus two

yeah in order to you're like would it be
to<00:03:04.430> 2x<00:03:06.080> okay<00:03:07.080> what<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:08.010> was<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.370> program

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
to 2x okay what it was a program

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.160 
to 2x okay what it was a program
attitude<00:03:09.360> here<00:03:09.630> yeah<00:03:09.960> then<00:03:11.750> then<00:03:12.750> you'd<00:03:13.020> have

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
attitude here yeah then then you'd have

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.510 
attitude here yeah then then you'd have
to<00:03:13.230> divide<00:03:13.680> by<00:03:13.980> two

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
to divide by two

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.960 
to divide by two
it'd<00:03:14.580> be<00:03:14.880> two<00:03:15.750> chromium's<00:03:16.610> but<00:03:17.610> that

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
it'd be two chromium's but that

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.820 
it'd be two chromium's but that
unfortunate<00:03:18.600> would<00:03:18.750> give<00:03:18.930> us<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.200> fractional

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
unfortunate would give us a fractional

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.949 
unfortunate would give us a fractional
charge<00:03:20.190> which<00:03:20.940> were<00:03:21.090> not<00:03:21.270> too<00:03:21.570> happy<00:03:21.750> about

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
charge which were not too happy about

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.280 
charge which were not too happy about
but<00:03:22.740> yes<00:03:23.010> if<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.459> was<00:03:23.610> two<00:03:24.530> is<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.680> okay<00:03:25.860> yeah
