00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
today I've got a really cool new tool to

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.259 
today I've got a really cool new tool to
show<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.110> it's<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.530> WORX<00:00:10.769> SD<00:00:11.040> semi<00:00:11.730> automatic

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
driver and you're ready to go again to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.980 
driver and you're ready to go again to
change<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.939> different<00:01:17.970> screw<00:01:18.540> driving<00:01:18.869> bit

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
change to a different screw driving bit

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.710 
change to a different screw driving bit
you<00:01:19.229> just<00:01:19.259> open<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.950> magazine<00:01:20.100> cover<00:01:20.720> rotate

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
you just open the magazine cover rotate

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.630 
you just open the magazine cover rotate
to<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.140> particular<00:01:22.740> screw<00:01:23.100> driving<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.490> you

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
to the particular screw driving that you

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.700 
to the particular screw driving that you
want<00:01:23.880> close<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.080> you're<00:01:25.259> ready<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.590> use

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
want close it and you're ready for use

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.710 
want close it and you're ready for use
again<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.670> really<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.000> cool<00:01:27.240> about<00:01:27.420> this

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
again so it really is cool about this

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.140 
again so it really is cool about this
tool<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:29.310> fact<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.759> don't<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.060> to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
tool is the fact that you don't have to

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.219 
tool is the fact that you don't have to
go<00:01:30.270> hunting<00:01:30.689> around<00:01:30.950> your<00:01:31.950> toolbox<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:33.229> tool
