00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.660
 hello now get another edition of sn 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.460
 TV 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.639
 We are only a few days from Christmas 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.529
 this date is coming quickly and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.720
 whenever Christmas arrives on the 25th of 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.850
 December returns to that polemic right 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.010
 but it was really that day that 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.480
 jesus was born to talk a little 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.029
 on this topic we are going to interview 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.670
 Now the pastor and doctor rinaldo siqueira 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.430
 he is the rector of the salt seminar 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.320
 Latin American Adventist theology 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.710
 but the kingdom is a pleasure to talk to the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.559
 You are pastor what is the actual date of 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.530
 birth of jesus ro 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.690
 reality no one knows we do not know 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.270
 I believe God even let it go. 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.329
 unknown purpose for which the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.149
 It's not me, people. 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.210
 something beyond what should be is not 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.539
 we have so much original focus for 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.949
 secondary things on the date of 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.619
 Birth of Jesus is secondary 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.490
 the main thing is that he was born he came 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:14.490
 has become one with us and therefore we know 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:17.970
 what day 25 is not is is because at the time there 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.240
 in the region of Israel in Judea and today 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.060
 we are in the middle of winter cold rain 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.659
 and does not match the description of the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.790
 shepherds in the field with their flocks 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.710
 What does not happen at this time of year? 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.860
 then knowing that it was not at this time 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.259
 but the important thing now is instead of focusing 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.619
 not simply human the date focus on 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.600
 event the main christ jesus 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.340
 but we must then take advantage of 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.710
 any way this moment is not that 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.350
 Is everyone thinking of Jesus in the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.820
 birth of a savior to celebrate 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.740
 somehow this is not 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.290
 there are some times of the year when 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.880
 people are more susceptible 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.829
 to think of god of one of them 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.840
 main I think maybe now 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.119
 Christmas season people gather in 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.270
 family there is a certain spirit of 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.670
 goodness and openness to God who 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.349
 happens at that time as it happens 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.780
 It would be good to take advantage of this moment. 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.050
 and so bring people waiting for 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.020
 what 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.300
 Closer to God and as a pastor to people. 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.550
 could then take advantage of this 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.800
 openness of people with regard to jesus 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.420
 to celebrate Christmas in that way 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.280
 We should celebrate Christmas. 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.340
 I think so family is important 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.990
 for us when the children focus 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.360
 in the event the birth of Jesus what 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.750
 this represents for the salvation of being 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.030
 and then with the people who are 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.040
 around who are awake like this 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.230
 insensitive also called for 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.960
 to know more about jesus who is the event 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.270
 the history of the salvation of the 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.220
 humanity and also for the needy 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.320
 I think this is another date is not 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.170
 very important in this campaign as 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.210
 take away from christmas more more bring tender 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.650
 of the beasts that God gave us to extend 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.480
 for those who do not have so many times 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.450
 like us and I think it would be something that 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.920
 really very conducive to this time 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.260
 Who would you brigade pastor behave for? 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.720
 interview team time christmas to you 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.850
 Celebrate and celebrate better orient here 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.030
 to family members remembering that the 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.310
 focus is jesus the focus is the people now 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.130
 around us needing to know 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.170
 This Savior also helps to work 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.610
 with a missionary service is not pastor 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.400
 through campaigns that the church 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.989
 It provides for that this time too 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.850
 propitious for everything for all this 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.570
 A good Christmas to you. 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.570
 until the next edition
