00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
great tune they did a great job they

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.680 
great tune they did a great job they
didn't<00:00:46.309> need<00:00:46.460> flat<00:00:46.820> by<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.120> way<00:00:47.299> I'm<00:00:47.420> shooting

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
didn't need flat by the way I'm shooting

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.289 
didn't need flat by the way I'm shooting
to<00:00:47.780> east<00:00:47.989> standard<00:00:48.500> I<00:00:48.680> know<00:00:49.250> it's<00:00:49.610> pretty<00:00:50.000> hard

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:50.299 
to east standard I know it's pretty hard

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:52.030 
to east standard I know it's pretty hard
to<00:00:50.479> sing<00:00:50.750> it<00:00:50.869> even<00:00:51.170> less<00:00:51.290> you<00:00:51.409> got<00:00:51.559> a<00:00:51.589> really

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
to sing it even less you got a really

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.350 
to sing it even less you got a really
high<00:00:52.280> voice<00:00:52.519> so<00:00:52.699> I<00:00:52.760> think<00:00:52.820> they<00:00:53.180> probably

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
high voice so I think they probably

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.600 
high voice so I think they probably
tuned<00:00:53.809> it<00:00:53.930> down<00:00:54.170> because<00:00:54.799> it<00:00:55.070> was<00:00:55.159> a<00:00:55.190> little<00:00:55.460> on

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
tuned it down because it was a little on

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.280 
tuned it down because it was a little on
the<00:00:55.699> high<00:00:55.850> side<00:00:55.879> for<00:00:56.420> him<00:00:56.540> the<00:00:56.930> original

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
the high side for him the original

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.259 
the high side for him the original
version<00:00:57.619> was<00:00:57.739> done<00:00:58.040> by<00:00:58.250> a<00:00:58.280> younger<00:00:58.729> voice<00:00:58.909> and

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
version was done by a younger voice and

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.539 
version was done by a younger voice and
he<00:00:59.750> did<00:00:59.900> have<00:01:00.080> a<00:01:00.110> very<00:01:00.589> high<00:01:00.860> voice<00:01:01.040> so<00:01:01.430> they

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
he did have a very high voice so they

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:04.660 
he did have a very high voice so they
tuned<00:01:02.119> it<00:01:02.239> down<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.420> half<00:01:02.720> step<00:01:03.400> for<00:01:04.400> more<00:01:04.580> on

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
tuned it down a half step for more on

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.890 
tuned it down a half step for more on
