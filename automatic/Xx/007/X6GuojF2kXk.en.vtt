00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Well the game is over I do not know if it's going to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.540
 have anger are hot those 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.110
 Brazilian players there are those from 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.349
 banking I think yes to see swipes there 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.010
 aggressive with his league is good wine already 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.939
 here it seems that they reach an agreement 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.300
 they are reassuring the waters and it is well 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.609
 Failure to a certain extent of Lohan 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.830
 they already try to pull so if you have to pull 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.810
 the Colombians would be the shirt of 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.780
 cow beach tie 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.780
 this is with albert surely and is 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.640
 well david wyss removing the player there 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.800
 that you have to create they won the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.870
 party we arrived we won the match 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.980
 gentlemen not good they destroyed the 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:52.579
 cow shirt is furious 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.940
 there is the party going to murillo 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.160
 look for neymar already tells him they are already thrown 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.100
 a headbutt that will not come and pushes 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.530
 neymar and that's where the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.290
 milestones that he puts 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.690
 some Brazilian player there to make that 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.440
 there is still the good ball there 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.440
 is the milestone 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.700
 Well, what a pity that the match ends 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.899
 thus 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.090
 warm at the end they cooled down and 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.240
 it seems that there will be nothing but 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.060
 to chase cattle colombia in a very 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.159
 meritorious in the passing of all the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.039
 balance party in being does not end 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.750
 being a better team than brazil does not give you 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.110
 the impression that goes here to make fun 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.170
 of me but it's also very bad I like it 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.520
 the drug and a certain cow imagine is not 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.219
 for me you kill for neymar 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.280
 there is good there is the red 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.799
 to win is and here is going to be for 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.170
 low is also incredible been that the 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.760
 you look at the referee was the one who 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.970
 finally the one that gives the push 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.440
 Neymar is Carlos Bacca and there they are going to 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.660
 Listen now let's see who they 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.280
 to this macabre task is embracing I know 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.220
 that there is even the red card for 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.500
 vary the state almost already what it has 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.750
 what to do the Colombian player is to leave 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.420
 to the bank man they have already won the 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.600
 party were expelled and go to 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.000
 stay in the neymar and cow cell because 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.150
 because they started to give air to all 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.740
 at the end of the match and the referee in 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.130
 front of the television and enriched everything 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.130
 the world now
