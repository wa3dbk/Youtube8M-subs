00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.379
 and 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.420
 meteorite or off of very good girls very 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.969
 good guys are try how are you 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.189
 I hope you are all very well 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.890
 today I tell you a story that rather 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.020
 that a news is a video and that it has 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.340
 engraved a meteorite in quotes in 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.599
 Mexico 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.750
 it was at 19 0 85 in 58 seconds of this 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.330
 Thursday and the celestial body is appreciated in 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.370
 the upper left of the image 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.000
 captured by the project's camera 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.949
 observation of webcams from mexico to 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.049
 mid -January a large 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.180
 commotion in the city of saltillo al 

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:47.360
 north of mexico when the tower of 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.369
 control of the local airport plan 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.110
 guadalupe also reported that there is a 

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:55.100
 meteorite around 7 o'clock in the 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.949
 tomorrow - local time-- say that after the 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.559
 event such hours later it 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.100
 has suspended the search and discarded 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.220
 that it was a meteorite since it does not 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.560
 no trace was found 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.440
 it is clearly seen in the link that you have 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.150
 in the description 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.010
 I have not posted the video by copyright 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.320
 because it's from the web page of camps 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.320
 mexico then a spare you have the 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.620
 image but the description you have the 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:30.120
 the video when a meteor goes through 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:33.030
 the layers of our atmosphere does like 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.880
 a kind of tour left us a trail 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.430
 like airplanes when they fly that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.650
 they left a queue rare 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.710
 like smoke good because exactly 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.380
 we make a thing very similar to a 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.490
 meteorite pieces that are going 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.310
 they are disintegrating so they go 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.250
 detaching from the same rock that is 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.590
 a way of being able to see that a 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.810
 meteorite and also a meteorite that 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.500
 can see with the naked eye so it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.580
 can say that that object was from a 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.960
 considerable size that's why you can see 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.830
 when it is a meteorite more 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.930
 small no 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.470
 is not appreciated much and therefore the 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.350
 trace is minor here the question is is 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.300
 the trace that cosmic trail that does not leave 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.510
 the trace of meteorites 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.710
 rockfall that is not there in the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:34.880
 air here is where speculation comes in 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.760
 UFO leaves no trace you do not see where it has 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.640
 fallen there are no fragments no trace of 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.600
 nothing in the air the search is suspended 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.800
 and the researchers themselves confirm 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.780
 that that has not been a meteor like that 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.400
 how good you already tell me what it is and 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.970
 do not tell me what is the ball of sergio 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.920
 because I do not strain anymore so nothing 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.050
 guys, I hope you've been interested 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.180
 news a little kiss to all and see you 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.660
 now again more of this channel up 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.660
 the next
