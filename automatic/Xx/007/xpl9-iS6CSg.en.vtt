Hello people of Malabarize-se

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.303
I am Luix Ã‰quixx of the video "there's not always sun in Rio"

00:00:05.303 --> 00:00:08.281
And now I'm going to teach you how to spin a ball on your finger

00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:16.069
Spinning - How to spin a ball on your finger

00:00:16.069 --> 00:00:18.203
Well, let's start with the ball

00:00:18.203 --> 00:00:20.807
You can spin any kind of ball

00:00:21.028 --> 00:00:22.741
It can be a soccer ball

00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:25.334
a basketball, or a mini-basketball

00:00:25.334 --> 00:00:27.468
a 100mm contact juggling ball

00:00:27.468 --> 00:00:29.558
any ball works

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:33.740
I like ir more or less withered which gives a good ...

00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:35.914
grip for you to hold it.

00:00:35.914 --> 00:00:37.236
to hold the ball

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:43.099
You'll hold it as tight you can

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:46.439
making this vacuum here

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:49.390
this vacuum is important for the moment you'll close your hand and release the ball

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.519
the spin of the ball happens with hand wide open when it closes

00:00:54.724 --> 00:00:58.284
once it is closed it remains closed

00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:06.110
height varies, you can release it on the height of your arm to a height slightly above your head

00:01:06.313 --> 00:01:09.581
you choose the one that feels most comfortable

00:01:09.888 --> 00:01:14.913
a important point of the throw is to focus the center of the ball

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.872
the shaft which is formed when the balls is rotating

00:01:18.153 --> 00:01:22.966
once you've trained spinning the ball at the correct height

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:28.948
you'll start practicing catching it with open hand, bringing it in a line

00:01:33.224 --> 00:01:39.281
this exercise works both to fix the height and stability of the ball

00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:45.786
once you have practiced enough the reception with open hand you're ready to spin directly on the finger

00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:52.545
the moment you close your hand your fingers make a pressure on the index finger to have more stability on the base

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.563
in the beginning it's not easy to keep the ball stabilized

00:01:55.563 --> 00:02:01.882
make small movements to stabilize the ball until you feel it's balanced

00:02:01.882 --> 00:02:07.139
after learning how to balance the ball, without having to correct it

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:12.480
you will begin to give little slaps on the ball

00:02:15.098 --> 00:02:20.883
with practice, the slaps will increase the intensity and speed

00:02:20.883 --> 00:02:24.376
well great people, I hope you have learned to spin a ball on your finger
