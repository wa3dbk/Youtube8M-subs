00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.540
chicken breast

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.470
We will also go

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.090
chopping into pieces

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.750

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.530
mass croquettes

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.700
so first we will put

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.770
heating oil and gilded onion

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.960

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.900
and we will go as stun three
four minutes

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.010
stir

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.260
add the
flour

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.820
much as about 3 tablespoons

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.940
60 grams

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.280

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.280
for flour

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.620
cook

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.280
Once cooked flour and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.600
we put the milk , half a liter

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.900
and you touch and remove and remove

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.960
until we see that they get a
very thick mass

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.830
remove from heat mass

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.340
and we add a tablespoon of butter

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.700
and also two eggs beaten

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.169
have retired but still
hot

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.669
so now we will remove

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.629
and so we get

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.909
that goal in egg mass

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:20.329
we leave it to cool for at least
half an hour or more if it could be

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.479
more more

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.469
the cold mass

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:27.779
We will be forming patties , we take two tablespoons

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.879

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:36.879

flour

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.959
once breadcrumbs

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.779

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:48.599

breadcrumbs to make a layer

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.589
