customized<00:03:07.840> settings<00:03:08.110> will<00:03:08.470> be<00:03:08.590> like<00:03:08.830> for

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
customized settings will be like for

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.520 
customized settings will be like for
instance<00:03:09.520> except<00:03:10.420> your<00:03:10.600> filter<00:03:10.959> mask<00:03:11.200> and

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
instance except your filter mask and

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.290 
instance except your filter mask and
filter<00:03:11.830> masking<00:03:12.280> basically<00:03:12.760> allows<00:03:13.000> you<00:03:13.150> to

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
filter masking basically allows you to

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.540 
filter masking basically allows you to
set<00:03:13.540> up<00:03:13.570> different<00:03:14.170> area<00:03:14.530> that's<00:03:15.190> going<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.430> be

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
set up different area that's going to be

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.850 
set up different area that's going to be
designed<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.390> find<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.900> through<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.410> eye<00:03:17.440> area

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
designed to find it through the eye area

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.710 
designed to find it through the eye area
that's<00:03:18.310> where<00:03:18.670> motion<00:03:19.150> is<00:03:19.239> going<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.480> occur

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
that's where motion is going to occur

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.660 
that's where motion is going to occur
and<00:03:19.989> it's<00:03:20.380> going<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.530> trigger<00:03:20.800> unit<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.310> record

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
and it's going to trigger unit to record

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.570 
and it's going to trigger unit to record
and<00:03:21.910> then<00:03:22.270> of<00:03:22.420> course<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:22.750> can<00:03:23.310> mask<00:03:24.310> off

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
and then of course you can mask off

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.220 
and then of course you can mask off
those<00:03:24.910> particular<00:03:25.360> other<00:03:25.480> areas<00:03:26.020> where

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
can separate that from triggering motion

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.790 
can separate that from triggering motion
so<00:03:55.180> get<00:03:55.390> this<00:03:55.570> particular<00:03:56.020> session<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.650> guys
