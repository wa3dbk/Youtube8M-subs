00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.140
 Hello everyone, I am Kimura U. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.720
 I am the fashion designer who likes pink in the universe. 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.400
 Today I am trying to use the bright mascara 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.460
 Start with the makeup 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.160
 First use the powder 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.600
 Then the eye shadow 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.540
 This time I am going to use this purple eye shadow. 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:04.140
 Try mixing different kinds of purple to bring out the most natural feeling 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.800
 Apply a dark color near the outline of the eye to create a gradient effect 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.260
 Next is this gelatinous eye shadow 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:27.260
 Do not apply directly to the eyes and apply it on the back of the hand. 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.920
 The skin around the eyes is very thin. Do not apply too much lightly. 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:53.560
 Apply a layer of dark eye shadow to the upper eyelid to make the eyes look bigger. 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.680
 Ok, I want to use red mascara. 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.740
 Apply like this 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.920
 The lower eyelashes are much shorter than the upper eyelashes, so they are painted vertically. 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.440
 I use this pearlescent eyeliner to draw a shiny eyeliner. 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.160
 Paint along the contours of the double eyelids 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:46.160
 The tail of the eye draws up slightly like a cat's eye 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.100
 The lower eyeliner is also painted like this 

00:02:53.926 --> 00:03:01.466
 The lower eyeliner does not need to be painted a little thicker like the upper eyeliner. 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.860
 Then the eye corners are also painted some 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.860
 Shiny 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.660
 Ok, the eye makeup is finished. 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:31.780
 Blush with this three pink 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.140
 Apply from both sides to the sides 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.040
 Normally, this time is higher in this position. 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.820
 It’s a bit like a sunburn. It’s also painted on the bridge of the nose. 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.235
 Next is the lipstick 

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.150
 This is bright pink 

00:04:11.775 --> 00:04:13.775
 Then apply a pink lip gloss on top 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:26.720
 You can apply your lips when you apply it. It doesn't matter if you feel your mouth closer to the nose. It looks so cute. 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.820
 Eyebrows are also painted 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.820
 This time I used gold. 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.860
 Apply a little bit just like when you apply mascara 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.780
 Then use this pink eyebrow pencil to draw the eyebrows. Actually, this eyebrow pencil is specially used for role playing. 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:59.860
 This color is very heavy so draw gently when painting 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.520
 Gently spread evenly with a cotton swab 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:24.700
 Then use this eyebrow powder and the blush to draw the shadow of the eyebrows. 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:43.260
 Painting this place from the tip of the eyebrow is also a little bit along the outline as before. 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:55.580
 The next one used is actually a nail sticker. I want to stick it to my face. 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.580
 Finally, give the hair a simple shape. 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:15.500
 Combing them with wooden combs and tie them up to make the shape of two dice 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:31.140
 After being tied up, roll it up a little and roll it down. 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:45.920
 Today's fashion highlight is pink, this is my favorite color. 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.580
 Then make-up dresses and shoes also choose pink 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:57.740
 Then the pattern on the clothes is actually my candy cake mille-feuilles 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:12.320
 This is the feeling of the candy in the cake. It’s very sweet. The pattern on both the pantyhose and the top is this pattern. 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:19.920
 Ok, my pink color makeup is done. 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.060
 Do you like it 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.960
 In fact, I am also challenging this color eyeshadow for the first time today. 

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.720
 The eyes become bright and beautiful, so happy. 

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.440
 Everyone is also challenging.
