keep<00:02:16.800> going<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.489> as<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.909> can<00:02:18.030> see<00:02:18.090> it's<00:02:18.840> that

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
keep going and as you can see it's that

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.009 
keep going and as you can see it's that
was<00:02:19.409> a<00:02:19.440> six<00:02:19.769> replicas<00:02:20.360> multiplier<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.840> was<00:02:21.989> a

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
was a six replicas multiplier that was a

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.770 
was a six replicas multiplier that was a
seven<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.739> here<00:02:23.220> comes<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.730> eight<00:02:23.849> so<00:02:24.599> it's

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
seven and here comes the eight so it's

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.660 
seven and here comes the eight so it's
an<00:02:24.870> eight<00:02:24.989> multiplier

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
an eight multiplier

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.030 
an eight multiplier
a<00:02:26.760> tremor<00:02:27.540> passes<00:02:28.080> which<00:02:28.530> will<00:02:28.709> net<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.010> a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
a tremor passes which will net you a

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.229 
a tremor passes which will net you a
shitload<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.700> fun

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
shitload of fun

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.809 
shitload of fun
just<00:02:31.870> don't<00:02:32.019> use<00:02:32.290> your<00:02:32.500> boost<00:02:33.189> on<00:02:33.579> this

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
just don't use your boost on this

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.849 
just don't use your boost on this
section<00:02:34.269> we're<00:02:34.750> just<00:02:34.900> gonna<00:02:35.049> wait<00:02:35.290> until<00:02:35.500> we

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
section we're just gonna wait until we

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.309 
section we're just gonna wait until we

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
get to the corner over here and when

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.449 
get to the corner over here and when
going<00:02:38.469> through<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.739> corner<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.099> won't<00:02:39.250> see

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
going through the corner you won't see

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.270 
going through the corner you won't see
me<00:02:39.579> using<00:02:39.730> boost<00:02:40.060> but<00:02:40.840> I'm<00:02:41.620> going<00:02:41.859> fast<00:02:42.069> enough

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
me using boost but I'm going fast enough

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.059 
me using boost but I'm going fast enough
to<00:02:42.549> get<00:02:42.670> three<00:02:42.909> red<00:02:43.299> patches<00:02:43.629> and<00:02:44.019> on<00:02:44.709> this

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
to get three red patches and on this

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.890 
to get three red patches and on this
last<00:02:45.370> section<00:02:45.609> of<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.909> track<00:02:46.150> you<00:02:46.420> might<00:02:46.689> want

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
last section of the track you might want

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.599 
last section of the track you might want
to<00:02:46.930> use<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.200> boost<00:02:47.409> because<00:02:47.769> they<00:02:47.980> will<00:02:48.340> catch

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
to use the boost because they will catch

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.280 
to use the boost because they will catch
up<00:02:48.849> to<00:02:48.879> you<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.450> you<00:02:49.780> don't<00:02:49.900> want<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.139> lose

we're gonna finish and you'll see I
finished<00:03:01.970> one<00:03:02.840> minute<00:03:03.110> 53<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:04.670> here<00:03:05.540> comes

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
finished one minute 53 and here comes

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.610 
finished one minute 53 and here comes
the<00:03:06.200> total<00:03:06.740> experience<00:03:07.010> points

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.820 

it's<00:03:13.069> 200<00:03:13.640> for<00:03:14.300> a<00:03:14.330> silver<00:03:14.660> medal<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.260> here<00:03:15.770> he

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
it's 200 for a silver medal and here he

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.089 
it's 200 for a silver medal and here he
comes<00:03:16.209> 9,000<00:03:17.209> for<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.510> race<00:03:17.690> itself<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.890> then

comes 9,000 for the race itself and then

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.580 
comes 9,000 for the race itself and then
a<00:03:19.160> thousand<00:03:19.700> for<00:03:19.819> four<00:03:20.030> run<00:03:20.390> so<00:03:20.630> that's<00:03:20.870> more

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
a thousand for four run so that's more

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.160 
a thousand for four run so that's more
m10<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.250> another<00:03:22.670> 500<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.360> it's<00:03:23.780> close<00:03:24.020> to

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
m10 and another 500 so it's close to

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.240 
m10 and another 500 so it's close to
11,000<00:03:25.099> just<00:03:25.310> in<00:03:25.520> under<00:03:26.000> two<00:03:26.209> minutes

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
11,000 just in under two minutes

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.930 
11,000 just in under two minutes
fastest<00:03:28.250> way<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.780> level<00:03:29.780> up
