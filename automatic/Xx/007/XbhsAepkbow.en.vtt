drawing tempo curves here we'll see I'm
automating<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.750> tempo<00:02:15.170> from<00:02:15.650> 120<00:02:16.459> beats<00:02:16.640> per

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
automating the tempo from 120 beats per

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.210 
automating the tempo from 120 beats per
minute<00:02:17.090> at<00:02:17.180> bar<00:02:17.360> 8<00:02:17.599> to<00:02:18.140> 70<00:02:18.560> beats<00:02:18.769> per<00:02:18.860> minute

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
minute at bar 8 to 70 beats per minute

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.339 
minute at bar 8 to 70 beats per minute
at<00:02:19.370> bar<00:02:19.580> 10

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.410 

let's<00:02:25.980> make<00:02:26.159> some<00:02:26.340> further<00:02:26.640> adjustments<00:02:27.269> on

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
let's make some further adjustments on

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.140 
let's make some further adjustments on
the<00:02:27.629> tempo<00:02:27.989> ruler<00:02:28.310> I'm<00:02:29.310> now<00:02:29.579> going<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.879> draw<00:02:30.060> a

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the tempo ruler I'm now going to draw a

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.599 
the tempo ruler I'm now going to draw a
line<00:02:30.420> from<00:02:30.749> bar<00:02:31.019> 11<00:02:31.439> which<00:02:31.799> is<00:02:31.950> still<00:02:32.129> at<00:02:32.249> 70

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
line from bar 11 which is still at 70

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.750 
line from bar 11 which is still at 70
beats<00:02:32.790> per<00:02:32.879> minute<00:02:33.299> after<00:02:33.959> bar<00:02:34.200> 13<00:02:34.769> aiming<00:02:35.609> for

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
beats per minute after bar 13 aiming for

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.000 
beats per minute after bar 13 aiming for
a<00:02:35.819> hundred<00:02:36.209> beats<00:02:36.389> per<00:02:36.599> minute<00:02:36.870> as<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.859> can

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
a hundred beats per minute as you can

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.309 
a hundred beats per minute as you can
see<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.519> can<00:02:38.790> use<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.209> blue<00:02:39.359> handles<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.079> fine

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
see I can use the blue handles to fine

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.399 
see I can use the blue handles to fine
adjust<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.920> tempo<00:02:41.689> let's<00:02:42.689> now<00:02:42.870> draw<00:02:43.109> an<00:02:43.230> even

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
adjust the tempo let's now draw an even

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.890 
adjust the tempo let's now draw an even
steeper<00:02:43.920> curve<00:02:44.340> going<00:02:45.120> from<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.389> hundred<00:02:45.689> beats

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
steeper curve going from a hundred beats

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.990 
steeper curve going from a hundred beats
per<00:02:46.079> minute<00:02:46.349> to<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.829> hundred<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.400> sixty<00:02:47.819> beats

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
per minute to a hundred and sixty beats

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.869 
per minute to a hundred and sixty beats
per<00:02:48.120> minute<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:48.599> one<00:02:48.989> bar<00:02:49.459> let's<00:02:50.459> now<00:02:50.670> have<00:02:50.819> a

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
per minute in one bar let's now have a

00:02:50.879 --> 00:03:08.080 
per minute in one bar let's now have a
listen<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.389> transition

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090
