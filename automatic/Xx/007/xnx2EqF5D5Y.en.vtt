00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Remove all they are to the city 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.639
 have forced back in 2008 tower 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.200
 everything to cnc candidates for the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.200
 home european championship like that 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.610
 from the three gentlemen in Northern Ireland 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.840
 Incidentally, team play in the premier league 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.520
 that's Johnson and that's the two 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.790
 meter no player 111 austrian 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.899
 team are also the one before kick-off 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:37.180
 still said from 323 of 2004 yet 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.180
 for example, a side job 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:50.710
 now the soon to be 44 counter on water 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.570
 but he does not deserve the gameplay 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.570
 of the type of game 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.579
 of what the Austrians are taking 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.579
 had absolutely 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.830
 high of the couples the meters of mine 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.300
 Aufhauser first in the shop can be 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.400
 beautiful time is not attacked properly 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.140
 and thus also for rene aufhauser 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.130
 that counts his fourth goal 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.130
 red white red ps 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.110
 again with the legs stretched out 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.110
 Mr. prix course 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.200
 At the situation the church is switched 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.180
 walk a few steps and look 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.650
 look at that 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.220
 that was expected again 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.220
 stretched leg 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.920
 Yes 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.060
 the stretched leg that is that 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.060
 normally already the red card 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.769
 now the assistant of 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.060
 the line 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.640
 religion finally realized that 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.990
 Has 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.990
 pogatetz injured on the ground 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.810
 raw game and at this are the Northern Irish 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.810
 guilt and a greek 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.129
 but once incredibly stretched leg 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.610
 and that was already the fifth in 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.610
 this game 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.390
 David is hectic but it's clear who wants 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.480
 there is something in a game around 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.650
 the third place 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.650
 they were both no longer eligible to vote 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.020
 but they want to be a bit broad 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:28.580
 continue playing in their clubs 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.580
 and that healthy 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.720
 athanasios prittas has become a few 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.720
 earned a month's break 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.310
 so 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.310
 red card for both 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.150
 Demian Johnson Muscles and Emanuel 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.150
 Pogatetz 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.400
 who can understand that 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.540
 gets a stretched foot 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.410
 opposite 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.410
 and must from the game 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.370
 since complained afterwards loudly 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.330
 maybe even the hustle and bustle then 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.979
 somehow instigated 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.979
 and of course in highest emotion 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:49.800
 on aa four against three 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:49.800
 he would have stood firm 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.280
 absolute 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:05.960
 only one is allowed to shoot this evening 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.960
 and that is Rene Aufhauser 2 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.450
 92 minutes 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.330
 Steadfast and chelsea are none 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.539
 more out 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:24.400
 standing ko the Northern Irishmen are now available 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.400
 the bill for this ugly game 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.750
 95 minutes are played the victory 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.790
 Austria wins against Northern Ireland 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.550
 quite well with 2 0 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.470
 especially because of the performance in the 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:45.830
 second half and yet the gates of 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:48.210
 renÃ© aufhauser 44 192 minutes of this man 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.890
 It does not take off for tonight 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.940
 are just as proud as the 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.390
 gentlemen in green 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:59.040
 the nordirische team that I at this 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:00.690
 evening has colored more yellow and sees it 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.150
 Looks like the referee is out 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.250
 greece athanassios prix akkus too 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.750
 now does not understand what this 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.560
 play maybe a bit too hard 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.560
 was guided 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.500
 So also the second country game victory 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.390
 against Northern Ireland is in history 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.670
 successful 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.530
 even though we have been since the game 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:24.760
 know the wm 2006 will take place without 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.770
 Austria instead of finally over there 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.170
 there is still a nice at least 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.760
 between the two trainers is now called 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.030
 Mouth wash it sill front look 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.250
 Full concentration on 2008 with all 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.890
 available and united 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.420
 forces and with as few hoppalas as possible 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.910
 Austria says goodbye to this 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.500
 Qualification with a victory against 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.480
 Northern Ireland It was not a nice game 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.400
 no match for the nordiren proud 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.630
 have to be 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.310
 it was a very bad one 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.300
 referee but a deserved victory 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.130
 that was it from me 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.160
 continue with the first open 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.160
 interview
