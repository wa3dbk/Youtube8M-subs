so you're going to allow these foils to

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.050 
so you're going to allow these foils to
sit<00:03:27.159> for<00:03:27.340> about<00:03:27.430> 10<00:03:27.790> minutes<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:29.640> then<00:03:30.640> check<00:03:30.909> to

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
see how well the color was developing I

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.399 
see how well the color was developing I
could<00:03:34.120> see<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.299> amarixe<00:03:34.780> hair<00:03:34.989> was<00:03:35.170> two

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409

could see that amarixe hair was two
shades<00:03:35.680> lighter<00:03:35.799> so<00:03:36.400> now<00:03:36.579> it<00:03:36.640> was<00:03:36.760> time<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:37.030> do

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
shades lighter so now it was time to do

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:45.960
