because we weren't doing well five six

because we weren't doing well five six
years<00:00:12.790> ago<00:00:12.910> and<00:00:13.330> we<00:00:14.080> made<00:00:14.320> a<00:00:14.350> concerted<00:00:14.770> effort

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040 
years ago and we made a concerted effort

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.400 
years ago and we made a concerted effort
at<00:00:15.280> that<00:00:15.430> time<00:00:15.700> to<00:00:16.000> show<00:00:16.660> improvement<00:00:16.810> because

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
Brookside for many years was kind of an

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.440 
Brookside for many years was kind of an
underdog<00:00:20.380> in<00:00:20.740> the<00:00:20.830> system<00:00:21.279> there<00:00:21.880> was<00:00:22.090> a<00:00:22.119> time

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
underdog in the system there was a time

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.150 
underdog in the system there was a time
where<00:00:22.930> teachers<00:00:23.170> just<00:00:23.529> went<00:00:23.800> into<00:00:23.920> their

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
where teachers just went into their

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.880 
where teachers just went into their
classrooms<00:00:24.700> and<00:00:24.910> closed<00:00:25.240> the<00:00:25.390> door<00:00:25.480> and<00:00:25.900> they

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
classrooms and closed the door and they

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.310 
classrooms and closed the door and they
didn't<00:00:27.310> associate<00:00:27.910> with<00:00:28.330> anyone<00:00:28.779> even<00:00:29.080> on

little world I'm doing this and I'm not
sharing<00:00:35.110> that<00:00:35.290> and<00:00:35.670> that's<00:00:36.670> just<00:00:37.210> an<00:00:37.570> awful

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
sharing that and that's just an awful

sharing that and that's just an awful
situation<00:00:38.290> to<00:00:38.829> work<00:00:39.010> in<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.550> answer<00:00:39.910> was<00:00:40.060> the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
situation to work in the answer was the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.880 
situation to work in the answer was the
teachers<00:00:40.480> of<00:00:40.600> cities<00:00:40.930> these<00:00:41.110> kids<00:00:41.380> can't<00:00:41.710> do

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
teachers of cities these kids can't do

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.760 
teachers of cities these kids can't do
it<00:00:42.070> we<00:00:42.820> can't<00:00:43.090> give<00:00:43.270> them<00:00:43.300> hard<00:00:43.719> work<00:00:44.050> because

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
it we can't give them hard work because

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.459 
it we can't give them hard work because
they<00:00:44.949> just<00:00:45.129> can't<00:00:45.489> do<00:00:45.699> it<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.989> was<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.199> little

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
they just can't do it it was a little

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.680 
they just can't do it it was a little
bit<00:00:47.559> of<00:00:47.590> a<00:00:47.680> struggle<00:00:47.890> to<00:00:48.160> trend<00:00:48.460> that<00:00:48.690> thought

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
bit of a struggle to trend that thought

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.770 
bit of a struggle to trend that thought
around<00:00:50.079> but<00:00:50.410> eventually<00:00:51.129> they<00:00:52.000> did<00:00:52.239> I<00:00:52.480> think

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
around but eventually they did I think

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.189 
around but eventually they did I think
it<00:00:52.870> starts<00:00:53.230> from<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.739> top<00:00:53.859> mr.<00:00:54.519> hey<00:00:54.960> he's<00:00:55.960> done

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
it starts from the top mr. hey he's done

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.860 
it starts from the top mr. hey he's done
a<00:00:56.260> great<00:00:56.530> job<00:00:56.559> leading<00:00:57.100> us<00:00:57.570> making<00:00:58.570> others

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
a great job leading us making others

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.740 
a great job leading us making others
reach<00:00:59.079> for<00:00:59.379> a<00:00:59.410> higher<00:00:59.440> standards<00:01:00.160> and<00:01:00.750> having

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
reach for a higher standards and having

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.270 
reach for a higher standards and having
us<00:01:01.870> press<00:01:02.289> it<00:01:02.440> onto<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.679> kids<00:01:02.949> as<00:01:03.100> well

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
us press it onto the kids as well

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.560 
us press it onto the kids as well
probably<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:03.940> one<00:01:04.030> of<00:01:04.120> the<00:01:04.180> critical<00:01:04.449> things

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
probably the one of the critical things

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.380 
probably the one of the critical things
that<00:01:04.900> we<00:01:04.989> did<00:01:05.170> was<00:01:05.320> simply<00:01:05.650> say<00:01:06.250> ah<00:01:06.580> students

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
that we did was simply say ah students

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.570 
that we did was simply say ah students
can<00:01:07.630> do<00:01:07.750> better<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:08.080> really<00:01:08.410> believe<00:01:08.590> that<00:01:09.040> he

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
can do better to really believe that he

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.720 
can do better to really believe that he
really<00:01:10.150> has<00:01:10.300> a<00:01:10.330> way<00:01:10.420> about<00:01:10.570> him<00:01:11.020> that<00:01:11.200> is<00:01:11.230> just

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
really has a way about him that is just

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.149 
really has a way about him that is just
he<00:01:12.730> really<00:01:13.030> coax<00:01:13.630> his<00:01:13.870> people<00:01:14.200> along<00:01:14.500> in<00:01:14.770> a

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
he really coax his people along in a

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.149 
he really coax his people along in a
very<00:01:15.369> subtle<00:01:15.610> way<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:17.170> jump<00:01:17.560> on<00:01:17.740> board<00:01:17.770> with

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
very subtle way to jump on board with

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.399 
very subtle way to jump on board with
him<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.790> have<00:01:18.970> someone<00:01:19.299> acknowledge<00:01:20.200> our

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
good real I think it has really just

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.139 
good real I think it has really just
changed<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.159> whole<00:01:27.280> atmosphere<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:28.000> this

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
changed the whole atmosphere of this

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.910 
changed the whole atmosphere of this
building<00:01:28.540> he<00:01:29.020> knows<00:01:29.229> that<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.560> teachers<00:01:29.890> are

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
what they have to do to get the job done

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.450 
what they have to do to get the job done
he<00:01:34.750> sometimes<00:01:35.409> he'll<00:01:35.770> tell<00:01:35.950> you<00:01:36.070> what<00:01:36.220> to<00:01:36.250> do

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
but most of times he'll throw it out

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.380 
but most of times he'll throw it out
there<00:01:38.259> and<00:01:38.560> he<00:01:39.280> knows<00:01:39.490> that<00:01:39.520> people<00:01:39.790> step<00:01:40.270> up

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
there and he knows that people step up

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.789 
there and he knows that people step up
and<00:01:40.570> get<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.780> job<00:01:40.960> done<00:01:40.990> she<00:01:41.409> had<00:01:41.500> leadership

and get the job done she had leadership
basically<00:01:42.520> takes<00:01:42.880> place<00:01:43.180> because<00:01:43.390> you're

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
basically takes place because you're

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.620 
basically takes place because you're
willing<00:01:44.439> to<00:01:44.710> give<00:01:44.890> up<00:01:45.009> power<00:01:45.250> as<00:01:45.670> an

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
administrator you have to recognize that

there leave all the people come together

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.980 
there leave all the people come together
it's<00:01:51.700> much<00:01:51.850> more<00:01:52.030> powerful<00:01:52.390> than<00:01:52.600> one<00:01:52.780> person

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
it's much more powerful than one person

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.830 
it's much more powerful than one person
