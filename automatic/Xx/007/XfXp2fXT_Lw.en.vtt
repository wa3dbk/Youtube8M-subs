guys<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.370> little<00:00:08.700> bit<00:00:08.880> about<00:00:08.970> ketogenic<00:00:09.929> ratios

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
guys a little bit about ketogenic ratios

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.560 
guys a little bit about ketogenic ratios
now<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.000> starting<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.300> get<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.450> little

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
now this is starting to get a little

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.289 
now this is starting to get a little
more<00:00:12.780> popular<00:00:13.380> because<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:15.000> ketogenic

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
more popular because of the ketogenic

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.359 
more popular because of the ketogenic
diet<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.680> Atkins<00:00:16.859> diet<00:00:17.539> but<00:00:18.539> lately<00:00:19.369> carb

at<00:00:31.439> leat<00:00:31.920> dot<00:00:32.489> IO<00:00:33.950> but<00:00:34.950> he<00:00:35.130> wrote<00:00:35.340> two<00:00:35.550> books

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
at leat dot IO but he wrote two books

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.900 
at leat dot IO but he wrote two books
one<00:00:36.420> called<00:00:36.750> carb<00:00:37.230> nite<00:00:37.350> solution<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
one called carb nite solution and the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.220 
one called carb nite solution and the
other<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.210> was<00:00:39.390> written<00:00:39.690> more<00:00:39.870> recently

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
other one was written more recently

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.130 
other one was written more recently
called<00:00:40.530> carb<00:00:40.920> backloading<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.600> concepts

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
called carb backloading and the concepts

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.700 
called carb backloading and the concepts
behind<00:00:43.350> them<00:00:43.920> are<00:00:44.219> basically<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.149> carb<00:00:45.989> cycling

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
behind them are basically a carb cycling

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.440 
behind them are basically a carb cycling
program<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.910> you're<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.149> go<00:00:48.239> through

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
program so you're going to go through

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.180 
program so you're going to go through
periods<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.930> time<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.530> low<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.010> high

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
periods of time we have low and high

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.850 
periods of time we have low and high
carbohydrates<00:00:51.090> well<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> want<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.379> jump<00:00:52.590> into

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
carbohydrates well I want to jump into

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.490 
carbohydrates well I want to jump into
here<00:00:53.309> though<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.449> during<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.199> times

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
here though is that during the times

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.500 
here though is that during the times
where<00:00:55.770> you're<00:00:55.890> not<00:00:56.160> consuming<00:00:56.820> carbohydrates

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.139 

ketogenic<00:01:00.510> ratio<00:01:01.010> now<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:02.969> is

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
ketogenic ratio now what this is

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.230 
ketogenic ratio now what this is
basically<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.739> making<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.640> as<00:01:05.790> simple<00:01:06.150> as

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
basically is just making it as simple as

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.649 
basically is just making it as simple as
possible<00:01:06.810> people<00:01:07.020> screw<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:08.450> you<00:01:09.450> need

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
possible people screw it up of you need

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.240 
possible people screw it up of you need
to<00:01:09.780> eat<00:01:09.960> more<00:01:10.320> fat<00:01:11.510> it's<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.720> simple

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
to eat more fat it's that simple

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.280 
to eat more fat it's that simple
maybe<00:01:14.250> eat<00:01:14.520> more<00:01:14.729> fat<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.420> when<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.960> explain

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
maybe eat more fat and when I explain

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.749 
maybe eat more fat and when I explain
this<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> people<00:01:16.590> lots<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> people<00:01:17.400> think<00:01:17.580> oh

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
this to people lots of people think oh

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.490 
this to people lots of people think oh
well<00:01:18.000> I'm<00:01:18.150> not<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.630> eat<00:01:18.780> carbs<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.380> that

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
well I'm not going to eat carbs and that

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.730 
well I'm not going to eat carbs and that
will<00:01:19.590> fix<00:01:19.830> everything<00:01:20.450> not<00:01:21.450> quite<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
will fix everything not quite if you

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.380 
will fix everything not quite if you
want<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.070> actually<00:01:23.159> end<00:01:23.520> up<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.759> ketogenesis

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
want to actually end up in ketogenesis

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.630 
want to actually end up in ketogenesis
ketosis<00:01:25.350> etc<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.100> actually<00:01:26.250> want<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
ketosis etc if you actually want to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.569 
ketosis etc if you actually want to
create<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.000> deficit<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.070> have<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.280> with<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
create a deficit you have to with the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.580 
create a deficit you have to with the
protein<00:01:29.970> -<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.079> restrict<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
protein - you have to restrict the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.730 
protein - you have to restrict the
protein<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.549> reason<00:01:33.030> being

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
protein the reason being

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.289 
protein the reason being
let's<00:01:34.740> see<00:01:34.890> cut<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> carbohydrates<00:01:36.180> but

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
let's see cut out the carbohydrates but

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.080 
let's see cut out the carbohydrates but
you're<00:01:36.420> still<00:01:36.630> consuming<00:01:37.229> protein<00:01:37.820> your<00:01:38.820> body

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
you're still consuming protein your body

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.050 
you're still consuming protein your body
is<00:01:39.329> amazingly<00:01:40.049> adaptable<00:01:40.549> there's<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.640> process

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
is amazingly adaptable there's a process

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.590 
is amazingly adaptable there's a process
called<00:01:42.240> gluconeogenesis<00:01:44.360> basically<00:01:45.360> break

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
called gluconeogenesis basically break

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.069 
called gluconeogenesis basically break

generating new sugar when we look at
this<00:01:57.719> if<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.380> overeat<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.189> protein<00:01:59.670> you

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
this if you overeat the protein you

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.270 
this if you overeat the protein you
might<00:02:01.049> as<00:02:01.140> well<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.380> eating<00:02:01.409> carbs<00:02:02.040> because

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
might as well be eating carbs because

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.410 
might as well be eating carbs because
now<00:02:02.399> your<00:02:02.549> boys<00:02:02.729> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.000> create<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
now your boys going to create the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.510 
now your boys going to create the
glucose<00:02:03.840> anyways<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.860> now<00:02:04.979> you're<00:02:05.130> gonna<00:02:05.219> have

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
glucose anyways so now you're gonna have

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.520 
glucose anyways so now you're gonna have
a<00:02:05.579> high<00:02:05.880> blood<00:02:06.149> sugar<00:02:06.450> regardless<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
a high blood sugar regardless of the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.970 
a high blood sugar regardless of the
fact<00:02:07.740> that

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
fact that

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.600 
fact that
yeah<00:02:08.400> the<00:02:08.700> good<00:02:08.820> stuff<00:02:09.150> so<00:02:09.800> what<00:02:10.800> we<00:02:10.950> need<00:02:11.220> here

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
yeah the good stuff so what we need here

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.200 
yeah the good stuff so what we need here
is<00:02:11.820> we<00:02:12.600> need<00:02:12.750> three<00:02:13.260> grams<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.830> fat<00:02:14.070> per<00:02:14.400> one

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
is we need three grams of fat per one

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.350 
is we need three grams of fat per one
gram<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.570> protein<00:02:15.780> or<00:02:16.590> carbohydrate<00:02:17.580> well

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.449 
want to consider is your protein intake
your<00:03:11.760> protein<00:03:12.209> intake<00:03:12.390> should<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:12.930> 20%<00:03:13.680> or

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459

less of your total intake and then

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.510 
less of your total intake and then
finally<00:03:18.690> your<00:03:18.840> fat<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.590> going<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.040> fill<00:03:20.220> up<00:03:20.370> all

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520

you're<00:03:22.740> going<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:22.950> eat<00:03:23.239> 75%<00:03:24.239> or<00:03:24.420> more<00:03:24.980> fat<00:03:25.980> if

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
you're going to eat 75% or more fat if

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.900 
you're going to eat 75% or more fat if

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
if your boys producing the ketones but

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.850 
if your boys producing the ketones but
it's<00:03:56.820> in<00:03:57.180> Keita<00:03:57.540> Genesis<00:03:58.320> which<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.739> may

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
it's in Keita Genesis which you may

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.979 
it's in Keita Genesis which you may

you're not going to register anything on
a<00:04:14.430> little<00:04:14.610> strip<00:04:14.940> you<00:04:15.450> have<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.750> take<00:04:15.930> your

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
a little strip you have to take your

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.720 
a little strip you have to take your
blood<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.530> actually<00:04:16.920> measure<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.280> ketones

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
blood to actually measure the ketones

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.090 
blood to actually measure the ketones
however<00:04:18.359> if<00:04:19.200> you<00:04:19.350> suddenly<00:04:19.650> ain't

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
however if you suddenly ain't

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.920 
however if you suddenly ain't
carbohydrates<00:04:21.090> because<00:04:21.269> your<00:04:21.570> boy<00:04:21.690> would

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
carbohydrates because your boy would

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.530 
carbohydrates because your boy would
switch<00:04:22.170> back<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.440> burning<00:04:22.980> glucose<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:24.360> would

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
switch back to burning glucose it would

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.150 
switch back to burning glucose it would
flush<00:04:24.900> out<00:04:25.110> all<00:04:25.260> those<00:04:25.380> ketones<00:04:25.890> that<00:04:26.070> you're

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
flush out all those ketones that you're

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.620 
flush out all those ketones that you're
holding<00:04:26.370> onto<00:04:26.610> because<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.120> body<00:04:27.300> actually

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
holding onto because the body actually

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.890 
holding onto because the body actually
prefers<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.170> burn<00:04:28.380> from<00:04:28.920> glucose<00:04:29.430> over

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
prefers to burn from glucose over

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.140 
prefers to burn from glucose over
ketones<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.260> so<00:04:32.010> then<00:04:32.340> suddenly<00:04:32.790> you're

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
ketones and so then suddenly you're

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.150 
ketones and so then suddenly you're
eating<00:04:33.420> carbohydrates<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:34.380> you'd<00:04:34.500> be<00:04:34.680> paying

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
eating carbohydrates and you'd be paying

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.790 
eating carbohydrates and you'd be paying
out<00:04:35.310> ketones<00:04:36.410> because<00:04:37.410> your<00:04:37.530> body<00:04:37.680> was

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
out ketones because your body was

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.260 
out ketones because your body was
holding<00:04:38.130> on<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.310> them<00:04:38.670> and<00:04:38.790> now<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:38.910> decide

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
holding on to them and now I decide

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.390 
holding on to them and now I decide
though<00:04:39.450> I<00:04:39.480> don't<00:04:39.750> need<00:04:39.900> them<00:04:40.110> anymore<00:04:40.400> the

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
though I don't need them anymore the

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.610 
though I don't need them anymore the
point<00:04:41.760> being<00:04:42.060> though<00:04:42.390> if<00:04:42.720> you're<00:04:43.050> doing<00:04:43.350> a<00:04:43.410> key

point being though if you're doing a key
