 Anti-cancer fruit list 

00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:10.993
 There are many ways we can compare the health of different foods: 

00:00:10.993 --> 00:00:14.540
 Like the nutrients in the fruit. 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.115
 If we are interested in the antioxidant ingredients in food, we can start with vitamin C content. 

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:30.235
 If you compare the most popular apples to bananas, bananas contain up to 10 mg of vitamin C, which is twice as high as 5 mg of apples. 

00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:35.401
 However, vitamin C is only one of the thousands of plant nutrients. 

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:41.471
 In fact, the anti-cancer activity of vitamin C in apples is only less than 1%. 

00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:47.408
 This is the total anti-cancer active ingredient of apple (red delicious variety). 

00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:53.111
 This is the content of apple vitamin C: it is almost invisible. 

00:00:53.378 --> 00:01:02.065
 Although a small apple contains only 5 mg of vitamin C, its anti-cancer energy is equivalent to 1500 mg of vitamin C (dietary supplement). 

00:01:02.147 --> 00:01:11.418
 I have commented that excessive use of vitamin C supplements can strengthen the body's oxidation reaction and cause DNA damage. 

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:19.157
 If you eat apples alone, there are no side effects of supplements and three times more antioxidant energy. 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.369
 Of course, bananas are not just vitamin C. 

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:36.657
 I am very surprised by this Harvard study. In addition to the red/blue/purple phytonutrients in blueberries and strawberries, bananas also contain large amounts of anthocyanins. 

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:41.211
 I may underestimate the beauty of the banana. After all, it also belongs to a fruit. 

00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:55.024
 Look at these three kinds of fruits, some of the anthocyanins in blueberries and strawberries, but not much in the bananas. 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.197
 But the wild banana is not the same. 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:12.306
 Blue, purple, red orange, red purple and pink purple wild bananas contain anthocyanins, only yellow bananas. 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:16.249
 When they presented this data to Harvard researchers, they said: 

00:02:16.314 --> 00:02:23.614
 We are only responsible for extracting relevant information from the USDA database. Looks like there are errors in the USDA data. 

00:02:23.686 --> 00:02:32.778
 There are no anthocyanins in the bananas. Although the vitamin C content is twice as high as that of apples, the antioxidant activity of apples is generally high. 

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:38.217
 However, we should note that this fruit oxidation test was carried out in test tubes. 

00:02:38.252 --> 00:02:42.145
 It would be more desirable if the actual biological activity could be measured. 

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:50.575
 For example, in this experiment, they also compare the peeled and extracted extracts from unpeeled apples. 

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:56.803
 The effects of the two groups on the proliferation of human cancer cells in the culture dish were observed. 

00:02:56.891 --> 00:03:03.754
 If you can compare the anti-cancer functions of different fruits, how good! 

00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:12.612
 This chart shows the relationship between the concentration of 11 commonly used fruit extracts in the United States and cancer cell growth rates. 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:17.239
 This experiment used human liver cancer cells. 

00:03:17.283 --> 00:03:21.840
 If the water droplets are on the cancer cells of the control group, the growth rate will not change. 

00:03:21.914 --> 00:03:27.278
 They are continuously maintained at a 100% growth rate. 

00:03:27.386 --> 00:03:34.056
 Pineapple, pear, and orange extracts also did not affect growth rate. 

00:03:34.142 --> 00:03:52.075
 Peaches are out of this trend. Peach extract can reduce the growth rate of cancer cells to 10% at high concentrations. But in contrast, bananas and grapefruit can more effectively reduce the growth rate of cancer cells by four times - 40%. 

00:03:52.075 --> 00:04:00.317
 Red grapes, strawberries and apples require only half the dose to reduce cancer cell growth by 50%. 

00:04:00.362 --> 00:04:15.959
 However, the winners are the two fruits; the tiny doses can effectively inhibit cancer cell proliferation: lemon and cranberry. 

00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:26.187
 When we investigated the effective dose required to inhibit the malignant proliferation of liver cancer cells, although apples were stronger than bananas, the ultimate winner was cranberry. 

00:04:26.195 --> 00:04:35.228
 This article also does not address the effective dose of antioxidants for oranges, pears and pineapples. Because these fruits do not affect the growth rate of cancer cells.
