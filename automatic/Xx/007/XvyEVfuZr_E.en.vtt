00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.240 
inside there's not that much different
feel<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> outside<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.800> radically

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
feel on the outside it's radically

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.860 
feel on the outside it's radically
different<00:00:50.579> than<00:00:50.670> Citroen<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.420> always<00:00:51.600> been

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
different than Citroen have always been

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.660 
different than Citroen have always been
noted<00:00:52.230> for<00:00:52.379> taking<00:00:52.710> some<00:00:53.100> risks<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:53.579> their

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
noted for taking some risks with their

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.670 
noted for taking some risks with their
styling<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.629> admired<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.320> sometimes

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
styling and I admired that but sometimes

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.170 
styling and I admired that but sometimes
I<00:00:55.860> don't<00:00:55.920> think<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:56.430> always<00:00:56.789> pull<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.090> off

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.680 
turns so I can tell you about how the
steering<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.490> ce-1<00:03:45.850> works<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.300> see<00:03:46.510> at

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
steering and the ce-1 works you see at

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.470 
steering and the ce-1 works you see at
low<00:03:46.930> speeds<00:03:47.290> it's<00:03:47.770> very<00:03:47.950> easy<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.700> steer<00:03:49.270> it

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
low speeds it's very easy to steer it

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.320 
low speeds it's very easy to steer it
nimble<00:03:50.080> and<00:03:50.200> light<00:03:50.260> however<00:03:51.100> when<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:51.970> speed

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
nimble and light however when you speed

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.890 
nimble and light however when you speed
up<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:53.020> steering<00:03:53.530> gets<00:03:54.220> heavier<00:03:54.790> so<00:03:55.150> this<00:03:55.690> car

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
up the steering gets heavier so this car

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.420 
up the steering gets heavier so this car
is<00:03:56.050> just<00:03:56.080> as<00:03:56.410> comfortable<00:03:56.590> cruising<00:03:57.130> along<00:03:57.190> on

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
is just as comfortable cruising along on

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.640 
is just as comfortable cruising along on
the<00:03:57.490> motorway<00:03:57.820> as<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:58.330> is<00:03:58.530> negotiating<00:03:59.530> car

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650

because they're so many to try and

because they're so many to try and
remember<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.350> each<00:04:35.830> has<00:04:36.130> its<00:04:36.340> own<00:04:36.669> merits

it's<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.360> very<00:04:37.510> difficult<00:04:37.750> decision<00:04:37.990> trying<00:04:38.800> to

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
it's a very difficult decision trying to

the i-10 in some respects looks like a

the i-10 in some respects looks like a

long warranty so why should you buy the
Citroen<00:04:54.490> well<00:04:54.880> in<00:04:55.090> my<00:04:55.480> opinion<00:04:55.930> I<00:04:56.110> think<00:04:56.350> it's

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
Citroen well in my opinion I think it's

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.800 
Citroen well in my opinion I think it's
with<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.280> best-looking<00:04:57.640> City<00:04:58.120> cars<00:04:58.360> it's

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
with the best-looking City cars it's

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.690 
with the best-looking City cars it's
also<00:04:59.020> mechanically<00:04:59.740> as<00:04:59.860> good<00:05:00.070> as<00:05:00.250> any<00:05:00.430> of<00:05:00.610> them

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
also mechanically as good as any of them

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.460 
also mechanically as good as any of them
out<00:05:00.790> there<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.210> it's<00:05:01.810> priced<00:05:02.110> very

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
out there and it's priced very

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.070 
out there and it's priced very
competitively<00:05:02.640> and<00:05:03.640> at<00:05:04.480> the<00:05:04.570> end<00:05:04.720> of<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.930> day

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
competitively and at the end of the day

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.820 
competitively and at the end of the day
what<00:05:05.680> more<00:05:05.890> can<00:05:06.070> you<00:05:06.130> want<00:05:06.400> from<00:05:06.550> a<00:05:06.640> car
