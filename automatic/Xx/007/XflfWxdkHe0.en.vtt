strings<00:03:19.989> are<00:03:20.110> open<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.650> then<00:03:20.859> I<00:03:20.950> strum<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.310> and

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
strings are open and then I strum it and

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.039 
strings are open and then I strum it and
then<00:03:21.700> I<00:03:21.760> should<00:03:21.970> get<00:03:22.090> this<00:03:24.329> nice<00:03:25.329> open<00:03:25.780> court

there<00:03:26.319> ok<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.579> that's<00:03:27.760> called<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.120> g5<00:03:28.540> cord

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
there ok so that's called a g5 cord

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.280 
there ok so that's called a g5 cord
because<00:03:31.150> we<00:03:31.269> don't<00:03:31.450> have<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.810> third<00:03:32.049> of<00:03:32.200> the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
because we don't have the third of the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.800 
because we don't have the third of the
quarter<00:03:32.560> that's<00:03:32.709> just<00:03:32.980> rude<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.400> fit<00:03:33.629> and<00:03:34.629> then

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
quarter that's just rude to fit and then

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.339 
quarter that's just rude to fit and then
we<00:03:34.870> have<00:03:35.340> addy<00:03:36.340> cord<00:03:36.700> ok<00:03:37.180> we<00:03:37.540> did<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:37.750> d<00:03:37.930> chord<00:03:38.260> in

that again that happens twice as well so
here's<00:04:44.590> though<00:04:44.889> here's<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:45.490> part

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.480 

ha

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.950 

now<00:04:52.120> guess<00:04:52.330> what<00:04:52.449> we're<00:04:52.539> going<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:52.750> do<00:04:52.840> the

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
now guess what we're going to do the

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.909 
now guess what we're going to do the
first<00:04:53.199> part<00:04:53.949> of<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.340> riff<00:04:54.490> and<00:04:58.530> so<00:04:59.530> do<00:04:59.740> that

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
first part of the riff and so do that

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.400 
first part of the riff and so do that
twice<00:05:00.220> again<00:05:00.759> and<00:05:01.060> then<00:05:01.479> all<00:05:01.660> that's<00:05:01.840> left<00:05:01.990> is

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
twice again and then all that's left is

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.730 
twice again and then all that's left is
this<00:05:02.800> where<00:05:03.220> he<00:05:03.280> goes<00:05:03.400> back<00:05:03.639> in<00:05:03.849> black<00:05:07.650> I'm<00:05:08.650> not

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
this where he goes back in black I'm not

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.379 
this where he goes back in black I'm not
even<00:05:08.800> going<00:05:09.069> to<00:05:09.130> try<00:05:09.430> to<00:05:09.610> see<00:05:09.819> how<00:05:09.940> he<00:05:09.970> does<00:05:10.060> I

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
even going to try to see how he does I

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.760 
even going to try to see how he does I
cannot<00:05:10.870> do<00:05:11.050> that<00:05:11.199> so<00:05:11.949> we're<00:05:12.880> going<00:05:12.970> to<00:05:13.060> do<00:05:13.240> a<00:05:13.810> g5

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
cannot do that so we're going to do a g5

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.469 
cannot do that so we're going to do a g5
we're<00:05:15.460> just<00:05:15.610> going<00:05:15.729> to<00:05:15.759> hold<00:05:16.030> it<00:05:16.150> way<00:05:16.270> he<00:05:16.330> goes

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
we're just going to hold it way he goes

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.760 
we're just going to hold it way he goes
back<00:05:16.660> in<00:05:16.870> black<00:05:18.900> and<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:19.960> strong<00:05:20.229> pattern<00:05:20.530> for

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
back in black and a strong pattern for

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.309 
back in black and a strong pattern for
that<00:05:20.889> is<00:05:20.979> maybe<00:05:21.130> down<00:05:21.789> up<00:05:22.000> down<00:05:22.030> down<00:05:22.870> up<00:05:23.229> down

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 
that is maybe down up down down up down

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:27.990 
that is maybe down up down down up down
down<00:05:23.889> up<00:05:23.949> down<00:05:26.250> I'm<00:05:27.250> not<00:05:27.370> sure<00:05:27.430> that's<00:05:27.789> exactly

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
down up down I'm not sure that's exactly

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.580 
down up down I'm not sure that's exactly
what<00:05:28.389> he<00:05:28.449> does<00:05:28.599> but<00:05:28.750> you<00:05:28.930> just<00:05:29.050> to<00:05:29.169> fill<00:05:29.349> up<00:05:29.380> the

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
what he does but you just to fill up the

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.990 
what he does but you just to fill up the
measure<00:05:29.770> they<00:05:29.979> don't<00:05:30.159> worry<00:05:30.280> about<00:05:30.460> doing

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
measure they don't worry about doing

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.499 
measure they don't worry about doing
exactly<00:05:32.069> what's<00:05:33.069> done<00:05:33.310> in<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:33.580> Ricky<00:05:33.819> so<00:05:34.240> down

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
exactly what's done in the Ricky so down

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:44.439 
exactly what's done in the Ricky so down
up<00:05:34.569> down<00:05:34.900> down<00:05:35.620> up<00:05:35.979> down<00:05:36.099> down<00:05:36.759> up<00:05:36.819> down

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:46.629 

and<00:05:45.020> then<00:05:45.169> going<00:05:45.259> to<00:05:45.409> a<00:05:45.439> décor<00:05:45.949> we're<00:05:46.490> going<00:05:46.580> to

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
and then going to a décor we're going to

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.429 
and then going to a décor we're going to
do<00:05:46.759> three<00:05:46.969> times<00:05:47.240> but<00:05:47.569> separate<00:05:50.439> little

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:51.439 
do three times but separate little

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:55.989 
do three times but separate little
vibrato<00:05:51.860> thing<00:05:52.129> if<00:05:52.249> you<00:05:52.340> want<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:52.610> 12<00:05:54.999> alright

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:55.999 
vibrato thing if you want to 12 alright

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:59.710 
vibrato thing if you want to 12 alright
so<00:05:56.210> that's<00:05:56.360> the<00:05:56.539> second<00:05:56.990> ref<00:05:57.139> hope<00:05:57.349> you<00:05:57.469> enjoy
