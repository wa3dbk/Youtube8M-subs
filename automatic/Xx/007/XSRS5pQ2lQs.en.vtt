it's<00:03:32.140> nice<00:03:32.379> I<00:03:32.590> don't<00:03:32.650> have<00:03:32.859> to<00:03:32.950> make<00:03:33.069> that

it's nice I don't have to make that

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.280 
it's nice I don't have to make that
decision<00:03:33.430> based<00:03:33.730> upon<00:03:33.819> quality<00:03:34.390> so<00:03:35.170> we're

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290

don't think of myself as a web printer I
have<00:06:29.550> got<00:06:29.879> an<00:06:30.059> integrated<00:06:30.599> manufacturing

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
have got an integrated manufacturing

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.759 
have got an integrated manufacturing
facility<00:06:31.860> here<00:06:32.219> all<00:06:32.939> I<00:06:32.999> do<00:06:33.240> is<00:06:34.050> produce<00:06:34.379> the

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:34.769 
facility here all I do is produce the

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.169 
facility here all I do is produce the
printed<00:06:35.129> work<00:06:35.279> for<00:06:35.429> my<00:06:35.519> customers<00:06:35.999> as

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:36.179 
printed work for my customers as

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:38.089 
printed work for my customers as
efficiently<00:06:36.539> as<00:06:36.689> possible

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099 
efficiently as possible

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:39.829 
efficiently as possible
and<00:06:38.399> so<00:06:38.610> we<00:06:38.759> see<00:06:38.969> all<00:06:39.149> the<00:06:39.300> quipment<00:06:39.479> working

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:39.839 
and so we see all the quipment working

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:41.990 
and so we see all the quipment working
together
