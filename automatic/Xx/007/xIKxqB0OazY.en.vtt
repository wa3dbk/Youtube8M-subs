00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
or not even law school it'll be like

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.120

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
almost impossible technics economically

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.100 
almost impossible technics economically
this<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.820> cannot<00:03:12.000> place<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.390> finish<00:03:12.660> my

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
this is you cannot place to finish my

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.020 
this is you cannot place to finish my
students<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.680> attend<00:03:13.950> these<00:03:14.070> law<00:03:14.220> schools<00:03:14.580> so

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
students to attend these law schools so

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.670 
students to attend these law schools so
in<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.510> next<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.350> think<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.560> APA<00:03:17.300> has

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
in the next I think the APA has

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.780 
in the next I think the APA has
incredible<00:03:19.680> not<00:03:19.860> lien<00:03:20.100> states<00:03:20.340> don't<00:03:20.610> just

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
incredible not lien states don't just

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.030 
incredible not lien states don't just
have<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.000> power<00:03:21.240> to<00:03:21.390> say<00:03:21.600> oh<00:03:21.990> we'll<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:22.800> the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
have the power to say oh we'll have the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.680 
have the power to say oh we'll have the
process<00:03:23.430> because<00:03:23.610> there<00:03:24.000> would<00:03:24.150> be<00:03:24.180> students

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
process because there would be students

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.560 
process because there would be students
going<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.990> this<00:03:25.170> law<00:03:25.350> schools<00:03:25.710> that<00:03:26.270> yeah

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
going to this law schools that yeah

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.840 
going to this law schools that yeah
which<00:03:27.960> is<00:03:28.110> why<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.350> think<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.550> know<00:03:29.670> the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
which is why I think in the you know the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.940 
which is why I think in the you know the
ABA<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.300> recognized<00:03:30.870> as<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.230> accreditor<00:03:31.680> by

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
ABA is recognized as the accreditor by

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.340 
ABA is recognized as the accreditor by
the<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.430> know<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.760> h-he<00:03:33.300> don't<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.930> know<00:03:34.050> the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
the you know the h-he don't you know the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.130 
the you know the h-he don't you know the
health<00:03:34.770> and<00:03:34.980> education<00:03:35.070> services<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.240> so<00:03:36.720> you

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
health and education services and so you

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.110 
health and education services and so you
know<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.320> need<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.620> get<00:03:37.920> some<00:03:38.430> change<00:03:38.760> through

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120
