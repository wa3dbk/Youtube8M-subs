extremely reliable first couple of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.660 
extremely reliable first couple of
models<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.469> came<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.309> inject<00:00:47.550> the

models that came out if you inject the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.459 
models that came out if you inject the
problems<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.329> stuff<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.899> bombard

problems and stuff like that bombard

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.350 
problems and stuff like that bombard
I've<00:00:49.590> done<00:00:49.739> an<00:00:49.860> awesome<00:00:49.980> job<00:00:50.190> now<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.850> I'm

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
I've done an awesome job now and I'm

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.139 
I've done an awesome job now and I'm
delivering<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:52.079> really<00:00:52.440> reliable<00:00:52.770> product<00:00:53.340> now

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
delivering a really reliable product now

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.060 
delivering a really reliable product now
also<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.539> turn<00:00:54.780> over<00:00:54.809> around<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.379> 500<00:00:55.649> hours

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
also I turn over around about 500 hours

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.420 
also I turn over around about 500 hours
a<00:00:56.219> year<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.059> if<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.690> had<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> fourth<00:00:58.140> stroke<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:59.280> me

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
a year so if I had a fourth stroke to me

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.099 
a year so if I had a fourth stroke to me
that<00:00:59.730> would<00:00:59.850> be<00:00:59.879> five<00:01:00.300> lots<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.629> servicing

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
that would be five lots of servicing

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.930 
that would be five lots of servicing
fees<00:01:01.350> which<00:01:01.590> range<00:01:01.890> between<00:01:02.250> six<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.789> eight

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
fees which range between six and eight

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.549 
fees which range between six and eight
hundred<00:01:03.120> dollars<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.930> four<00:01:04.229> thousand

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
hundred dollars and that four thousand

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.250 
hundred dollars and that four thousand
dollars<00:01:04.769> years<00:01:04.979> quite<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> saving<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:06.570> services

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
dollars years quite a saving on services

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.910 
dollars years quite a saving on services
and<00:01:07.560> pretty<00:01:08.369> much<00:01:08.520> every<00:01:09.330> 250<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.049> 300<00:01:10.470> hours<00:01:10.560> I

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
and pretty much every 250 to 300 hours I

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.890 
and pretty much every 250 to 300 hours I
change<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> spark<00:01:11.700> plugs<00:01:11.939> change<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
change the spark plugs change the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.560 
change the spark plugs change the
gearbox<00:01:13.080> oil<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:14.580> an<00:01:14.670> impeller<00:01:14.970> once

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
gearbox oil and do an impeller once

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.270 
gearbox oil and do an impeller once
twice<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.020> year<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.320> well<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.009> sure

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
twice a year as well just to be sure

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.789 
twice a year as well just to be sure
so<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> reason<00:01:18.810> why<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.049> use<00:01:19.170> e<00:01:19.530> Tech's

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
so that's the reason why I use e Tech's

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.480 
so that's the reason why I use e Tech's
they<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.580> very<00:01:21.420> reliable<00:01:21.630> these<00:01:22.080> days<00:01:22.490> lots

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
they are very reliable these days lots

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.920 
they are very reliable these days lots
of<00:01:23.640> power<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.180> lot<00:01:24.390> more<00:01:24.540> power<00:01:24.720> than<00:01:24.900> a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
of power a lot more power than a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.990 
of power a lot more power than a
four-stroke<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.680> I've<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.460> less<00:01:26.670> time<00:01:26.880> off

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
four-stroke and I've got less time off

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.120 
four-stroke and I've got less time off
the<00:01:27.150> water<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:27.479> servicing<00:01:27.990> now<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:28.979> like

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the water with servicing now just like

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.429 
the water with servicing now just like
do<00:01:29.280> bust<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.939> few<00:01:30.119> myths<00:01:30.180> regarding<00:01:30.630> two-stroke

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
do bust a few myths regarding two-stroke

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.850 
do bust a few myths regarding two-stroke
motors<00:01:31.829> they<00:01:32.820> no<00:01:33.060> longer<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.570> old<00:01:33.689> smelly<00:01:34.409> gas

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
motors they no longer the old smelly gas

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.640 
motors they no longer the old smelly gas

different from the old e-tax Ryan we

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.420 
different from the old e-tax Ryan we
kind<00:02:51.879> of<00:02:51.970> started<00:02:52.689> from<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.260> ground<00:02:53.290> up<00:02:53.709> took

kind of started from the ground up took
a<00:02:54.579> new<00:02:54.760> block<00:02:55.439> changed<00:02:56.439> the<00:02:56.530> way<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.889> we<00:02:57.430> did

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
a new block changed the way that we did

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.099 
a new block changed the way that we did
the<00:02:57.700> exhaust<00:02:58.060> porting<00:02:58.540> was<00:02:58.689> probably<00:02:58.959> one<00:02:59.079> of

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
the exhaust porting was probably one of

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.929 
the exhaust porting was probably one of
the<00:02:59.260> main<00:02:59.439> changes<00:02:59.680> we<00:03:00.519> found<00:03:00.760> some

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
the main changes we found some

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.670 
the main changes we found some
technology<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.540> could<00:03:01.840> get<00:03:02.019> inside<00:03:02.409> of<00:03:02.439> the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
technology that could get inside of the

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.369 
technology that could get inside of the
engine<00:03:03.010> get<00:03:03.189> into<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.489> cylinder<00:03:03.939> and<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:05.200> see

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
engine get into the cylinder and and see

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.899 
engine get into the cylinder and and see
what<00:03:05.530> was<00:03:05.650> going<00:03:05.919> on<00:03:06.069> inside<00:03:06.250> of<00:03:06.489> there<00:03:06.760> so

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
what was going on inside of there so

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.309 
what was going on inside of there so
that<00:03:06.939> was<00:03:07.120> probably<00:03:07.419> the<00:03:07.540> main<00:03:07.719> change<00:03:08.079> and

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
that was probably the main change and

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.670 
that was probably the main change and
that<00:03:08.829> resulted<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:09.900> similar<00:03:10.900> part<00:03:11.169> to<00:03:11.379> what<00:03:11.500> we

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
that resulted in similar part to what we

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.929 
that resulted in similar part to what we
have<00:03:11.829> we've<00:03:12.010> always<00:03:12.159> been<00:03:12.430> known<00:03:12.579> for<00:03:12.639> having
