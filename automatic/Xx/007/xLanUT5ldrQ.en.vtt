it<00:00:00.089> was<00:00:00.210> Apollo<00:00:00.870> 17<00:00:02.810> now<00:00:03.810> in<00:00:04.259> particular<00:00:04.589> and

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
it was Apollo 17 now in particular and

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.360 
it was Apollo 17 now in particular and
this<00:00:05.130> one<00:00:05.339> we've<00:00:05.490> got<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:06.180> man<00:00:06.870> as<00:00:07.259> reflected<00:00:08.160> in

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
this one we've got a man as reflected in

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.620 
this one we've got a man as reflected in
the<00:00:08.550> visor<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.660> astronaut<00:00:10.170> here<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:11.630> the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
the visor of the astronaut here and the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.410 
the visor of the astronaut here and the
reflection<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:14.400> man<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.059> can<00:00:15.150> see

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
reflection of the man that you can see

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.730 
reflection of the man that you can see
here<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:16.279> not<00:00:17.279> wearing<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.119> PLA<00:00:18.840> CS<00:00:19.109> backpack

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
here is not wearing a PLA CS backpack

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.130 
here is not wearing a PLA CS backpack
and<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.609> would<00:00:20.789> say<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.330> big<00:00:21.539> backpacks

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
and I would say that the big backpacks

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.859 
and I would say that the big backpacks
that<00:00:22.350> they<00:00:22.470> wear<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:22.920> here<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> astronauts

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
that they wear on here the astronauts

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.130 
that they wear on here the astronauts
obviously<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.220> probe<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:27.140> pressurized

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
obviously the probe the pressurized

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.800 
obviously the probe the pressurized
their<00:00:28.429> suits<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:30.150> obviously<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
their suits and obviously all that the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.630 
their suits and obviously all that the
breathing<00:00:31.199> apparatus<00:00:31.320> as<00:00:31.890> well<00:00:32.070> they<00:00:32.430> also

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
breathing apparatus as well they also

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.709 
breathing apparatus as well they also
they<00:00:32.880> keep<00:00:33.030> them<00:00:33.210> cool<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.710> their<00:00:34.980> suits

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
they keep them cool and so their suits

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.530 
they keep them cool and so their suits
circulating<00:00:36.719> water<00:00:37.430> so<00:00:38.430> what<00:00:39.180> we'll<00:00:39.329> do<00:00:39.450> is

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
circulating water so what we'll do is

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.720 
circulating water so what we'll do is
we're<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> place<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> look<00:00:40.950> here<00:00:41.489> on

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
we're just have a place a look here on

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.760 
we're just have a place a look here on
the<00:00:42.620> astronaut's<00:00:44.450> helmet<00:00:46.340> see<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.550> image

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
the astronaut's helmet see the image

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:58.880 
the astronaut's helmet see the image
coming<00:00:49.770> through

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.520 

see<00:00:59.730> that<00:01:01.190> image<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.460> air<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.870> reflector

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
see that image the air of a reflector

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.810 
see that image the air of a reflector
which<00:01:04.649> is<00:01:04.799> obviously<00:01:05.129> meant<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.430> be<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
which is obviously meant to be in the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.130 
which is obviously meant to be in the
other<00:01:05.909> astronauts<00:01:06.619> supposedly<00:01:08.390> now<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
other astronauts supposedly now the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.620 
other astronauts supposedly now the
figure<00:01:10.740> isn't<00:01:11.100> distorted<00:01:11.970> at<00:01:12.090> all<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.509> can

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
figure isn't distorted at all so you can

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050 
figure isn't distorted at all so you can
actually<00:01:12.780> make<00:01:13.680> out<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.490> normal<00:01:14.790> legs

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
actually make out the the normal legs

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.820 
actually make out the the normal legs
there<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:16.680> arm<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> head<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:19.259> strangely

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
there the arm and the head but strangely

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.990 
there the arm and the head but strangely
we<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:21.270> not<00:01:21.479> see<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:22.289> big<00:01:22.649> large<00:01:23.100> backpack

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
we do not see the big large backpack

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.669 
we do not see the big large backpack
that<00:01:24.210> should<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.929> the<00:01:25.170> reflection

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
that should be there and the reflection

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.289 
that should be there and the reflection
it's<00:01:26.280> not<00:01:26.429> coming<00:01:26.640> through<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:27.210> that

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
it's not coming through what that

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.620 
it's not coming through what that
actually<00:01:27.600> looks<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:27.929> is<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.640> just<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.789> man<00:01:30.270> with

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
actually looks like is a just a man with

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.090 
actually looks like is a just a man with
no<00:01:31.319> helmet<00:01:31.649> unity<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.340> face<00:01:32.789> is<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.210> like

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
no helmet unity the face is just like

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.490 
no helmet unity the face is just like
someone<00:01:35.100> wearing<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.700> white<00:01:36.500> sleeveless

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
someone wearing a white sleeveless

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.840 
someone wearing a white sleeveless
jacket<00:01:38.959> with<00:01:39.959> a<00:01:40.110> hood<00:01:40.289> on<00:01:40.319> it<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.520> obviously

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
jacket with a hood on it and obviously

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.270 
jacket with a hood on it and obviously
big<00:01:42.030> boots<00:01:42.470> but<00:01:43.470> there's<00:01:43.740> definitely<00:01:43.890> no

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
big boots but there's definitely no

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.740 
big boots but there's definitely no
backpack<00:01:44.759> here<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:46.069> will<00:01:47.069> just<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.310> it

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
backpack here I will just do it

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.449 
backpack here I will just do it
should<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> look<00:01:49.380> at<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> figure

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
should we just have a look at the figure

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:59.539 
should we just have a look at the figure
again<00:01:52.130> see<00:01:53.130> they're<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:54.270> big<00:01:54.539> backpack

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.630 

and<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.799> comparison<00:02:01.799> here<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.399> another

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and in a comparison here and another

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.910 
and in a comparison here and another
Apollo<00:02:03.149> 17<00:02:03.689> photo<00:02:03.990> which<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.409> one<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.649> pole

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
Apollo 17 photo which this one is pole

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.180 
Apollo 17 photo which this one is pole
17<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.020> as<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.259> see<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.590> size<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.190> this

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
17 and as you can see the size of this

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.580 
17 and as you can see the size of this
backpack<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.580> they<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:12.379> is<00:02:13.379> actually

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
backpack that they have is actually

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.640 
backpack that they have is actually
quite<00:02:13.860> large<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:14.730> it's<00:02:15.060> not<00:02:15.810> here<00:02:16.170> in<00:02:16.560> the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
quite large but it's not here in the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.890 
quite large but it's not here in the
reflection<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:18.150> individual<00:02:18.780> this

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
reflection of this individual this

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.240 
reflection of this individual this
suppose<00:02:19.319> Elizabeth<00:02:19.830> II<00:02:19.890> with<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.069> over

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
suppose Elizabeth II with the over

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.559 
suppose Elizabeth II with the over
astronaut<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:24.650> obviously<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:26.569> someone

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
astronaut so this obviously is someone

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.589 
astronaut so this obviously is someone
else<00:02:27.750> helping<00:02:28.200> out<00:02:28.379> just<00:02:29.599> slightly

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
else helping out just slightly

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.800 
else helping out just slightly
represented<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.769> white<00:02:31.980> outfit<00:02:32.810> helping

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
represented in the white outfit helping

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.490 
represented in the white outfit helping
out<00:02:33.900> with<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.110> filming<00:02:34.470> but<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.579> obviously

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
out with the filming but is obviously

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.740 
out with the filming but is obviously
not<00:02:37.500> an<00:02:37.860> astronaut<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:39.000> does<00:02:39.209> not<00:02:39.360> have<00:02:39.599> this

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
not an astronaut that does not have this

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.750 
not an astronaut that does not have this
big<00:02:39.989> pack<00:02:40.440> on<00:02:41.280> his<00:02:41.400> back<00:02:42.380> so<00:02:43.380> mmm<00:02:44.010> definitely

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
big pack on his back so mmm definitely

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.289 
big pack on his back so mmm definitely
shows<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:46.049> was<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.890> film<00:02:47.700> studio
