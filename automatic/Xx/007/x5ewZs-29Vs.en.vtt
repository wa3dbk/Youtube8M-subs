00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.950
 the engine parts are inside the 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.610
 engine block means that reaches 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.470
 manufactured to the company here is auctioned the 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.280
 diameter of the cylinders by which 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.560
 raise and lower the pistons 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.010
 a cross pattern is carved in its 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.200
 interior walls the oil lubricated 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.530
 so that the pistons move with 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.530
 smoothness 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.610
 while this the engine block travels 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.610
 up to the assembly line 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.640
 When a scanner arrives it records the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.770
 tracking code that allows you to follow 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.770
 the track to the block during its production 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.350
 the devices of the line control 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.350
 that the pieces are installed properly 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.150
 meanwhile the little crankshaft is created 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.760
 to little 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.130
 the crankshaft is a bar that rotates with the 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.659
 movement of the pistons 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.460
 when turning transmit power to the motor on 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.360
 crankshaft is born from a steel block 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.310
 wrought 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.100
 the mechanical arms take it from 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.110
 station in station is not finished 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.110
 until having gone through 20 machines 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.000
 Y 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.180
 then a toothed disc installs 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.180
 steel ring 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.590
 it warms up and pushes against 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.290
 crankshaft when it is cold it shrinks and 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.030
 fits this ring contributes in the 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.310
 combustion cycle 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.709
 when turning the teeth they go through a sensor 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.360
 that reads the position of the crankshaft and 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.440
 signals the engine to activate the spark plug in 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.440
 the precise moment 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.800
 Now the crankshaft is balanced if it is 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.200
 off-center the engine vibrates a computer 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.120
 analyzes the turn and determines if there is 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.750
 drill it at certain points to 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.750
 balance it 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.380
 on the assembly line they are given the 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.260
 back to engine blocks 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.600
 a robot lubricates the bearings in the 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.630
 that will turn the crankshaft and place it in its 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.630
 place 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.250
 of the pistons are 6 because this engine 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.250
 has 6 cylinders 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.130
 why 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.990
 that are made of aluminum and it 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.990
 install in the diameter of the cylinders 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.110
 a steel connecting rod joins the pistons to 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.110
 crankshaft 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.879
 Now you can cover the back of this 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.739
 It is sealed with silicone and screwed 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.760
 manually with a shaft gun 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.760
 multiple torsion 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.140
 in another line the two tanks are mounted 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.459
 which will cover the upper part applies 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.560
 to an adhesive to the spark plug tubes 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.560
 before inserting them into the cylinder heads 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.420
 i 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:52.090
 the cylinder heads cover the cylinders in each 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.310
 one of which is inserted a spark plug and 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.590
 four valves and two to mix the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.390
 fuel and two to eject the 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.700
 gases 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.670
 the tubes that go from side to side are the 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:08.670
 camshafts the parts that open and 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.670
 they close those valves there are 4 x motor 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.200
 It is sealed and screwed to the lid 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.450
 front of the engine block on the 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.459
 timing belt that connects the 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.209
 crankshaft to camshafts for 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:24.070
 rotate in unison so the valves are 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.070
 open according to the position of the pistons 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.020
 I have complicated everything on the next occasion 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.020
 we will lift the plug
