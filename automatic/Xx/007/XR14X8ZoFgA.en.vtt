the song but more importantly what I'm
going<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.980> do<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.190> I'm<00:01:35.310> also<00:01:35.460> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.790> show

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
going to do is I'm also going to show

going to do is I'm also going to show
you<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.450> arranging<00:01:36.930> techniques<00:01:37.410> that<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.030> used

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you the arranging techniques that I used

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.260 
you the arranging techniques that I used
to<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.630> able<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.870> create<00:01:40.260> this<00:01:40.530> arrangement

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
to be able to create this arrangement

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.780 
to be able to create this arrangement
for<00:01:42.270> instance<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:43.190> example<00:01:44.190> here<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.580> when<00:01:44.760> I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
for instance one example here is when I

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.210 
for instance one example here is when I
was<00:01:47.240> when<00:01:48.240> I'm<00:01:48.360> going<00:01:48.750> up<00:01:48.870> this<00:01:49.220> diminished

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
was when I'm going up this diminished

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.250 
was when I'm going up this diminished
chord<00:01:50.580> this<00:01:50.730> b-flat<00:01:51.210> diminished<00:01:51.660> you<00:01:51.990> can

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
chord this b-flat diminished you can

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.780 
chord this b-flat diminished you can
follow<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:54.710> melody<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:56.070> using<00:01:56.520> these

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
follow the melody up using these

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.720 
follow the melody up using these
diminished<00:01:57.510> chord<00:01:58.170> shells<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.280> okay

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
diminished chord shells like this okay

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.370 
diminished chord shells like this okay
so<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.360> see<00:02:00.510> that<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> chord<00:02:00.990> shell<00:02:01.230> is

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
so you see that the chord shell is

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.320 
so you see that the chord shell is
that's<00:02:01.620> your<00:02:01.800> B<00:02:01.980> flat<00:02:02.010> diminished<00:02:02.490> chord<00:02:02.910> you

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
that's your B flat diminished chord you

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.760 
that's your B flat diminished chord you
want<00:02:03.510> to<00:02:03.570> remember<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.900> B<00:02:04.230> flat<00:02:04.440> diminished

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
want to remember that B flat diminished

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.219 
want to remember that B flat diminished
is<00:02:05.010> also<00:02:05.310> d<00:02:05.520> flat<00:02:05.760> diminished<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.690> also<00:02:06.870> a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
is also d flat diminished it's also a

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.990 
is also d flat diminished it's also a
diminished<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:07.979> also<00:02:08.250> G<00:02:08.580> diminished

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
diminished and it's also G diminished

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.150 
diminished and it's also G diminished
meaning<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.350> diminished<00:02:10.890> chord

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
meaning that that one diminished chord

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.979 
meaning that that one diminished chord
or<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.700> should<00:02:12.000> say<00:02:12.120> those<00:02:12.300> four<00:02:12.570> diminished

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
or I should say those four diminished

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.370 
or I should say those four diminished
chords<00:02:13.410> all<00:02:13.920> share<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.730> same<00:02:14.910> notes<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:16.020> when

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
chords all share the same notes so when

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.870 
chords all share the same notes so when
you<00:02:16.470> have<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.770> diminished<00:02:17.190> line<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.730> can

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
you have that diminished line you can

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.290 
you have that diminished line you can
actually<00:02:18.150> move<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:20.640> can<00:02:21.000> move<00:02:21.150> that

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
actually move that you can move that

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.350 
actually move that you can move that
diminished<00:02:21.780> chord<00:02:22.050> shell<00:02:22.350> up<00:02:22.560> with<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.340> lines

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.580 

and<00:02:29.360> we're<00:02:29.630> also<00:02:29.750> using<00:02:30.080> some<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.440> these

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
and we're also using some of these

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.160 
and we're also using some of these
quarrel<00:02:31.099> voicings<00:02:31.550> like<00:02:31.700> on<00:02:31.849> this<00:02:31.970> d7<00:02:32.660> that's

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
quarrel voicings like on this d7 that's

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.680 
quarrel voicings like on this d7 that's
a<00:02:33.260> root<00:02:33.470> third<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.040> 7th<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.640> 13th<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.450> ninth

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
a root third the 7th the 13th and ninth

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.309 
a root third the 7th the 13th and ninth
and<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.380> fifth<00:02:36.880> okay<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.480> talked<00:02:38.870> about<00:02:39.110> all

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
and the fifth okay so I talked about all

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.400 
and the fifth okay so I talked about all
of<00:02:39.349> this<00:02:39.590> in<00:02:39.800> this<00:02:40.130> lesson<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:42.080> there's<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.260> lot

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
of this in this lesson so there's a lot

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.229 
of this in this lesson so there's a lot
of<00:02:42.459> arranging<00:02:43.459> techniques<00:02:43.910> that<00:02:44.120> you'll

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
of arranging techniques that you'll

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.260 
of arranging techniques that you'll
learn<00:02:44.569> as<00:02:44.900> well<00:02:45.190> we<00:02:46.190> do<00:02:46.340> go<00:02:46.520> very<00:02:46.760> slow<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.150> can

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
learn as well we do go very slow you can

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.270 
learn as well we do go very slow you can
hear<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.660> was<00:02:47.840> just<00:02:48.050> practicing<00:02:48.800> it<00:02:48.950> or<00:02:49.100> just

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
hear I was just practicing it or just

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.000 
hear I was just practicing it or just
playing<00:02:49.489> it<00:02:49.640> for<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:49.850> at<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.000> very<00:02:50.030> slow<00:02:50.569> tempo

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
playing it for you at a very slow tempo

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.770 
playing it for you at a very slow tempo
so<00:02:52.010> it's<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.550> also<00:02:52.760> have<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.150> drumbeat<00:02:53.450> that

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
so it's you also have the drumbeat that

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.479 
so it's you also have the drumbeat that
you<00:02:53.840> can<00:02:53.989> play<00:02:54.140> along<00:02:54.260> with<00:02:54.560> yeah<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:54.980> know<00:02:55.160> it's

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
you can play along with yeah I know it's

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.009 
you can play along with yeah I know it's
not<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.790> best<00:02:56.030> drum<00:02:56.330> beat<00:02:56.510> in<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.690> world<00:02:56.840> but

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
not the best drum beat in the world but

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.809 
not the best drum beat in the world but
it<00:02:57.110> does<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.410> job<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.680> it's<00:02:58.040> it's<00:02:58.310> functional

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
it does the job and it's it's functional

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:59.729 
it does the job and it's it's functional
and<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.000> sounds<00:02:59.300> nice

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
and it sounds nice

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.080 
and it sounds nice
so<00:03:00.739> anyway<00:03:00.980> I<00:03:01.160> hope<00:03:01.400> you'll<00:03:01.610> join<00:03:01.670> me<00:03:01.880> in<00:03:02.030> the
