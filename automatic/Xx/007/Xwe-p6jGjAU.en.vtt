00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.670
 and now we're going to talk about the removal 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.660
 of the vehicle is already another measure 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.619
 administrative 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.310
 Let's see the removal consists of removing 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.279
 the vehicle from where you are 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.420
 leading to the accredited courtyard or to 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.090
 the deposit 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.699
 This is because with the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.660
 remove the vehicle from the place where it 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.200
 is found 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.559
 we will see the removal occur when the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.270
 vehicle is parked in disagreement 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.480
 with legislation 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.550
 I want you guys to note that's it. 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:52.469
 you leave the word well highlighted 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:57.480
 stationed 99% of the time in your 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:00.440
 evidence of vehicle removal 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.920
 the problem is related to 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.670
 parking 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:11.210
 I will repeat the grade in 99% of the time 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.549
 in your test fall some question 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.750
 mentioning removal of vehicle 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.330
 the problem is related to 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.720
 parking and kept it great 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.060
 and here we have the exception has a type 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.829
 of parking that does not give the 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.900
 which is when the vehicle is 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.850
 parked on guard against it 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.850
 all irregular parking 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.700
 it will only remove the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.369
 hand against the parking is not 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.570
 will give the removal 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.659
 There are a lot of people who send me e-mails. 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.939
 asking why removal does not occur 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.979
 when the vehicle was against 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.619
 the Brazilian traffic code 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.100
 Brazilian law does not explain why 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.850
 in this case no 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.210
 explains 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.150
 simply states that there will be no 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.460
 removal 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.190
 when he's on the opposite side now 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.410
 my understanding, I conclude that the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.890
 vehicle on the other hand 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.160
 it is not in a prohibited place and 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.200
 against the hand here only justifying is for 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.790
 the two-way and half way 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.650
 driver was parking the vehicle on the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.210
 right of the village parked there from the side 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.970
 left of the road 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.580
 and if on the left side of the track is 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.560
 allowed to park with vehicle 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.390
 turn in the direction of traffic 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.580
 the fact is that it is parked from the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.520
 turn counterclockwise is not 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.590
 occupying no place that comes to harm 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.840
 forbidden local traffic 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.590
 only his own positioning that is 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.310
 wrong 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.830
 the fine will occur the vehicle will be 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.480
 fined for irregular parking 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.870
 but the removal in this case will not occur 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.800
 It's clear, it's great, there are still two 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.620
 other situations where 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.130
 removal of the vehicle when the vehicle is 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.380
 mobilizing on the road for lack of 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.970
 then fuel in vehicle 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.320
 immobilized on the road for lack of 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.120
 fuel has nothing to do with 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.160
 parking but the removal occurs and 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.920
 also when the penalty is applied 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.739
 of vehicle seizure 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.080
 see if the vehicle has been seized 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.930
 certainly need to be taken to the 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.380
 patio where you will be seized 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.140
 in this case it will be in tea du he will be 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.190
 removed where it is and taken to the patio 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.170
 then occurs concurrently 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.959
 seizure removal 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.430
 Of course there are exceptions every rule has 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:57.340
 exceptions but I say that 80% of the time 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:02.590
 in which there is seizure the vehicle 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:05.950
 will also suffer counter-attack removal 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.340
 exceptions that do not see the case but 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.160
 there are yes I believe that five four 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.079
 or five situations where the vehicle will be 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.230
 seized and removal will not take place. 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.400
 concomitant 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.400
 the seizure
