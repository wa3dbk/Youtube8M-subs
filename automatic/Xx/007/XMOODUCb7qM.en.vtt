hinge<00:00:23.710> across<00:00:24.160> those<00:00:25.150> just<00:00:25.449> gonna<00:00:25.660> last<00:00:25.869> very

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
hinge across those just gonna last very

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.320 
hinge across those just gonna last very
long<00:00:26.320> so<00:00:27.010> the<00:00:27.130> good<00:00:27.310> durability<00:00:27.670> factor<00:00:28.090> is

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
long so the good durability factor is

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.910 
long so the good durability factor is
what<00:00:28.480> you're<00:00:28.630> saying<00:00:28.779> very<00:00:29.050> exactly<00:00:29.740> you<00:00:29.859> have

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
what you're saying very exactly you have

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.630 
what you're saying very exactly you have
longevity<00:00:30.279> and<00:00:31.320> life<00:00:32.320> expectancy<00:00:32.739> of<00:00:33.220> that<00:00:33.460> is

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
longevity and life expectancy of that is

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.729 
longevity and life expectancy of that is
just<00:00:33.820> going<00:00:33.940> to<00:00:34.030> be<00:00:34.150> amazing<00:00:34.420> that's<00:00:35.290> usually

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739

the tail area that's we believe we've
got<00:00:42.219> that<00:00:42.610> problem<00:00:42.820> solved<00:00:43.390> this<00:00:43.660> trail<00:00:43.989> how

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
got that problem solved this trail how

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.440 
got that problem solved this trail how
long<00:00:44.860> has<00:00:44.950> just<00:00:45.100> fit<00:00:45.250> in<00:00:45.340> the<00:00:45.489> process<00:00:46.329> the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
long has just fit in the process the

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.700 
long has just fit in the process the
engineering<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.079> everything<00:00:47.350> else<00:00:47.469> to<00:00:47.559> come

engineering and everything else to come

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.150 
engineering and everything else to come
up<00:00:47.829> with<00:00:47.980> this<00:00:48.629> about<00:00:49.629> three<00:00:49.930> years<00:00:50.170> we

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
up with this about three years we

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.850 
up with this about three years we
started<00:00:51.789> with<00:00:51.969> the<00:00:52.149> trailer<00:00:53.050> last<00:00:53.230> year<00:00:53.680> and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
started with the trailer last year and

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.040 
started with the trailer last year and
it<00:00:54.100> made<00:00:54.489> several<00:00:54.969> changes<00:00:55.120> on<00:00:55.690> it<00:00:55.870> and<00:00:55.989> the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
it made several changes on it and the

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.599 
it made several changes on it and the
hinges<00:00:56.350> were<00:00:56.500> one<00:00:56.649> of<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:56.829> big<00:00:57.010> updates<00:00:57.399> that

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
hinges were one of the big updates that

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.430 
hinges were one of the big updates that
we<00:00:57.730> did<00:00:57.940> just

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
we did just

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.349 
we did just
three<00:01:01.440> year<00:01:01.590> process<00:01:01.910> probably<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.090> little

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
three year process probably a little

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.609 
three year process probably a little
longer<00:01:03.600> than<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.899> because<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.379> started

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
longer than that because we started

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.830 
longer than that because we started
talking<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.220> our<00:01:05.369> customers<00:01:05.940> and<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.690> don't

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
talking with our customers and you don't

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.240 
talking with our customers and you don't
get<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.140> ideas<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.530> they<00:01:07.830> thought<00:01:08.100> were

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
get the ideas that they thought were

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.340 
get the ideas that they thought were
important<00:01:08.850> also<00:01:09.720> there's<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.960> good<00:01:10.110> customer

we've talked about doing more of a
formal<00:01:35.369> thing<00:01:35.399> did<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:35.940> do<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.649> with<00:01:37.649> low<00:01:37.979> key

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
formal thing did we do that with low key

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.130 
formal thing did we do that with low key
with<00:01:38.429> you<00:01:38.490> know<00:01:38.789> mostly<00:01:39.149> informal<00:01:39.810> right<00:01:39.960> now

our left side by side you can actually

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.130 
our left side by side you can actually
tie<00:03:15.489> in<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.760> center<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:16.599> you<00:03:16.629> can<00:03:16.780> tie<00:03:16.959> all

this trailer it obviously safety is a
big<00:03:56.810> concern<00:03:57.530> when<00:03:58.010> they<00:03:58.099> built<00:03:58.370> this<00:03:58.549> we<00:03:59.090> have

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
big concern when they built this we have

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.850 
big concern when they built this we have
lights<00:03:59.569> that<00:03:59.810> show<00:04:00.049> when<00:04:00.230> you're<00:04:00.349> locked<00:04:00.560> and
