00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.270 
seems to be a lot harder to take out
when<00:01:32.549> shooting<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.960> lot<00:01:34.140> more

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
when shooting on so it's a lot more

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.609 
when shooting on so it's a lot more
valuable<00:01:35.280> than<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> model<00:01:36.180> for<00:01:36.360> 3<00:01:36.619> now

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
valuable than it was a model for 3 now

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.230 
valuable than it was a model for 3 now
holding<00:01:38.070> our<00:01:38.130> choke<00:01:38.400> point<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.030> thing

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
holding our choke point with this thing

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.969 
holding our choke point with this thing
is<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.570> really<00:01:39.930> useful<00:01:40.470> you're<00:01:40.740> getting<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
is really really useful you're getting a

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.010 
is really really useful you're getting a
whole<00:01:41.189> lot<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.460> kills<00:01:41.670> night<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.390> trust

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
whole lot of kills night and and trust

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.719 
whole lot of kills night and and trust
me<00:01:43.110> that's<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.890> thing<00:01:44.070> that's<00:01:44.189> really<00:01:44.460> true

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
me that's one thing that's really true

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.859 
me that's one thing that's really true
in<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.939> game<00:01:45.119> you're<00:01:45.329> getting<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> whole<00:01:45.840> lot

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
in this game you're getting a whole lot

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.510 
in this game you're getting a whole lot
of<00:01:46.110> kills<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.470> as<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.920> guys<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.399> on

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
of kills and as you guys can see it on

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.520 
of kills and as you guys can see it on
the<00:01:47.759> screen<00:01:47.790> pretty<00:01:48.659> much<00:01:48.840> how<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.049> works<00:01:49.350> is

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the screen pretty much how it works is

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.530 
the screen pretty much how it works is
that<00:01:49.560> once<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> enemy<00:01:50.759> gets<00:01:50.880> close<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.390> it

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
that once the enemy gets close to it it

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.870 
that once the enemy gets close to it it
gets<00:01:51.899> sort<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> trigger<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.640> pops

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
gets sort of like a trigger and it pops

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.429 
gets sort of like a trigger and it pops
up<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> rocket<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.960> pretty<00:01:55.170> much<00:01:55.200> goes

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
up the rocket and pretty much goes

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.350 
up the rocket and pretty much goes
targeting<00:01:55.979> at<00:01:56.070> them<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.549> kills<00:01:56.759> them<00:01:56.939> so

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
targeting at them and kills them so

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.850 
targeting at them and kills them so
obviously<00:01:57.750> holding<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.170> objective<00:01:58.619> points

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
obviously holding on objective points

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.160 
obviously holding on objective points
and<00:01:58.979> choke<00:01:59.250> points<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.670> very<00:02:00.240> valuable<00:02:00.689> with

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and choke points are very valuable with

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.840 
and choke points are very valuable with
this<00:02:01.350> kill<00:02:01.590> streak<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.040> if<00:02:02.399> plays<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
this kill streak and if plays in the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.459 
this kill streak and if plays in the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
right manner this kills you could be an

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.289

games and dominate other teams so that's

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.210 
games and dominate other teams so that's
pretty<00:02:09.599> much<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> breakdown<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> IMS

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
blitz I use it often to hold down the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.970 
blitz I use it often to hold down the
objective<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:19.080> becomes<00:02:19.410> really<00:02:19.680> really

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
objective and it becomes really really
