AK<00:00:12.960> with<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.590> 305

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
AK with the 305

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.800 
AK with the 305
the<00:00:15.299> hood<00:00:15.509> horns<00:00:16.609> so<00:00:17.609> first<00:00:17.970> question<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.510> have

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
the hood horns so first question is have

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.779 
the hood horns so first question is have
you<00:00:18.990> ever<00:00:19.020> started<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.859> carbureted<00:00:20.369> vehicle

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
you ever started a carbureted vehicle

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.370 
you ever started a carbureted vehicle
before<00:00:22.699> huh<00:00:23.699> well<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.359> guess<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.990> basically

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
before huh well I guess it basically

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.080 
before huh well I guess it basically
means<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:25.769> not<00:00:25.949> fuel-injected<00:00:26.670> if<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:26.970> know

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
means it's not fuel-injected if you know

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.089 
means it's not fuel-injected if you know
what<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.210> means

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
what that means

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.919 
what that means
so<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.250> means<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.670> start<00:00:29.939> them<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
so that means to start them you have to

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.930 
so that means to start them you have to
pump<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> pedal<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:32.279> thing<00:00:32.550> hasn't<00:00:32.759> been

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
pump the pedal this thing hasn't been

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.630 
pump the pedal this thing hasn't been
started<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.390> three<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:33.719> four<00:00:33.899> weeks<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:35.250> we

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
started for three or four weeks so we

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.790 
started for three or four weeks so we
have<00:00:35.760> no<00:00:35.940> idea<00:00:36.270> if<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.840> start<00:00:37.110> no

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
have no idea if it's going to start no

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.860 
have no idea if it's going to start no
idea<00:00:38.100> if<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.489> need<00:00:38.640> maximum<00:00:39.030> pump<00:00:39.450> age<00:00:39.629> or<00:00:39.840> a

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
idea if we need maximum pump age or a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.350 
idea if we need maximum pump age or a
little<00:00:40.079> bit<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.290> random<00:00:40.649> pump<00:00:40.860> age<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:42.000> we'll

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
little bit of random pump age but we'll

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.690 
little bit of random pump age but we'll
work<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.200> sec<00:00:43.410> hop<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.250> we'll

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
work on that just a sec hop in and we'll

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.529 
work on that just a sec hop in and we'll
see<00:00:44.730> how<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.180> here<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.360> take<00:00:50.239> are<00:00:51.239> you

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
see how what is here to take are you

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.389 
see how what is here to take are you
ready

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
ready

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.920

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
no give it some good heart maximum pump

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.850 
no give it some good heart maximum pump
age<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:12.689> all<00:01:12.810> righty<00:01:13.200> now<00:01:14.360> this<00:01:15.360> machine's

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
age and all righty now this machine's

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.969 
age and all righty now this machine's
old-fashioned<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.070> has<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> choke<00:01:17.549> okay

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
old-fashioned so it has a choke okay

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.100 
old-fashioned so it has a choke okay
that<00:01:19.979> means<00:01:20.360> you<00:01:21.360> move<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.780> little

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
that means you move this little

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.050 
that means you move this little
lawnmower<00:01:22.770> leaver<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.130> hooked<00:01:23.400> up<00:01:23.549> all<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.939> way

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
lawnmower leaver I hooked up all the way

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.420 
lawnmower leaver I hooked up all the way
to<00:01:24.090> stop<00:01:24.479> position<00:01:26.360> there<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.509> go<00:01:28.130> is<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.189> all

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
to stop position there you go is it all

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.830 
to stop position there you go is it all
the<00:01:29.549> way<00:01:29.640> over<00:01:29.790> yeah<00:01:30.860> all<00:01:31.860> right<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:32.840> you're

the way over yeah all right now you're

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.600 
the way over yeah all right now you're
gonna<00:01:33.990> turn<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.439> key<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.979> go<00:01:35.100> around<00:01:35.189> rammer

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
gonna turn that key and go around rammer

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.140 
gonna turn that key and go around rammer
and<00:01:36.259> see<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.619> start<00:01:38.030> hold<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
and see if it's going to start hold the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.530 
and see if it's going to start hold the
forecast<00:01:39.540> down<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.200> tiny<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:41.000> okay<00:01:42.030> start

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
forecast down just a tiny bit okay start

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.030 
forecast down just a tiny bit okay start
turning<00:01:44.780> harder

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.830 

stop<00:01:51.240> pump<00:01:52.240> it<00:01:52.390> give<00:01:52.570> us<00:01:52.600> some<00:01:52.840> more<00:01:52.990> pump<00:01:53.230> egde

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
stop pump it give us some more pump egde

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.780 
stop pump it give us some more pump egde
okay

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
okay

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:05.520 
okay
turn<00:01:57.790> that<00:01:58.000> key<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.270> crank<00:01:58.630> again<00:02:04.350> hope<00:02:05.350> it's

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
turn that key and crank again hope it's

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.359 
turn that key and crank again hope it's
not<00:02:05.650> out<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:05.830> gas<00:02:06.990> could<00:02:07.990> be<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.410> little<00:02:09.250> bit

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
not out of gas could be a little bit

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:50.340 
not out of gas could be a little bit
more<00:02:09.520> pump<00:02:14.340> next<00:02:15.340> try<00:02:26.310> okay<00:02:27.310> stop<00:02:49.170> more<00:02:50.170> give

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
more pump next try okay stop more give

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.920 
more pump next try okay stop more give
it<00:02:50.470> some<00:02:50.650> more<00:02:50.770> pump<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:52.120> got<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.390> choke<00:02:52.570> open

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
it some more pump we got the choke open

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:02.750 
it some more pump we got the choke open
a<00:02:52.989> bit<00:02:53.140> now<00:02:53.340> try<00:02:54.340> again<00:02:56.190> yep

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.820 

I<00:03:02.790> think<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.629> last<00:03:03.840> person<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.230> used<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.680> ran

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
I think the last person that used it ran

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.430 
I think the last person that used it ran
out<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.010> gas<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:06.000> guess<00:03:06.870> we<00:03:06.959> probably<00:03:07.170> got<00:03:07.349> to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
out of gas so I guess we probably got to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.949 
out of gas so I guess we probably got to
