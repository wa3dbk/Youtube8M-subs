00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.520
 wackel candidates looks like speak 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.619
 Schmelzer Götze and Gündogan were able to 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.250
 the coach showed the prospect that 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.529
 You can play your load dual 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.460
 screen is white candidate from smelter 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.460

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.820
 Magdalena Brzeska is turning and spinning 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.019
 when stopping with the timetable 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.149

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.129
 called in jumps swinging 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.570
 Hopes and twelve, they probably equal 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.890
 Put the stick away and start again 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.570
 Yes, yes, channels are also decisive 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.699
 but times are you's they are the thing 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.290
 while the debris of the pre just 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.970
 bavaria sees the air play on the c 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.620
 great but then I know exactly where 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.290
 it leads her throws the thing away again 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:18.520
 also wanted to catch ground again 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:21.210

 I do not break in three-room apartment 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:34.720

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:35.700
 Thank good luck knight more jerseys of 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.110

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:46.660
 the blue Schalke the stab so 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:48.430
 bit the eyes now that the 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.380
 royal but quite a bit vulnerable 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.530
 are so many in standard situations 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.390
 matches in a dogfight, so to speak 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.130
 they did not have the air in the game 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.040
 in valencia kaffee and ajax amsterdam 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.770
 and also after another standard situation 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.200

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.280

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.020
 against the fc barcelona 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.220
 maybe you have one there 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.220
 weak spot identified 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.620
 sid 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:32.040
 I did not play while playing 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:33.690

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.820
 repeat the season abroad 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.430
 back 93 minutes at freiumschlag 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.260
 marcel schmelzer patagonia makes it 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.410
 jakub blasczykowski personnel change 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.820
 schlager meets there will be there 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.950
 Of course not satisfied though 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.320
 fans' friends what are you doing 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.690
 believe me now is enough for him 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.870
 Not 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:57.420
 the facial features to excite also the 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.150
 can fluctuate reported places and 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.500
 are completely inferior in Hamburg hsv 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.410
 only to play one to one 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.910
 the players have to listen to some where it is 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:22.010
 robert is the master of the nonsensical 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:22.010
 statistics statistics 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:39.320
 Now the whole world does not know certain 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.320
 similarity is still there 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.479
 if you have looked at the game 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.350
 The motorcycle that is well over 29 is the 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.130
 age cut certainly also one 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.669
 problem can be the one 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.080
 allow top team I found 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.180
 But the novel made pretty neat 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.680
 when you set up the morning 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.870
 horrible picture he gives but 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.710
 I do not have to say a chance 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.970
 to change something 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.620
 we have to drag him and we have to 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.570
 So we look neither how long yet 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.590
 but at the moment I am also there 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.030
 no alternative i can not 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.340
 field player is the only one of the 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.630
 have me and accordingly we have to 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.210
 we have so also nice drink 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.650
 he cheering after 14 0 goal 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.550
 leave his gate alone left too 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.509
 can not drive the trainer 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.009
 he may also play the 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:22.250
 team a bit against the 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.240
 Coach really possible as I would like 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.289
 I can look at the pictures again 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.820
 but if I have more to say, too 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:30.639
 now even no words meant that was 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.639
 Of course not today but good 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.599
 this nursery nail here by the 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.289
 league as if it were no tomorrow that is 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:47.880
 extraordinary why does bavaria do that? 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.880
 Give a player like mats hummels 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:06:04.470
 yes I have set there drenched 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:04.470
 but totally cool 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.000
 a question is not asked 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.050
 was the place assigns though you 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.050
 marcel schmelzer 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:37.100
 You can really see if he was inside 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:44.630
 or not that is what will work for me 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:47.860
 should be considered so have a fucking dirt 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.860
 I honestly do not belong in life 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.670
 on
