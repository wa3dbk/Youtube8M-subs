custom billet wheels a design that is to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.299 
custom billet wheels a design that is to
be<00:00:53.940> determined<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.659> I<00:00:54.749> will<00:00:54.949> well<00:00:55.949> you'll<00:00:56.129> see

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
be determined and I will well you'll see

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.700 
be determined and I will well you'll see
it<00:00:56.399> when<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.550> sin<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.030> then<00:00:57.659> the<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.499> motor

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it when you sin and then the the motor

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.979 
it when you sin and then the the motor
the<00:00:58.980> powertrain<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.969> all<00:01:00.359> american-made

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the powertrain is all american-made

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.020 
the powertrain is all american-made
we're<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> start<00:01:01.769> with<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.980> s<00:01:02.129> NS<00:01:02.399> 1<00:01:02.640> 11

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
we're going to start with that s NS 1 11

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.149 
we're going to start with that s NS 1 11
which<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.780> an<00:01:03.899> incredible<00:01:04.500> motor<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:05.010> got

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
which is an incredible motor it's got

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.860 
which is an incredible motor it's got
plenty<00:01:05.370> of<00:01:05.550> power<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:06.360> got<00:01:06.510> plenty<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
plenty of power it's got plenty of

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.590 
plenty of power it's got plenty of
torque<00:01:07.230> but<00:01:08.010> importantly<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:09.120> really

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
torque but importantly is it's really

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.960 
torque but importantly is it's really
smooth<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.229> has<00:01:10.590> an<00:01:10.770> even<00:01:11.190> bore<00:01:11.550> and<00:01:11.700> stroke

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
smooth it has an even bore and stroke

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.180 
smooth it has an even bore and stroke
four<00:01:12.300> nights<00:01:12.510> more<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:13.080> tonight<00:01:13.320> stroke<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
four nights more for tonight stroke the

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.470 
four nights more for tonight stroke the
motor<00:01:14.370> was<00:01:14.520> actually<00:01:14.850> designed<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
motor was actually designed to be a

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.080 
motor was actually designed to be a
bagger<00:01:15.870> replacement<00:01:16.860> motor<00:01:16.980> so<00:01:17.730> it's<00:01:17.940> got

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
bagger replacement motor so it's got

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.410 
bagger replacement motor so it's got
again<00:01:19.020> great<00:01:19.440> power<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.520> incredibly<00:01:21.090> smooth

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
again great power but incredibly smooth

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.250 
again great power but incredibly smooth
so<00:01:21.870> we<00:01:21.990> know<00:01:22.140> from<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.580> SNS<00:01:23.580> 111<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.300> baker

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
so we know from the SNS 111 a baker

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.770 
so we know from the SNS 111 a baker
transmission<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.730> know<00:01:26.850> Baker<00:01:27.330> sets<00:01:27.660> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
transmission you know Baker sets the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.530 
transmission you know Baker sets the
standards<00:01:28.230> and<00:01:28.910> transmissions<00:01:29.910> and<00:01:30.120> power

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
standards and transmissions and power

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.590 
standards and transmissions and power
trains<00:01:30.870> and<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:32.460> primary<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.150> also<00:01:33.570> a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
trains and the the primary is also a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.890 
trains and the the primary is also a
baker<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:36.180> bikes<00:01:36.330> can<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.600> some<00:01:36.750> other
