00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.010
 as well 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.420
 look at all business models that have 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.650
 I always a few weeks ago 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.150
 once again said that we are looking 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.430
 want where the future lies 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.169
 and we just found out 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.730
 the free-to-play course has disadvantages 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.110
 but also has many advantages 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.379
 a long discussion and have us 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.390
 decided just for this hybrid free 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.440
 to play model the idea is behind it 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.750
 that we got the players started 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.010
 Many players want to make it easier 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.269
 just feel quenched by it 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.620
 generally at first with the game 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.750
 because it is very very big 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.640
 download is because it is very expensive 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.199
 because it has monthly fees right now 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.280
 at games like our sap from 12 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.710
 it is sometimes a bit 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.879
 more difficult to bring people to 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.379
 to watch the game ever 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.939
 with the free to play model and also 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.650
 now with the tri to level 15 

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:00.580
 we have just the possibility the 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.500
 to tell people a look at times 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.879
 take a look without obligation plays the 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.229
 story looks at you how well and how 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.520
 deep is the story and if it is you 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.049
 really like and their endgame 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.939
 arrived we are interested in you 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.470
 then you have the opportunity with 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.920
 further options continue the game 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.159
 play 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.360
 that the idea behind it so too does the 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.890
 I had already thought so too 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.320
 times in preliminary discussions mentioned the mention 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.759
 I just play here times 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.900
 have jumped for this only 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.039
 insanely large threshold yet 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.539
 to invest money to look 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.119
 what has happened, what has changed 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.929
 what has become better in the game 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.249
 I might want to play again 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.140
 With a free to play model you can 

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:33.549
 Just say it lures yours 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.409
 character a pet and if it does 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.210
 you like the game abo model 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.770
 is still there you will continue 13 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.119
 to be able to pay euro for just about everybody 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.280
 to get features you have 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.479
 wanna do, which is actually just the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.039
 most important that you just give to the people 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.210
 simply showing what we have are proud 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.740
 on our game we are proud of that 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.060
 what we created and so 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.139
 we show the people what we have and 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.439
 if you like it you can continue 

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:52.439
 play 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.280
 That's not easy to answer 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.509
 the differences i had to guess 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.710
 I will guess a bit now 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.869
 but it is so that we still have the thing 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.649
 define the free to play model comes 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.030
 only in the autumn 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.200
 that is, where to look 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.450
 little thing you can do what can 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.580
 you do not do what I personally do 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.840
 is that the operations are not 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.400
 be available or only very 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.319
 will be available limited 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.299
 the war zones will certainly 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.099
 not just be playable or free 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.569
 maybe a certain number of times 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.250
 someone can play 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.480
 maybe if we have limitations of 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.650
 race or in the small classes 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.790
 I do not believe but the races 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.530
 maybe you can play 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.030
 where exactly the differences are like 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.440
 but it is just being defined 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.030
 I would really guess it is so 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.650
 that we want that people up 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.540
 you can play level 50 so you can 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.280
 all classes at least until level 50 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.480
 play can watch the game 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.260
 look at the story and then 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.060
 decide 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.120
 ok i would like to carry on 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.230
 I want to raiden I want to see more 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.920
 the flashpoint see whatever and 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.920
 the consumer 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.240
 give the complete system changed how 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.740
 we 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.480
 We want to bring out the problem that we 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.040
 So far we had decided that 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.690
 have other big patches out and 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.160
 These big patches are relative 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.990
 often had the problem that one 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.400
 Triviality has shifted because we 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.500
 say we bring out the patch as for 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.270
 example 1.2 afford flashpoint in it 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.740
 there is an operation in there are very 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.760
 many balance changes in it and so on 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.440
 continue and any of it 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.330
 does not work with the whole patch 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.030
 moved backwards that is unfortunately 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.500
 relatively hard happens with 1.2 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.510
 remind us of director songs the it 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.310
 just up to 1.3 did not get into the game 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.080
 and thus a bit much 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.250
 delay and we have 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.540
 we want to do it differently 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.340
 want to deliver content faster 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.660
 that means the future patches will be 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.640
 rather smaller 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.750
 but for that very regularly that means we 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.650
 want every four to six weeks as 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.700
 already been said 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.650
 I hope we can make the appointment too 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.630
 we may want to keep small 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.620
 things bring that one just says to 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.210
 for example next it will be a 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.500
 be operation that the next could 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.030
 I know your game is coming from 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.810
 that will just come and then one 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.670
 few weeks later maybe 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.230
 war zone few weeks later then 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.960
 again a flashpoint and so on and 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.070
 so on that you are always continuous 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.300
 has little things and then 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.220
 still big in between 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.900
 patches will have the but clear 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.620
 rarer than lightning and then just with 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.620
 much more content 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.760
 unfortunately I do not really know I have 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.070
 no idea I knew until just now 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.030
 I still like the operation 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.840
 just said somehow muddy 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.890
 Damn something really no more 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.420
 I do not remember the new one 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.120
 Hot but she will come in 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.470
 cancel the next weeks without names 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.470
 with a number of posts 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.729
 there will be a change that gives 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.710
 but it's always because we are 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.930
 just want to look where the balance is not 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.880
 fit 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.470
 how massive the whole thing turns out 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.940
 I really can not say yet 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.620
 but should not be too blatant what 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.820
 I just know because it's me 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.990
 player himself a bit concerned 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.960
 I've looked that is the 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.340
 powertech and his counterpart what 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.470
 again which soldier is it from the 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.990
 both on the case that the powertech 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.979
 and its counterpart 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.780
 We want to do that a bit 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.520
 to change that even more in the 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.050
 melee must because both class 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.330
 wear heavy armor have thick 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.039
 weapons and they should balance 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.479
 just have to go in danger 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.699
 At least Powertech can but at the moment 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.289
 still pretty far behind with 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.580
 Some things and there we have a few 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.990
 made small change i saw 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.270
 have that the biggest change to me 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.620
 noticed that's just some skills 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.050
 a bit changed that one 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.340
 But there must be more in the melee 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.539
 now in principle is in close combat 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.539
 will not be too much 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.849
 I can not believe the ears in secret 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:38.830
 have calls 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.270
 we lost some players there 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.709
 I do not have to rum around that 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.429
 just so happens we have massive 

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:44.080
 player lost 

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:45.729
 but we also have very many 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.139
 this will be a friend program 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.979
 actually helped in front of everyone 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:48.849
 things after we get the player 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.770
 have introduced 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.569
 he seems to motivate some people 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.759
 to have the friends there too 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.259
 it helped a lot too 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.879
 this level 15 system we said 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:59.619
 have games up to level 15 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:01.029
 That was one of the big ones, as I said 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:02.860
 hurdles i would like to see but 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:04.899
 spend after 50 euro for the player 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.279
 I do not know and that makes me strong 

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:07.360
 noticed when we came out with it and 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:09.189
 said now has a playable demo 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.629
 a look at it out there have very 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:12.729
 Many people downloaded the game and 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:15.029
 I also noticed what they are doing with it 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.029
 to have 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.340
 the top conductor fashion can come 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.830
 just say so in the camera without me 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.240
 to be ashamed of the overnight I come white 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.039
 just really not when 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.419
 I was promised that she would 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:36.590
 should be as one of the next things are 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:38.919
 which will definitely happen but no 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.919
 warranty 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.380
 I could of course 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.729
 star wars phrases down the drain but that 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.780
 I just save myself there I am 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.340
 I'm not the right one either 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.889
 thickest is any in duisburg or something 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.759
 that does not have to be 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:58.650
 on the ground, I would simply say 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:00.180
 if you enjoy the good story 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.620
 if you enjoy star wars have 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.330
 look at you or wait until it is in the 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.069
 fall free to play is then check out 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.120
 the game is worth it we have nine 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:07.770
 we could be even more new 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.849
 content and I believe that we 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.169
 a really good game 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:12.860
 that i just star wars fans 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.860
