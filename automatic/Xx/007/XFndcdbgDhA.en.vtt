00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.820
 against a person you already see the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.010
 name or alfred truck that we salute 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.199

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.219
 this challenge on our channel this 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.829
 challenge was held in the fifth round at the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.050
 fifth election round was a night of 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.430
 Swiss and then the top 8 rightly 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.590
 then the fifth was held and fifth 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.000
 challenge precisely against alfred that leads 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.070
 this beautiful team for this vdc 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.210
 2015 if we wanted to load it 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.670
 because it was a very nice challenge 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.500
 because as many very particular and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.059
 truly truly original one 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.489
 great whales or bad I all think 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.230
 that you know who is a youtuber here 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.670
 indiscretion we leave you clearly on 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.430
 his channel but I don't think there is a need 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.899
 when we first started we say 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.760
 learning to play I had followed a lot and 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.229
 he and scatter does that I have to say that I have them 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.909
 you find it very very good a lot 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.530
 prepared so anyway I think that 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.790
 you know well or bad we all have suffered 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.640
 see two teams we have his own now 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.590
 team but but wilde goti tell it mount 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.479
 hop and the beautiful always also also 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.970
 the other time evening or our dear 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.220
 friend we wish nicotra while from mine 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.530
 part remains more like a gustavo 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.530
 that is, huge mega kang chess is 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.540
 a great deal with spam over 2014 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.310
 this the 15 the cicas are used 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.049
 kanev is about my trams 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.000
 very bad star up I come back veronique 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.710
 I played 20 of my little kitty 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.689
 that nobody ever sees 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.030
 from December to this period it is therefore 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.680
 I would say not to lose further words 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.079
 as always it's going to see this 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.790
 challenge of the Novara premer challenge 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.790
 against alfredo common 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.229
 and here is pietro his sado e 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.780
 lines is who swears he is composing 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.479
 risen by great nicknames of 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.429
 tablets of micro tanga style and that 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.459
 be part of the combo we had spent 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.709
 obviously in our channel it ca n't 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.510
 taken from voices because I am 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.739
 great fan of conquests and then his 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.569
 nicknames really at the top 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.700
 edmond top is immediately blocked by a 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.799
 point blank because you were the sate 6 whips 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.750
 the sado I was afraid of a free thing 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.250
 I find that I had an aget button object 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.470
 I had already seen one 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.440
 something like that though I didn't have well 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.870
 in mind what he was going to 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.459
 do when i saw gothel enter there 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.690
 I stayed because he said shit and 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.670
 now it's point blank 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.099
 he will treat me so I was hoping he would die 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.349
 its lines are instead no great 6 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.690
 because surely you will see what I do 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.340
 will do next first of all put 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.140
 distorted area so now it's quiet 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.329
 to be faster also with god eater 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.250
 then among other things weems icot is a bit like 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.620
 a ravine therefore attacks with priority 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.690
 with the coins it was and see that 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.609
 that does and indeed vaio repeated it to me of 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.069
 ripe knew it scaro I tried to 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.780
 change I wanted to change but I knew that 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.700
 I could not change so I am now 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.590
 stuck on point blank then like a 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.180
 Donkey, if he stays in, you will always remain now 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.590
 there to make hair burn that clearly 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.329
 But what perhaps will not attack 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.829
 only works in the first round where it is 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.319
 enters the field but a warm wave enters 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.120
 who luckily sends that agreement 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.440
 that will offer but enough that no one will give me 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.910
 more annoyance however came the 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.680
 safeguard 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.040
 I know what the safeguard of the is needed 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.349
 turen boats needed because i 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.910
 my pokémon made him delicate either 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.650
 he was also speaking because he has seen 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.450
 very well my team and was not a 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.099
 I listen to the genre I saw the rhythm 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.810
 a touch and they said or verb for 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.910
 better for savory croutons 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.310
 unleash great fortin sato ho 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.829
 said but try to sacrifice 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.120
 passalacqua that I like not tonight 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.130
 he feels he hasn't seen this yet 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.870
 point-blank video in the meantime vanin 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.639
 and here is how much the safeguard is needed 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.099
 extra to be affirmed of the Lazio 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:56.620
 one of our channels on or on his 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.720
 hunger things and its live streams e 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.489
 I knew what would have happened therefore 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.260
 myth a project with the three simply 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.150
 to resist a little bit more data 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.730
 that now there was also thieves 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.689
 the program and then with the thief for 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.610
 know that Coratine 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.189
 and then another well and the other bunga here 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.959
 most four in attack and then 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.370
 we have a rhythm in a distorted area 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.590
 with four more in attack you can't 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.970
 change pokémon as a cocktail not 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.519
 lets you change pokémon not me 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.590
 I expected less my mother who risks 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.110
 in fact I knew what it would be 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.759
 dead because it is fairly fast itron 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.180
 certainly faster than heat moon top 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:33.280
 and therefore in the ko of tra dies in 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.020
 meanwhile my mega kang scan continues 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.690
 to make point blank that from a certain 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.930
 point of view was a bit of a 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:43.090
 advantage for me because I have targeted 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.460
 i except my mega kang scan could 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.350
 stay alive and then go free 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.169
 or your beautiful kitten 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.400
 very nice sealed air one that goes 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.800
 clearly I really hope I'll go to 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.630
 hyper voice not now on the reputation of saint seal 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.550
 gas I knew the soup would go 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.470
 against ganga scan because it was the most thing 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.830
 right to do but I also knew that with 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.050
 my I feel real clan voice I would have 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.199
 made out finally question later 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.760
 that four is more 4 more soup has 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.380
 reduced adapting defense and the different 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.180
 yellow very much almost certainly 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.919
 he would go to the camp but he would be born 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.570
 the probably surely understood though 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.070
 you know a good one anyway 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.000
 special defense if they do not bark good 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:25.539
 special agent enters united will be played 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.650
 great delay and always enters 20 at 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.240
 nicknames at the top 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.280
 I really saw bad feathers because 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.409
 now the mini trend is fucked up and right 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.960
 so I couldn't take it out anymore 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.320
 I could no longer melt the metal of 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.120
 wight 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.520
 I could no longer change then 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.539
 bullying had hit me and I felt 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.610
 really very very much was silvia 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:48.240
 broken noe I guess right that is specs 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.240
 the bari 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.189
 it is not that if not then it shines and I go of 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:56.250
 stu voice actor, if anything, had never a 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:58.319
 fuck I'm totally nothing however it is though 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.699
 clearly being leased is its ai 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.500
 cowboys I could just do that 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.050
 clearly I expected it and so did I 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.150
 I try to get it out got it helper for 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.229
 have a single target because how 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.699
 square entitled another video 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.560
 we can maximize the damage of 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.629
 pervoice in this case ended for you 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.180
 himself will do more harm than before 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:16.710
 landslide on that roan ue but in fact 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.729
 I manage it very well that of the 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:23.330
 safeguard spigo attack subsis on 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:26.610
 silver that I probably didn't want 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.199
 would have been better on star hector in 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.909
 this case nobody is there to say why 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:32.699
 could now be attacked with one 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:34.530
 soup and do a great deal of damage while there 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.509
 for you even if it were 6 single 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.979
 target probably maybe yes 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:39.539
 waiting for a protection of maybe you 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.919
 take another, he said yes 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:42.330
 do another csai indeed 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:43.620
 you will protect so I am prominent 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.539
 attack trying to send cup in 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.389
 examples that for eight saved me also 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:51.779
 of the sorbit root of this 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:53.460
 great star hector that maximized 

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:55.159
 but the damage I really saw 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.520
 bad the team was beautiful 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:58.199
 original 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.849
 unlike many good stuff that you 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.159
 see despite of the xix pokémon e 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:06.089
 have tripled four times over 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:07.469
 all blacks of kalos analyzes is not 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:09.240
 always a lot in ten new ones 

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:11.009
 institutions in really very original 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.779
 beautiful is looked very nice indeed 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:14.339
 lord has also seen himself from the first three 

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:16.500
 four rounds that still lock up 

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:18.389
 in short, a thoughtful team was cautious 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.740
 anyway to go against most 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:21.360
 part of the teams that do point blank 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.159
 plus a combo of any kind
