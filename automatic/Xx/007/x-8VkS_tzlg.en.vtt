00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:05.780
 gambling presents 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.519
 tropico series was changed so 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.289
 one so much and brings down the words to that 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.210
 say impressions that this is evolution 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.219
 dinosaur you run us another 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.290
 part of the game and if you are not like 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.570
 teacher deep fans of the series you 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.420
 think and what is changed 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.430
 should I play it at all I'm honest in 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.519
 each tropico clears up for 20 hours 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.040
 30 and they are fans of the series but me 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.409
 I generally like the game when I'm ready 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.449
 goes to play every new one 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.820
 and after passing each part I am 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.760
 I sit down and think for myself in my head 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.710
 make notes what's new here 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.600
 here improved here small 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.309
 change itself historical realities 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.410
 corrected more characteristics 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.200
 there was more logic in which 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.750
 economic interactions and here's to 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.310
 the fifth part of such ticks has always been 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.020
 quite a lot and all with clean 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.789
 conscience thought that I knowingly won 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.100
 new part of the lines and here's after 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.860
 I played in the fifth part, I sat put 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.830
 These same ticks yourself and I realized that here in 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.450
 The fifth part, I probably played a number 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.100
 nothing diametrically new 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.049
 there was nothing interesting here 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.060
 minus various flaws in my opinion have 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.250
 added so I ask now 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.869
 in which of these games to play people 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.909
 who are not addicted trail i'm talking 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.920
 here is the tropico series and start with 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.000
 foursome for example the parts they sleep me 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.890
 That's very interesting if I can 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.930
 tell there in one minute about 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.930
 changes tropico 5 5 try 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.000
 actively advertised 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.590
 developers colonial coffees on 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.210
 which built all the advertising campaigns 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.380
 turned out to be such a bum because with 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.020
 one side give the colonial era 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.670
 but there is no new way of development 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.140
 internal does not exist in essence 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.479
 everything you do inside the colonial 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.189
 epochs are cropped versions of all that 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.200
 so that you do later 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.879
 previous parts of the tropics in fact we 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.200
 taken away a lot of things away 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.849
 small-small beginnings of development 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.129
 who were basically up to this and 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.870
 just more slowly build them up by 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.390
 least current game time 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.310
 women are nothing new we have not received 2 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.170
 schools salary payments changed to some 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.640
 total budget on the one hand this is sort of 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.060
 should be more understandable for new 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.370
 players 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.930
 and on the other hand planning and 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.150
 detailed understanding of the economy 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.590
 sharply decreased worsened understand what 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.630
 happens in economic 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.430
 interactions become harder in the end 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.500
 it would seem logical and simplification has become 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.930
 dead economic zone 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.519
 perception of the game is a block of indicators 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.510
 each end ladder and became big 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.319
 quantities that were before 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.910
 reduced to some kind of welfare and 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.379
 satisfaction level in the end all those who 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.000
 it was interesting to dig all these 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.500
 small settings and big 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.290
 amount of information about each individual 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.209
 the characters were left with nothing why 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.030
 the fourth has reduced the number of buildings and 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.370
 removed and the prison which was always in 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.870
 tropico why was it still going on it 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.310
 simplification for new players is big 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.959
 the number of buildings on them does not 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.000
 limit play it will be interesting 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.139
 well old players who are used to 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.220
 a large number of buildings, all the more 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.130
 accustomed to prison 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.230
 for some reason he was cut why is it done 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.030
 not clear the general feeling of the game game 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.769
 became less predictable and with one 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.239
 hand gives good because the same 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.920
 the most happening in real life with 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.810
 other side in-game logic 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.459
 become much less you can't clearly 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.230
 predict what will happen if you do 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.730
 here it is this this action or 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.440
 predict the fork what you are doing 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.120
 here it will come either to this or to 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.579
 either this one or this one now 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.980
 do some actions and it doesn't 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.750
 It knows what will at first it 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.010
 a little happy and then begins 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.560
 strongly annoyed because 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.419
 predictability in the game has decreased dramatically 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.730
 one more thing a military coup 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:51.130
 almost always means end knowing 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.870
 whether the president as so why not 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.730
 ways to solve this situation and 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.650
 finally dynasties advertised when 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.090
 governors of your dynasty give you 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.680
 any increase yes it is interesting 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.580
 innovations but again cardinally 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.030
 gimp 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.030
 and she has no effect on my lay 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.110
 in the end, I recommend playing building 5 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.360
 only to people who are really 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.340
 like this series for them new tropico 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.109
 this is despite the flaws always 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.880
 very important for other people who 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.530
 want to join the world of tropico i would 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.870
 recommended starting from the previous part 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.870
 games my score trinity 56 points 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:50.149
 be
