 The enemy has 13 times the direction of the direction of the world where you want to

 We will try to move deuldorok feel that once the first home server 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.560
 Similarly, by utilizing the tape slides do not give a lot of lg just completely 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:45.070
 The book is centered on the tower, but the tower is a bit like the center , 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.310
 When I enter, but do not start from feelings into writing by the edge 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.130
 Haebwara give any variety that you back

 Syothan is to be according to me then I will try once again as 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:58.930
 So you see we'll party through this site You put characters in this state, 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.500
 Here is the first, first you see a lot of the characters skills rely on tee 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.370
 You drink.

 So do a lot of sewooji termination cause a skills before and after the car in front and behind 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.840
 Thanks parties to make use of characters like this slide 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.830
 I 'll try to recommend it using the second slide . 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.630
 One 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:21.610
 Introducing 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:24.130
 Now it's easy for me to go skiing with the body almost in front 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.520
 It's the feeling of returning the tower and the tee at the same time. 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:32.170
 Of course, now chair while turning now to hear a little bit from the bottom of Dream High 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:37.119
 Thus himdeunde How about the ski itself meokneunge much any edge 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:41.920
 Discerning the edges are lightly as described in the state of the floor as the bottom of the ski 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:45.400
 Let's take a brief explanation and let us feel simple. 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.909
 Tail Slide'd like that again, but the tower also move as a feeling that Tate 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:53.140
 Now that you like it, you're doing it . 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:58.420
 Summer is now a little no use I do not want to have no 1 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:03.130
 How do you like it? If this happens, if skiing will keep you skiing, 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.920
 I do not know what 's going on. 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.830
 I set Edge up, 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.860
 You 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:15.540
 The ASCII is haejueoya a little more after premotor 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.320
 I get out of the house with the power of the East, so I feel a bit of a slip on the top team 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:24.060
 At the same time, moving the tower and ski tee 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:29.670
 He did so again on itguyo Do you feel if I in 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.950
 Without the ups and downs, I do not get lost. 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.950
 With interest bending 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:41.120
 It is possible that it is good, too. So, by fixing the upper body down , 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.120
 With the feeling of keeping it high 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:48.470
 Any bending shottone that you feel like you should know 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.640
 It is. 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:56.720
 And then another thing 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.620
 Oh, by utilizing the body axis by utilizing the body axis 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.830
 Now, you can use the gas 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.450
 How would I feel this party 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:11.600
 How about pushing the body a little bit, but almost outward 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.360
 While still being constant 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.470
 Well this way 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.540
 Inside a short, near-outside using some body axis that you are doing 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.480
 Bend it and straighten it out 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.350
 Yes, you should be able to feel that. 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.370
 Let me ask you a few more questions . 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.610
 To wipe a little, now that I'll have to try again in a little bit of speed 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.610
 do it 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:42.840
 4 Yes what 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.709
 Now, a little more banding here. 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:52.400
 Let's try the carving feeling . 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.400
 You keep your upper body a little higher. 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.910
 Garlic expand the Jackal by feeling 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.910
 As if to fry 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:09.180
 What about the last time you feel self-giving a lot of skill Sleep 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.840
 I do not know how to do it. 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:17.430
 Of course you will not be 100% carved, but you have a lot of will 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:21.539
 Skiing is a little more minutes sseuneunge am not heard, coming from the slide tower 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.550
 I tried to do something like that with a short description. So, 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:29.250
 Until now, 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:33.389
 From the Aphraw screen, the Fluga Bogen system turns to Ferrite 1 and Shoton 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:37.620
 You've done it once, so to get to the middle of now, 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:41.100
 If these technologies, such as one of the top slide Tang technology is by far the top tail 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.370
 On slides or carvings , you pick up the selector 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.539
 Chief catapult where a step further, some more once no further revelations 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.110
 Furthermore, 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:53.070
 I am not too obsessed with any one technique, 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:56.990
 Slide table for your situation what taktel banding or Virgin Queen axis skiing 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:00.990
 Or is this all you've got to practice hasyeo five after carving 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:05.070
 Each and every one should be able to do well. 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.080
 Technology is not something that any spread deepens in light sleep state technology 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.889
 Your skiers 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.940
 It's possible that you can get a little higher in quality. 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.010
 Once you practice this once again, you will feel like skiing any new feeling 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.550
 If you feel it , you might want to look at it later . 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.550
 The auditor
