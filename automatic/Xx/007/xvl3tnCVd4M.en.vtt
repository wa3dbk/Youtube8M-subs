digital<00:00:18.029> servos<00:00:18.510> one<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.020> base<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:20.100> up

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
digital servos one in the base to up

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.650 
digital servos one in the base to up
here<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.699> arm<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.119> actually<00:00:21.510> has<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
here in the arm and actually has a

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.380 
here in the arm and actually has a
fourth<00:00:22.170> analog<00:00:22.890> servo<00:00:23.340> right<00:00:23.550> up<00:00:24.090> there<00:00:24.269> in

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
fourth analog servo right up there in

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.740 
fourth analog servo right up there in
the<00:00:24.480> tip<00:00:24.660> for<00:00:25.170> turning<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.160> effector<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.539> also

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
the tip for turning the effector it also

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.009 
the tip for turning the effector it also
has<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.590> pump<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.849> can<00:00:30.029> see<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.869> uses

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
has a pump that you can see that it uses

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.470 
has a pump that you can see that it uses
to<00:00:31.230> lift<00:00:31.710> up<00:00:31.920> objects<00:00:32.550> all<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
to lift up objects all of the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.209 
to lift up objects all of the
electronics<00:00:34.050> are<00:00:34.200> built<00:00:34.380> into<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.770> base<00:00:34.950> back

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
electronics are built into the base back

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.790 
electronics are built into the base back
there<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.790> has<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.940> shield<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:37.020> Arduino<00:00:37.590> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
there so it has a shield on Arduino and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.310 
there so it has a shield on Arduino and
this<00:00:38.340> pump<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.390> has<00:00:39.510> all<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.780> electronics

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
this pump and so has all the electronics

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.139 
this pump and so has all the electronics
that<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.559> need<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.340> get<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.610> moving<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:42.000> you

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
that you need to get it moving like you

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.779 
that you need to get it moving like you
see<00:00:42.329> here<00:00:42.530> we've<00:00:43.530> currently<00:00:43.920> programmed<00:00:44.579> this

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
see here we've currently programmed this

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.880 
see here we've currently programmed this
one<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.239> deal<00:00:45.420> out<00:00:45.450> blackjack<00:00:46.200> because<00:00:46.590> as

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
one to deal out blackjack because as

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.510 
one to deal out blackjack because as
humans<00:00:47.370> were<00:00:47.730> all<00:00:47.850> pretty<00:00:48.329> lazy<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:50.370> it

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
humans were all pretty lazy so here it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.340 
humans were all pretty lazy so here it
is<00:00:50.730> using<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.059> little<00:00:51.270> mechanism<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.960> flip<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
is using a little mechanism to flip the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.290 
is using a little mechanism to flip the
cards<00:00:52.620> over<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.920> deal<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.789> hand<00:00:54.149> of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
cards over and deal out a hand of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.910 
cards over and deal out a hand of
blackjack<00:00:54.510> for<00:00:54.870> all<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.079> us<00:00:57.890> we're<00:00:58.890> just

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
blackjack for all of us we're just

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.040 
blackjack for all of us we're just
taking<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.670> coordinates<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.510> each<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:01.020> of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
taking the coordinates of each one of

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.189 
taking the coordinates of each one of
the<00:01:01.260> people's<00:01:02.250> cards<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.910> we're<00:01:03.570> memorizing

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
the people's cards and we're memorizing

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.469 
the people's cards and we're memorizing
where<00:01:04.530> those<00:01:04.799> servo<00:01:05.189> positions<00:01:05.700> are<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
where those servo positions are for the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.969 
where those servo positions are for the
arm<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.869> then<00:01:07.229> all<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.710> just<00:01:07.740> basically

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
arm and then all we do is just basically

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.980 
arm and then all we do is just basically
play<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.640> back<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> script<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.869> when

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
play that back as a script so that when

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.140 
play that back as a script so that when
I<00:01:10.080> say<00:01:10.260> something<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.619> hit<00:01:10.979> me<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.820> knows<00:01:12.119> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
I say something like hit me it knows to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.249 
I say something like hit me it knows to
reach<00:01:12.510> into<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> cards<00:01:13.320> grab<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:15.080> place<00:01:16.080> it

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
reach into the cards grab one place it

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.149 
reach into the cards grab one place it
there<00:01:16.470> flip<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.100> around<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.710> put<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.040> on

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
there flip it around and then put it on

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.320 
there flip it around and then put it on
my<00:01:20.520> hand

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.690 

in<00:01:26.330> addition<00:01:27.020> to<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:27.770> vacuum<00:01:28.010> pump<00:01:28.430> as<00:01:28.640> well

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
in addition to the vacuum pump as well

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.600 
in addition to the vacuum pump as well
as<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.180> servo<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:29.780> has<00:01:30.440> a<00:01:30.470> switch<00:01:31.010> in<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.490> end

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
as the servo it has a switch in the end

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.850 
as the servo it has a switch in the end
of<00:01:31.730> this<00:01:31.880> which<00:01:32.210> can<00:01:32.540> determine<00:01:32.960> if<00:01:33.410> it's

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
of this which can determine if it's

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.280 
of this which can determine if it's
reached<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.340> end<00:01:34.550> of<00:01:34.850> its<00:01:35.000> limit<00:01:35.420> essentially

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
reached the end of its limit essentially

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.040 
reached the end of its limit essentially
telling<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.740> how<00:01:37.040> far<00:01:37.280> down<00:01:37.460> it's<00:01:37.700> pressed<00:01:38.050> one

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
telling it how far down it's pressed one

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.510 
telling it how far down it's pressed one
of<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.230> other<00:01:39.380> nice<00:01:39.620> features<00:01:40.070> about<00:01:40.220> this

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
of the other nice features about this

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.550 
of the other nice features about this
arm<00:01:40.760> is<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.090> ability<00:01:41.480> to<00:01:41.510> record<00:01:42.260> and

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
arm is the ability to record and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.680 
arm is the ability to record and
playback<00:01:42.770> actions<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:43.970> let's<00:01:44.150> say<00:01:44.300> we<00:01:44.450> want<00:01:44.660> to

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
playback actions so let's say we want to

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.480 
playback actions so let's say we want to
move<00:01:44.870> this<00:01:45.020> over<00:01:45.200> pick<00:01:45.560> up<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.800> chip<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:46.220> drop

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
move this over pick up a chip and drop

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.610 
move this over pick up a chip and drop
it<00:01:46.640> over<00:01:46.730> there<00:01:47.030> what<00:01:47.780> we<00:01:47.900> can<00:01:48.050> do<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.290> we<00:01:48.440> can

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
it over there what we can do is we can

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.350 
it over there what we can do is we can
press<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:48.980> record<00:01:49.250> button<00:01:49.520> on<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:49.940> back<00:01:50.090> and

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
press the record button on the back and

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.660 
press the record button on the back and
then<00:01:51.170> just<00:01:51.410> move<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.830> arm<00:01:51.980> to<00:01:52.220> where<00:01:52.370> we<00:01:52.490> want

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
then just move the arm to where we want

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.880 
then just move the arm to where we want
it<00:01:52.760> to<00:01:52.880> go<00:01:53.060> let's<00:01:53.810> press<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:54.170> down<00:01:54.290> on<00:01:54.500> top<00:01:54.710> of

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
it to go let's press it down on top of

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.700 
it to go let's press it down on top of
this<00:01:55.010> chip<00:01:55.340> then<00:01:56.120> we<00:01:56.240> press<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:56.630> button<00:01:56.900> to

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
this chip then we press the button to

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.610 
this chip then we press the button to
activate<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:58.130> suction<00:01:58.940> and<00:01:59.320> then<00:02:00.320> we'll<00:02:00.440> move

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
activate the suction and then we'll move

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.140 
activate the suction and then we'll move
it<00:02:00.830> over<00:02:01.820> to<00:02:01.970> here<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:03.580> then<00:02:04.580> drop<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.940> chip

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150
