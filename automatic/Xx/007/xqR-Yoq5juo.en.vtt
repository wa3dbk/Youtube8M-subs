an Imperial Guard arm that I did not
prime<00:00:05.460> I<00:00:05.730> just<00:00:05.940> simply<00:00:06.330> base<00:00:06.779> coat<00:00:07.080> it<00:00:07.170> with

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
prime I just simply base coat it with

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.040 
prime I just simply base coat it with
whatever<00:00:07.529> colors<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:08.040> had<00:00:08.570> this<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.750> just<00:00:09.900> for

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
whatever colors I had this is just for

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.419 
whatever colors I had this is just for
demonstration<00:00:10.559> purposes<00:00:10.590> only<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.190> that's

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
demonstration purposes only so that's

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.100 
demonstration purposes only so that's
probably<00:00:11.639> not<00:00:11.730> gonna<00:00:11.849> show<00:00:12.030> up<00:00:12.120> as<00:00:12.210> smooth<00:00:12.750> as

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
probably not gonna show up as smooth as

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.010 
probably not gonna show up as smooth as
possible<00:00:14.099> but<00:00:14.940> it'll<00:00:15.630> give<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.870> guys<00:00:15.990> a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
possible but it'll give you guys a

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.140 
possible but it'll give you guys a
general<00:00:16.289> idea<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.680> what<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:16.890> should<00:00:17.010> be<00:00:17.160> doing

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
general idea of what you should be doing

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.390 
general idea of what you should be doing
and<00:00:18.240> what<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.449> should<00:00:18.570> be<00:00:18.660> looking<00:00:18.779> at<00:00:19.400> first

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
and what you should be looking at first

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.509 
and what you should be looking at first
we<00:00:20.699> are<00:00:20.730> going<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.300> use<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:22.160> Vallejo<00:00:23.160> color

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
we are going to use the Vallejo color

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.890 
we are going to use the Vallejo color
flat<00:00:23.939> green<00:00:25.010> then<00:00:26.010> we're<00:00:26.189> basically<00:00:26.310> going<00:00:26.760> to

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
flat green then we're basically going to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.380 
flat green then we're basically going to
mix<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.109> with<00:00:28.140> white<00:00:28.680> as<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.580> are<00:00:29.760> moving<00:00:30.060> on

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
mix it with white as we are moving on

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.990 
mix it with white as we are moving on
with<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:31.619> highlight<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.279> basically<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.850> whole

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
with a highlight so basically the whole

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.830 
with a highlight so basically the whole
goal<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.480> you're<00:00:33.570> gonna<00:00:33.630> be

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
goal is that you're gonna be

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.440 
goal is that you're gonna be
highlighting<00:00:34.500> highlights<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.880> continuously

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
highlighting highlights so continuously

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.240 
highlighting highlights so continuously
you're<00:00:36.719> going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.230> dipping<00:00:37.950> your<00:00:38.190> brush

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
you're going to be dipping your brush

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.950 
you're going to be dipping your brush
into<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.940> white<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.390> then<00:00:39.570> you're<00:00:39.719> gonna<00:00:39.809> be

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
into the white and then you're gonna be

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.410 
into the white and then you're gonna be
pulling<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.500> down<00:00:40.770> into<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.219> green<00:00:41.550> slowly

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
pulling it down into the green slowly

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.200 
pulling it down into the green slowly
but<00:00:42.629> surely<00:00:42.800> lighting<00:00:43.800> up<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.160> green<00:00:44.430> more

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
but surely lighting up the green more

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.490 
but surely lighting up the green more
and<00:00:45.329> more<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.600> more<00:00:45.780> if<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.110> way<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.260> can

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and more and more if that way you can

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.350 
and more and more if that way you can
just<00:00:46.739> go<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.190> go<00:00:47.489> ahead<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.820> layer<00:00:48.239> your

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
just go on go ahead and layer your

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.470 
just go on go ahead and layer your
highlights<00:00:48.960> after<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.910> just<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> head<00:00:51.329> up

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
highlights after that just as a head up

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.580 
highlights after that just as a head up
I'm<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> highlights

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
I'm going to have the highlights

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.260 
I'm going to have the highlights
slightly<00:00:53.250> larger<00:00:53.699> than<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.940> would<00:00:54.090> normally

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
slightly larger than I would normally

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.689 
slightly larger than I would normally
have<00:00:54.690> them<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> model<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:55.920> even<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:56.579> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
have them on a model but even if you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.770 
have them on a model but even if you
want<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.940> make<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> highlights<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.570> this

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
want to make the highlights of this

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.869 
want to make the highlights of this
large<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.620> still<00:00:58.829> doesn't<00:00:59.010> look<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.250> bad<00:00:59.609> but

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
large it still doesn't look that bad but

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.520 
large it still doesn't look that bad but
it's<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.809> guys<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.199> see<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it's just so that you guys can see it a

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.470 
it's just so that you guys can see it a
little<00:01:01.620> bit<00:01:01.800> easier

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.149 

also<00:01:10.480> it<00:01:10.660> should<00:01:10.930> go<00:01:11.140> without<00:01:11.260> saying

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
also it should go without saying

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.130 
also it should go without saying
I'm<00:01:12.219> going<00:01:12.369> to<00:01:12.460> say<00:01:12.609> it<00:01:12.670> anyways<00:01:13.329> this<00:01:13.749> can<00:01:13.990> be

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
I'm going to say it anyways this can be

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.899 
I'm going to say it anyways this can be
used<00:01:14.409> with<00:01:14.619> literally<00:01:15.069> any<00:01:15.310> color<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:15.759> you

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
used with literally any color that you

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.399 
used with literally any color that you
really<00:01:16.270> want<00:01:16.509> out<00:01:16.719> there<00:01:16.899> it's<00:01:17.049> just<00:01:17.079> a<00:01:17.259> matter

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
really want out there it's just a matter

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.559 
really want out there it's just a matter
of<00:01:17.530> what<00:01:18.159> color<00:01:18.399> you<00:01:18.579> want<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.789> use<00:01:18.969> to<00:01:19.210> lighten

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569
