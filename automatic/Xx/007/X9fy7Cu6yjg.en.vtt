00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.940
 little trick end of the little tricks 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.070
 to chase odors when we did 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.510
 painting it smells of paint 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.340
 the house is not necessarily very 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.770
 nice especially when it's 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.870
 glycero from the oil painting of the 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.300
 brood some little tricks 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.490
 allow to chase odors from 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.290
 paint faster then 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.880
 chased off the paint odors of 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.420
 little tricks of grandma by 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.610
 example the coffee grounds 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.590
 have a plate of coffee grounds 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.210
 in your living room or in the room in 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.780
 which you have just painted to make 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.860
 the painting hunt well the odors on 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:51.790
 can also use salt so due 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.700
 rosell in classic a good plate 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.530
 coarse salt in the room that comes 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.110
 to be painted it allows precisely 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:04.689
 to absorb the odors we also have 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.110
 the onion with the onion that makes us 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.600
 cry 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.219
 we can chase the odors you 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.079
 cut in half you put it well in 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.689
 the room in which you come from 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.899
 paint and it will smell 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.999
 much less paint after this 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.700
 we do not know is that the crumb of bread 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:22.810
 so that absorbs the paintings of the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.560
 blow if you have bread crumbs 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.229
 Feel free to ask me in the room 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.729

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.409
 can also use that we do not know 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.539
 necessarily but the milk it absorbs well 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.380
 the smells of the shot a good glass of milk 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.270
 to pose in the room it will avoid 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.340
 bad smells or it will facilitate 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.920
 precisely the fact that it feels less 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.539
 quickly so here I have given you 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.340
 some quick tips but of course 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.590
 the most effective will always be 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.590
 to properly feed the house 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.200
