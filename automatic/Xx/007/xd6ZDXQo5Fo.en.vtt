papi

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:52.500 

that's<00:00:25.279> a<00:00:25.460> shame

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.330 

well<00:00:53.510> in<00:00:53.629> my<00:00:53.780> opinion<00:00:54.260> this<00:00:54.379> is<00:00:54.559> probably<00:00:55.040> the

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
well in my opinion this is probably the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.090 
well in my opinion this is probably the
best-looking<00:00:56.140> naked<00:00:57.140> leader<00:00:57.649> bike<00:00:59.860> it's<00:01:00.860> a

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
best-looking naked leader bike it's a

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.200 
best-looking naked leader bike it's a
three<00:01:01.489> cylinder<00:01:02.589> Triumph<00:01:03.589> Speed<00:01:04.070> Triple<00:01:04.339> 1050

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
three cylinder Triumph Speed Triple 1050

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.210 
three cylinder Triumph Speed Triple 1050
now<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.990> difference<00:01:06.350> between<00:01:06.500> this<00:01:06.890> one<00:01:07.190> and

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
now the difference between this one and

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.109 
now the difference between this one and
the<00:01:07.990> 675<00:01:08.990> Street<00:01:09.440> triple<00:01:09.860> is<00:01:10.119> obviously

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
the 675 Street triple is obviously

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.300 
the 675 Street triple is obviously
engine<00:01:11.540> size<00:01:12.490> this<00:01:13.490> bike<00:01:13.790> is<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:15.200> bit<00:01:15.950> heavier

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
engine size this bike is a bit heavier

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.710 
engine size this bike is a bit heavier
than<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:17.690> street<00:01:17.960> triple<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.970> it's<00:01:19.970> also<00:01:20.330> not

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
than the street triple and it's also not

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.210 
than the street triple and it's also not
going<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:21.020> get<00:01:21.170> as<00:01:21.289> good<00:01:21.380> of<00:01:21.500> fuel<00:01:22.009> economy

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
going to get as good of fuel economy

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.710 
going to get as good of fuel economy
because<00:01:22.729> because<00:01:23.119> it<00:01:23.270> has<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.539> bigger

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
because because it has the bigger

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.830 
because because it has the bigger
displacement<00:01:24.410> engine<00:01:24.789> this<00:01:25.789> is<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.030> 2009

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
displacement engine this is the 2009

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.260 
displacement engine this is the 2009
iteration<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.070> speed<00:01:28.340> triple<00:01:28.789> I<00:01:29.060> actually

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
iteration of the speed triple I actually

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.160 
iteration of the speed triple I actually
happen<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.780> like<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.590> round<00:01:31.130> headlights<00:01:32.170> as

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
happen to like the round headlights as

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.889 
happen to like the round headlights as
opposed<00:01:33.679> to<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.070> new<00:01:34.190> I<00:01:35.119> guess<00:01:35.570> some<00:01:35.869> people

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
opposed to the new I guess some people

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.830 
opposed to the new I guess some people
are<00:01:36.200> calling<00:01:36.500> them<00:01:36.649> bug-eyed<00:01:37.160> headlights<00:01:37.840> one

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
are calling them bug-eyed headlights one

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.510 
are calling them bug-eyed headlights one
of<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.050> things<00:01:39.289> that<00:01:39.560> really<00:01:39.710> sets<00:01:40.039> this<00:01:40.310> bike

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
of the things that really sets this bike

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.700 
of the things that really sets this bike
off<00:01:40.759> for<00:01:41.210> me<00:01:41.330> at<00:01:41.479> least<00:01:41.690> is<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:43.820> frame<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:45.619> way

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
off for me at least is the frame the way

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.190 
off for me at least is the frame the way
the<00:01:45.860> frame<00:01:46.130> is<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.610> has<00:01:46.789> for<00:01:47.660> some<00:01:47.810> reason<00:01:48.080> it

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
the frame is it has for some reason it

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.600 
the frame is it has for some reason it
has<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.380> it's<00:01:48.829> got<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.159> blend<00:01:49.579> of<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:50.420> very<00:01:51.610> retro

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
has a it's got a blend of a very retro

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.219 
has a it's got a blend of a very retro
classic<00:01:53.650> cafe<00:01:54.650> bike<00:01:54.979> look<00:01:55.340> with<00:01:56.119> kind<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:57.079> a

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
classic cafe bike look with kind of a

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.280 
classic cafe bike look with kind of a
new<00:01:57.409> sort<00:01:57.799> of<00:01:57.890> artistic<00:01:58.720> organic<00:01:59.720> twist<00:02:00.049> to<00:02:00.259> it

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
new sort of artistic organic twist to it

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.789 
new sort of artistic organic twist to it
the<00:02:01.009> bike<00:02:01.220> actually<00:02:01.729> looks<00:02:01.970> like<00:02:02.149> somebody

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
the bike actually looks like somebody

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.670 
the bike actually looks like somebody
custom-built<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:04.100> frame<00:02:05.229> which<00:02:06.229> is<00:02:06.409> one<00:02:06.560> of

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
custom-built the frame which is one of

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.020 
custom-built the frame which is one of
the<00:02:06.740> things<00:02:06.950> that<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.159> think<00:02:07.399> makes<00:02:07.579> this<00:02:07.700> look

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
the things that I think makes this look

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.650 
the things that I think makes this look
so<00:02:08.239> unique<00:02:09.880> now<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:10.940> previous<00:02:11.329> owner

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
so unique now the previous owner

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.479 
so unique now the previous owner
actually<00:02:12.140> went<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.530> trouble<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:12.920> put<00:02:13.370> the

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
actually went to the trouble to put the

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.720 
actually went to the trouble to put the
bike<00:02:13.640> master<00:02:13.880> handlebar<00:02:15.250> mirrors<00:02:16.250> on<00:02:16.459> here

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
bike master handlebar mirrors on here

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.720 
bike master handlebar mirrors on here
which<00:02:17.329> really<00:02:17.739> cleans<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.980> lines<00:02:19.190> up<00:02:19.459> of<00:02:19.610> the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
which really cleans the lines up of the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.020 
which really cleans the lines up of the
bike<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:21.190> little<00:02:22.190> bit<00:02:22.280> earlier<00:02:22.549> you<00:02:22.670> saw<00:02:22.970> the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
bike a little bit earlier you saw the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.880 
bike a little bit earlier you saw the
tail<00:02:23.360> light<00:02:23.570> section<00:02:24.019> of<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.230> bike<00:02:24.410> which<00:02:24.709> is

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
tail light section of the bike which is

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.550 
tail light section of the bike which is
an<00:02:25.100> aftermarket<00:02:25.489> tail<00:02:26.209> end<00:02:26.420> section<00:02:26.870> after

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
an aftermarket tail end section after

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.069 
an aftermarket tail end section after
having<00:02:28.519> thrown<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.760> leg<00:02:29.000> over<00:02:29.030> this<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.720> can<00:02:29.870> tell

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
having thrown a leg over this I can tell

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.100 
having thrown a leg over this I can tell
you<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.880> seat<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.720> seat<00:02:32.930> height

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
you that the seat that the seat height

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.990 
you that the seat that the seat height
is<00:02:33.140> not<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.709> high<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:33.980> what<00:02:34.430> makes<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:34.880> a

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
is not that high but what makes it a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.630 
is not that high but what makes it a
little<00:02:35.030> bit<00:02:35.480> more<00:02:35.630> problematic<00:02:36.549> it's<00:02:37.549> the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
little bit more problematic it's the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.099 
little bit more problematic it's the
width<00:02:37.820> of<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.150> seat<00:02:38.450> on<00:02:38.690> this<00:02:38.959> bike<00:02:39.730> makes<00:02:40.730> it

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
width of the seat on this bike makes it

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.110 
width of the seat on this bike makes it
feel<00:02:42.109> as<00:02:42.320> if<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.650> bike<00:02:42.829> is<00:02:42.859> actually<00:02:43.579> higher

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
feel as if the bike is actually higher

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.610 
feel as if the bike is actually higher
than<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.690> is<00:02:44.720> now<00:02:46.239> again<00:02:47.239> this<00:02:47.480> may<00:02:47.810> or<00:02:48.140> may<00:02:48.440> not

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
than it is now again this may or may not

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.289 
than it is now again this may or may not
be<00:02:48.859> a<00:02:48.890> problem<00:02:49.100> for<00:02:49.400> some<00:02:49.579> people<00:02:49.609> it's<00:02:50.060> not

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
be a problem for some people it's not

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.740 
be a problem for some people it's not
too<00:02:50.600> big<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.989> deal<00:02:51.170> for<00:02:51.200> me<00:02:52.330> even<00:02:53.330> though<00:02:53.510> I'm

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
too big of a deal for me even though I'm

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.080 
too big of a deal for me even though I'm
only<00:02:53.780> 5<00:02:54.230> 7<00:02:54.680> I'd<00:02:54.830> find<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.459> felt<00:02:56.030> very

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
only 5 7 I'd find that I felt very

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.860 
only 5 7 I'd find that I felt very
comfortable<00:02:56.420> on<00:02:56.930> this<00:02:57.140> bike

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
comfortable on this bike

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.020 
comfortable on this bike
for<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.049> leader<00:02:58.500> class<00:02:58.830> naked<00:02:59.340> bike<00:02:59.519> this<00:02:59.970> is

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
for a leader class naked bike this is

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:17.449 
for a leader class naked bike this is
actually<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.560> feels<00:03:02.010> relatively<00:03:02.790> like

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.690 

half<00:03:18.459> us
