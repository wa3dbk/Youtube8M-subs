00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.200
 well we are going to program a key 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.660
 of 2007 and can be scheduled since 2007 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.500
 8 9 10 11 12 every day you can 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.150
 program with this same type of key 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.519
 this in this case is thrown uses the 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.070
 key and the control separately but what 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.740
 let's do with the key is board of 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.660
 the news 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.170
 and we will see that this key is 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.790
 deprogrammed let's bail 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.790
 and no action to insurance 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.910
 today we are going to give way to the program 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.430
 key and we are checking that it is not 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.430
 then scheduled the next step 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.769
 in these cases 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.540
 in the car it has to be 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.460
 fully closed all doors 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.390
 and we put the insurance 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.130
 then the door 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.390
 he gets into the life of golfer 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.390
 where facebook 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.350
 When you stop the turn signals, turn the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.970
 cylinder 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:18.290
 program and defer the insurance button 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.750
 key and will blink again 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:26.299
 the witnesses of the intermittent 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.310
 we close the switch open the door 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.850
 and with that, we already leave the programming 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.470
 and today we're going to check 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.470
 and it is programmed 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.750
 ay sierra 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.290
 and open 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.290
 i 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.340
 let's give way to that to program the 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.340
 today we are going to turn the cylinder 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.580
 and there's the witness that the key is not 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.380
 it's programmed 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.620
 if I try to boot it is not going to 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.330
 start because the witness is here today 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.800
 let's take this step to program the 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.980
 key 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.470
 and by this approval the control that 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.540
 It's all for programming the key right now 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.540
 let's say how it's done thanks
