00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.190 

well<00:01:51.280> first<00:01:51.549> one<00:01:51.759> I<00:01:51.789> made<00:01:52.030> didn't<00:01:52.899> come<00:01:53.079> out

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
well first one I made didn't come out

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.989 
well first one I made didn't come out
quite<00:01:53.259> right<00:01:53.560> this<00:01:54.100> bite<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.429> couple<00:01:54.729> years<00:01:54.909> ago

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
quite right this bite a couple years ago

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:57.419 
quite right this bite a couple years ago
really<00:01:55.359> and<00:01:55.689> i<00:01:55.899> scaled<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.560> for<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.799> while<00:01:57.039> and

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
really and i scaled it for a while and

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.270 
really and i scaled it for a while and
eventually<00:01:57.549> broke<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.509> and<00:01:58.539> then<00:01:59.319> sort<00:02:00.189> of

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
eventually broke it and then sort of

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.410 
eventually broke it and then sort of
this<00:02:00.399> you<00:02:00.579> thought<00:02:00.819> it's<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.090> bit<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.359> a

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
this you thought it's a bit of a

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.990 
this you thought it's a bit of a
learning<00:02:01.569> curve<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:02.369> learn<00:02:03.369> how<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.609> make<00:02:03.789> them

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
learning curve to learn how to make them

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.230 
learning curve to learn how to make them
better<00:02:04.209> and<00:02:04.799> improve<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:05.829> process<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:06.819> make

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
better and improve the process and make

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.960 
better and improve the process and make

holding<00:02:15.340> up<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.549> lot<00:02:15.730> better<00:02:15.879> than<00:02:16.239> any<00:02:16.510> other

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
holding up a lot better than any other

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.650 
holding up a lot better than any other
board<00:02:17.019> so<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.260> I'd<00:02:17.650> skated<00:02:18.099> before<00:02:18.360> even<00:02:19.360> and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
board so that I'd skated before even and

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.640 
board so that I'd skated before even and
thought<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:21.760> is<00:02:21.819> this<00:02:22.629> is<00:02:22.810> going<00:02:23.110> well<00:02:23.290> might

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
thought this is this is going well might

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:33.390 
thought this is this is going well might
start<00:02:23.950> making<00:02:24.340> making<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.269> bit<00:02:25.450> more<00:02:25.629> boards

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.610 

so<00:02:34.060> far<00:02:34.299> everyone<00:02:34.720> seems<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.290> think<00:02:35.379> that

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
so far everyone seems to think that

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.220 
so far everyone seems to think that
they're<00:02:35.860> good<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.310> I've<00:02:37.209> been<00:02:37.239> testing<00:02:38.110> them

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
they're good and I've been testing them

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.869 
they're good and I've been testing them
through<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.799> whole<00:02:38.950> time<00:02:39.159> making<00:02:39.579> sure<00:02:39.730> they

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
through the whole time making sure they

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.449 
through the whole time making sure they
hold<00:02:40.090> up<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.959> lot<00:02:41.349> of<00:02:41.470> trial<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:41.829> error<00:02:42.010> but

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
hold up and a lot of trial and error but

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.270 
hold up and a lot of trial and error but
finally<00:02:43.269> getting<00:02:43.599> there<00:02:43.750> we<00:02:44.530> want<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:44.890> just

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
finally getting there we want to just

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.059 
finally getting there we want to just
continue<00:02:45.849> making<00:02:46.030> high-quality<00:02:47.019> boards<00:02:47.860> and

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
continue making high-quality boards and

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.949 
continue making high-quality boards and
maybe<00:02:48.370> go<00:02:48.549> into<00:02:48.790> making<00:02:48.939> some<00:02:49.269> longboards<00:02:49.870> a

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
maybe go into making some longboards a

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.410 
maybe go into making some longboards a
bit<00:02:50.109> then<00:02:50.409> cruiser<00:02:51.250> boards<00:02:51.609> just<00:02:51.819> all<00:02:52.150> types

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
bit then cruiser boards just all types

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.599 
bit then cruiser boards just all types
of<00:02:52.599> things<00:02:52.780> just<00:02:53.079> try<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.500> broaden<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
of things just try and broaden the

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:06.950 
of things just try and broaden the
market<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.060> bit

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.560 

it's<00:03:07.950> fun<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.490> it's<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.120> strange<00:03:09.360> feeling

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
it's fun and it's a strange feeling

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.050 
it's fun and it's a strange feeling
skating<00:03:10.410> aboard<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:10.950> then<00:03:11.070> taking<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.880> minute

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
skating aboard and then taking a minute

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.550 
skating aboard and then taking a minute
to<00:03:12.120> think<00:03:12.240> that<00:03:12.630> he<00:03:12.720> actually<00:03:12.900> made<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.410> up

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
to think that he actually made it up

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.860 
to think that he actually made it up
from<00:03:13.890> foe<00:03:14.280> start<00:03:14.580> from<00:03:14.940> scratch<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.510> start<00:03:15.720> to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
from foe start from scratch and start to

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.860 
from foe start from scratch and start to
finish<00:03:16.140> did<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.070> may<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.370> done<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:18.690> went

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
finish did you may have done you went

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.600 
finish did you may have done you went
through<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.230> whole<00:03:19.350> process<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.190> sort<00:03:20.550> of

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
through the whole process of it sort of

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.380 
through the whole process of it sort of
appreciate<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.960> lot<00:03:21.990> more
