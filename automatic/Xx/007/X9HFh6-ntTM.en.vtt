00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello you love today I have mine 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:11.309
 nail routine with legal and 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:13.110
 animal-free products for you there 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.250
 I always wear nail polish that was it 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.990
 actually a white you this pink 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.859
 I have to sting through my hair color 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.490
 Of course, first with the nail polish 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.720
 agree 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.550
 I do that with these levels 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.140
 nail polish eliminates the acceptance of the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.640
 but works great for effect 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.050
 Lacko and so the user since 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.060
 years to the very happy with it 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.410
 just lose weight with a pad 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.720
 can lure you a bit 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.460
 effect paints and so see my nails 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.230
 in first without everything I will 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.730
 I file the nails had me his 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.809
 you can double-click on one side 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.250
 The nails cut it a bit 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.559
 rougher the side on the other has 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.210
 file and he really thought so 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.590
 it just always one direction only 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.870
 so that the proof is not additional 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.370
 is strained and then hack the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.620
 desired shape I have it so half 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.329
 angular half-round the side of the fog one 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.699
 a bit shorter for playing the guitar and 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.410
 after the fall it looks like that 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.719
 From time to time I use this extremely 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.370
 drum have if it were about to equal 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.600
 put with the micro cell but me 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.059
 I just wanted to show it that use 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.049
 I do not just now if we break 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.850
 Nails it is in any case 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.439
 recommendation from me now used 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.159
 Instead, maintain a nails the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.830
 I also do more or less 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.409
 regularly this latest single from p 2 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.820
 I just wear that very easily 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.799
 on the nails on that will be the same anyway 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.990
 rubbed in on the cuticles again 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.270
 in the nails with it the nails times 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.280
 to recover a bit from the strain 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.619
 of the nail polish then I use it off and on 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.790
 even this text is just about that 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.380
 cut a little bit inwards 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.060
 I have to move very carefully 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.310
 cuticle but that just increases the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.689
 Surface is single nail and thunder 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.100
 usually look that way and me 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.509
 I then decided my hand 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.119
 a little more to maintain with this 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.799
 organ serum and that I am distributing now 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.720
 still on the back of the hand and a bit 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.329
 also on the palms and leave that 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.890
 whole ones work well 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.479
 is attracted and then it works 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.479
 continue to style with the nail 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.909
 First I use the base in the 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.259
 dungeon of P2 as a basis because I 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.539
 always have customer schedule is on everyone 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.159
 Case better to protect the nails 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.659
 Of course, I wear every nail 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.069
 and that is good for now as well 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.390
 dry through before I stock up 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.180
 I use a black one 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.650
 the towers of p2 is a brush 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.180
 way too small because of it works 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.440
 that not optimal but usually 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.269
 I go once in the middle once 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.160
 Left once right sounded and then is 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.170
 The nail already covered when I 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.209
 I usually do that later 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.799
 clean or little shower stop that 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.690
 is a bit of a detachment from the cuticle 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.970
 and I'll be fine for now 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.260
 dry out I use only one here 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.569
 has covered the world pretty well 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.920
 otherwise like two layers afterwards 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.900
 I still use the mega if seems 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.970
 kurt vom p2 that is not the i think 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.200
 best he prefers to let the of essens 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.510
 the weather because daniels 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.220
 but that's finally good too 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.440
 and then the nails shine too much 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.540
 very much after having the whole patzer 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.610
 has removed with a stock remover 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.930
 and cotton swabs see my nails long 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.879
 So I'm very happy with that 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.500
 it says I'll just stop the steep 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.540
 steps and very little care around 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.920
 To be honest I hope that you 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.209
 video celebrates the area or 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.620
 Another tip was that I would 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.819

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.950

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.720
