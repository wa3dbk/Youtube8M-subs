we<00:05:34.650> can<00:05:34.860> but<00:05:35.760> sometimes<00:05:36.180> we<00:05:36.300> hit<00:05:36.450> a<00:05:36.479> game<00:05:36.780> where

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
we can but sometimes we hit a game where

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.540 
we can but sometimes we hit a game where
we<00:05:37.050> disagree<00:05:37.229> on<00:05:37.590> some<00:05:37.919> points<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:38.460> other

times<00:05:38.880> we<00:05:39.030> play<00:05:39.240> games<00:05:39.570> which<00:05:39.900> we<00:05:40.440> think<00:05:40.710> might

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
times we play games which we think might

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.070 
times we play games which we think might
be<00:05:41.070> awesome<00:05:41.640> with<00:05:41.790> a<00:05:41.820> couple<00:05:42.180> of<00:05:42.240> rule<00:05:42.570> changes

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
be awesome with a couple of rule changes

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.670

that<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:46.919> money<00:05:47.130> God<00:05:47.340> was<00:05:47.580> a<00:05:47.610> little<00:05:47.910> too

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380
