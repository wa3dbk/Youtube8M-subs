do you got a flat bolster it's not quite

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.610 
do you got a flat bolster it's not quite
flat<00:01:44.420> enough<00:01:44.720> but<00:01:44.870> I'll<00:01:44.960> demonstrate<00:01:45.170> with

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
flat enough but I'll demonstrate with

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:54.610 
flat enough but I'll demonstrate with
this<00:01:45.740> put<00:01:46.670> it<00:01:46.790> on<00:01:46.910> there<00:01:47.120> just<00:01:53.440> to<00:01:54.440> make<00:01:54.590> sure

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
this put it on there just to make sure

let's write down as you can see by doing

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.280 
let's write down as you can see by doing
that<00:01:57.950> it's<00:01:58.160> vibrating<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.760> which<00:01:59.050> you<00:02:00.050> can

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
that it's vibrating to which you can

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:12.720 
that it's vibrating to which you can
loose<00:02:00.670> all<00:02:01.670> we're<00:02:01.910> do<00:02:02.060> I<00:02:05.620> put<00:02:06.620> wedging

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.200 

now<00:02:13.730> when<00:02:13.910> you're<00:02:14.030> doing<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:14.390> be<00:02:14.630> careful

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
now when you're doing this be careful

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.480 
now when you're doing this be careful
some<00:02:17.210> people<00:02:17.510> dump<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.870> overboard<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:19.310> get

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
some people dump it overboard and get

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.040 
some people dump it overboard and get
chisels<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.150> all<00:02:20.240> sorts<00:02:20.570> and<00:02:20.690> what<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.870> find

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
chisels and all sorts and what you find

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.750 
chisels and all sorts and what you find
is<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.410> joint<00:02:21.680> across<00:02:21.890> here<00:02:22.130> splits<00:02:22.490> all<00:02:22.640> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
is the joint across here splits all the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.130 
is the joint across here splits all the
way<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.090> chimneys<00:02:23.450> are<00:02:23.630> shaking<00:02:24.050> about

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
way and the chimneys are shaking about

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.470 
way and the chimneys are shaking about
so<00:02:25.040> don't<00:02:25.550> go<00:02:25.640> over<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.000> top<00:02:26.180> you're<00:02:26.390> only

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
so don't go over the top you're only

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.580 
so don't go over the top you're only
holding<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.810> letting<00:02:27.140> you're<00:02:27.290> not<00:02:27.410> holding

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
holding the letting you're not holding

cut it with a disc it's difficult to get
a<00:02:40.970> lid<00:02:41.120> wedging<00:02:41.510> now<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:43.100> what<00:02:43.280> we've<00:02:43.430> found

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
a lid wedging now and what we've found

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.160 
a lid wedging now and what we've found
it<00:02:43.940> works<00:02:44.840> for<00:02:45.080> us<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.560> cotton<00:02:48.739> out<00:02:50.020> put<00:02:51.020> it

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
it works for us is it cotton out put it

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:00.220 
it works for us is it cotton out put it
in<00:02:53.890> even<00:02:54.890> adapt<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.430> point

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:16.820 

like<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.350> below<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.560> surface

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.920 

what<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:17.860> want<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.070> do<00:03:18.190> now<00:03:18.400> is<00:03:18.670> just<00:03:19.570> drop<00:03:19.750> onto

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
what I want to do now is just drop onto

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.250 
what I want to do now is just drop onto
this<00:03:20.140> front<00:03:20.440> part<00:03:20.650> just<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.100> show<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.480> how<00:03:22.480> we

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
this front part just to show you how we

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.030 
this front part just to show you how we
turn<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.650> round<00:03:23.830> it's<00:03:24.370> most<00:03:24.610> important

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
turn that round it's most important

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.470 
turn that round it's most important
because<00:03:27.040> obviously<00:03:27.370> this<00:03:27.790> lady<00:03:28.030> needs<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.360> go

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
because obviously this lady needs to go

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.590 
because obviously this lady needs to go
up<00:03:28.630> above<00:03:28.870> this<00:03:29.380> if<00:03:30.190> you<00:03:30.400> make<00:03:31.120> this<00:03:31.300> a<00:03:31.360> lot

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
up above this if you make this a lot

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.960 
up above this if you make this a lot
shorter<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:32.320> would<00:03:32.440> have<00:03:32.530> found<00:03:32.770> that<00:03:33.100> it

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
shorter you would have found that it

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.390 
shorter you would have found that it
wouldn't<00:03:34.240> and<00:03:34.620> then<00:03:35.620> you've<00:03:35.800> got<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.220> start

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
wouldn't and then you've got to start

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.520 
wouldn't and then you've got to start
sticking<00:03:36.610> bits<00:03:36.880> on<00:03:37.150> or<00:03:37.390> redoing<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.320> side

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
sticking bits on or redoing the side

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.260 
sticking bits on or redoing the side
again<00:03:39.120> whatever<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.270> you<00:03:40.960> feel<00:03:41.170> thick<00:03:42.240> what<00:03:43.240> I

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
again whatever you you feel thick what I

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.080 
again whatever you you feel thick what I
would<00:03:43.540> do<00:03:43.690> here<00:03:44.370> mess<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.520> down<00:03:45.700> from<00:03:45.910> that

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
would do here mess it down from that

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:53.840 
would do here mess it down from that
course<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:47.440> where<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.880> groove<00:03:48.880> is<00:03:49.060> here

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.360 

you're<00:03:54.850> gonna<00:03:55.000> line<00:03:55.270> that<00:03:56.070> low<00:03:57.070> end<00:03:57.100> is

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
you're gonna line that low end is

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.540 
you're gonna line that low end is
telling<00:03:57.700> you<00:03:57.790> where<00:03:57.910> this<00:03:58.090> joint<00:03:58.360> is<00:03:59.550> and

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
telling you where this joint is and

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.510 
telling you where this joint is and
exactly<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:01.030> same<00:04:01.090> as<00:04:01.390> we<00:04:01.510> did<00:04:01.540> before<00:04:02.520> coming

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
exactly the same as we did before coming

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:12.790 
exactly the same as we did before coming
back<00:04:03.700> in<00:04:04.680> juice<00:04:05.680> it's<00:04:05.920> time<00:04:09.990> there<00:04:10.990> you<00:04:11.080> go

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
back in juice it's time there you go

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.220 
back in juice it's time there you go
now<00:04:13.520> once<00:04:13.760> you<00:04:13.850> got<00:04:13.970> that<00:04:14.090> line<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.510> got<00:04:15.080> to

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
now once you got that line it got to

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.470 
now once you got that line it got to
slip<00:04:15.590> that<00:04:15.740> bit<00:04:15.980> that<00:04:18.970> piece<00:04:19.970> can<00:04:20.150> come<00:04:20.360> off

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
slip that bit that piece can come off

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:34.920 
slip that bit that piece can come off
out<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.780> way<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:24.140> then<00:04:25.330> what<00:04:26.330> we'll<00:04:26.510> do

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.500 

pushing<00:04:35.930> me<00:04:36.020> on<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.170> front<00:04:37.390> leave<00:04:38.390> is

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
pushing me on the front leave is

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.790 
pushing me on the front leave is
flapping<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:38.930> bit<00:04:39.110> out<00:04:39.200> of<00:04:39.230> it<00:04:39.410> and<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:39.620> want<00:04:39.770> to

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
flapping a bit out of it and you want to

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.710 
flapping a bit out of it and you want to
hold<00:04:39.920> it<00:04:40.040> still<00:04:40.430> obviously<00:04:43.540> determine<00:04:44.540> where

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
hold it still obviously determine where

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.860 
hold it still obviously determine where
you<00:04:44.870> can<00:04:45.050> do<00:04:45.170> it<00:04:46.180> and<00:04:47.180> press<00:04:47.390> a<00:04:47.420> little<00:04:47.600> nail

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
you can do it and press a little nail

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.110 
you can do it and press a little nail
just<00:04:48.170> above<00:04:48.410> that<00:04:48.590> in<00:04:48.980> that<00:04:49.160> joint<00:04:49.460> this<00:04:50.060> is

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
just above that in that joint this is

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.120 
just above that in that joint this is
going<00:04:50.390> to<00:04:50.450> get<00:04:50.570> cut<00:04:50.780> off<00:04:50.930> later<00:04:51.110> anyway<00:04:51.680> no

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
going to get cut off later anyway no

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:59.040 
going to get cut off later anyway no
problem

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.170 

what<00:05:00.050> we've<00:05:00.140> got<00:05:00.260> to<00:05:00.350> do<00:05:00.470> now<00:05:00.850> where<00:05:01.850> I'll<00:05:01.940> cut

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
what we've got to do now where I'll cut

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.600 
what we've got to do now where I'll cut
some<00:05:02.420> folds<00:05:02.810> in<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.820> bottom<00:05:04.820> lap<00:05:05.030> joint<00:05:06.610> lines

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
some folds in the bottom lap joint lines

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.240 
some folds in the bottom lap joint lines
up<00:05:07.820> with<00:05:07.940> that<00:05:08.060> one<00:05:08.560> that<00:05:09.560> lines<00:05:09.830> up<00:05:10.010> with<00:05:10.070> the

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
up with that one that lines up with the

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.320 
up with that one that lines up with the
water<00:05:10.430> line

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:22.610 

put<00:05:15.840> another<00:05:16.020> one<00:05:16.229> in<00:05:16.259> here

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:31.240 

put<00:05:23.190> it<00:05:23.310> on<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:23.520> line<00:05:25.820> mark<00:05:26.820> along<00:05:27.030> there

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.400 

there<00:05:32.389> that's<00:05:33.389> a<00:05:33.510> cut<00:05:33.810> I'll<00:05:33.930> put<00:05:34.080> your<00:05:34.260> red

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
there that's a cut I'll put your red

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.930 
there that's a cut I'll put your red
should<00:05:34.650> be<00:05:34.740> black<00:05:34.980> so<00:05:35.010> let's<00:05:35.430> cut<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:35.730> one

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
should be black so let's cut that one

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:50.560 
should be black so let's cut that one
again<00:05:36.180> market

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.330 

so<00:05:51.110> I<00:05:51.140> don't<00:05:51.260> using<00:05:51.620> the<00:05:51.680> same<00:05:51.890> method<00:05:52.250> as

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
so I don't using the same method as

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.620 
so I don't using the same method as
before<00:05:54.580> this<00:05:55.580> one<00:05:55.790> might<00:05:55.940> be<00:05:56.090> a<00:05:56.120> bit<00:05:56.270> shaky

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
before this one might be a bit shaky

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.440 
before this one might be a bit shaky
because<00:05:56.780> it<00:05:57.170> one<00:05:57.320> fit<00:05:57.590> him<00:05:57.710> very<00:05:57.740> easily<00:05:58.450> you

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
because it one fit him very easily you

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.150
