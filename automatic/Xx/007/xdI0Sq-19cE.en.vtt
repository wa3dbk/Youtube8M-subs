in<00:00:00.269> this<00:00:01.140> video<00:00:01.380> I'm<00:00:01.620> going<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.920> show<00:00:02.159> you<00:00:02.220> how

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.999 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:02.550> fold<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.360> piece<00:00:03.600> of<00:00:03.659> paper<00:00:04.020> that's<00:00:04.620> just

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
to fold a piece of paper that's just

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.550 
to fold a piece of paper that's just
about<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.670> size<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.240> square<00:00:06.569> into<00:00:07.350> a

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
about the size of a square into a

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.430 
about the size of a square into a
perfect<00:00:08.069> square<00:00:08.330> first<00:00:09.330> we<00:00:09.809> want<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.110> create

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
perfect square first we want to create

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.930 
perfect square first we want to create
one<00:00:11.280> nice<00:00:11.670> edge<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.540> just<00:00:12.809> take<00:00:13.320> one<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.710> these

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
one nice edge so just take one of these

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.700 
one nice edge so just take one of these
ragged<00:00:14.940> edges<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.680> fold<00:00:16.680> them<00:00:17.480> so<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:19.470> get<00:00:19.680> a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
ragged edges and fold them so you get a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.519 
ragged edges and fold them so you get a
nice<00:00:19.980> straight<00:00:20.550> edge<00:00:20.810> then<00:00:21.810> turn<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.410> paper

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
nice straight edge then turn the paper

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.060 
nice straight edge then turn the paper
around<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.519> fold<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.449> edge<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.920> half<00:00:28.070> so

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
around and fold that edge in half so

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.749 
around and fold that edge in half so
that<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.789> two<00:00:30.060> halves<00:00:30.560> exactly<00:00:31.579> lie<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.730> top

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
that the two halves exactly lie on top

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.049 
that the two halves exactly lie on top
of<00:00:32.969> each<00:00:33.210> other<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:34.440> then<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.250> unfold<00:00:35.670> that

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
of each other and then you unfold that

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.840 
of each other and then you unfold that
again<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.079> can<00:00:37.260> see<00:00:37.469> you've<00:00:38.219> created<00:00:38.520> a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
again and you can see you've created a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.119 
again and you can see you've created a
crease<00:00:39.120> right<00:00:39.239> here<00:00:39.390> no<00:00:40.200> we're<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.860> turn

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
crease right here no we're going to turn

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.700 
crease right here no we're going to turn
the<00:00:41.250> paper<00:00:41.430> like<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:43.079> bring<00:00:43.440> our

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the paper like this and then bring our

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.790 
the paper like this and then bring our
nice<00:00:43.980> edge<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> top<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.079> paper<00:00:46.350> so

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
nice edge to the top of that paper so

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.330 
nice edge to the top of that paper so
that<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.940> crease<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.570> see<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.930> here

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
that the crease you can see on here

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.810 
that the crease you can see on here
aligns<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.910> crease<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.480> see<00:00:51.719> there

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
aligns with the crease you see there

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.720 
aligns with the crease you see there
like<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:55.370> you<00:00:56.370> crease<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:58.500> then<00:00:59.129> you

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
like so and you crease that and then you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.470 
like so and you crease that and then you
unfold<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:01.399> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.579> see<00:01:02.789> again

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
unfold that and you can see again

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.230 
unfold that and you can see again
you<00:01:03.719> created<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.260> crease<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.000> these<00:01:06.000> two

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
you created a crease and these two

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.960 
you created a crease and these two
creases<00:01:06.510> now<00:01:06.930> meet<00:01:07.490> exactly<00:01:08.490> here

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
creases now meet exactly here

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.940 
creases now meet exactly here
what<00:01:09.630> we're<00:01:09.810> now<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.680> we're

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
what we're now going to do is we're

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.270 
what we're now going to do is we're
going<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.220> forward<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.360> paper<00:01:12.659> diagonally

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
going to forward this paper diagonally

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.520 
going to forward this paper diagonally
so<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> crease<00:01:14.760> goes<00:01:15.090> exactly<00:01:15.330> through<00:01:16.049> that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
so a crease goes exactly through that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.050 
so a crease goes exactly through that
intersection<00:01:18.680> so<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:20.100> cannot<00:01:20.340> pinch<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
intersection so you cannot pinch this a

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.870 
intersection so you cannot pinch this a
bit<00:01:21.830> just<00:01:22.830> pinch<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.000> bit<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:25.549> then<00:01:26.549> what

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
bit just pinch it a bit and then what

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.140 
bit just pinch it a bit and then what
you<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:29.220> want<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> align<00:01:29.850> this

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
you want to do is you want to align this

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.020 
you want to do is you want to align this
crease<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:31.140> see<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> top<00:01:31.829> with<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
crease you can see on the top with that

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.609 
crease you can see on the top with that
one<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.869> created<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:36.079> here<00:01:37.079> again<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
one you just created and here again the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.280 
one you just created and here again the
crease<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.189> top<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.509> one<00:01:39.720> that

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
crease on the top with the one that

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.200 
crease on the top with the one that
you've<00:01:40.560> got<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.310> bottom<00:01:42.229> like<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.880> you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
you've got on the bottom like so so you

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.469 
you've got on the bottom like so so you
get<00:01:45.950> exactly<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.460> right<00:01:47.490> angle<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.270> that

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
get exactly the right angle on that

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.280 
get exactly the right angle on that
diagonal<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.820> when<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.970> unfold<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.570> you

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
diagonal and when you unfold that you

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.630 
diagonal and when you unfold that you
can<00:01:52.500> see<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:53.250> created<00:01:53.540> this<00:01:54.540> diagonal<00:01:55.200> crease

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
can see we created this diagonal crease

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.749 
can see we created this diagonal crease
let's<00:01:56.640> fold<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.450> crease<00:01:57.689> back<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.759> then

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
let's fold this crease back in and then

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.889 
let's fold this crease back in and then
turn<00:02:00.270> into<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.719> paper<00:02:00.960> around<00:02:02.180> now<00:02:03.180> what<00:02:03.750> we

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
turn into the paper around now what we

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.499 
turn into the paper around now what we
want<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> do<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:05.219> want<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.549> fold<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.329> edge

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
want to do is we want to fold this edge

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.089 
want to do is we want to fold this edge
in<00:02:07.020> half<00:02:07.849> so<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.090> we<00:02:09.330> exactly<00:02:09.720> go<00:02:10.560> through

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
in half so that we exactly go through

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.240 
in half so that we exactly go through
the<00:02:11.250> intersection

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
the intersection

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.700 
the intersection
of<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.910> creases<00:02:13.450> from<00:02:14.170> before<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:16.060> just<00:02:16.710> go

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
of the creases from before so just go

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
of the creases from before so just go
along<00:02:18.150> there<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.450> then<00:02:20.380> again<00:02:20.620> align<00:02:21.460> these

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
along there and then again align these

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.200 
along there and then again align these
two<00:02:21.790> edges<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:23.170> they're<00:02:23.770> perfectly<00:02:24.370> back<00:02:24.670> on

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
two edges so they're perfectly back on

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.870 
two edges so they're perfectly back on
top<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.600> each<00:02:25.720> other<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.620> then<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.610> get

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
top of each other and then you get

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.300 
top of each other and then you get
something<00:02:28.300> like<00:02:28.450> this<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.990> you<00:02:29.920> can<00:02:30.070> see

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
something like this and you can see

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.060 
something like this and you can see
you've<00:02:30.700> got<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:30.970> top<00:02:31.209> layer<00:02:31.450> here<00:02:31.780> now<00:02:32.709> what

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
you've got a top layer here now what

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.550 
you've got a top layer here now what
we're<00:02:33.220> going<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.490> do<00:02:33.760> is<00:02:34.200> take<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.260> pair<00:02:35.500> of

we're going to do is take a pair of
scissors<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.370> cut<00:02:36.430> exactly<00:02:37.390> along<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.440> edge

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.410 

like<00:02:47.530> so<00:02:47.739> and<00:02:48.959> then<00:02:49.959> when<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.620> unfollowed<00:02:51.420> you

like so and then when you unfollowed you

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.660 
like so and then when you unfollowed you
can<00:02:52.600> see<00:02:52.870> you've<00:02:53.260> still<00:02:53.560> got<00:02:53.739> one<00:02:53.770> edge<00:02:54.250> here

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
can see you've still got one edge here

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.300 
can see you've still got one edge here
and<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.959> cut<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:56.410> with<00:02:56.860> this<00:02:57.010> is<00:02:57.160> your

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
and you cut that with this is your

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:06.600 
and you cut that with this is your
student

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.240 

and<00:03:06.700> then<00:03:07.620> you've<00:03:08.620> got<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:09.190> perfect<00:03:09.970> square
