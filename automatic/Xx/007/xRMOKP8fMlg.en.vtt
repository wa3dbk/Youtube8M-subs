00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.729
 today we are going to talk about 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.390
 how to transport an image to our 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:10.780
 frame so that you can paint it there 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.879
 different methods that we can employ 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.940
 depending on the type of result that 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:19.490
 we are looking 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.260
 I am here drawing by hand 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.090
 this means that the drawing 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.160
 directly on the frame with a 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.529
 charcoal or a pencil or a cake 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.220
 this may not be the method that is going 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.830
 to give a more accurate result 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.690
 however it is very used by many 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.850
 painters since it will give us a 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.130
 rather personal result 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.950
 let's say everyone has a way 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.710
 unique to draw and this will be reflected 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.050
 in our painting 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.579
 Now we can use some other 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.329
 methods we can help us for example from 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.329
 a grid 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.670
 this method is very good since it reduces 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.560
 the area that we are copying instead of 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.080
 copy the whole image we can 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.320
 concentrate only on one detail 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.770
 let's say on a surface a little more 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.770
 little 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.490
 this method is very good if we want 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.890
 get a more accurate result or if 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.000
 we are also just learning to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.380
 draw and we want to conserve much better 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.380
 the proportions 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.469
 it does not matter the size of the squares I 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.439
 here I used in my frame pictures 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.420
 5 x 5 centimeters but we can 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.860
 use smaller squares or more 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.110
 big 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.270
 my image also the grid 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.130
 neither here does the size of the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.620
 square as long as they are 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.450
 square and we have the same number of 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.150
 square both in the image and in the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.090
 frame we can see that I have 4 by 5 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.600
 square both in photography and in 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.600
 my support 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:08.160
 ok then how do you see this is a method 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.500
 very simple and very practical if we want 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.480
 get a result a little bit more 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.610
 precise 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.690
 there is a third method that we can 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.090
 use if we are beginners and we 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.340
 It costs a lot of work to draw or for the 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.709
 otherwise if we are already painters more 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.130
 advanced and we want to save a little bit of 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.490
 weather 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.790
 about a photocopy 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.400
 or an impression of the same image in the 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.640
 reverse I'm going to apply a layer of 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.970
 charcoal or pastel 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.490
 This is going to help me transport the 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.360
 picture let's say it's going to work like a 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.360
 tracing paper 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.430
 putting the image on the frame and 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.019
 fixing it with a little tape 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.019
 we can draw directly 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.080
 about photography 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.989
 and the charcoal on the back 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.989
 will help us transfer 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.980
 we can detail how much we want or 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.950
 just make a stroke a little 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.799
 more sketched also this will depend 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.500
 of the kind of result that you are 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.140
 searching 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.380
 As you can see, this is very simple and 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.540
 ready to be able to paint ok if they have 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.700
 some doubt you can leave it down here in 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.700
