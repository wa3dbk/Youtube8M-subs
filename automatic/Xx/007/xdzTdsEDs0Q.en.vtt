the<00:00:47.190> volume<00:00:47.520> rockers<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.629> then<00:00:48.840> there<00:00:49.020> is

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the volume rockers and and then there is

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.860 
the volume rockers and and then there is
this<00:00:49.410> space<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:50.039> as<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> iPhone<00:00:51.120> 5<00:00:51.360> we

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
this space here as in the iPhone 5 we

have a volume down volume up and then
the<00:00:54.000> mute<00:00:54.210> switch<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.050> depending<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the mute switch so depending on the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.380 
the mute switch so depending on the
person<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.280> amount<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.550> tactility<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:57.270> be

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
person the amount of tactility can be

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.970 
person the amount of tactility can be
increased<00:00:57.750> or<00:00:57.899> decreased<00:00:58.109> depending<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
increased or decreased depending on a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.270 
increased or decreased depending on a
space<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.520> if<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.699> like<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.030> panel<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.629> so

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
space or if you like this panel here so

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.950 
space or if you like this panel here so
sliding<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.609> down<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.180> our<00:01:03.390> 3.5

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
sliding it on down we have our 3.5

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.420 
sliding it on down we have our 3.5
millimeter<00:01:04.409> jack<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
millimeter jack and this is on the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.640 
millimeter jack and this is on the
bottom<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:05.880> both<00:01:06.119> devices<00:01:06.470> we<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.500> our

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
bottom on both devices we have our

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.560 
bottom on both devices we have our
microphone<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.820> our<00:01:08.909> lightning<00:01:09.119> port

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
microphone we have our lightning port

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.450 
microphone we have our lightning port
here<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> Lightning<00:01:10.380> port<00:01:10.530> there<00:01:10.799> then<00:01:11.310> we

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
here in the Lightning port there then we

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.280 
here in the Lightning port there then we
have<00:01:11.490> our<00:01:11.909> sound<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:12.600> thing<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.049> does

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
have our sound so one thing that does

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.109 
have our sound so one thing that does
differentiate<00:01:13.799> between<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.520> iPod<00:01:14.820> Nano<00:01:15.060> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
differentiate between the iPod Nano and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.149 
differentiate between the iPod Nano and
iPhone<00:01:15.540> 5<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.380> fact<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.680> there<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:16.979> no

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
iPhone 5 is the fact that there is no

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.890 
iPhone 5 is the fact that there is no
physical<00:01:17.369> speaker<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> unit<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.780> you're

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
physical speaker on the unit so you're

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.270 
physical speaker on the unit so you're
gonna<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.350> use<00:01:19.470> headphones<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
gonna have to use headphones for the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.980 
gonna have to use headphones for the
iPod<00:01:20.729> Nano<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.150> be<00:01:21.270> able<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.479> listen<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
iPod Nano to be able to listen to the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.109 
iPod Nano to be able to listen to the
audio<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.220> pretty<00:01:23.460> much<00:01:23.610> assumed

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
audio but that is pretty much assumed

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.850 
audio but that is pretty much assumed
considering<00:01:24.750> you're<00:01:25.380> not<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.770> be

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
considering you're not going to be

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.499 
considering you're not going to be
cranking<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> speakers<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:27.299> there

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
cranking out to the speakers if there

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.330 
cranking out to the speakers if there
was<00:01:27.659> one<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> iPod<00:01:28.560> Nano<00:01:28.799> because<00:01:29.189> it

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
was one on the iPod Nano because it

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.060 
was one on the iPod Nano because it
would<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.520> very<00:01:29.670> miniscule<00:01:30.799> it's<00:01:31.799> coming<00:01:32.009> to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
would be very miniscule it's coming to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.469 
would be very miniscule it's coming to
the<00:01:32.159> side<00:01:32.280> here<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.880> anything<00:01:33.210> on

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
the side here we do not have anything on

have our glass panel as we did see up

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.360 
have our glass panel as we did see up
top<00:02:51.600> here<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.020> then<00:02:52.350> we<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:52.830> our<00:02:52.860> radio

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.150 
top here and then we just have our radio
antenna<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.930> now<00:02:55.050> let's<00:02:55.260> compare<00:02:55.380> weight<00:02:55.890> and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
antenna so now let's compare weight and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.580 
antenna so now let's compare weight and
thickness<00:02:56.959> so<00:02:57.959> now<00:02:58.080> we're<00:02:58.200> gonna<00:02:58.320> go<00:02:58.470> ahead

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
thickness so now we're gonna go ahead

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.470 
thickness so now we're gonna go ahead
and<00:02:58.830> compare<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.340> weight<00:02:59.610> in<00:02:59.850> thickness<00:03:00.150> of

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
and compare the weight in thickness of

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.449 
and compare the weight in thickness of
each<00:03:00.600> device<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.500> go<00:03:01.920> ahead<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.160> place<00:03:02.310> the

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
each device so go ahead and place the

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.390 
each device so go ahead and place the
ipod<00:03:02.790> nano<00:03:02.820> on<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.540> iPhone<00:03:03.870> 5<00:03:04.220> I'll<00:03:05.220> go<00:03:05.340> ahead

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
can see there's definitely a thickness

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.530 
can see there's definitely a thickness
difference<00:03:11.010> if<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.220> will<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.910> iPod<00:03:12.180> Nano<00:03:12.360> is

a<00:03:12.630> lot<00:03:12.900> thinner<00:03:13.140> compared<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.650> iPhone<00:03:13.739> 5

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
a lot thinner compared to the iPhone 5

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.470 
a lot thinner compared to the iPhone 5
just<00:03:14.370> pointing<00:03:14.670> out<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.880> Ivies<00:03:15.150> because<00:03:15.390> the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
just pointing out the Ivies because the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.240 
just pointing out the Ivies because the
iPhone<00:03:15.630> 5<00:03:15.989> has<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.200> slew<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.590> features<00:03:16.830> in<00:03:17.130> there

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
iPhone 5 has a slew of features in there

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.479 
iPhone 5 has a slew of features in there
such<00:03:17.700> as<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:17.940> a6<00:03:18.540> processor<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.560> full<00:03:20.160> 1

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
such as the a6 processor and the full 1

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.550 
such as the a6 processor and the full 1
gigabyte<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:21.060> RAM<00:03:21.269> cuz<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.900> iPod<00:03:22.170> Nano<00:03:22.320> just

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
gigabyte of RAM cuz the iPod Nano just

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.720 
gigabyte of RAM cuz the iPod Nano just
has<00:03:22.680> your<00:03:22.799> base<00:03:23.010> line<00:03:23.250> features<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:23.640> know

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.729 
has your base line features you know
music<00:03:24.000> maybe<00:03:24.540> watching<00:03:24.900> some<00:03:25.019> videos<00:03:25.320> and

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
music maybe watching some videos and

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.210 
music maybe watching some videos and
rocking<00:03:26.580> out<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.030> radio<00:03:27.330> on<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:28.130> so<00:03:29.130> we'll

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
rocking out to the radio on it so we'll

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.440 
rocking out to the radio on it so we'll
compare<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.580> weight<00:03:29.700> now<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:30.330> can

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
compare the weight now you can

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.420 
compare the weight now you can
definitely<00:03:30.660> see<00:03:31.170> that<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.470> iPhone<00:03:31.920> 5<00:03:32.130> will

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
definitely see that the iPhone 5 will

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.770 
definitely see that the iPhone 5 will
not<00:03:32.580> see<00:03:32.820> just<00:03:33.120> kind<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:33.420> hear<00:03:33.630> my<00:03:33.750> voice

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
not see just kind of hear my voice

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.140 
not see just kind of hear my voice
talking<00:03:34.260> but<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.830> iPhone<00:03:35.220> 5<00:03:35.459> is<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.820> lot

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
talking but the iPhone 5 is a lot

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.759 
talking but the iPhone 5 is a lot
heavier<00:03:36.540> than<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.810> iPod<00:03:37.170> Nano<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.440> again

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
heavier than the iPod Nano and again

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.110 
heavier than the iPod Nano and again
that's<00:03:38.010> just<00:03:38.160> because<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.580> features<00:03:38.910> and

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
that's just because of the features and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.550 
that's just because of the features and
how<00:03:39.180> much<00:03:39.390> they<00:03:39.540> really<00:03:39.570> have<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.930> pack<00:03:40.170> into

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
how much they really have to pack into

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.069 
how much they really have to pack into
the<00:03:40.650> iPhone<00:03:40.799> 5<00:03:41.480> also<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.570> can<00:03:42.750> do<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.870> lot<00:03:43.049> more

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
the iPhone 5 also this can do a lot more

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.930 
the iPhone 5 also this can do a lot more
than<00:03:43.290> this<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.160> guess<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.610> kind<00:03:44.670> of

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
than this and I guess that is kind of

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.670 
than this and I guess that is kind of
obvious<00:03:45.299> if<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.480> will<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.260> think<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.530> could

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
obvious if you will so I think I could

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.470 
obvious if you will so I think I could
hold<00:03:46.829> maybe<00:03:47.040> three<00:03:47.370> or<00:03:47.400> four<00:03:47.519> iPod<00:03:48.150> nanos

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
hold maybe three or four iPod nanos

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.970 
hold maybe three or four iPod nanos
before<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.780> can<00:03:48.930> even<00:03:48.989> fathom<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.500> weight<00:03:49.769> of

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
before I can even fathom the weight of

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.690 
before I can even fathom the weight of
the<00:03:50.130> iPhone<00:03:50.610> 5<00:03:51.890> so<00:03:52.890> hope<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.190> guys<00:03:53.340> enjoyed
