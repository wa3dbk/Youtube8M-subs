surprising<00:02:54.110> again<00:02:54.799> if<00:02:55.010> it's<00:02:55.190> list<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.519> true

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
surprising again if it's list is true

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.610 
surprising again if it's list is true
because<00:02:55.940> they're<00:02:56.239> kind<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:56.630> like<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.230> pseudo

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
because they're kind of like the pseudo

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.220 
because they're kind of like the pseudo
legends<00:02:57.950> of<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.160> game<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.870> we've<00:02:59.870> seen<00:03:00.110> like

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
legends of the game and we've seen like

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.259 
legends of the game and we've seen like
T<00:03:00.410> target<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.920> mega<00:03:01.370> ugly<00:03:01.670> he<00:03:01.790> was<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:01.910> pseudo

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
T target a mega ugly he was a pseudo

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.780 
T target a mega ugly he was a pseudo
legend<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:02.959> think<00:03:03.709> it's<00:03:03.799> more<00:03:03.829> possible<00:03:04.100> to
