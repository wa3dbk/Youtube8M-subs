00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.130 
probably until the new xbox comes out
which<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.489> like<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.989> one<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.079> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
which is going to be like in one and a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
which is going to be like in one and a
half<00:00:52.170> or<00:00:52.500> two<00:00:52.530> years<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.579> I'm<00:00:53.760> gonna<00:00:53.820> wait<00:00:53.940> for

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
half or two years so I'm gonna wait for

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.910 
half or two years so I'm gonna wait for
that<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.629> then<00:00:56.180> I'm<00:00:57.180> probably<00:00:57.300> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.719> get

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920
