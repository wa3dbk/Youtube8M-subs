 with silvana also another visitor to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.730
 cone of edges we find that in 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.250
 half of the solar realized although it seems 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.960
 lie or if we met and would be 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.070
 well tell us what you think 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.670
 the experience up here of what we're going 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.619
 visiting is that I am a repeat offender the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.410
 last year comes to the dollar and it is impossible 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.210
 do not go back this year and know this from that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.699
 we left with the vans of 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.619
 refuge I come thinking I can not be 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.140
 here I can not be here or this place 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.820
 it seems magical to me or is it totally magic 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.160
 where from no bad visits to the bias 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.899

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.420

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.420
 the difference with the puna Salta does not 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.520
 you put to good is much the difference is 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.290
 a place we are also talking about the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.230

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.690
 day and thing is very strong in this place 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.039
 it's about the energy that we 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.469
 we always speak the magic of the Andes 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.410
 well here you feel that energy is the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.379
 place is the place it's like that one comes 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.760
 it is one day two days three days and it goes 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.330

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.330
