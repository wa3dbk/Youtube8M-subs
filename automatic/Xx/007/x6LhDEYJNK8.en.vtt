00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:11.659
 at the stern 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.050
 we distinguish two groups of inflammatory signs once the four 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.409
 classical staging should be according to census 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.919
 a Roman doctor 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.169
 We will become ourselves at the fifth inflammatory to Gaul 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.610
 look at 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.010
 I'm the first source of inflammation 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.790
 Carlo 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.210
 that wanted solo 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.280
 Then we have 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.330
 tumor 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.340
 a third 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.040
 and the fourth is 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.340
 RUB ear 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.520
 Carlo Bruno from the morning before please note the Karlovy the calories 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.680
 Werner 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.430
 Dolo like DooLoad what the pain second pain 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.229
 Tumor refers to the swelling 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.059
 and humor that's the Rolf tion 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.090
 and for each one 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.140
 every inflammation mostly contains these four signs 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.960
 Heat is due to the fact that in the context of inflammation one more 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.799
 Circulation takes place, we see this more blood circulation, among other things 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.550
 that the inflamed area 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.690
 swollen and reddened but at the same time the more blood circulation 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.090
 leads to a warming of the inflamed area 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.110
 DooLoad is the name of the pain 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.380
 the pain is triggered by it 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.150
 that is hurt 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.670
 Capote defective 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.670
 or destroy broken ones 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.120
 one of the WSV Moon release namely that Pfister media 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.890
 and this is then - the fluid, for example, too 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.880
 Nettle contact causes pain 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.509
 then the swelling comes the third 1 &amp; 1 such tumor the swelling 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.090
 also attributed this as well as the fourth of the u-boats zero point to one 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.880
 Increased blood flow that is in the inflamed area are the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.099
 We have already seen capillaries 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.759
 this chapel job and effects 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.300
 warmer swelling and redness 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.869
 because the book was about volume so it quickly gets down to business 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:24.119
 and the whole of course serves the accelerated repair 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.149
 then we have the fifth inflammatory-rich one 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:30.060
 to Berlin the function 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.039
 Openair Saar 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.940
 he says 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.030
 derived from this from this word the German word legitimizes the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.480
 Function reader designates that I do not negate there but impaired 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.269
 function 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.909
 that it is in the area 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.700
 in the tissue in which inflammation takes place 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.519
 the function of the tissue is impaired 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.769
 and so we basically have five Cardinals and Roma 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.769
 the inflammation 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.259
 the factors that cause inflammation 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.639
 leaders are relatively easy to describe as we have first 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.309
 once microorganisms 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.889
 these are the disease to make like bacteria viruses or fungi 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:17.980
 then with the fawns belong to it 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.620
 above that they will land much more ours 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.669
 Chapter on infectious diseases 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.889
 then we have the right mix and physical 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.289
 still yesterday 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:32.129
 with one more thing we describe a damaging Reitz 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:37.459
 chemical locomotives are, for example, chemicals that break down the tissues 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.019
 can 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.760
 which also in Bregenz alcohol 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.749
 although we also count that among the top 10 toxins 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:47.039
 and physical oxen 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.930
 I believe many of us have been exposed to such before 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.989
 as we all do well we did deeds 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.249
 in the endeavor to have lain BartÃ³k Rome and then we had the sunburn on 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:03:59.270
 next morning 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.770
 we realized that it was way too long 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.500
 that's it for example 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.209
 the physical still so radiation 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.270
 by simply 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.639
 Sunbeams 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.679
 In addition, allergies can 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:14.939
 and others the monologues already factors 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.699
 triggering an inflammation Allergies are exactly what they mean by it 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:20.850
 one tolerates 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.130
 Do not look harmless by pater seeds or peas and carrots 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.349
 but other geological factors that is a bit more interesting 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.870
 There are people in whom the body's immune system 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.610
 Fighting against the body's own tissue, there is something out wrong 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.559
 ran 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:44.069
 a nasty Aldean Toby I said and under the influence of such 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.629
 Drive-in Monologues Shire sick around 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.879
 people can die 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.979
 then we have everything in the next draw for 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:56.210
 Inflammation the the clamps median 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.210
 with the damage we go to write the under-circulation 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:04.379
 There are some legendary and fatally injured the damage going on
