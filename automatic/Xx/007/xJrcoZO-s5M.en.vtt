00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:13.599
 hello my name is pedro then i will pass explained the way 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.599
 configure your pc with an aesthetic ilp 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.390
 well first of all we'll see let's check the ite that is assigning us 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.769
 our router 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:24.789
 for it 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.189
 we have to go to the beginning 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.909
 run 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:34.280
 i in the run box we write the cmd sequence 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.560
 We are going to accept and I'm going away 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.640
 a waitress file 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.240
 in windows vista and gÃ¼iro 7 to get to this point 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.350
 we would go to home 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.020
 programs 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.670
 accessories 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.390
 and system symbol 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.570
 once there 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.760
 percent we will introduce 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.760
 the csi between command 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.350
 with fiz 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 spelling 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.090
 n efe ig 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.610
 with this command 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.950
 norm shows the configuration of our local road connection 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.740
 I explain 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.390
 the ip address 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.500
 that day the pure truth about six or eight 1 35 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.620
 in the ip address 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.760
 that our route is assigning our pc 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.520
 the network mask 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.550
 205 worthy destinations but five zero would be the most expensive that our 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.110
 and the default gateway a new one about 6 8 1 1 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.490
 it is at the door of the sun the idea that the router has 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.490
 let's say everything where the eagerness 8 pts 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.630
 with the router to exit the internet 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.860
 will have a race 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.740
 well a ban is checked this 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.910
 closing the window 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.960
 and we have to configure 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.070
 an ip is our perez said 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.200
 we perceived began 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.890
 will connect 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.179
 show network connections 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.599
 once there 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.499
 click on the right mouse button 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:16.799
 on 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.789
 with the anti-k vote and that the Roman law on the connection 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:25.029
 and we would give properties 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.810
 well we went to play see we go to the internet protocol is 20 to be fixed 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.029
 we have configured 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:34.359
 and we do a double ti 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.529
 ok to get to this point in windows 7 and windows vista 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.249
 we must follow the following steps 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:44.989
 this would be the route for windows 7 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.529
 we lived started 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:48.629
 control Panel 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.299
 Internet networks 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.369
 Center network and sharing 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.589
 change configuration of network adapter 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.319
 and there we would give again to the right button in local road connection 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:10.010
 properties and we select the internet protocol version 4 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.100
 both windows xp and windows 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.169
 view 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.480
 I have been the internet protocol version 4 and 6 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.089
 we would take the picture 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:25.139
 well the route of windows view and very similar to windows 7 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.280
 except that 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.519
 Where we have 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.659
 p network adapter configuration changes 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.359
 there we would have 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.749
 manage network connections 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:40.749
 for everything else it is totally 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.419
 we continue with xp 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:52.249
 we see that we have that evaluation get a piper an address 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:54.909
 tried automatically 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:56.279
 in this way 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:58.260
 the Utrera would be assigned 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.929
 one and 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:04.379
 to each of our fish in this case to this and we are already distant in 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:05.869
 mind is not being assigned 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:09.729
 the 1 35 this is called configuration by hcp 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.649
 yes yes yes we would like a configuration 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.669
 we would see use the following ip address 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.669
 and write and masters 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.099
 the ip that we are interested in 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.499
 new one 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.919
 about six or eight 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.150
 and here 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.150
 we could put for example side 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:40.729
 this is important because I put side and I do not put 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.020
 the 34 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.559
 your skin the router 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:47.639
 efe as a general rule starts like this at Christmas 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:49.270
 from 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.449
 of the ip address 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.659
 33 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.499
 therefore if we have several fish in our network 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.940
 and some with hcp we are going worse because in it and tried to take vitamin t 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:04.479
 the lute 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.260
 the first one will assign 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.980
 the 1 33 to the second the 1 34 to the third the 1 35 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.110
 and so on 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.220
 if we put our pc the 1 35 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.810
 and we have two computers that I want them to be interested in taking 

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:23.300
 vitamin C 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.760
 when we commit 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.559
 elche the second computer 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:28.970
 do not 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.199
 the network entered conflict 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.800
 that is why we will have reserved in the figures that have included 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.180
 sleepless 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.180
 until 32 to avoid conflicts 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.930
 we would put you side 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.689
 click on network mask 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:52.479
 September automatically and as the default gateway 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.360
 We saw that it was a new one 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.879
 1 6 8 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:58.330
 one 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.830
 and one that would be 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.550
 the route gateway 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.770
 now we would only have to put the babies that plan table 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.099
 the any 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.349
 you will see that there is a percentage in the market in this case we are going to put 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:13.889
 those of telephone 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.059
 that day the 80 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:18.689
 58 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:20.050
 0 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.259
 33 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.259
 and 80 58 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.809
 entity 

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:29.749
 97 

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:33.469
 At this point we should accept, we would accept 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:37.639
 the window behind 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:41.870
 we close this window and we would only check if the change that 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.180
 we have done it correctly 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.430
 for that we return to the beginning 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.050
 run 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.499
 cmd 

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:52.879
 to accept 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:55.879
 and we rewrite the command lippe 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.460
 I met 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.139
 and to give him encouragement we see that the address that our pc now has 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.469
 is the one we have assigned 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:09.479
 manually 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.479
 this is all I hope this works 

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:13.869
 this explanation
