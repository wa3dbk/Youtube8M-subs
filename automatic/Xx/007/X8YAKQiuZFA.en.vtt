00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.890
 and international champion manual of the 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.350
 bikini fitness category 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.540
 does a back workout and the 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.820
 favorite exercises for this great 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.650
 international competitor as we see in 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.880
 this case is doing milestones by 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:26.720
 behind grip has opened more or less 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:30.199
 hands open a meter and a half 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.670
 approximately always the chest to 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:37.240
 in the back well straight good 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.540
 placed within what is 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:44.230
 the seat of the machine and always by 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.390
 behind the neck trying to try 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.690
 lower the maximum route and above all 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.880
 looking for a final stretch that is what 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.460
 that makes us really locate the 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.500
 dorsal or the part of the back the 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.950
 next exercise is milestone 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.820
 closed grip 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.409
 it's about changing the bar for a 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.999
 triangle grip 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.939
 and the athlete in this case is placed in 

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:15.640
 an identical position to the first 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.970
 exercise that we have made and we look for 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.240
 go down 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.310
 the triangle to the chest pulling out chest 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.620
 arching our backs as we can 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.980
 observe arching the back and 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.770
 recovering the initial position above 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.490
 perfectly stretching what is the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.410
 dorsal to work in thickness what 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.900
 we will work more than what is 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.060
 dorsal expansion all that is the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.650
 internal work of rhomboid is trapeze 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.660
 inside 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.910
 and back in thickness and density 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.290
 next preferred exercise of this 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.820
 great athlete is rowing 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.180
 in bar 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.710
 or rowing in tips that is also called and 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.310
 it's an exercise where we have to bow the 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.510
 back pulling the chest out and 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.000
 the gluteus outwards always looking 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.510
 involve the back in a very 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.340
 strict to whom it is really about 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.480
 balance as little as possible to another 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.070
 charge to make a small estate the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.310
 final moment but especially the 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.120
 complete travel and get to the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.280
 part of the chest with the bar for 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.590
 the elbows very closed involve 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.959
 directly everything is the dorsal part 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.890
 inside what is also a job of 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.890
 back density 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.790
 we now proceed to fourth exercise 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.430
 favorite of immaculate world that is a 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.269
 exercise that we call walk over in 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.920
 pole to the correct position is 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.269
 slightly used the trunk arching 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.069
 well the back for the part of the 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.290
 Lumbar, taking out the gluteus and taking out a 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.390
 little chest for outside and arms 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.090
 right to not involve the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.939
 triceps and looking for a maximum travel 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.480
 where we stretch the number to find 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:11.099
 that this is marked in its entirety 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.129
 exercise really also serves as 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:17.190
 stretch and she can favor the 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:19.560
 development and that the inner connection 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.690
 oral brain with our muscles 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.700
 be more correct 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.840
 we finished then with this exercise 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.609
 which will be the last of this round of 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.879
