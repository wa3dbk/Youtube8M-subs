hello everyone my name is mr. polka fowl
and<00:00:07.680> welcome<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.130> another<00:00:08.580> halo<00:00:09.179> 4<00:00:09.599> custom<00:00:10.050> map

and welcome to another halo 4 custom map

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.129 
and welcome to another halo 4 custom map
this<00:00:11.219> one<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.670> called<00:00:12.090> frontier<00:00:12.840> it's<00:00:13.080> a

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
this one is called frontier it's a

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.780 
this one is called frontier it's a
competitive<00:00:13.410> map<00:00:13.799> for<00:00:14.040> six<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.370> ten<00:00:14.519> players

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
competitive map for six to ten players

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.820 
competitive map for six to ten players
that<00:00:15.030> was<00:00:15.120> built<00:00:15.360> by<00:00:15.509> pneumonic<00:00:16.080> now<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
that was built by pneumonic now the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.590 
that was built by pneumonic now the
thing<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.100> think<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.340> like<00:00:17.490> most<00:00:17.850> about<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.359> map

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
thing I think I like most about this map

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.060 
thing I think I like most about this map
is<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.900> fact<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.170> he's<00:00:19.380> gone<00:00:19.560> with<00:00:19.770> an<00:00:19.890> off

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
is the fact that he's gone with an off

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.000 
is the fact that he's gone with an off
coordinate<00:00:20.640> style<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.420> means<00:00:21.689> basically

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
coordinate style so that means basically

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.990 
coordinate style so that means basically
you'll<00:00:23.010> notice<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.369> there's<00:00:23.550> alleyways

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
you'll notice that there's alleyways

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.660 
you'll notice that there's alleyways
that<00:00:24.180> don't<00:00:24.330> really<00:00:24.539> fit<00:00:24.779> into<00:00:24.990> any<00:00:25.289> set

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
that don't really fit into any set

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.710 
that don't really fit into any set
coordinates<00:00:26.670> at<00:00:26.849> all<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.210> it's<00:00:27.359> not<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:27.689> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
coordinates at all so it's not like a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.870 
coordinates at all so it's not like a
two<00:00:27.960> by<00:00:28.109> four<00:00:28.140> wide<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:28.859> not<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> four<00:00:29.760> by

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
two by four wide it's not like a four by

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.370 
two by four wide it's not like a four by
four<00:00:29.910> wide<00:00:30.269> or<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> three<00:00:30.720> by<00:00:30.840> three<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.199> kind

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
four wide or a three by three it's kind

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.959 
four wide or a three by three it's kind
of<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.529> his<00:00:31.740> own<00:00:31.980> coordinates<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.669> he's<00:00:32.790> made

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
of a his own coordinates that he's made

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.940 
of a his own coordinates that he's made
up<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.660> feels<00:00:33.840> much<00:00:34.050> more<00:00:34.260> natural<00:00:34.320> it

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
up and it feels much more natural it

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.190 
up and it feels much more natural it
feels<00:00:35.160> less<00:00:35.489> like<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.760> forge<00:00:36.090> map<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:36.899> only

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
feels less like a forge map not only

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.080 
feels less like a forge map not only
because<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.100> meshing<00:00:38.610> between<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
because of the meshing between the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.240 
because of the meshing between the
natural<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.079> unnatural<00:00:40.410> train<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
natural and the unnatural train but the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.479 
natural and the unnatural train but the
fact<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:42.510> composed<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.489> coordinates

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
fact that it's composed of coordinates

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.279 
fact that it's composed of coordinates
that<00:00:44.579> he's<00:00:44.940> made<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.300> dimensions<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.960> aren't

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
that he's made up dimensions that aren't

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.860 
that he's made up dimensions that aren't
relevant<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.219> block<00:00:47.910> sizes<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> game

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
relevant to the block sizes in the game

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.260 
relevant to the block sizes in the game
so<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.620> always<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> plus<00:00:50.280> they're<00:00:51.030> not<00:00:51.120> too

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
so that is always a plus they're not too

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.729 
so that is always a plus they're not too
small<00:00:51.510> not<00:00:51.690> too<00:00:51.750> wide<00:00:52.050> which<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.350> like<00:00:52.500> quite<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
small not too wide which I like quite a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.500 
small not too wide which I like quite a
bit<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.100> also<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> fact<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.210> he's<00:00:54.390> gone

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
bit I also like the fact that he's gone

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.180 
bit I also like the fact that he's gone
with<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> consistent<00:00:55.410> color<00:00:55.649> theme<00:00:55.949> throughout

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
with a consistent color theme throughout

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.260 
with a consistent color theme throughout
the<00:00:56.309> maps<00:00:56.489> you'll<00:00:56.670> notice<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.090> there<00:00:57.239> is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the maps you'll notice that there is

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.840 
the maps you'll notice that there is
quite<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> bit<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.930> green<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.399> green<00:00:59.640> so

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
quite a bit of green and I like green so

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.209 
quite a bit of green and I like green so
I<00:00:59.879> have<00:01:00.059> no<00:01:00.210> problems<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.719> whatsoever

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
I have no problems with that whatsoever

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.470 
I have no problems with that whatsoever
as<00:01:02.219> for<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.609> gameplay<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.149> map<00:01:03.300> you'll

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
as for the gameplay on this map you'll

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.969 
as for the gameplay on this map you'll
notice<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> lot<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.500> times<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
notice that a lot of the times the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.800 
notice that a lot of the times the
battle<00:01:05.309> will<00:01:05.489> migrate<00:01:05.820> towards<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.510> upper

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
battle will migrate towards this upper

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.660 
battle will migrate towards this upper
hallway<00:01:07.080> over<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.650> but<00:01:08.250> that's<00:01:08.340> not<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.640> say

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
hallway over here but that's not to say

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.250 
hallway over here but that's not to say
that<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.000> won't<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.390> other<00:01:09.570> sections<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
that you won't see other sections of the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.310 
that you won't see other sections of the
map<00:01:10.640> since<00:01:11.640> there<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.330> much<00:01:12.510> combat<00:01:12.840> going

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
map since there is so much combat going

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.140 
map since there is so much combat going
on<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.680> hallway<00:01:13.890> chances<00:01:14.549> are<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.970> will

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
on in this hallway chances are you will

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.359 
on in this hallway chances are you will
spawn<00:01:15.600> somewhere<00:01:16.170> else<00:01:16.380> inside<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.189> map

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
spawn somewhere else inside of the map

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.609 
spawn somewhere else inside of the map
and<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.390> will<00:01:18.630> force<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.140> people<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
and that will force the people in the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.080 
and that will force the people in the
hallway<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> actually<00:01:20.340> leave<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.790> hallway

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
hallway to actually leave the hallway

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.880 
hallway to actually leave the hallway
and<00:01:21.180> start<00:01:21.360> attacking<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.770> go

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and start attacking you and you to go

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.020 
and start attacking you and you to go
towards<00:01:23.310> them<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.670> you'll<00:01:23.850> have

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
towards them so you'll have

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.399 
towards them so you'll have
opportunities<00:01:25.020> where<00:01:25.229> you'll<00:01:25.320> have

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
opportunities where you'll have

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.899 
opportunities where you'll have
firefights<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.100> various<00:01:26.460> sections<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
firefights in various sections of the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.730 
firefights in various sections of the
map<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.390> map<00:01:27.509> does<00:01:27.750> balance<00:01:28.229> itself<00:01:28.500> out

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
map so the map does balance itself out

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.370 
map so the map does balance itself out
but<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.729> spend<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.299> chunk<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
but you do spend a chunk of it in that

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.960 
but you do spend a chunk of it in that
hallway<00:01:31.590> which<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.070> gotta<00:01:32.280> say<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.670> like

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
hallway which I gotta say I do like

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.580 
hallway which I gotta say I do like
normally<00:01:33.360> that's<00:01:33.540> kind<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.900> flauta<00:01:34.140> map<00:01:34.439> if

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
normally that's kind of a flauta map if

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.080 
normally that's kind of a flauta map if
game<00:01:34.799> plays<00:01:34.979> really<00:01:35.250> heavy<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.610> one<00:01:35.759> section

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
game plays really heavy in one section

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.210 
game plays really heavy in one section
but<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.840> here<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> fine<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:38.040> right

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
but I think here it is fine it's right

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.550 
but I think here it is fine it's right
on<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> threshold<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.939> being<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.570> good<00:01:40.170> balance

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
on the threshold of being a good balance

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.620 
on the threshold of being a good balance
here<00:01:40.770> though<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.549> see<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.909> spawned<00:01:42.299> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
here though you can see I have spawned a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.060 
here though you can see I have spawned a
beam<00:01:42.899> rifle<00:01:43.110> now<00:01:43.380> they're<00:01:43.500> being<00:01:43.590> rifle<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.009> do

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
beam rifle now they're being rifle I do

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.770 
beam rifle now they're being rifle I do
not<00:01:44.280> believe<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.729> native<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> map<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.570> can

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
not believe is native to the map you can

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.569 
not believe is native to the map you can
only<00:01:46.020> get<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.290> through<00:01:46.470> ordnance<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.280> that's

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
only get it through ordnance and that's

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.039 
only get it through ordnance and that's
exactly<00:01:47.820> what<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.299> since<00:01:48.509> we<00:01:48.659> had<00:01:48.810> such<00:01:49.020> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
exactly what it and since we had such a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.450 
exactly what it and since we had such a
lead<00:01:49.320> here<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> decided<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.189> was<00:01:50.340> just

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
lead here I decided that I was just

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.950 
lead here I decided that I was just
gonna<00:01:50.640> kind<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.000> mess<00:01:51.210> around<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.720> go<00:01:51.780> for

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
gonna kind of mess around and go for

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.240 
gonna kind of mess around and go for
snapshots<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.590> beat<00:01:52.740> down<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.040> that's<00:01:53.159> why

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
snapshots and beat down so that's why

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.340 
snapshots and beat down so that's why
you'll<00:01:53.399> see<00:01:53.430> me<00:01:53.840> messing<00:01:54.840> around<00:01:54.960> with<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
you'll see me messing around with the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.929 
you'll see me messing around with the
beam<00:01:55.500> rifle<00:01:55.710> quite<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> bit<00:01:56.189> well<00:01:56.670> that's<00:01:56.790> just

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
beam rifle quite a bit well that's just

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.700 
beam rifle quite a bit well that's just
goes<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.299> show<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.840> map<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.320> kind

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
goes to show you that this map is kind

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.010 
goes to show you that this map is kind
of<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.009> fun<00:01:59.369> map<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.759> mean<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.509> does<00:02:00.689> definitely

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
of a fun map I mean it does definitely

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.959 
of a fun map I mean it does definitely
have<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> very<00:02:01.560> strong<00:02:02.100> competitive<00:02:02.640> feel<00:02:02.850> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
have a very strong competitive feel to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.310 
have a very strong competitive feel to
it<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.210> at<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.360> same<00:02:03.390> time<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.079> kind<00:02:04.259> of

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
it but at the same time you can kind of

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.569 
it but at the same time you can kind of
mess<00:02:04.500> around<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.250> play<00:02:05.369> with<00:02:05.490> your

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
mess around on it and play with your

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.410 
mess around on it and play with your
friends<00:02:05.640> whatever

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
friends whatever

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.240 
friends whatever
and<00:02:06.630> that's<00:02:07.020> exactly<00:02:07.200> what<00:02:07.680> makes<00:02:07.800> this<00:02:08.009> map

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
and that's exactly what makes this map

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.800 
and that's exactly what makes this map
so<00:02:08.550> great<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.910> doesn't<00:02:09.180> really<00:02:09.270> categorize

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
so great it doesn't really categorize

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.780 
so great it doesn't really categorize
itself<00:02:10.380> either<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> highly<00:02:11.520> competitive

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
itself either as a highly competitive

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.600 
itself either as a highly competitive
map<00:02:12.180> or<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> very<00:02:13.170> casual<00:02:13.770> map<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.340> really

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
map or a very casual map it's really

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.790 
map or a very casual map it's really
just<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.880> nice<00:02:15.030> balance<00:02:15.510> between<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.990> two<00:02:16.170> but

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
just a nice balance between the two but

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.890 
just a nice balance between the two but
even<00:02:16.980> if<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.460> do<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.820> forge<00:02:18.270> competitive<00:02:18.840> or

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
even if you do not forge competitive or

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.210 
even if you do not forge competitive or
play<00:02:19.230> competitive<00:02:19.770> for<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.040> matter

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
play competitive for that matter

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.710 
play competitive for that matter
definitely<00:02:21.030> give<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.210> one<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.390> download

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
definitely give this one a download

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.120 
definitely give this one a download
because<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.140> architecture<00:02:22.770> on<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.920> map

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
because the architecture on the map

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.010 
because the architecture on the map
itself<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.850> very<00:02:24.150> nice<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.600> maybe<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.870> can

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
itself is very nice and maybe you can

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.930 
itself is very nice and maybe you can
learn<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.230> thing<00:02:25.530> or<00:02:25.650> two<00:02:25.710> or<00:02:26.370> maybe<00:02:26.520> pick<00:02:26.760> up<00:02:26.850> a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
learn a thing or two or maybe pick up a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.340 
learn a thing or two or maybe pick up a
style<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.390> see<00:02:27.570> here<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> map<00:02:27.960> because<00:02:28.230> it

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
style you see here on the map because it

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.490 
style you see here on the map because it
is<00:02:28.860> very<00:02:29.550> very<00:02:30.270> nice<00:02:30.420> anyways<00:02:30.840> my<00:02:31.050> name<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.260> mr.
