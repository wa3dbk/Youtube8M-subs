00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
they're all in here as well off the list

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.010 
they're all in here as well off the list
and<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.240> think<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:09.689> get<00:01:09.990> a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
and so I think if you just get a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.710 
and so I think if you just get a
toothbrush<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> soapy<00:01:11.729> water<00:01:12.240> easily

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
toothbrush and with a soapy water easily

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.539 
toothbrush and with a soapy water easily
so<00:01:13.020> that's<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.560> needs<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.860> be<00:01:13.979> done<00:01:14.280> with

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
so that's what I needs to be done with

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.429 
so that's what I needs to be done with
something<00:01:14.820> needs<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:15.990> done<00:01:16.080> with

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
something needs to be done with

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.899 
something needs to be done with
something<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.430> would<00:01:17.670> save

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
something and you think this would save

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.210 
something and you think this would save
it<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.360> well<00:01:18.810> I'd<00:01:18.990> say<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.740> what<00:01:20.040> will

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
it then well I'd say but what will

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.090 
it then well I'd say but what will
happen<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.549> say<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:20.820> they're<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> stop<00:01:21.509> sucking

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
happen to say if they're a stop sucking

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.249 
happen to say if they're a stop sucking
insect<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.670> they'll<00:01:23.850> weaken<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> clown<00:01:24.659> but

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
insect so they'll weaken the clown but

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.350 
insect so they'll weaken the clown but
this<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.560> fairly<00:01:26.009> big<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.790> certain

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
this is fairly big and it's a certain

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.240 
this is fairly big and it's a certain
amount<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.689> interesting<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:29.040> too

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
amount of interesting but it's not too

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.210 
amount of interesting but it's not too
terrible<00:01:29.700> right<00:01:30.119> okay<00:01:30.840> no<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.740> definitely

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
terrible right okay no you definitely

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.609 
terrible right okay no you definitely
don't<00:01:32.579> want<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.820> eat<00:01:32.970> those<00:01:33.180> good<00:01:33.869> good<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.590> I

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
don't want to eat those good good so I

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.140 
don't want to eat those good good so I
think<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:35.040> something<00:01:35.490> water<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.000> just

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
think just something water and just

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.030 
think just something water and just

potash knows I think I think just get a
little<00:02:11.739> bit<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.069> a<00:02:12.099> slow-release<00:02:12.459> fertilizer

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
little bit of a slow-release fertilizer

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.330 
little bit of a slow-release fertilizer
mix<00:02:13.569> into<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.900> top<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.319> compost<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.950> then

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
mix into the top of the compost and then

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.369 
mix into the top of the compost and then
when<00:02:15.519> you<00:02:15.610> water<00:02:15.819> say<00:02:16.300> obviously<00:02:17.230> you're
