00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
all right I've been made a video in

little overview of the homemade
motorcycle<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.910> made<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.329> some<00:00:54.900> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.050> parts

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
motorcycle I made and some of the parts

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.670 
motorcycle I made and some of the parts
that<00:00:55.410> are<00:00:55.559> used<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.860> build<00:00:56.040> it<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:58.140> engine<00:00:58.530> is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
that are used to build it the engine is

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.240 
that are used to build it the engine is
just<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.520> Honda<00:01:00.449> 6.5<00:01:01.199> horsepower<00:01:01.230> clone

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
just a a Honda 6.5 horsepower clone

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
just a a Honda 6.5 horsepower clone
it's<00:01:02.580> the<00:01:02.879> Greyhound<00:01:03.449> clone<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.989> used<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.410> be

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
it's the Greyhound clone that used to be

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.620 
it's the Greyhound clone that used to be
able<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.769> buy<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> Harbor<00:01:05.339> Freight<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:06.450> now

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
able to buy a Harbor Freight but now

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.300 
able to buy a Harbor Freight but now
they<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.410> predator<00:01:07.920> engines

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
they just have the predator engines

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.770 
they just have the predator engines
which<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.610> basically<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> same<00:01:09.180> thing<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.660> a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
which is basically the same thing just a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.480 
which is basically the same thing just a
different<00:01:10.140> name<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.470> 200<00:01:13.470> CC<00:01:13.890> 6.5

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
different name so that's 200 CC 6.5

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.130 
different name so that's 200 CC 6.5
horsepower<00:01:14.690> and<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:17.520> has<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:18.110> torque<00:01:19.110> converter

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
horsepower and it has a torque converter

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.359 
horsepower and it has a torque converter
on<00:01:19.649> it<00:01:19.770> which<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:19.979> also<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.399> Chinese<00:01:21.330> clone<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
on it which is also a Chinese clone of a

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.219 
on it which is also a Chinese clone of a
comet<00:01:23.369> comet<00:01:24.060> 30<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.570> think<00:01:24.840> they're<00:01:24.990> called

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
comet comet 30 I think they're called

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.270 
comet comet 30 I think they're called
and<00:01:26.360> get<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> little<00:01:27.660> better<00:01:27.810> torque<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.619> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and get a little better torque and a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.710 
and get a little better torque and a
better<00:01:29.640> top<00:01:29.940> speed<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.450> torque<00:01:30.690> converter

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
better top speed with torque converter

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.609 
better top speed with torque converter
than<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.410> a<00:01:31.560> centrifugal<00:01:32.520> clutch<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.350> it's

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
than just a centrifugal clutch so it's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.590 
than just a centrifugal clutch so it's
good<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.160> motorcycle<00:01:35.430> not<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.330> a<00:01:36.420> mini

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
good for a motorcycle not just a mini

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.260 
good for a motorcycle not just a mini
biker<00:01:36.899> a<00:01:37.310> go-karts<00:01:38.310> better<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.060> road

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
biker a go-karts better for on the road

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.590 
biker a go-karts better for on the road
and<00:01:41.270> has<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.300> chain<00:01:42.630> drive<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:45.119> back<00:01:45.330> wheel<00:01:45.570> is

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
and has a chain drive the back wheel is

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.359 
and has a chain drive the back wheel is
from<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.140> Honda<00:01:47.070> CB<00:01:47.759> 1<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.270> 5<00:01:48.539> TT<00:01:49.050> I<00:01:49.320> think<00:01:50.039> is<00:01:50.160> a

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
from a Honda CB 1 to 5 TT I think is a

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.370 
from a Honda CB 1 to 5 TT I think is a
bike<00:01:50.729> they<00:01:50.880> only<00:01:51.060> used<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.720> motorcycle

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
bike they only used in motorcycle

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.370 
bike they only used in motorcycle
training<00:01:52.590> programs<00:01:53.330> so<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:55.050> don't<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.349> that

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
training programs so you don't see that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.699 
training programs so you don't see that
many<00:01:55.679> of<00:01:55.800> them<00:01:55.890> around<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:57.140> I<00:01:58.140> had<00:01:58.349> to<00:01:58.470> change

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
many of them around and I had to change

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:00.979 
many of them around and I had to change
the<00:01:58.890> rear<00:01:59.069> sprocket<00:01:59.580> with<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.599> original

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:00.989 
the rear sprocket with the original

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:02.449 
the rear sprocket with the original
sprocket<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.470> would<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.679> been<00:02:01.860> geared<00:02:02.280> way

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
sprocket it would have been geared way

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:03.199 
sprocket it would have been geared way
too<00:02:02.520> high

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
too high

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:05.830 
too high
a<00:02:03.270> way<00:02:04.050> too<00:02:04.110> high<00:02:04.440> top<00:02:04.709> speed<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> had<00:02:05.429> to

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
a way too high top speed so I had to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.100 
a way too high top speed so I had to
change<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.050> for<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> 50<00:02:07.590> tooth<00:02:08.840> instead<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
change it for a 50 tooth instead of the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.559 
change it for a 50 tooth instead of the
usual<00:02:10.410> 40<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:14.160> frame<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.819> actually<00:02:15.420> not

it's most of it is 3/4 inch but in some

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.880 
it's most of it is 3/4 inch but in some
parts<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.550> are<00:02:23.640> half-inch<00:02:24.150> such<00:02:24.360> as<00:02:24.890> these

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
parts that are half-inch such as these

there's no front suspension it's just a

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.360 
there's no front suspension it's just a
solid<00:02:39.260> Forks<00:02:39.800> it<00:02:39.920> was<00:02:40.010> kind<00:02:40.190> of<00:02:40.220> an

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
solid Forks it was kind of an

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.820 
solid Forks it was kind of an
afterthought<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:42.550> couldn't<00:02:43.550> find<00:02:43.700> any<00:02:43.880> cheap

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
afterthought I couldn't find any cheap

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.350 
afterthought I couldn't find any cheap
telescopic<00:02:45.830> forks<00:02:46.190> anywhere<00:02:46.550> online<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.330> I

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
telescopic forks anywhere online so I

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.260 
telescopic forks anywhere online so I
just<00:02:47.569> went<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.020> made<00:02:48.190> some<00:02:49.190> solid<00:02:49.520> ones<00:02:49.760> just

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
just went and made some solid ones just

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.600 
just went and made some solid ones just
to<00:02:50.450> be<00:02:50.569> cheap

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
to be cheap

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.580 
to be cheap
it<00:02:52.610> does<00:02:52.819> have<00:02:53.030> rear<00:02:53.209> suspension<00:02:53.690> though<00:02:53.870> it's

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
it does have rear suspension though it's

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.130 
it does have rear suspension though it's
just<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.980> twin<00:02:55.819> shock<00:02:58.480> standard<00:02:59.480> shock

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.640 

it<00:05:46.210> only<00:05:46.360> has<00:05:46.630> one<00:05:46.930> break<00:05:47.530> which<00:05:47.919> is<00:05:49.530> kind<00:05:50.530> of<00:05:50.590> a

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
it only has one break which is kind of a

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.960 
it only has one break which is kind of a
problem<00:05:51.780> it<00:05:52.780> does<00:05:52.990> have<00:05:53.199> a<00:05:53.229> back<00:05:53.919> break<00:05:54.220> but

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
problem it does have a back break but

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:55.920 
problem it does have a back break but
it's<00:05:55.090> not<00:05:55.270> hooked<00:05:55.479> up

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
it's not hooked up

I<00:05:56.669> think<00:05:57.669> the<00:05:58.030> pads<00:05:58.270> might<00:05:58.510> be<00:05:58.659> worn<00:05:58.870> out<00:05:59.020> in<00:05:59.169> it

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
I think the pads might be worn out in it

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:00.540 
I think the pads might be worn out in it
or<00:05:59.500> something<00:05:59.860> like<00:05:59.949> that<00:06:00.130> because<00:06:00.250> doesn't

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
or something like that because doesn't

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:14.620
