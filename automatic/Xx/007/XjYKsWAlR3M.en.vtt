00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.724
 - Hey, my friends, I am here with the one and the only one. 

00:00:03.724 --> 00:00:05.806
 - Jenna marble. (laugh) - [Taylor] Hey! 

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:06.924
 - [Taylor] What are we doing, Jenna? 

00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:09.779
 - I want to ask you some brain tasks. 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:11.682
 Some fourth grades (laughing) 

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:13.240
 Some fourth grade questions. 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.695
 - Yeah, um. 

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:16.220
 - And you have to go to three seconds to answer these questions. 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.217
 - Fuck, okay, and these are difficult questions to answer. 

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:19.153
 We go through them a little bit. 

00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:20.680
 - Yes, some are easy. 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.614
 - For a fourth grader, you have to be smart, 

00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:26.389
 As a 25-year-old I am a stupid shit, so... 

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:27.070
 - Yes. 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.701
 - If I don't understand the problem right in three seconds, 

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:29.272
 what are you going to do? 

00:00:29.272 --> 00:00:31.241
 - I will tear your hair, your legs. 

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:32.588
 (laugh) 

00:00:32.588 --> 00:00:34.248
 One point of cultivation, one point of harvest, honey. 

00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:35.660
 - What is the gain from this? 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.879
 (laugh) 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.224
 - [All] is like a slippery leg. 

00:00:39.224 --> 00:00:42.858
 - Ok, find generous antonyms, 

00:00:42.858 --> 00:00:43.880
 this is your choice: 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.866
 - Oh, great! 

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.401
 - My choice for you. - [Taylor] Oh, okay, yes. 

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:50.930
 - It's delicious, hard, and embarrassing. 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.437
 One, two - [Taylor] for generosity? 

00:00:53.437 --> 00:00:55.713
 - [Jenna] three (Taylor Stuttering) 

00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:57.210
 - [Jenna] This is a greeting. 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.439
 - (laughs) Oh, damn it! 

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:01.332
 Wait a minute, eh? 

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:03.955
 Oh, hey, my god, hey! 

00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:05.220
 (laugh) 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.556
 - Holy shit! - [Jenna] This is beautiful! 

00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:08.411
 - [Jenna] Look! - [Taylor] Look at that. 

00:01:08.411 --> 00:01:10.302
 - [Taylor] Oh, my god, it stings. 

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:12.779
 - This is terrible, I think it is terrible! 

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:14.741
 - But this looks smooth like a shit. 

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:15.879
 - You look like a baby! 

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:17.354
 I watched the laser hair removal, 

00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:20.302
 Because it's like if you wax, it's expensive to do anything, 

00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:20.838
 you know what I mean? 

00:01:20.838 --> 00:01:22.938
 So, I looked at it, it is a lot cheaper than I imagined. 

00:01:22.938 --> 00:01:25.212
 To get such six meetings, or whatever. 

00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:27.441
 And all they get, like a stranger, 

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:30.192
 They make you like to scatter the eagle, 

00:01:30.192 --> 00:01:31.157
 They just got there and like 

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.465
 (Catch) to your asshole. 

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:33.704
 - Wait a minute, you are talking about the laser. 

00:01:33.704 --> 00:01:34.410
 - Yeah, um. 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.173
 - Laser processing your farts. 

00:01:35.173 --> 00:01:37.729
 Yeah, and all it -. 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.010
 - You live your dream girl. 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.213
 - Put money in the bank, 

00:01:40.213 --> 00:01:42.266
 Do you make a deposit or withdraw money? 

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:45.087
 - Deposit. (laugh) 

00:01:45.087 --> 00:01:49.445
 - What do you look at if you need water in the green trees? 

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:50.648
 - Oasis? 

00:01:51.585 --> 00:01:52.894
 - Yes. - [Taylor] Oh, my God. 

00:01:52.894 --> 00:01:55.225
 - What continent is completely located 

00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:58.467
 In the eastern and southern hemispheres? 

00:01:58.648 --> 00:01:59.711
 - Australia? 

00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:02.978
 - Yes, sacred shit, you smash it! 

00:02:02.978 --> 00:02:04.184
 - Thank you, thank you. 

00:02:04.184 --> 00:02:09.109
 - Ok, minus 3996 from 6325. 

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:12.092
 - You, holy! (laugh) 

00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:14.147
 - One, - [Taylor] No, wait! 

00:02:14.147 --> 00:02:15.077
 - Second, 

00:02:15.077 --> 00:02:17.175
 - I forgot the number, this is... 

00:02:17.175 --> 00:02:18.638
 - Get waxed! 

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:21.232
 - What, no (laugh) no! 

00:02:21.232 --> 00:02:22.932
 - Well, one, two, three, ah! 

00:02:22.932 --> 00:02:27.378
 - Oh, my God, hey, my God, hey! (laugh) 

00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:28.864
 Oh, my God, hey, my God! 

00:02:28.864 --> 00:02:30.539
 - Sorry, Taylor! 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:32.345
 - It’s the worst, when I thought you would tear it. 

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:33.019
 And you don't. 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.088
 - I know. 

00:02:34.088 --> 00:02:37.146
 - (Heavy breathing) (laugh) 

00:02:37.146 --> 00:02:39.083
 - What three digits can you make? 

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:41.568
 One, two, and three from these numbers? 

00:02:41.568 --> 00:02:43.668
 - Three, - [Taylor] 321. 

00:02:43.668 --> 00:02:45.422
 - Two, one. - [Taylor] Waiting! 

00:02:45.422 --> 00:02:47.100
 - [Taylor] How much do you need? (laugh) 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.352
 - There are 6 answers. 

00:02:48.352 --> 00:02:50.177
 - No, I will give you one, that count! 

00:02:50.177 --> 00:02:50.728
 (laugh) 

00:02:50.728 --> 00:02:51.692
 very good. - [Jenna] Ok, okay. 

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:52.885
 - [Jenna] in what state, you can visit 

00:02:52.885 --> 00:02:54.824
 Kennedy Space Center? 

00:02:54.824 --> 00:02:56.821
 - Oh, fuck this shit! 

00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:59.323
 Some types of Nevada? 

00:02:59.323 --> 00:03:00.395
 (buzzing) 

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:03.943
 (laughs) Oh, fucking, hey, my god! 

00:03:03.943 --> 00:03:08.005
 (laugh) 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.553
 Oh! 

00:03:10.553 --> 00:03:12.015
 - I didn’t mean to tear it down. 

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:13.908
 But they stick together. (laugh) 

00:03:13.908 --> 00:03:15.510
 Oh, my God, are you okay? 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.134
 - Oh my God! 

00:03:17.134 --> 00:03:19.271
 - Are we digital systems from Arabs? 

00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:21.928
 Greek, or China? 

00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:26.005
 - Hey, China? 

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.408
 - (嗡嗡) Arabs! 

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:31.414
 - (laughs) Oh, fucking, thank you, Arab. 

00:03:31.414 --> 00:03:32.299
 (Jenna’s voice) 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.587
 - what? 

00:03:33.587 --> 00:03:36.031
 - Get waxed (laugh) 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.615
 Oh, it will be so good to make it really passionate, 

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:41.137
 Oh, let it hate! - [Taylor] I hate you! 

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.634
 - [Jenna] Let it hate! - [Taylor] I hate you! 

00:03:42.634 --> 00:03:44.990
 - [Jenna] fell, it fell to the floor and made it annoying! 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.076
 Take the antonym to play in its home, 

00:03:48.076 --> 00:03:51.048
 What compound word did you get? 

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.497
 - Layhome? (laugh) 

00:03:54.497 --> 00:03:56.660
 I don't know, what is it? 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.180
 - homework? 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.976
 - Oh, work and play, I thought - 

00:03:59.976 --> 00:04:00.745
 - this is correct! 

00:04:00.745 --> 00:04:03.008
 - Do not! (laugh) 

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:05.424
 - What information is not gathered in the US Census? 

00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:09.186
 A person's name, age, race, or weight? 

00:04:10.815 --> 00:04:11.738
 Its weight. - [Taylor] name? 

00:04:11.738 --> 00:04:14.167
 - [Taylor] Waiting, no! (laugh) 

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:16.579
 Oh my god, I thought it was a name, though. 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.452
 Oh, that's fucking! - [Jenna] This is very good. 

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:21.363
 - [Jemna] Ok, let me be here. 

00:04:21.363 --> 00:04:23.103
 - Oh, it stings. 

00:04:23.103 --> 00:04:25.624
 - Dude, like a real small waxing kit at home, 

00:04:25.624 --> 00:04:27.351
 This shit is doing an explosion to work. 

00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:28.444
 - Thank you. 

00:04:28.444 --> 00:04:30.527
 - Enter a part of a word into a word 

00:04:30.527 --> 00:04:33.627
 Something you set to capture the mouse. 

00:04:33.627 --> 00:04:34.642
 Three, - [Taylor] trap! 

00:04:34.642 --> 00:04:35.581
 - [Jenna] Yes. - [Taylor] Ok, hey, my God. 

00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:37.110
 - [Jenna] This is a trap! - [Taylor] I understand. 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.687
 - [Jenna] If Mario eats three meals a day, 

00:04:39.687 --> 00:04:42.451
 How many meals did he eat in three weeks? 

00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:43.935
 - Oh, fuck this shit! 

00:04:43.935 --> 00:04:45.574
 Three times seven is 21, - [Jenna] three, two, 

00:04:45.574 --> 00:04:47.799
 - [Jenna] One! - [Taylor] Oh, God, 63! 

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:49.560
 - [Jenna] You are right, but you have no time! 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.040
 - No, hey, my god, hey! (laugh) 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.423
 - Are you ready? 

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:58.301
 - Oh! (laugh) 

00:04:58.301 --> 00:04:59.529
 - I am sorry! 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.225
 - This is by far the most painful. 

00:05:01.225 --> 00:05:05.172
 - Ok, is this the first in the butterfly's life cycle? 

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:06.090
 - Fuck this. 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.832
 - Larvae or cockroaches? 

00:05:07.832 --> 00:05:09.903
 - Oh, this fucking, hey. 

00:05:09.903 --> 00:05:11.085
 - This is a larva. 

00:05:11.085 --> 00:05:13.587
 - No, no, that is the phone. 

00:05:13.587 --> 00:05:16.900
 - Get wax, ok, I will do this hard, I can. 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.167
 One, two... 

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:21.361
 (Taylor laughs) 

00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:25.603
 - Oh my God! 

00:05:25.603 --> 00:05:27.688
 - We didn't get this one, two, three, 

00:05:27.688 --> 00:05:29.243
 Four, five, six, seven! 

00:05:29.243 --> 00:05:30.306
 (Taylor) 

00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:31.811
 Oh my God. 

00:05:32.426 --> 00:05:34.536
 - Consider all the pain you just take me through, 

00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:37.135
 I think I should wax you 1 piece. 

00:05:37.135 --> 00:05:37.693
 - Yes. 

00:05:37.693 --> 00:05:38.315
 - Where do you want to go? 

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:38.979
 - Anywhere. 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:39.832
 - right here? - [Jenna] You want it everywhere. 

00:05:39.832 --> 00:05:40.848
 - Wait a minute, can I really? 

00:05:40.848 --> 00:05:43.008
 - Yes, it's just going to go to the load of a fake Tan. 

00:05:43.008 --> 00:05:46.702
 - Wait (laugh) Ok, let's do it, hey, mine. 

00:05:46.702 --> 00:05:47.909
 - Yes, this is the way to do it. 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:49.361
 - Do you want to go to the bar? 

00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:51.261
 Oh, wait a minute! (laugh) 

00:05:51.261 --> 00:05:52.985
 - I think, yeah, this is the way to do it. 

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:54.681
 It's like my entire forearm. 

00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:55.556
 Fuck! - [Taylor] Yeah, this is. 

00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:59.474
 Does electricity pass through conductors or insulators? 

00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:01.575
 - An insulator. 

00:06:01.575 --> 00:06:03.258
 Well, I mean it comes from a conductor-- 

00:06:03.258 --> 00:06:04.510
 - (laughs) Ok, I will give you because you're-- 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.984
 - No, tear it open. - [Taylor] Are you sure? 

00:06:05.984 --> 00:06:08.072
 - We only need to wax, just wax it, what is it! 

00:06:08.072 --> 00:06:09.699
 Oh my God! - [Taylor] You are ready, ok? 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:14.284
 - Three, two, one. 

00:06:17.436 --> 00:06:19.918
 - Oh my God! - Oh, God! 

00:06:19.918 --> 00:06:22.473
 (laugh) 

00:06:22.473 --> 00:06:24.909
 - [Taylor] This is the best thing I have ever seen! 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:26.336
 - Oh, man, oh! 

00:06:26.336 --> 00:06:28.978
 - 100% fucked by a cobbler. 

00:06:28.978 --> 00:06:30.291
 - Fake cobbler, you. 

00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:33.151
 - Oh my God! (laugh) 

00:06:33.151 --> 00:06:36.980
 This is very interesting, and she is not my last little knee pit, 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.860
 I think I can say goodbye, thank you for watching everyone, 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.400
 And be sure to give a thumbs up and subscribe to me and Jenna. 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:48.682
 I really like the fucking seat on the edge! 

00:06:48.682 --> 00:06:50.341
 (laugh)
