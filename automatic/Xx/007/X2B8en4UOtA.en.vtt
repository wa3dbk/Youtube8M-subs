00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Modest Tastes cuisine from armful loves 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.680
 we will share a very easy pie recipe in this section 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.080
 "Bow tie" 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.480
 but let's take a look at the list of materials before 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.480
 12 pcs square puff pastry 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.240
 1 bunch of spinach 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.600
 1 tea cup crushed white cheese 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.160
 1 tea cup sunflower oil 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.720
 1 egg white 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 and 1 teaspoon of salt 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.120
 1 egg yolk for 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.080
 and 1 tbsp sesame seeds 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.840
 after the list of materials by preparing the inside ... 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.720
 we can begin operations 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.760
 We have 1 bunch of spinach, 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.440
 now especially the stalks are very thin 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.000
 the leaves are slightly larger 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.600
 we leave our oil in the pot 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.400
 After a little warming, we can add spinach 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.160
 and we'll roast it so that it doesn't leave much water on the fire. 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.560
 as seen in our spinach 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.560
 now we'll add some salt 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.680
 we're going to close the gold and wait a little to cool down 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.040
 roasted spinach 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.280
 now we are completing the inside by adding other materials 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.920
 We have a tea cup with crushed white cheese 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.520
 1 piece of egg white 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.400
 a little mess 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.200
 After our puff pastry was thawed a little ... 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.800
 we'll expand a little flour 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.360
 with finger tips, we don't want it to be too big 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.360
 set aside 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.600
 because we will expand the second 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.320
 to expand on the puff pastry ... 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.520
 we leave with spinach 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.160
 we are closing our other dough on 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.800
 first we cut the edges with a roulette 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.160
 we cut it right in the middle 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.040
 We said a bow ... 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.720
 to make a bow, we're shrinking in the middle 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.960
 and we're connecting the middle of the tracks 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.760
 after shaping our pies ... 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.040
 egg yolk with brush help 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.600
 After hatching, on our bows ... 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.720
 sesame seeds 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.520
 don't spread to the middle 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.640
 Yes, we're now preheating our donuts ... 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.640
 We can bake it until it's brown. 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.520
 Our bowls are freshly baked 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.520
 now we will serve warmly 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.600
 Modest Taste in the kitchen, in this section ... 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.480
 we shared a recipe for a very easy pie 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.560
 "Bow tie" 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.560
 if you make it with cheese you can prepare in less time 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.040
 if you try 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.880
 Enjoy your meal now!
