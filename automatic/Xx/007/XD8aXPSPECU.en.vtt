00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.189
 hello today we are removing the rack 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:10.740
 themed on mercedes in 220 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:14.250
 rear-wheel drive time has just started 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.480
 lower so where do we begin begin 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.480
 and salon 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.100
 unscrew the rack 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.410
 which is fastened with three bolts here 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.570
 such here at 13 unscrew 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.369
 key actuator for 10 all easy 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.899
 unscrew the elementary release 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:41.420
 everyone here has nothing more to do 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:42.629
 moving on not noticing the bottom 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.360
 elementary 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.430
 for convenience, I unscrewed the rack 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.890
 stabilizer completely removed so she 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.770
 It does not prevent us take down the lower arm 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.140
 stop and the lower arm itself 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.329
 unscrewed from the floating block saline to 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.149
 he went with us like this 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.309
 so that we can press it down and stand 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.189
 to output from there accordingly 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.210
 unscrew the rack itself all this 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.090
 curls easily enough 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.840
 disconnect the power cord to 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.689
 shock absorber stiffness adjustment 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.000
 itself over there is mounted under the bottom 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.600
 spar as it leaves the wire but it 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.750
 it was easy to climb 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.320
 quite easily and naturally say 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.170
 so since 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.780
 so much removed in the garage so I had to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.720
 remove the soup for what it did explain 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.070
 if you rent a rack in a pit or on 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.170
 lift you enough rack 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.200
 lower down that is how we lower 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.460
 lever retracted little stand slightly to the left and 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.920
 let it down vertically 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.990
 accordingly here and here you have it 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.850
 hands in the garage this will not work 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.780
 because so much all very long 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.250
 goes deep inside the body 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.920
 I'll have to take a little aside 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.229
 so as to shift here and pull out 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.820
 as if tilting it does not give 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.849
 to make 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.459
 brake hose it will get in the way for 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.290
 I spent 5 minutes of this 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.140
 take off 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.540
 caliper and we have this part this part 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.060
 completely free to drive 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.069
 a lever further I now what made us he 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.829
 already half of them back to freedom by which 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.019
 what does not hold here only the lower arm 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:31.519
 it props up accordingly i am now and 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:33.650
 here squeezing down I take it aside to the left and 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.939
 pulling everything in my hands going over 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.939
 good luck to all
