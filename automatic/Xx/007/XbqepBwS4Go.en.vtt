00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
tried and they're trying to just vital

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.700

signs<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.300> didn't<00:01:03.510> quite<00:01:03.719> work<00:01:04.080> out<00:01:04.409> I

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
signs and it didn't quite work out I

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.830 
signs and it didn't quite work out I
don't<00:01:05.369> think<00:01:05.430> how<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.670> wanted<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.450> teacher<00:01:06.689> was

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
don't think how I wanted one teacher was

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.200 
don't think how I wanted one teacher was
really<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.250> trying<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.280> get<00:01:08.460> us<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:08.970> with

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
really like trying to get us going with

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.310 
really like trying to get us going with
the<00:01:09.270> vital<00:01:09.479> signs<00:01:09.659> mana<00:01:09.869> teacher<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.200> kept

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the vital signs mana teacher just kept

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.530 
the vital signs mana teacher just kept
talking<00:01:10.500> about<00:01:10.680> different<00:01:10.890> stuff<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.510> it<00:01:12.510> was

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
talking about different stuff and it was

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.719 
talking about different stuff and it was
more<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.900> think<00:01:13.380> she<00:01:13.770> kind<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.220> got<00:01:14.310> confused

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
more I think she kind of got confused

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.429 
more I think she kind of got confused
and<00:01:14.790> was<00:01:14.939> doing<00:01:15.150> more<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> physical

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
and was doing more like a physical

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.399 
and was doing more like a physical
assessment<00:01:17.689> presentation<00:01:18.689> which<00:01:18.960> isn't<00:01:19.259> what

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
assessment presentation which isn't what

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.390 
assessment presentation which isn't what
we<00:01:19.530> haven't<00:01:19.710> learned<00:01:19.860> anything<00:01:20.040> about<00:01:20.130> that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
we haven't learned anything about that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.420 
we haven't learned anything about that
yet<00:01:20.549> um<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.619> didn't<00:01:22.830> really<00:01:22.860> help<00:01:23.070> us<00:01:23.189> much<00:01:23.369> I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
yet um so I didn't really help us much I

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.850 
yet um so I didn't really help us much I
think<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.640> kind<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.820> left<00:01:23.970> there<00:01:24.240> think<00:01:24.479> like

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
think we kind of left there think like

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.410 
think we kind of left there think like

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
shouldn't really say what was going I

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.830 
shouldn't really say what was going I
think<00:01:47.520> she<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:47.820> needed<00:01:48.149> something<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.570> eat

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
think she just needed something to eat

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.200 
think she just needed something to eat
because<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.110> was<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.399> past<00:01:50.970> lunch

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
because it was like it was past lunch

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.789 
because it was like it was past lunch
time<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.570> sure<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:51.990> much<00:01:52.140> better<00:01:52.380> place<00:01:52.649> to

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
time for sure not much better place to
