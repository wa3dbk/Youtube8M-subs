some breaks that made that score look a
little<00:04:19.019> more<00:04:19.340> powerful<00:04:20.340> than<00:04:20.489> what<00:04:20.700> it

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
little more powerful than what it

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.340 
little more powerful than what it
actually<00:04:20.880> was<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:21.690> as
