00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.939
 chapter 8 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.180
 when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.629
 and I saw the seven angels who were standing before God 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.299
 and they were given seven trumpets 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.250
 another angel came then and stood before the altar with a golden censer and 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.919
 was given a lot of incidence or to add it to the prayers of all 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.000
 saints on the golden altar that was before the throne 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.560
 and from the hand of the angel the smoke of the incense rose to the presence of God 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.150
 with the prayers of the saints 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.520
 and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.450
 to Earth 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.010
 and there were thunder and voices and lightning and an earthquake 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.430
 and the seven angels who had the seven trumpets set out to 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.680
 touch them 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.290
 the first angel sounded the trumpet and there was hail and fire mixed with 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.020
 blood that were thrown on the ground 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.410
 and a third of the trees burned and burned all the green grass 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.200
 the second angel sounded the trumpet and like a great mountain burning the fire 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.830
 it was precipitated in the sea and a third of the sea became blood 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.890
 and the third part of the living beings that were in the sea and the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.060
 third part of the ships was destroyed 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.090
 the third angel sounded the trumpet and a great star fell from the sky 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.490
 burning like a torch and fell on the third part of the rivers and on 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.430
 the sources of the waters 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.080
 and the name of the star is absinthe 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.160
 and a third of the waters became an agent and many 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.880
 men died because of those waters because they became bitter 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.940
 the fourth angel sounded the trumpet and the third part of the sun and the 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.640
 third part of the moon and a third of the stars 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.170
 so that the third of them was darkened and there was no light in the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.170
 third part of the day and likewise of the night 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.330
