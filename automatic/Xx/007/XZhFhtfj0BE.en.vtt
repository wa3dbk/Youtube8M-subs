00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.210 
well the benefit of a CMOS sensor is
that<00:01:26.520> unlike<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> CCD<00:01:27.659> data<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.680> read<00:01:28.890> very

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
that unlike a CCD data can be read very

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.490 
that unlike a CCD data can be read very
very<00:01:29.430> quickly<00:01:29.759> off<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.150> sensor<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.470> that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
very quickly off the sensor so that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.010 
very quickly off the sensor so that
opens<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.159> way<00:01:32.400> for<00:01:32.430> features<00:01:33.119> like<00:01:33.390> much

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
opens the way for features like much

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.770 
opens the way for features like much
higher<00:01:34.320> resolution<00:01:35.009> movie<00:01:35.549> recording<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
higher resolution movie recording so the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.390 
higher resolution movie recording so the
high-definition<00:01:37.259> movie<00:01:37.829> recording<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.280> we

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
high-definition movie recording that we

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.359 
high-definition movie recording that we
have<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.700> sony<00:01:38.970> handycam<00:01:39.180> for<00:01:39.780> example<00:01:40.369> it

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
have on sony handycam for example it

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.280 
have on sony handycam for example it
also<00:01:41.610> allows<00:01:41.790> cameras<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.509> capture<00:01:42.720> images

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
also allows cameras to capture images

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.889 
also allows cameras to capture images
more<00:01:43.590> quickly<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.670> example<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.240> still<00:01:45.659> camera

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
more quickly for example a still camera

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.289 
more quickly for example a still camera
like<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> WX<00:01:46.770> one<00:01:46.979> here<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.700> capture<00:01:47.970> up<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
like the WX one here can capture up to

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.539 
like the WX one here can capture up to
10<00:01:48.720> frames<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.320> second<00:01:49.710> at<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.310> full

there<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:54.869> other<00:01:55.290> benefits<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:55.950> get

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
there are other benefits that you get

the sensor through to the image

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.350 
the sensor through to the image
processor<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:36.100> they<00:03:36.580> have<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.880> circuitry

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
processor so they have the circuitry

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.020 
processor so they have the circuitry
that<00:03:37.630> lies<00:03:38.200> over<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:39.100> top<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.610> sensor

that lies over the top of the sensor

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.670 
that lies over the top of the sensor
that's<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.780> traditional<00:03:41.230> way<00:03:41.380> that<00:03:41.560> they've

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
that's a traditional way that they've

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.940 
that's a traditional way that they've
built<00:03:41.980> CMOS<00:03:42.760> sensors<00:03:43.270> now<00:03:43.840> this<00:03:44.020> allows<00:03:44.380> you

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
built CMOS sensors now this allows you

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.840 
built CMOS sensors now this allows you
to<00:03:45.160> transfer<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:46.090> data<00:03:46.239> from<00:03:47.580> one<00:03:48.580> of<00:03:48.700> these

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
image processing if that system works

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.690 
image processing if that system works
reasonably<00:03:56.020> well<00:03:56.160> except<00:03:57.160> when<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:57.430> get<00:03:57.580> to

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
reasonably well except when you get to

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.670 
reasonably well except when you get to
very<00:03:57.940> very<00:03:58.000> small<00:03:58.420> sensors<00:03:58.930> like<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.530> ones

very very small sensors like the ones

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
found in these new cameras so if you've

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.690 
found in these new cameras so if you've
got<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:01.900> really<00:04:02.080> small<00:04:02.440> sensor<00:04:02.890> all<00:04:03.280> of<00:04:03.580> this

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
got a really small sensor all of this

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.910 
got a really small sensor all of this
wiring<00:04:04.000> gets<00:04:04.690> in<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.989> way<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.709> light<00:04:05.890> that

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
wiring gets in the way of the light that

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.250 
wiring gets in the way of the light that
is<00:04:06.190> actually<00:04:06.489> trying<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:06.820> pass<00:04:07.090> through<00:04:07.450> so

is actually trying to pass through so

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.500

what<00:04:08.620> Sony<00:04:08.890> have<00:04:09.070> done<00:04:09.250> is<00:04:09.640> very<00:04:10.030> clever<00:04:10.239> with

what Sony have done is very clever with
