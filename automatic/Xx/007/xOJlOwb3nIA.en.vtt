in<00:01:09.470> contrast<00:01:09.980> that<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.730> Olympic<00:01:11.090> lifter<00:01:11.450> is

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.770 

but<00:01:15.440> he<00:01:15.590> takes<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:16.760> generate<00:01:16.940> forces<00:01:17.540> for

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780

so<00:01:23.960> basically<00:01:24.290> olympic<00:01:25.130> lifting<00:01:25.460> will<00:01:26.119> train

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
so basically olympic lifting will train

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
improved clearly essential attention is

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.390 
improved clearly essential attention is
movement<00:02:28.030> which<00:02:28.989> describes<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.800> extension

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
movement which describes the extension

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.460 
movement which describes the extension
of<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.610> tree<00:02:30.880> joints<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.540> lower<00:02:31.690> limb<00:02:31.959> so

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
of the tree joints of the lower limb so

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.590 
of the tree joints of the lower limb so
you've<00:02:32.590> got<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.860> hip<00:02:33.040> joints<00:02:33.489> Benito<00:02:33.940> behind

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
you've got the hip joints Benito behind

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.080 
you've got the hip joints Benito behind
so<00:02:35.530> basically<00:02:35.800> triple<00:02:36.220> extension<00:02:36.400> looks<00:02:36.880> like

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
so basically triple extension looks like

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.640 
so basically triple extension looks like
this

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
this

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.710 
this
so<00:02:39.069> basically<00:02:39.370> I'm<00:02:39.519> extending<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.450> three

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
so basically I'm extending the three

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.800 
so basically I'm extending the three
joints<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.739> my<00:02:41.950> Bower<00:02:42.160> name<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.599> tip

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
joints of my Bower name and so tip

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.030 
joints of my Bower name and so tip

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.000 
to to sprint or to to accelerate and so
you<00:03:04.430> improve<00:03:05.000> your<00:03:05.180> triple<00:03:05.540> expansion<00:03:06.080> and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
you improve your triple expansion and

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.860 
you improve your triple expansion and
you<00:03:07.220> will<00:03:07.340> be<00:03:07.459> quicker<00:03:07.730> off<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.090> back<00:03:08.300> again

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.140 
lifting
and<00:03:15.420> in<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.630> glitch<00:03:15.890> that<00:03:16.890> rapid<00:03:17.550> and

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
and in the glitch that rapid and

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.750 
and in the glitch that rapid and
aggressive<00:03:18.780> triple<00:03:19.170> extension<00:03:19.760> triple

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
extension that brings the barrel and so

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.700 
extension that brings the barrel and so
then<00:03:23.670> training<00:03:24.060> that<00:03:24.300> triple<00:03:24.570> expansion<00:03:25.020> so

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
then training that triple expansion so

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.750 
then training that triple expansion so
the<00:03:25.830> third<00:03:26.010> reason<00:03:26.160> why<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.460> should<00:03:26.580> take<00:03:26.640> up

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
the third reason why you should take up

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.250 
the third reason why you should take up
Olympic<00:03:27.210> lifting<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.630> for<00:03:27.780> balance<00:03:27.930> and

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
Olympic lifting is for balance and

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.680 
Olympic lifting is for balance and
stability<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.460> if<00:03:29.520> you<00:03:29.640> can<00:03:29.790> picture<00:03:30.000> but

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
stability and so if you can picture but

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.090 
stability and so if you can picture but

the fourth reason we should hate Olympic

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.280 
the fourth reason we should hate Olympic
incredibly<00:03:45.120> enjoyable<00:03:45.330> it's<00:03:45.990> something

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
incredibly enjoyable it's something

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.490 
incredibly enjoyable it's something

parodist in your bodybuilding
bodybuilding<00:03:51.390> workouts<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.560> it's<00:03:53.010> kind<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.220> a

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
bodybuilding workouts and it's kind of a

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.340 
bodybuilding workouts and it's kind of a
more<00:03:53.460> intense<00:03:53.820> rush<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.330> endorphins<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:55.230> fear

the<00:03:58.950> big<00:03:59.070> reasons<00:03:59.220> we<00:03:59.490> should<00:03:59.700> take<00:03:59.850> Olympic

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
the big reasons we should take Olympic

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.720 
the big reasons we should take Olympic
lifting<00:04:00.570> is<00:04:00.780> because<00:04:01.140> what<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.100> see<00:04:02.310> in<00:04:02.490> jeans

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
lifting is because what you see in jeans

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.910 
lifting is because what you see in jeans
and<00:04:03.060> particularly<00:04:03.540> among<00:04:03.830> kind<00:04:04.830> of

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
and particularly among kind of

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.980 
and particularly among kind of
field-based<00:04:05.310> athletes<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.270> they<00:04:06.450> cycle

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
field-based athletes is that they cycle

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.770 
field-based athletes is that they cycle
to<00:04:07.440> go<00:04:07.590> true<00:04:07.860> year<00:04:08.280> in<00:04:08.460> year<00:04:08.730> out<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:09.210> just

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
to go true year in year out of just

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.840 
to go true year in year out of just
strength<00:04:10.530> training<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:11.100> so<00:04:11.580> what<00:04:11.730> they're

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
strength training and so what they're

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.980 
strength training and so what they're
doing<00:04:11.880> is<00:04:12.120> they're<00:04:12.240> becoming<00:04:12.390> incredibly

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
doing is they're becoming incredibly

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.140 
doing is they're becoming incredibly
strong<00:04:13.530> but<00:04:13.830> they're<00:04:14.460> not<00:04:14.580> able<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.970> apply

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
strong but they're not able to apply

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.830 
strong but they're not able to apply
that<00:04:15.420> force<00:04:16.250> over<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.700> short<00:04:18.299> period<00:04:18.390> of<00:04:18.780> time

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
that force over a short period of time

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.390 
that force over a short period of time
so<00:04:19.080> they<00:04:19.320> don't<00:04:19.560> have<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.830> rate<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.190> force

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
so they don't have the rate of force

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.979 
so they don't have the rate of force
development<00:04:20.940> but<00:04:21.150> haven't<00:04:21.390> generated<00:04:21.570> that

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
development but haven't generated that

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.770 
development but haven't generated that
rate<00:04:22.170> force<00:04:22.470> development<00:04:22.980> our<00:04:23.880> true<00:04:24.630> with

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
rate force development our true with

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.560 
rate force development our true with
Indic<00:04:25.050> lifting<00:04:25.440> or<00:04:25.620> power<00:04:25.800> exercises<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:27.210> so

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
Indic lifting or power exercises and so
