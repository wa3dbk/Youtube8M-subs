00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.870 
really really light and I probably could
use<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.259> light<00:01:43.530> sand<00:01:43.860> one<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> under-eye

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
use this light sand one as a under-eye

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.819 
use this light sand one as a under-eye
concealer<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:45.990> an<00:01:46.110> extreme<00:01:46.409> highlight

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
concealer like with an extreme highlight

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.800 
concealer like with an extreme highlight
but<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.700> didn't<00:01:47.909> really<00:01:48.060> feel<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.509> you

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
for me so that's why I had to mix the

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.540 
for me so that's why I had to mix the
two<00:04:21.550> but<00:04:22.270> about<00:04:22.720> this<00:04:22.960> foundation<00:04:23.110> I<00:04:23.770> really

like the foundation now this is just a
first<00:04:26.380> impression<00:04:26.950> because<00:04:27.430> this<00:04:27.730> is<00:04:27.850> my

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
first impression because this is my

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.970 
first impression because this is my
first<00:04:28.210> time<00:04:28.390> wearing<00:04:28.600> it<00:04:28.930> as<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.260> said<00:04:29.500> I<00:04:29.740> tried

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
first time wearing it as I said I tried

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.770 
first time wearing it as I said I tried
to<00:04:30.070> purchase<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.610> year<00:04:31.060> or<00:04:31.150> two<00:04:31.270> ago<00:04:31.420> and

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
to purchase it a year or two ago and

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.230 
to purchase it a year or two ago and
they<00:04:32.170> didn't<00:04:32.380> have<00:04:32.530> a<00:04:32.590> shade<00:04:32.950> that<00:04:32.980> fit<00:04:33.580> me<00:04:33.760> it

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
they didn't have a shade that fit me it

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.460 
they didn't have a shade that fit me it
wasn't<00:04:34.540> even<00:04:34.630> a<00:04:34.780> couple<00:04:34.960> of<00:04:35.080> shades<00:04:35.290> that<00:04:35.380> I

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
wasn't even a couple of shades that I

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.500 
wasn't even a couple of shades that I
could<00:04:35.680> mix<00:04:35.890> but<00:04:36.430> since<00:04:36.640> they<00:04:36.820> broaden<00:04:37.360> their

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
could mix but since they broaden their

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.500 
could mix but since they broaden their
range<00:04:37.840> now<00:04:38.530> I'm<00:04:38.800> able<00:04:38.980> to<00:04:39.130> try<00:04:39.430> it<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:39.790> I<00:04:40.270> must

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
range now I'm able to try it and I must

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.410 
range now I'm able to try it and I must
say<00:04:40.750> I've<00:04:41.440> had<00:04:41.710> this<00:04:41.920> on<00:04:42.130> for<00:04:42.670> probably<00:04:42.940> at

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
say I've had this on for probably at

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.030 
say I've had this on for probably at
least<00:04:43.450> 5<00:04:43.840> hours<00:04:43.870> as<00:04:44.260> well<00:04:44.440> when<00:04:44.680> I<00:04:44.710> did<00:04:44.830> my

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
least 5 hours as well when I did my

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.500 
least 5 hours as well when I did my
makeup<00:04:45.160> and<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:46.480> looks<00:04:46.930> exactly<00:04:48.060> exactly<00:04:49.060> and

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
makeup and it looks exactly exactly and

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.270 
makeup and it looks exactly exactly and
it<00:04:49.690> was<00:04:49.840> hot<00:04:50.020> today<00:04:50.200> it<00:04:50.560> was<00:04:50.680> like<00:04:50.830> 85<00:04:51.130> degrees

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
it was hot today it was like 85 degrees

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.210 
it was hot today it was like 85 degrees
so<00:04:52.060> I<00:04:52.090> was<00:04:52.300> kind<00:04:52.510> of<00:04:52.570> hot<00:04:52.780> okay<00:04:53.260> and<00:04:53.530> it<00:04:53.950> is

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
so I was kind of hot okay and it is

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.310 
so I was kind of hot okay and it is
still<00:04:54.490> and<00:04:54.760> I<00:04:55.150> was<00:04:55.570> sweating<00:04:55.900> a<00:04:55.960> little<00:04:56.080> bit

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
still and I was sweating a little bit

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.130 
still and I was sweating a little bit
and<00:04:56.500> I<00:04:56.590> dabbed<00:04:56.920> it<00:04:57.220> and<00:04:57.400> all<00:04:57.670> that<00:04:57.940> and

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
and I dabbed it and all that and

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.470 
and I dabbed it and all that and
everything<00:04:59.140> looks<00:04:59.530> exactly<00:04:59.820> the<00:05:00.820> same

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
everything looks exactly the same

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.140 
everything looks exactly the same
it<00:05:01.810> seems<00:05:02.110> matte<00:05:02.530> it<00:05:02.950> is<00:05:03.340> definitely<00:05:03.940> full

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
it seems matte it is definitely full

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.420 
it seems matte it is definitely full
coverage<00:05:04.690> I<00:05:04.960> think<00:05:05.050> I<00:05:05.380> put<00:05:05.590> on<00:05:05.680> one<00:05:05.920> layer<00:05:05.950> I

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
coverage I think I put on one layer I

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.280 
coverage I think I put on one layer I
can't<00:05:06.670> remember<00:05:06.940> but<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:07.450> hasn't<00:05:07.810> moved<00:05:07.990> it

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
can't remember but it hasn't moved it

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.830 
can't remember but it hasn't moved it
says<00:05:08.800> it<00:05:08.980> lasts<00:05:09.160> for<00:05:09.370> 12<00:05:09.610> hours<00:05:09.820> and<00:05:10.270> I<00:05:10.600> would

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
says it lasts for 12 hours and I would

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.630 
says it lasts for 12 hours and I would
almost<00:05:11.050> put<00:05:11.470> money<00:05:11.710> on<00:05:11.830> it<00:05:12.100> that<00:05:12.130> it<00:05:12.520> would

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
almost put money on it that it would

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.040 
almost put money on it that it would
last<00:05:12.760> longer<00:05:13.060> than<00:05:13.270> that<00:05:13.420> I'm<00:05:13.660> just<00:05:13.690> saying

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
last longer than that I'm just saying
