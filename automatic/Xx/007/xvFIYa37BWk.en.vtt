liberty is green Dean wasn't made green
it<00:00:26.699> just<00:00:27.150> rust<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.599> ok<00:00:28.670> and<00:00:29.670> right<00:00:29.939> here<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.269> 10

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:40.209 

so<00:00:33.690> i<00:00:36.290> can<00:00:37.290> craft<00:00:37.620> these<00:00:37.950> into<00:00:38.760> these<00:00:39.000> ingots

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
so i can craft these into these ingots

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.970 
so i can craft these into these ingots
something<00:00:41.390> like<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.600> yeah<00:00:45.350> i<00:00:46.350> really

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
something like that yeah i really

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.220 
something like that yeah i really
understand<00:00:47.430> why<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.700> would<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.079> but<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
understand why you would do that but the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.889 
understand why you would do that but the
simple<00:00:49.739> thing<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:50.370> let's<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.510> put<00:00:51.870> that

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
simple thing to do let's just put that

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.740 
simple thing to do let's just put that
in<00:00:52.170> furnace<00:00:52.910> melt<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.030> down<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.210> look<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:54.600> you

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
in furnace melt it down and look at you

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.819 
in furnace melt it down and look at you
the<00:00:58.430> get<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.730> yeah<00:00:59.940> copper<00:01:00.680> which<00:01:01.680> will

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
the get you that yeah copper which will

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.310 
the get you that yeah copper which will
then<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.250> make<00:01:02.460> these<00:01:02.640> copper<00:01:03.320> tools

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
then what you make these copper tools

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.890 
then what you make these copper tools
like<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.769> sword<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.970> stuff<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.510> somber

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
like the sword and this stuff and somber

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.520 
like the sword and this stuff and somber
it's<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> little<00:01:07.770> bit<00:01:07.890> weaker<00:01:08.310> than<00:01:08.520> um<00:01:09.530> iron

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
it's a little bit weaker than um iron

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.620 
it's a little bit weaker than um iron
but<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.850> find<00:01:12.060> some<00:01:12.210> tin<00:01:12.420> then

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
but if you have to find some tin then

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.940 
but if you have to find some tin then
you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.869> make<00:01:12.990> some<00:01:13.170> bronze<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.830> can

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
you can make some bronze and you can

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.800 
you can make some bronze and you can
make<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.189> these<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.820> now<00:01:17.820> there's<00:01:18.060> there<00:01:18.570> some

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
make all these so now there's there some

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.789 
make all these so now there's there some
so<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> show<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.729> works<00:01:21.650> I'm<00:01:22.650> just

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
so this is a show that it works I'm just

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.109 
so this is a show that it works I'm just
going<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> put<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:25.549> out<00:01:26.549> should<00:01:26.880> pop

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
going to put that in and out should pop

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:35.480 
going to put that in and out should pop
yeah<00:01:30.259> 10<00:01:31.259> you're<00:01:32.220> there<00:01:33.680> we<00:01:34.680> go<00:01:34.829> there<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.340> we

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
yeah 10 you're there we go there and we

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.300 
yeah 10 you're there we go there and we
got<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.729> bronze<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.049> Nick<00:01:37.650> should<00:01:38.130> just

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
got the bronze so then Nick should just

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.499 
got the bronze so then Nick should just
be<00:01:38.490> able<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.640> craft<00:01:38.880> anything<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.360> also

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
be able to craft anything you can also

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.370 
be able to craft anything you can also
do<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.990> enchantments<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.890> them<00:01:44.329> so<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.630> do<00:01:46.079> that

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
do it enchantments on them so I do that

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.109 
do it enchantments on them so I do that
I<00:01:46.610> sit<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:48.320> find<00:01:49.320> one<00:01:49.640> it<00:01:50.640> doesn't<00:01:51.000> actually

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
I sit in find one it doesn't actually

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.090 
I sit in find one it doesn't actually
seem<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.540> working<00:01:54.350> not<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:55.829> not

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
seem to be working not that it's not

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.480 
seem to be working not that it's not
working<00:01:57.170> look<00:01:58.170> at<00:01:58.259> that

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.020 

hmm<00:02:02.040> well<00:02:03.040> anyway<00:02:03.369> hopefully<00:02:03.579> that<00:02:03.729> will<00:02:03.939> get

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
hmm well anyway hopefully that will get

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.569 
hmm well anyway hopefully that will get
fixed<00:02:04.329> or<00:02:05.020> maybe<00:02:05.890> it's<00:02:06.040> interfering<00:02:06.310> with<00:02:06.490> a

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
fixed or maybe it's interfering with a

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.900 
fixed or maybe it's interfering with a
different<00:02:06.880> mod<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:08.429> happen<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.459> have<00:02:09.580> its<00:02:09.759> own

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
different mod I happen to have its own

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:24.110 
different mod I happen to have its own
um<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:18.989> think<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.260> said<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.650> if<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.130> put<00:02:21.370> them<00:02:21.580> in

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.830 

here<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.390> should<00:02:25.840> make<00:02:26.019> a<00:02:26.080> block<00:02:28.590> yeah<00:02:30.840> that

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
here it should make a block yeah that

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.309 
here it should make a block yeah that
made<00:02:32.019> one<00:02:32.230> block<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:34.060> we<00:02:34.209> like<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:35.140> that's

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
made one block that we like so that's

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.440 
made one block that we like so that's
how<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.500> make<00:02:35.650> like<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.010> harder<00:02:36.910> bloxom<00:02:37.390> in

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
how you make like the harder bloxom in

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.330 
how you make like the harder bloxom in
yo<00:02:37.660> F<00:02:38.280> then<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.459> other<00:02:39.610> one<00:02:40.739> like<00:02:41.739> so<00:02:42.190> like

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
yo F then the other one like so like

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.009 
yo F then the other one like so like
that<00:02:42.610> one<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.209> one<00:02:43.390> I'm<00:02:43.690> going<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.900> go

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
that one and that one I'm going to go

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.140 
that one and that one I'm going to go
for<00:02:44.380> how<00:02:44.530> you<00:02:44.590> make<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.760> other<00:02:45.910> ones

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
for how you make it and the other ones

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.190 
for how you make it and the other ones
that<00:02:46.510> one<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:47.080> one<00:02:48.209> eat<00:02:49.209> i'm<00:02:49.420> going<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.780> go<00:02:49.900> to

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
that one that one eat i'm going to go to

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.380 
that one that one eat i'm going to go to
just<00:02:50.410> make<00:02:50.680> them<00:02:50.920> as<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.190> storage<00:02:51.670> device<00:02:51.760> for

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
just make them as a storage device for

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.960 
just make them as a storage device for
your<00:02:52.510> other<00:02:52.660> ones<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.519> unless<00:02:54.519> you're<00:02:54.670> crazy

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
your other ones but unless you're crazy

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.670 
your other ones but unless you're crazy
i<00:02:55.090> don't<00:02:55.299> think<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.540> would<00:02:55.660> do<00:02:55.959> any<00:02:56.470> of<00:02:56.620> that

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
i don't think you would do any of that

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.440
