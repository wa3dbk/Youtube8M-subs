00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.799
 a new call of duty is ours 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.280
 house with black ops three here we see 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.330
 the first teaser trailer to us 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.240
 Of course we read the first one 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.570
 already comment china I hear that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.810
 because never on and every year of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.779
 same crap here was call of duty time 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.180
 player's darling like here at times 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.529
 from modern warfare the first and 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.260
 Of course, it is still far today 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.610
 far from stopping 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.770
 Nevertheless, this is a good opportunity 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.059
 to be as objective as possible 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.520
 looking back 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.780
 and how do we do that, of course 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.640
 look at the numbers 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.770
 So little warning for all people with 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.539
 it will be the one or the excel allergy 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.289
 give others to watch 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.180
 do not hit me on the other one 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.890
 looking for answers to the questions when 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.760
 began the opinion against call of duty 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.770
 to tilt one 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.180
 and what about with about 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.989
 reach the sales figures 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.989
 we look 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.189
 looking at the average 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.290
 test be of call of duty on the 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.700
 aggregators since metacritic seems 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.659
 For a long time everything is in 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.060
 to be orderly 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.680
 This graphic shows the gray bar 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.750
 the average score for the pc 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.360
 version and the orange for each 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.520
 best consoles edition to modern 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.500
 Warfare 3 drives the series good to very 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.220
 good rating of at least 80 percent 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.649
 on 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.320
 only then in the eighth part of the series 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:37.600
 the cut falls under 80 for the first time 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:39.310
 percent and on the pc quite different 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.869
 at the user evaluations the players 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.789
 yourself fall much faster from 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.319
 believe in this graphic of the time 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.450
 yellow bars the average rating 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.429
 the console users and the blue ones 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.060
 Average rating of the PC Group 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:54.459
 already call of duty 3 at that time exclusively for 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.289
 The consoles appeared for the first time 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.860
 on average under the mark of 80 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.649
 points 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.450
 call of duty 4 modern warfare is then 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.700
 the last part of the series on 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.700
 console or pc of this brand ever 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.530
 again passes to the first violent 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.429
 burglary occurs when it appears 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.290
 modern warfare 2 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.420
 we are showing this here in the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.299
 background the average rating of 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.200
 user drops to 62 for console and 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:22.000
 Interestingly, 40 out of 10 for pc is 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.680
 By the way, it's just that with players often 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.170
 laughed analyst michael pachter the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.120
 At that time I already personally believe 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.160
 honestly that the call of duty brand too 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.900
 often appears around at the players 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.900
 to build up much anticipation 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.730
 sounds bad enough but it still works 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.349
 continue to the cellar 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.510
 exactly as already described 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.819
 drops at call of duty modern warfare 3 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.770
 the pc criticism for the first time under the 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.500
 magic brand of 80 percent only 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.209
 78 percent on average 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.430
 The consoles magazine give the game 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.440
 but still an average of 88 percent 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.000
 with the users, however, the 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.510
 patience to be torn 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.880
 only 33 points awarded the consoles 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.280
 user in the cut for modern warfare 3 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.850
 the worst rating of all 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.860
 call of dutys come on the pc 24 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.630
 points together later only from 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.430
 call of duty goes under drops 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.560
 that just at two points from the 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.720
 pc players come it is therefore 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.760
 probably no coincidence that the games 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.950
 review international reviews 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.840
 This time starts down to 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.670
 correct 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.980
 the displeasure of the consumer to this is inasmuch 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.690
 Interesting since activision for years 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.510
 also your platform the main focus 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.190
 pc pc players have been around for a while 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.630
 often with technology problems and 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.120
 then the fight on the consoles 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.160
 far less occur 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.630
 Dozens of players, whether pc or 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.090
 However, console award for modern 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.170
 warfare 3 0 points and complain that that 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.820
 play the last modern warfare 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.590
 simply too similar 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.359
 even the multiplayer is playing 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.160
 extremely similar, however, with 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.880
 worse movements and worse 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.260
 that be that mon amour 43 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.630
 Maybe that's how bad it is 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.950
 no coincidence because not too long after 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.959
 the publication of modern warfare 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.390
 2 there was a big crash between 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.700
 activision and the modern warfare studio 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.010
 infinity became the two founders of 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.220
 studios vince zampella and jason west 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.959
 were fired and then moved in for 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.910
 new studio respawn entertainment 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.820
 Dozens of her former colleague of 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.890
 Infinity was formed from so much in the 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.900
 Revier her former studio that 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.220
 activision a call of duty spin-off 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.520
 at the newly founded studio 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.349
 sledgehammer had to cancel games 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.690
 and the team of the dwindling crew of 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.770
 infinity became a page set of 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.750
 look at the rating is the 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.520
 guess that infinity was 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.430
 never really recovered from this break 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.560
 the studio treyarch here we see black 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.810
 Three of them then enters the 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.699
 Ironically, one has to foreground 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.919
 say a straight with call of duty 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.360
 3 actually started to infinity ward 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.159
 to give the time to be modern 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.139
 warfare a new engine and a new one 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:59.229
 Timeline to start in the story 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.159
 and thus in the first place the mega success 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.949
 the series 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:04.750
 but the fat years are over the 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.800
 last two infinity games 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.509
 modern warfare 3 and ghost mark the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.889
 absolute low points in the series what 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.979
 the user feedback is concerned 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.560
 after all comforting for activision that 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.800
 next game black ops 3 is this one 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.800
 contract
