00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
tall and so these men's bikes do not

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.810 
tall and so these men's bikes do not
work<00:00:37.460> for<00:00:37.489> me

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
work for me

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.400 
work for me
I<00:00:38.000> really<00:00:38.449> have<00:00:38.629> to<00:00:38.750> have<00:00:38.930> a<00:00:38.960> women's<00:00:39.290> specific

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
I really have to have a women's specific

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.310 
I really have to have a women's specific
bike<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.550> top<00:00:40.879> tube<00:00:41.210> of<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.540> bike<00:00:41.720> so<00:00:42.050> from

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
bike the top tube of the bike so from

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.619 
bike the top tube of the bike so from
the<00:00:42.530> saddle<00:00:42.829> across<00:00:43.430> is<00:00:43.940> shorter<00:00:44.479> on<00:00:44.600> a

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
the saddle across is shorter on a

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.930 
the saddle across is shorter on a
women's<00:00:44.989> bike<00:00:45.229> it's<00:00:45.589> a<00:00:45.680> lot<00:00:45.860> easier<00:00:46.159> once

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
women's bike it's a lot easier once

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.820 
women's bike it's a lot easier once
you're<00:00:47.119> on<00:00:47.150> the<00:00:47.330> saddle<00:00:47.600> which<00:00:48.140> also<00:00:48.350> happens

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
you're on the saddle which also happens

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.680 
you're on the saddle which also happens
to<00:00:48.860> be<00:00:49.010> a<00:00:49.040> women's<00:00:49.309> specific<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:50.330> reach<00:00:50.479> the

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
to be a women's specific to reach the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.380 
to be a women's specific to reach the
handlebars<00:00:51.519> once<00:00:52.519> you're<00:00:52.699> on<00:00:52.729> the<00:00:52.940> handlebars

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
handlebars once you're on the handlebars

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.380 
handlebars once you're on the handlebars
I<00:00:53.570> always<00:00:53.839> had<00:00:54.019> trouble<00:00:55.150> breaking<00:00:56.150> and

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
I always had trouble breaking and

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.810 
I always had trouble breaking and
actually<00:00:56.720> shifting<00:00:57.199> gears<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:58.280> reach<00:00:58.519> is

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
actually shifting gears and the reach is

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.969 
actually shifting gears and the reach is
a<00:00:58.850> lot<00:00:59.089> a<00:00:59.390> lot<00:00:59.570> easier<00:01:00.080> to<00:01:00.290> maintain<00:01:00.439> on<00:01:00.949> a

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
a lot a lot easier to maintain on a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:02.500 
a lot a lot easier to maintain on a
women's<00:01:01.280> specific<00:01:01.430> bike<00:01:01.850> they<00:01:02.119> actually

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
women's specific bike they actually

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.450 
women's specific bike they actually
shorten<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.110> grip<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:03.949> you're<00:01:04.070> able<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.339> hold

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
shorten the grip so you're able to hold

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.740 
shorten the grip so you're able to hold
it<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:04.699> you<00:01:04.760> can<00:01:04.879> actually<00:01:05.000> tell<00:01:05.360> that<00:01:05.390> I<00:01:05.600> can

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
it and you can actually tell that I can

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.330 
it and you can actually tell that I can
get<00:01:05.869> my<00:01:06.020> small<00:01:06.350> hands<00:01:06.590> around<00:01:06.770> there<00:01:07.070> pretty

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
get my small hands around there pretty

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.450 
get my small hands around there pretty
comfortable<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.840> bar<00:01:09.140> itself<00:01:09.710> whole<00:01:10.130> handle

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
comfortable the bar itself whole handle

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.460 
comfortable the bar itself whole handle
bar<00:01:10.610> itself<00:01:10.880> is<00:01:11.090> actually<00:01:11.479> shorter<00:01:11.960> which<00:01:12.259> on

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
bar itself is actually shorter which on

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.410 
bar itself is actually shorter which on
my<00:01:12.590> other<00:01:12.890> bike<00:01:13.130> I<00:01:13.340> used<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.670> ride<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:13.880> bit<00:01:14.180> wider

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
my other bike I used to ride a bit wider

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.720 
my other bike I used to ride a bit wider
out<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.080> now<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:15.680> can<00:01:16.010> get<00:01:16.160> a<00:01:16.190> much<00:01:16.430> closer

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
out and now you can get a much closer

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.360 
out and now you can get a much closer
grip<00:01:17.120> on<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.570> handlebars<00:01:18.100> so<00:01:19.100> that's<00:01:19.280> a

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
grip on the handlebars so that's a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.160 
grip on the handlebars so that's a
couple<00:01:19.550> reasons<00:01:19.820> right<00:01:20.120> there<00:01:20.390> why<00:01:20.630> I<00:01:20.660> love<00:01:21.020> it

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
couple reasons right there why I love it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.230 
couple reasons right there why I love it
it<00:01:21.980> comes<00:01:22.220> in<00:01:22.400> a<00:01:22.460> pretty<00:01:22.610> purple<00:01:22.880> color

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
it comes in a pretty purple color

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.510 
it comes in a pretty purple color
another<00:01:23.990> reason<00:01:24.440> why<00:01:24.650> I<00:01:24.980> like<00:01:25.190> women's

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
another reason why I like women's

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.910 
another reason why I like women's
specific<00:01:25.640> bikes<00:01:26.120> they<00:01:26.420> actually<00:01:26.840> cater<00:01:27.470> to

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
specific bikes they actually cater to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.310 
specific bikes they actually cater to
the<00:01:28.850> woman's<00:01:29.210> style<00:01:29.510> and<00:01:29.870> so<00:01:30.050> they're<00:01:30.200> not

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
the woman's style and so they're not

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.920 
the woman's style and so they're not
kind<00:01:30.650> of<00:01:30.800> black<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:31.520> red<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.000> they're<00:01:32.900> a

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
kind of black and red and they're a

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.070 
kind of black and red and they're a
little<00:01:33.110> bit<00:01:33.230> a<00:01:33.409> little<00:01:33.560> bit<00:01:33.680> girlier<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:35.750> this

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
little bit a little bit girlier so this

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.350 
little bit a little bit girlier so this
bike<00:01:36.380> starts<00:01:37.340> at<00:01:37.430> eight<00:01:37.580> hundred<00:01:37.610> bucks<00:01:38.030> we

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
bike starts at eight hundred bucks we

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.990 
bike starts at eight hundred bucks we
have<00:01:38.540> all<00:01:38.750> sizes<00:01:39.080> in<00:01:39.320> stock<00:01:39.800> remember<00:01:40.760> you've

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
have all sizes in stock remember you've

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.030
