00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
there are three ways of doing this the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.290 
there are three ways of doing this the
first<00:00:15.960> way<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:17.130> wrap<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.670> Diablo<00:00:18.029> once

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
first way is to wrap the Diablo once

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.359 
first way is to wrap the Diablo once
with<00:00:18.570> your<00:00:18.720> string<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.170> pull<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.859> up<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.130> down

with your string and pull it up and down

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.400 
with your string and pull it up and down
this<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.240> most<00:00:21.300> beginner<00:00:21.810> way<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.140> doing

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
this is the most beginner way of doing

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.630 
this is the most beginner way of doing
it

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.310 

the<00:00:26.640> second<00:00:27.029> way<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.240> getting<00:00:27.510> speed<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:28.019> even

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the second way of getting speed is even

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.160 
the second way of getting speed is even
used<00:00:28.500> by<00:00:28.650> advanced<00:00:29.189> Diablo<00:00:29.730> Jews<00:00:29.939> all<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:31.080> is

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
used by advanced Diablo Jews all I do is

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.020 
used by advanced Diablo Jews all I do is
wrap<00:00:31.380> around<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.920> throw<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.460> underneath<00:00:32.790> your

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
arm back and forth even I use this

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.209 
arm back and forth even I use this
method<00:00:36.180> because<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.899> gets<00:00:37.050> speed<00:00:37.320> very<00:00:37.649> fast
