00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
21 as you know is a combination of the

the<00:00:38.190> features<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> typical<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.270> rack<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the features on the typical a rack and

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.780 
the features on the typical a rack and
this<00:00:40.170> year<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.559> added<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.890> third<00:00:41.100> calibre<00:00:41.579> along

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
this year we added a third calibre along

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.270 
this year we added a third calibre along
with<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> 556<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.930> 300<00:00:43.260> blackout<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:44.070> headed

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
with the 556 in 300 blackout we headed

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.389 
with the 556 in 300 blackout we headed
to<00:00:44.370> 762<00:00:44.969> by<00:00:45.090> 39<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.350> requires<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.829> new<00:00:47.039> barrel

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
to 762 by 39 so it requires a new barrel

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.799 
to 762 by 39 so it requires a new barrel
and<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.850> different<00:00:48.180> bullet<00:00:48.300> who<00:00:48.629> actually

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
and a different bullet who actually

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.240 
and a different bullet who actually
beats<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.320> bolt<00:00:49.500> up<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:49.920> bigger<00:00:50.100> in

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
beats the bolt up it's bigger in

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.220 
beats the bolt up it's bigger in
diameter<00:00:50.430> has<00:00:50.850> more<00:00:51.059> strength<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.140> we

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
diameter has more strength to it so we

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.810 
diameter has more strength to it so we
actually<00:00:52.530> made<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> particular<00:00:53.370> bolt<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
actually made a particular bolt for the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.270 
actually made a particular bolt for the
716<00:00:54.539> round<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.199> an<00:00:55.559> increased<00:00:55.920> time<00:00:56.100> for

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
716 round and an increased time for

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 
716 round and an increased time for
firing<00:00:56.460> pin<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:57.000> more<00:00:57.360> reliable<00:00:57.600> detonation

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
firing pin for more reliable detonation

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.080 
firing pin for more reliable detonation
that<00:00:58.710> goes<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.920> any<00:00:59.100> standard<00:00:59.489> ar-15<00:00:59.760> lower

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
that goes on any standard ar-15 lower

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.860 
that goes on any standard ar-15 lower
yes<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:01.530> gone<00:01:01.800> RZ<00:01:02.309> right<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:02.760> gonna<00:01:03.210> lower<00:01:03.480> and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
yes it gone RZ right for gonna lower and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.870 
yes it gone RZ right for gonna lower and
then<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.170> year<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.549> our<00:01:05.670> new

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880

so<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.350> either<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.040> primary<00:01:32.280> or

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
so you can either is this the primary or

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.969 
so you can either is this the primary or
that<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.720> primary<00:01:33.930> go<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
that is your primary go but you have to

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.770 
that is your primary go but you have to
charging<00:01:35.490> handles<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.150> gets<00:01:36.299> damaged

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
charging handles so if one gets damaged

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.719 
charging handles so if one gets damaged
your<00:01:36.930> system<00:01:37.320> still<00:01:37.590> works<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.310> other<00:01:38.460> thing

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
your system still works the other thing

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.219 
your system still works the other thing
we<00:01:38.850> did<00:01:39.060> there<00:01:39.570> were<00:01:39.630> some<00:01:39.840> people<00:01:39.960> made

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
we did there were some people made

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.319 
we did there were some people made
comments<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.040> could<00:01:41.220> actually<00:01:41.549> remove

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
comments that you could actually remove

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
take it away from here and look we don't

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.090 
take it away from here and look we don't
to<00:02:52.810> tilt<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.140> or<00:02:53.260> anything<00:02:53.440> yeah<00:02:53.709> just<00:02:53.890> look

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
to tilt it or anything yeah just look

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.400 
to tilt it or anything yeah just look
right<00:02:54.250> in<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:55.060> it's<00:02:55.390> interesting<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:56.110> also

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
right in so it's interesting it also

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.570 
right in so it's interesting it also
works<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:56.770> both<00:02:56.890> right<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.130> left<00:02:57.310> hand

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
works in both right and left hand

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.699 
works in both right and left hand
configurations<00:02:58.270> by<00:02:58.690> simply<00:02:59.110> rotating<00:02:59.530> the

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
configurations by simply rotating the

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.390 
configurations by simply rotating the
bolt<00:02:59.890> 180<00:03:00.400> degrees<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.750> 21<00:03:02.290> got<00:03:02.500> two<00:03:02.590> 7.62

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
bolt 180 degrees so the 21 got two 7.62

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.150 
bolt 180 degrees so the 21 got two 7.62
x<00:03:03.640> 39<00:03:03.820> and<00:03:04.300> potentially<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.870> door<00:03:05.019> windows
