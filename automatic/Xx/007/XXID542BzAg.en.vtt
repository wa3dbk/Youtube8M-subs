00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
one thing that kind of lacks that's why

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.130 
one thing that kind of lacks that's why
there's<00:02:29.700> such<00:02:29.879> underrated<00:02:30.540> vehicles<00:02:30.930> is

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
there's such underrated vehicles is

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.380 
there's such underrated vehicles is
because<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.620> their<00:02:31.709> speed<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.819> know<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.150> not

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
because of their speed you know it's not

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.270 
because of their speed you know it's not
as<00:02:33.569> fast<00:02:34.290> as<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:35.580> know<00:02:35.670> buggy<00:02:36.030> or<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.450> dpv

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
as fast as a you know buggy or a dpv

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.490 
as fast as a you know buggy or a dpv
Jeep<00:02:38.280> or<00:02:38.580> whatever<00:02:38.849> but<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.989> doesn't<00:02:40.319> have<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
Jeep or whatever but it doesn't have the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.119 
Jeep or whatever but it doesn't have the
firepower<00:02:41.099> as<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.489> tank<00:02:42.000> would<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:42.959> it's<00:02:43.830> kind

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
firepower as a tank would so it's kind

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.479 
firepower as a tank would so it's kind
of<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.750> happy-go-lucky<00:02:45.920> medium<00:02:46.920> kind<00:02:47.340> of
