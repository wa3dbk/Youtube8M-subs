I<00:02:31.890> mentioned<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.340> ones<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:32.849> are<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.120> bit<00:02:33.330> dry

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
I mentioned the ones that are a bit dry

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.710 
I mentioned the ones that are a bit dry
when<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.040> get<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.640> them<00:02:35.760> but<00:02:36.299> this<00:02:36.420> one's<00:02:36.629> really

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720

creamy<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.349> nice<00:02:38.510> it's<00:02:39.510> quite<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> pale<00:02:40.200> nude

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
creamy and nice it's quite a pale nude

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.640 
creamy and nice it's quite a pale nude
so<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.890> Paris<00:02:44.599> this<00:02:45.599> next<00:02:45.989> one<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.349> called

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
so this is Paris this next one is called

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.580 
so this is Paris this next one is called
Tokyo<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.580> it's<00:02:47.760> like<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.269> bright<00:02:48.900> kind<00:02:49.440> of

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
Tokyo and it's like a bright kind of

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.050 
Tokyo and it's like a bright kind of
bubblegum<00:02:50.099> pink<00:02:52.190> that's<00:02:53.190> what<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.489> looks<00:02:53.700> like

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.390 

this<00:02:57.060> one<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.079> is<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.410> only<00:02:58.590> ones<00:02:59.010> that

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
this one and this is the only ones that

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.479 
this one and this is the only ones that
I<00:02:59.430> can<00:02:59.730> easily<00:03:00.269> see<00:03:01.200> like<00:03:01.620> gooey<00:03:02.190> doll-like

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
I can easily see like gooey doll-like

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.240 
I can easily see like gooey doll-like
shimmer<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.299> there<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.590> don't<00:03:04.709> know<00:03:04.920> why

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
shimmer in there so I don't know why

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.360 
shimmer in there so I don't know why
that<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.670> if<00:03:05.879> it's<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.150> matte<00:03:06.360> lipstick<00:03:06.780> but

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
that is if it's a matte lipstick but

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:15.160 
that is if it's a matte lipstick but
that's<00:03:08.370> what<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.610> looks<00:03:08.760> like<00:03:08.910> on<00:03:09.090> there

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.510 

and<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.230> can<00:03:16.380> definitely<00:03:16.530> see<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.040> shimmer

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
and you can definitely see the shimmer

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.330 
and you can definitely see the shimmer
on<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.940> lip<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:18.510> I'm<00:03:19.440> not<00:03:19.620> really<00:03:19.830> sure<00:03:20.130> what

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
on the lip so I'm not really sure what

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.280 
on the lip so I'm not really sure what
that's<00:03:20.670> about<00:03:21.000> like<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.510> still<00:03:21.810> does<00:03:22.020> say

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
that's about like it still does say

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.610 
that's about like it still does say
matte<00:03:22.770> on<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.040> packaging<00:03:23.640> but<00:03:24.440> it's<00:03:25.440> still

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
matte on the packaging but it's still

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.620 
matte on the packaging but it's still
pretty<00:03:25.830> it's<00:03:26.100> not<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.310> really<00:03:26.670> like<00:03:27.060> frosty<00:03:27.540> or

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
pretty it's not I really like frosty or

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.470 
pretty it's not I really like frosty or
anything<00:03:27.780> like<00:03:28.020> that

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
anything like that

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.120 
anything like that
that's<00:03:30.480> what<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.810> one<00:03:30.930> looks<00:03:31.110> like<00:03:31.200> the

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
that's what that one looks like the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.640 
that's what that one looks like the
third<00:03:32.490> lightest<00:03:32.940> one<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.420> an<00:03:33.750> orange<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.500> it's

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
third lightest one is an orange and it's

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.280 
third lightest one is an orange and it's
called<00:03:34.980> Maui<00:03:35.460> and<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:35.940> polish<00:03:36.210> seen<00:03:36.480> this<00:03:36.690> in

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
called Maui and you polish seen this in

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.720 
called Maui and you polish seen this in
my<00:03:37.470> videos<00:03:37.860> before<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.490> you've<00:03:38.610> probably

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
my videos before and you've probably

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.390 
my videos before and you've probably
also<00:03:39.060> seen<00:03:39.240> that<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:40.020> accidentally<00:03:40.890> bought<00:03:41.130> two

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
also seen that I accidentally bought two

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.450 
also seen that I accidentally bought two
of<00:03:41.460> these<00:03:41.610> so<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.060> think<00:03:42.510> this<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:42.840> my<00:03:43.220> my<00:03:44.220> new

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
of these so I think this is my my new

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.400 
of these so I think this is my my new
one<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:45.060> it's<00:03:45.180> got<00:03:45.330> quite<00:03:45.660> a<00:03:45.780> bit<00:03:46.020> in<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.260> if

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
one so it's got quite a bit in it if

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.600 
one so it's got quite a bit in it if
you're<00:03:46.560> wondering<00:03:46.950> that's<00:03:47.100> how<00:03:47.280> much<00:03:47.430> it

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
you're wondering that's how much it

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.500 
you're wondering that's how much it
winds<00:03:48.000> up<00:03:48.860> this<00:03:49.860> one<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.280> orange<00:03:50.580> one<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:51.090> a

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
winds up this one the orange one is a

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.780 
winds up this one the orange one is a
bit<00:03:51.810> dry<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.440> bit<00:03:52.590> more<00:03:52.620> chalky<00:03:53.280> on<00:03:53.490> the<00:03:53.610> lip

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
bit dry and a bit more chalky on the lip

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.220 
bit dry and a bit more chalky on the lip
so<00:03:54.030> I<00:03:54.060> don't<00:03:54.330> know<00:03:54.450> why<00:03:54.600> that<00:03:54.780> is

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
so I don't know why that is

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.460 
so I don't know why that is
the<00:03:55.610> formulas<00:03:56.610> really<00:03:57.450> vary<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.320> can

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
the formulas really vary and you can

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.750 
the formulas really vary and you can
probably<00:03:58.620> see<00:03:58.830> when<00:03:59.010> I'm<00:03:59.100> putting<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.430> on<00:03:59.520> it

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
probably see when I'm putting it on it

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:13.559 
probably see when I'm putting it on it
type<00:04:00.150> drugs<00:04:00.570> in<00:04:00.840> it's<00:04:01.830> not<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.100> creamy

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.140 

but<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:14.230> color<00:04:14.439> is<00:04:14.709> still<00:04:15.189> really<00:04:15.640> bright<00:04:15.939> and

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
but the color is still really bright and

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.420 
but the color is still really bright and
really<00:04:16.239> neon<00:04:16.810> which<00:04:17.019> makes<00:04:17.799> these<00:04:17.979> a<00:04:18.039> really

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
really neon which makes these a really

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.120 
really neon which makes these a really
good<00:04:18.639> affordable<00:04:19.180> lipstick<00:04:19.780> because<00:04:20.769> they<00:04:21.070> do

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
good affordable lipstick because they do

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.260 
good affordable lipstick because they do
have<00:04:21.519> that<00:04:21.549> really<00:04:22.030> good<00:04:23.340> map<00:04:24.340> pigmentation

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
have that really good map pigmentation

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.670 
have that really good map pigmentation
so<00:04:25.680> that's<00:04:26.680> what<00:04:26.889> this<00:04:27.009> one<00:04:27.250> looks<00:04:27.280> like<00:04:27.550> I

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
so that's what this one looks like I

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.310 
so that's what this one looks like I
didn't<00:04:29.680> show<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:29.889> on<00:04:29.979> my<00:04:30.099> own

cities and these ones have names and

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.250 
cities and these ones have names and
flowers<00:04:53.820> so<00:04:54.000> I<00:04:54.060> got<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.300> tell<00:04:54.390> you<00:04:54.510> know<00:04:54.630> the

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
flowers so I got to tell you know the

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.450 
flowers so I got to tell you know the
difference<00:04:55.590> is<00:04:55.740> so<00:04:55.920> this<00:04:56.040> one's<00:04:56.250> called

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
difference is so this one's called

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.820 
difference is so this one's called
blossom<00:04:57.000> it's<00:04:57.180> like<00:04:57.330> I'd<00:04:58.080> say<00:04:58.230> this<00:04:58.320> is<00:04:58.470> like<00:04:58.620> a

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
blossom it's like I'd say this is like a

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.540 
blossom it's like I'd say this is like a
medium<00:04:59.100> pink<00:04:59.670> but<00:04:59.880> it's<00:05:00.000> still<00:05:00.260> really<00:05:01.260> bright

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.120 

so<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.670> looks<00:05:05.820> like<00:05:06.110> this<00:05:07.110> one<00:05:07.410> is<00:05:07.710> really

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
so it looks like this one is really

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.760 
so it looks like this one is really
really<00:05:08.940> creamy<00:05:09.210> like<00:05:09.570> this<00:05:10.110> is<00:05:10.290> probably<00:05:10.650> the

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
really creamy like this is probably the

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.220 
really creamy like this is probably the
best<00:05:10.890> feeling

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.180 

so<00:05:17.800> that's<00:05:17.980> how<00:05:18.160> it<00:05:18.280> looks<00:05:18.430> like

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
so that's how it looks like

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.310 
so that's how it looks like
as<00:05:20.760> I<00:05:20.910> said<00:05:21.120> it's<00:05:21.390> still<00:05:21.570> really<00:05:21.990> really

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
as I said it's still really really

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.730 
as I said it's still really really
bright<00:05:22.770> it's<00:05:23.100> just<00:05:23.280> kind<00:05:23.490> of<00:05:23.520> like<00:05:23.700> a<00:05:24.740> dog

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
bright it's just kind of like a dog

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.940 
bright it's just kind of like a dog
coming<00:05:26.450> compared<00:05:27.450> to<00:05:27.570> you<00:05:27.750> um<00:05:27.870> Tokyo<00:05:28.770> which
