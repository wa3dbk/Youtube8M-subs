if<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.630> remove<00:02:38.960> them<00:02:39.170> you're<00:02:39.410> able<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.680> see

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
if you remove them you're able to see

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.090 
if you remove them you're able to see
the<00:02:40.160> temporalis<00:02:40.520> muscle<00:02:41.210> the<00:02:42.200> last<00:02:42.410> muscle<00:02:42.890> on

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
the temporalis muscle the last muscle on

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.380 
the temporalis muscle the last muscle on
the<00:02:43.630> head<00:02:44.630> is<00:02:45.220> deep<00:02:46.220> so<00:02:46.730> we<00:02:46.760> remove<00:02:47.240> the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
the head is deep so we remove the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.150 
the head is deep so we remove the
superficial<00:02:47.870> structures<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.830> we<00:02:48.980> see

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
superficial structures and we see

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.120 
superficial structures and we see
splenius<00:02:49.820> capitis<00:02:50.810> right<00:02:51.080> here<00:02:51.410> we<00:02:51.950> knees

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
splenius capitis right here we knees

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.760
