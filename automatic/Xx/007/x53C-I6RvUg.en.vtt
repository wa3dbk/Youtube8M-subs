got<00:01:54.490> two<00:01:54.700> more<00:01:54.850> cameras<00:01:55.240> here<00:01:55.450> in<00:01:55.540> front<00:01:55.660> of<00:01:55.780> us

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
got two more cameras here in front of us

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.180 
got two more cameras here in front of us
they<00:01:56.020> look<00:01:56.170> kind<00:01:56.380> of<00:01:56.440> similar<00:01:56.620> but<00:01:56.860> I'm<00:01:56.980> sure

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
they look kind of similar but I'm sure

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.980 
they look kind of similar but I'm sure
they're<00:01:57.370> different<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.000> can<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:58.510> tell<00:01:58.570> us<00:01:58.810> a

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
they're different and can you tell us a

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.300 
they're different and can you tell us a
little<00:01:59.050> bit<00:01:59.230> about<00:01:59.410> them<00:01:59.620> they<00:01:59.890> are<00:01:59.920> there

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
little bit about them they are there

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.430 
little bit about them they are there
they're<00:02:00.580> two<00:02:00.730> of<00:02:00.760> our<00:02:00.970> DP<00:02:01.660> series<00:02:02.020> cameras

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
they're two of our DP series cameras

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.390 
they're two of our DP series cameras
that<00:02:02.650> have<00:02:02.680> been<00:02:02.770> updated<00:02:03.250> for<00:02:03.790> PMA<00:02:04.510> 2010<00:02:05.400> both

of these cameras feature the same sensor

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.320 
of these cameras feature the same sensor
we<00:02:08.679> put<00:02:08.860> into<00:02:09.009> our<00:02:09.099> DSLR<00:02:09.700> camera<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.119> same

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
we put into our DSLR camera the same

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.360 
we put into our DSLR camera the same
large<00:02:10.539> sensor<00:02:11.020> this<00:02:11.349> is<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.500> product<00:02:11.800> category

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
large sensor this is a product category

large sensor this is a product category
that<00:02:12.819> Sigma<00:02:13.299> actually<00:02:13.659> pioneered<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:14.469> couple

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
that Sigma actually pioneered a couple

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.190 
that Sigma actually pioneered a couple
of<00:02:15.010> years<00:02:15.189> ago<00:02:15.519> with<00:02:15.909> our<00:02:15.939> DP<00:02:16.450> one<00:02:16.629> camera

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
of years ago with our DP one camera

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.190 
of years ago with our DP one camera
and<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.620> DP<00:02:17.950> one<00:02:18.270> looks<00:02:19.270> looks<00:02:19.750> like<00:02:19.810> this

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
and the DP one looks looks like this

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.869 
and the DP one looks looks like this
what<00:02:20.680> distinguishes<00:02:21.129> it<00:02:21.489> from<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.730> other

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
what distinguishes it from the other

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.880 
what distinguishes it from the other
model<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.930> has<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.080> very<00:02:23.349> wide<00:02:23.410> angle

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890
