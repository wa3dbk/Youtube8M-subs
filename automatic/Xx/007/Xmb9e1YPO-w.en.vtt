00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
don't even try to do the maneuver at

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.549 
don't even try to do the maneuver at
full<00:00:58.289> speed<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:58.980> what<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.340> look<00:00:59.489> like

another thing that you can try something

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.330 
another thing that you can try something
called<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.299> Connie's<00:01:06.900> world<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.470> call<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.189> that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
called a Connie's world I call it that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.950 
called a Connie's world I call it that
so<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.729> dancing<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.570> girl<00:01:09.689> named

Connie<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:11.189> started<00:01:11.460> doing<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.909> was

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
Connie and we started doing this it was

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.750 
Connie and we started doing this it was
fun<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:13.260> idea<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.770> when<00:01:14.310> you're<00:01:14.400> doing<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
fun the idea is when you're doing a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.330 
fun the idea is when you're doing a
courtesy<00:01:15.119> turn<00:01:15.439> you<00:01:16.439> know<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.189> same

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
courtesy turn you know that in the same

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.890 
courtesy turn you know that in the same
amount<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> time<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.090> takes<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.630> just

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
amount of time that it takes to do just

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.789 
amount of time that it takes to do just
a<00:01:19.320> basic<00:01:19.680> courtesy<00:01:19.830> turn<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.619> actually

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
a basic courtesy turn you can actually

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.440 
a basic courtesy turn you can actually
get<00:01:23.159> around<00:01:23.250> twice<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.000> same<00:01:24.150> amount<00:01:24.420> of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
get around twice in the same amount of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.109 
get around twice in the same amount of
time<00:01:24.720> if<00:01:24.960> you've<00:01:25.080> really<00:01:25.470> booked<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.830> around

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
time if you've really booked it around

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.810 
time if you've really booked it around
as<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.330> start<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.659> change<00:01:28.490> first<00:01:29.490> thing<00:01:29.700> is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
as you start to change first thing is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.520 
as you start to change first thing is
you're<00:01:30.240> probably<00:01:30.720> means<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.049> put<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.290> hand

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
you're probably means that put your hand

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.380 
you're probably means that put your hand
on<00:01:31.710> her<00:01:31.920> waist<00:01:31.950> instead<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.610> taking<00:01:32.909> her<00:01:33.150> hand

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
on her waist instead of taking her hand

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.740 
on her waist instead of taking her hand
back<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.680> because<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.520> need<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.329> mean<00:01:36.479> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
back here but because you need to mean a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.179 
back here but because you need to mean a
way<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.259> each<00:01:37.350> other<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.009> catch

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
way for each other so that you can catch

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.380 
way for each other so that you can catch
weight<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:39.299> once<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> start<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.930> around

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
weight but once you start going around

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.240 
weight but once you start going around
after<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.420> first<00:01:42.780> time<00:01:42.930> through<00:01:43.170> just

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
after that first time through just

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.690 
after that first time through just
back<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.090> take<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> second<00:01:45.960> time<00:01:46.080> around<00:01:46.700> this

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
back and take a second time around this

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.090 
back and take a second time around this
is<00:01:47.760> a<00:01:47.910> maneuver<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:49.350> better<00:01:49.590> want<00:01:49.800> to<00:01:49.890> do<00:01:49.950> this

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
is a maneuver you better want to do this

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.280 
is a maneuver you better want to do this
only<00:01:50.280> with<00:01:50.520> your<00:01:50.640> regular<00:01:50.820> partners<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.900> at
