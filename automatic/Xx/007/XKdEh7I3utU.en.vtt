00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.220
 let's start doing our 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.650
 sections we make a ponytail with all the 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.379
 back of our ear section 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.660
 We leave it loose and we take the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.060
 part of bangs with a clamp for 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.670
 that is not entangled 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.460
 we have already made a section 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.579
 diagonal on top for 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.879
 divide our two braids then what 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.520
 what we started doing is a braid 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:37.170
 basic of three chains 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.019
 let's go collecting all the hair 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.790
 that we left loose in the division of 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.260
 ear to ear 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.030
 then we start our braid 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.130
 basic whenever we 're going to cross to that 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.500
 we are going to remove a piece we leave it 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.160
 in the upper part and we cross the 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.090
 rest that we have left then we feed 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.090
 let's cross 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.270
 we take a piece out of him and 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:10.180
 we cross and add hair again 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.070
 the braid we comb 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.290
 we combed well so that we do not 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.790
 messy 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.329
 we cross that we're going to cross what 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.220
 we split in two and cross again and 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.590
 so we do it successively until 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.350
 collect all our inheritance all 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.270
 our hair the idea of ​​taking that 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.479
 little piece of hair that we are taking out 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.280
 of that tuft is to make a 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.470
 decoration I'm going to do in the part 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.930
 from behind with that hair 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.100
 as we add hair to 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.440
 our braid 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.480
 it is better to go combing we can apply gel 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.760
 also so that our braid is left 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.120
 well organized we continue with the other 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.810
 side we apply gel and we can moisten 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.450
 the hair combed and we started our 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.120
 braid this we are going to make a braid 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.120
 basic feeding the also of a single 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.930
 side only that we will not live any 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.820
 lock will collect all the hair 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.260
 this side we're not going to make the mesh that 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.260
 let's close it to the other side 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.720
 Now we will work with 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.320
 betteries that we leave the side of the 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.580
 We are going to wet well 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:28.850
 with water and we are going to apply gel 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.510
 we combed them the dis tangles well 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.910
 we make each one individual and 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.170
 let's start a fabric in the form of 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.570
 mesh or we take the first one of the 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.960
 top part and we started to move it 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.390
 above below above by 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.790
 below above below each 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.660
 tuft until we reach the last one 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.660
 is stuck to the ear 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.590
 and so we continue little by little passing the 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.709
 that follows but we had it in shape 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.780
 contrary if we start the first 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.349
 once over then with the second 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.420
 we start below and so we continue with 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.859
 the third we started over by let 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.720
 above below above by 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.299
 below so that we have a fabric like 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.159
 in the shape of gray hair and so we're going 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.750
 happening all and we're going to leave them 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.750
 loose on the bottom 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.140
 apply gel for this type of hairstyles 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.440
 it helps us a lot because that way the fabric 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.810
 what we do is cleaner than we do not 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.520
 hair is stopped or anything by the 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.930
 style 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.720
 here already then we finish our 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.230
 tissue we let loose all afternoon or 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.440
 good a part of the braid and we started 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.770
 to feed the braid with the little tables 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.540
 that we left the tissue and crossed 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.310
 we do with a normal braid but 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.250
 We feed with the little tables that have 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.019
 stayed from the tissue and so on until 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.019
 let's finish collecting them all 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.849
 when we no longer have anything more than 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.790
 add it to the hair then we finish 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.190
 in a braid of 3 and what we're going to 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.220
 to do is to turn around the little bit 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.440
 to cover it and that same thing we're going to do 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.139
 on the other side we finish our braid 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.990
 of 3 and we're going to rotate it around the 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.539
 rubber good now what we're going to do 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.760
 is to decorate our braid this is a 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.350
 kind of bow there are many colors 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.139
 that you can use the color that 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.510
 want let's make a way how to 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.039
 interlaced circles then what 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.880
 we do is we put the needle through 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:50.250
 under the hair and crossed the bow 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.990
 below the needle they have to put 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.910
 very careful how I do it so that 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.789
 you can do it at home 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.520
 below and we put the loop below 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.220
 the needle and we pull and so on 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.880
 we do it all along the line 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.880
 of the braid 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.659
 we continue our decoration in the 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.849
 top part just stretch a 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.889
 little the tie and that little flower that we have 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.979
 stuck there is stuck with a little bit of 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:21.389
 silicone to lacito or with any 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.520
 soft adhesive that you have and 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.580
 we hide the thread of the thread so that 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.740
 look and finally with the hair 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.800
 remaining that we are left out of the 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.629
 pigtail let's make 3 braids or 4 the 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.629
 amount we want from a braid 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:40.090
 basic normal and this is the result 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:43.740
 end of our hairstyle is a hairstyle 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.740
 very beautiful and very easy to do 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.860
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.860
 in a next video
