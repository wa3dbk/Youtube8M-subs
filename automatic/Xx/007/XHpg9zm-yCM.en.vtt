class<00:01:46.909> here<00:01:47.119> because<00:01:47.389> what<00:01:47.840> makes<00:01:47.990> all<00:01:48.200> these

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
class here because what makes all these

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.379 
class here because what makes all these
different<00:01:48.799> is<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.100> acidity<00:01:49.759> or<00:01:49.789> the<00:01:50.149> the

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:50.389 
different is the acidity or the the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:53.289 
different is the acidity or the the
alkalinity<00:01:50.929> of<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.319> pH<00:01:51.679> okay<00:01:52.159> okay<00:01:52.579> so<00:01:52.939> now

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
alkalinity of the pH okay okay so now

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.050 
alkalinity of the pH okay okay so now
we've<00:01:53.450> got<00:01:53.479> examples<00:01:54.079> of<00:01:54.289> soda<00:01:54.829> soda<00:01:55.639> I

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
we've got examples of soda soda I

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.700 
we've got examples of soda soda I
couldn't<00:01:56.990> get<00:01:57.079> you<00:01:57.170> all<00:01:57.259> drinking<00:01:57.619> this

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
couldn't get you all drinking this

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.260 
couldn't get you all drinking this
morning<00:01:57.889> and<00:01:58.310> two<00:01:58.490> different<00:01:58.819> types<00:01:58.999> of

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
morning and two different types of

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.059 
morning and two different types of
bottled<00:01:59.689> water<00:01:59.719> all<00:02:00.200> in<00:02:00.229> there<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:00.829> then<00:02:00.950> when

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
bottled water all in there and then when

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.010 
bottled water all in there and then when
you<00:02:01.159> put<00:02:01.369> what<00:02:01.549> what<00:02:01.759> is<00:02:01.850> this<00:02:01.969> this<00:02:02.539> is<00:02:02.600> pH

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
you put what what is this this is pH

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.499 
you put what what is this this is pH
drops<00:02:03.259> its<00:02:03.560> pH<00:02:03.829> testing<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:04.609> so<00:02:04.969> what<00:02:05.389> I'm

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
drops its pH testing so so what I'm

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.330 
drops its pH testing so so what I'm
going<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:05.749> do<00:02:05.899> is<00:02:06.049> I'm<00:02:06.170> going<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.439> put<00:02:06.740> this

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
going to do is I'm going to put this

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.960 
going to do is I'm going to put this
into<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:08.030> water<00:02:08.270> but<00:02:08.630> we<00:02:08.750> want<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.080> see<00:02:09.259> purple

is acidic we've put some Kang and water

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.350 
is acidic we've put some Kang and water
in<00:02:47.960> it<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.200> look<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.590> turns<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:49.100> blue<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:50.210> it

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
in it and look it turns it blue so it

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.020 
in it and look it turns it blue so it
neutralizes<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.290> acid<00:02:51.830> put<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.760> in<00:02:52.910> that

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
neutralizes the acid put it in that

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.870 
neutralizes the acid put it in that
water<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:54.110> put<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.380> even<00:02:54.620> in<00:02:54.740> vodka<00:02:55.010> look<00:02:55.760> at

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
water you put it even in vodka look at

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.630 
water you put it even in vodka look at
that<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.240> turns<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:56.950> neutralizes<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.160> alkalis

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
that it turns it neutralizes and alkalis

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.390 
that it turns it neutralizes and alkalis
of<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.940> vodka<00:02:59.300> so<00:02:59.570> knowing<00:03:00.160> knowing<00:03:01.160> that's

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
of the vodka so knowing knowing that's

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.040 
of the vodka so knowing knowing that's
why<00:03:01.550> wouldn't<00:03:01.910> water<00:03:02.060> companies<00:03:02.510> do<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:02.870> to

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
why wouldn't water companies do this to

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.860 
why wouldn't water companies do this to
their<00:03:03.200> water<00:03:03.580> good<00:03:04.580> question<00:03:05.330> good<00:03:05.720> question

stream<00:03:48.350> is<00:03:48.470> sends<00:03:48.860> out<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.100> acid<00:03:49.280> water<00:03:49.700> and

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
stream is sends out the acid water and

stream is sends out the acid water and
you<00:03:50.300> bottle<00:03:50.959> up<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.170> kangen<00:03:51.680> water<00:03:51.709> now<00:03:52.640> this

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
you bottle up the kangen water now this

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.090 
you bottle up the kangen water now this
is<00:03:53.780> what<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:53.959> wanted<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.320> go<00:03:54.410> back<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.800> this<00:03:54.920> to

is what I wanted to go back to this to

is what I wanted to go back to this to
show<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:55.340> with<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.850> soda<00:03:56.150> okay<00:03:56.870> we<00:03:57.320> put<00:03:57.530> this

alkaline<00:03:59.750> because<00:04:00.709> it's<00:04:00.950> too<00:04:01.250> acidic<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:02.030> will

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
alkaline because it's too acidic it will

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.170
