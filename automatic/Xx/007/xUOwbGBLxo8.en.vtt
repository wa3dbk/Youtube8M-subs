hi<00:00:01.410> there<00:00:01.680> may<00:00:01.890> be<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:02.010> big<00:00:02.129> gamer<00:00:02.340> here<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:02.820> we

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hi there may be a big gamer here and we

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.800 
hi there may be a big gamer here and we
have<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:04.609> tutorial<00:00:05.609> that<00:00:05.970> people<00:00:06.390> have<00:00:06.509> asked

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
have a tutorial that people have asked

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.350 
have a tutorial that people have asked
for<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.470> this<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.519> how<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.700> wire<00:00:08.910> your<00:00:09.030> piston

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
for and this is how to wire your piston

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.870 
for and this is how to wire your piston
elevators<00:00:09.780> this<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> 5<00:00:11.070> clock<00:00:11.340> timer<00:00:11.639> I've

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
elevators this is a 5 clock timer I've

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.940 
elevators this is a 5 clock timer I've
talked<00:00:12.090> about<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.780> 5<00:00:13.469> clock<00:00:13.710> timer

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
talked about this a 5 clock timer

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.430 
talked about this a 5 clock timer
basically<00:00:14.400> does<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> loop<00:00:14.849> if<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.750> blow<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.289> up

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
basically does a loop if you blow it up

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.050 
basically does a loop if you blow it up
and<00:00:16.619> expand<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.130> out<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.550> make<00:00:17.670> more<00:00:17.880> space

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
and expand it out and make more space

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.050 
and expand it out and make more space
you<00:00:18.240> can<00:00:18.600> wire<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.350> those<00:00:20.010> channels<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.910> go

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
you can wire in those channels that go

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.529 
you can wire in those channels that go
to<00:00:21.119> your<00:00:21.240> Pistons<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.070> use<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.939> timers<00:00:24.359> to

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
to your Pistons and use the timers to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.349 
to your Pistons and use the timers to
delay<00:00:24.840> them<00:00:25.130> now<00:00:26.130> one<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.000> things<00:00:27.060> about

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
delay them now one of the things about

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.169 
delay them now one of the things about
that<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:28.189> can<00:00:29.189> wire<00:00:29.400> into<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:29.939> it's

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
that is you can wire into it and it's

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.179 
that is you can wire into it and it's
not<00:00:30.330> too<00:00:30.510> hard<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.590> don't<00:00:31.769> want<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> wire

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
not too hard but you don't want to wire

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.100 
not too hard but you don't want to wire
into<00:00:32.489> clothes<00:00:32.730> that's<00:00:33.000> why<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.180> say<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.480> expand

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
into clothes that's why I say you expand

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.770 
into clothes that's why I say you expand
it<00:00:34.290> out<00:00:34.440> blow<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.890> out<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:36.000> use<00:00:36.270> your<00:00:36.390> timers

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
it out blow it out and use your timers

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.410 
it out blow it out and use your timers
but<00:00:37.469> we're<00:00:37.950> going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> go<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:39.000> easy

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
but we're going to go with the easy

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.720 
but we're going to go with the easy
peasy<00:00:39.989> method<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:41.100> will<00:00:41.399> make<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.700> very

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
peasy method this will make you very

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.790 
peasy method this will make you very
happy<00:00:42.090> wiring<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.960> because<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.469> super

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
happy wiring this because it's super

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.340 
happy wiring this because it's super
fast<00:00:44.160> super<00:00:44.399> simple<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.960> came<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.320> with

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
fast super simple and I came up with

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.470 
fast super simple and I came up with
this<00:00:46.649> one<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.039> works<00:00:47.280> very<00:00:47.820> well<00:00:47.940> people<00:00:48.420> are

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
this one it works very well people are

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.180 
this one it works very well people are
like<00:00:48.629> holy<00:00:48.840> crap<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.410> actually<00:00:49.770> works<00:00:50.039> it's

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
like holy crap this actually works it's

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.119 
like holy crap this actually works it's
so<00:00:50.460> simple<00:00:51.020> basically<00:00:52.020> that's<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.829> wire

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
so simple basically that's just a wire

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.060 
so simple basically that's just a wire
that<00:00:53.520> goes<00:00:53.670> all<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.000> way<00:00:54.180> down<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:55.070> has

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that goes all the way down and has

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.150 
that goes all the way down and has
delays<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.899> basically<00:00:57.899> three<00:00:58.739> redstone

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
delays in it basically three redstone

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.600 
delays in it basically three redstone
wire<00:00:59.480> for<00:01:00.480> delays<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.910> repeating<00:01:04.040> 3434<00:01:05.040> it

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
wire for delays and repeating 3434 it

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.500 
wire for delays and repeating 3434 it
comes<00:01:05.820> down<00:01:06.000> 34<00:01:06.600> 34<00:01:07.970> okay<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.210> I'm<00:01:09.299> doing

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
comes down 34 34 okay what I'm doing

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.950 
comes down 34 34 okay what I'm doing
right<00:01:09.600> now<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.960> bringing<00:01:10.890> out<00:01:10.979> our<00:01:11.040> wire<00:01:11.430> leads

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
right now is bringing out our wire leads

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.480 
right now is bringing out our wire leads
that<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:13.110> number<00:01:13.380> four<00:01:13.590> back<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.310> is

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that was number four back there this is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.320 
that was number four back there this is
number<00:01:14.640> three<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.439> the<00:01:16.439> firing<00:01:16.710> order

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.610 

and<00:01:19.450> we'll<00:01:19.810> do<00:01:19.930> is<00:01:20.080> we're<00:01:20.290> going<00:01:20.410> to<00:01:20.500> go<00:01:20.590> ahead

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
and we'll do is we're going to go ahead

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.780 
and we'll do is we're going to go ahead
and<00:01:21.280> get<00:01:21.640> number<00:01:21.910> two<00:01:23.370> basically<00:01:24.370> after<00:01:24.490> each

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
and get number two basically after each

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.820 
and get number two basically after each
one<00:01:24.970> of<00:01:25.000> your<00:01:25.150> delays<00:01:25.420> is<00:01:25.810> going<00:01:26.230> to<00:01:26.290> be<00:01:26.440> one<00:01:26.800> of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
one of your delays is going to be one of

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.240 
one of your delays is going to be one of
your<00:01:27.040> leads<00:01:28.290> actually<00:01:29.290> let's<00:01:29.470> block<00:01:29.950> in<00:01:30.100> there

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
your leads actually let's block in there

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.390 
your leads actually let's block in there
and<00:01:30.370> make<00:01:30.460> that<00:01:30.640> nice<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.330> easy<00:01:31.570> to<00:01:31.750> see<00:01:33.900> okay

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and make that nice and easy to see okay

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.510 
and make that nice and easy to see okay
this<00:01:36.400> ain't<00:01:36.640> gonna<00:01:36.760> work<00:01:36.820> out<00:01:37.060> too<00:01:37.180> well<00:01:38.520> want

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
this ain't gonna work out too well want

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.500 
this ain't gonna work out too well want
to<00:01:39.580> bring<00:01:39.760> this<00:01:39.880> across<00:01:40.150> without

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
to bring this across without

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.600 
to bring this across without
interrupting<00:01:41.110> so<00:01:41.920> I'm<00:01:41.980> bringing<00:01:42.190> it<00:01:42.340> down<00:01:42.460> the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
interrupting so I'm bringing it down the

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.140 
interrupting so I'm bringing it down the
middle<00:01:42.820> there<00:01:43.120> but<00:01:44.310> yeah<00:01:45.310> those<00:01:45.850> are<00:01:45.970> going<00:01:46.090> to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
middle there but yeah those are going to

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.940 
middle there but yeah those are going to
connect<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:47.020> we<00:01:47.170> gotta<00:01:47.350> dig<00:01:47.560> that<00:01:47.710> just

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
connect so we gotta dig that just

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.940 
connect so we gotta dig that just
because<00:01:50.950> too<00:01:51.190> deep<00:01:51.400> won't<00:01:51.820> jump<00:01:52.120> and<00:01:53.080> let's

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
because too deep won't jump and let's

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.130 
because too deep won't jump and let's
bring<00:01:54.130> this<00:01:54.250> out<00:01:54.430> okay<00:01:55.270> so<00:01:55.330> now<00:01:55.660> we<00:01:55.720> have<00:01:55.960> all

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
bring this out okay so now we have all

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.070 
bring this out okay so now we have all
of<00:01:56.620> our<00:01:56.770> legs<00:01:57.040> completed<00:02:00.360> okay<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.660> we're

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
of our legs completed okay and we're

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.950 
of our legs completed okay and we're
going<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.260> go<00:02:02.320> ahead<00:02:02.350> set<00:02:02.770> all<00:02:03.010> of<00:02:03.310> these<00:02:03.900> up<00:02:04.900> to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
going to go ahead set all of these up to

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.370 
going to go ahead set all of these up to
their<00:02:05.440> maximum<00:02:06.960> notches<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.940> can<00:02:10.300> lower<00:02:11.260> that

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
their maximum notches you can lower that

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.100 
their maximum notches you can lower that
I<00:02:11.770> would<00:02:12.010> recommend<00:02:12.280> like<00:02:12.640> for<00:02:12.880> instance<00:02:13.110> your

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
I would recommend like for instance your

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.890 
I would recommend like for instance your
last<00:02:14.350> one<00:02:14.740> if<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.130> do<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.459> take<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.390> down<00:02:16.600> one

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
last one if you do it take it down one

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.040 
last one if you do it take it down one
notch<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.290> time<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.800> fine-tune<00:02:18.070> this<00:02:18.990> what<00:02:19.990> it

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
notch a time to fine-tune this what it

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.230 
notch a time to fine-tune this what it
basically<00:02:20.170> does<00:02:20.470> by<00:02:20.830> taking<00:02:21.160> one<00:02:21.340> nacho<00:02:21.940> time

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
basically does by taking one nacho time

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.320 
basically does by taking one nacho time
down<00:02:22.570> on<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.350> last<00:02:23.590> one<00:02:23.860> allows<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:24.940> speed

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
down on the last one allows you to speed

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.390 
down on the last one allows you to speed
up<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.630> process<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:26.140> little<00:02:26.380> bit<00:02:26.530> in<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:28.380> I

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
up the process a little bit in this I

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.610 
up the process a little bit in this I
don't<00:02:30.400> recommend<00:02:30.850> doing<00:02:31.570> any<00:02:31.989> more<00:02:32.290> than<00:02:32.530> the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
don't recommend doing any more than the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.070 
don't recommend doing any more than the
last<00:02:32.830> one<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.420> mean<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.510> can<00:02:34.660> take<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.870> last

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
last one I mean you can take the last

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.070 
last one I mean you can take the last
one<00:02:35.260> all<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.500> way<00:02:35.590> down<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:35.920> know<00:02:36.400> notches<00:02:37.080> of

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
one all the way down to know notches of

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.810 
one all the way down to know notches of
separation<00:02:38.910> but<00:02:39.910> usually<00:02:40.450> you'll<00:02:40.780> find<00:02:41.080> that

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
separation but usually you'll find that

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.640 
separation but usually you'll find that
slower<00:02:42.820> is<00:02:42.970> better<00:02:43.030> because<00:02:43.750> what<00:02:44.140> happens<00:02:44.530> is

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
slower is better because what happens is

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.130 
slower is better because what happens is
if<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.670> circuit<00:02:46.060> fires<00:02:46.269> off<00:02:46.480> rapidly<00:02:46.900> and

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
if this circuit fires off rapidly and

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.430 
if this circuit fires off rapidly and
there's<00:02:47.350> lag<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:48.070> screws<00:02:48.459> up<00:02:48.989> so<00:02:49.989> what<00:02:50.290> you

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
there's lag it screws up so what you

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.979 
there's lag it screws up so what you
want<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:50.680> kind<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.070> like<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.300> one<00:02:52.300> two<00:02:52.600> three

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
want is kind of like a one two three

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.550 
want is kind of like a one two three
four<00:02:53.290> 1234

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
four 1234

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.170 
four 1234
you<00:02:55.800> know<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.099> one<00:02:56.310> two<00:02:56.489> three<00:02:56.700> four<00:02:56.910> 1234

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
you know that one two three four 1234

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.559 
you know that one two three four 1234
kind<00:02:58.020> of<00:02:58.110> sequence<00:02:58.730> allows<00:02:59.730> you<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.209> have

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
kind of sequence allows you to have

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.380 
kind of sequence allows you to have
reliability<00:03:01.349> on<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:02.430> thing<00:03:02.670> working<00:03:02.940> for

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
reliability on this thing working for

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.190 
reliability on this thing working for
you<00:03:04.610> now<00:03:07.610> this<00:03:08.610> will<00:03:08.970> work<00:03:09.150> on<00:03:09.330> xbox<00:03:09.690> 360

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
you now this will work on xbox 360

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.320 
you now this will work on xbox 360
because<00:03:10.349> this<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.860> such<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> simple<00:03:11.610> circuit

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
because this is such a simple circuit

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.940 
because this is such a simple circuit
that<00:03:13.400> there's<00:03:14.400> no<00:03:14.760> redstone<00:03:15.420> issues<00:03:15.930> on<00:03:16.590> offs

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
that there's no redstone issues on offs

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.170 
that there's no redstone issues on offs
or<00:03:17.310> anything<00:03:17.730> like<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:19.050> simple

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
or anything like that it's that simple

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.070 
or anything like that it's that simple
basically<00:03:21.180> after<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.390> set<00:03:21.569> this<00:03:21.660> up<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.930> put

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
basically after you set this up you put

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.800 
basically after you set this up you put
a<00:03:22.110> repeater<00:03:22.410> on<00:03:22.560> then<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:22.830> you're<00:03:23.069> golden

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
a repeater on then and you're golden

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.150 
a repeater on then and you're golden
okay<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:24.870> what<00:03:25.200> we<00:03:25.319> did<00:03:25.470> here<00:03:25.709> we'll<00:03:25.860> put<00:03:26.010> some

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
okay so what we did here we'll put some

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.070 
okay so what we did here we'll put some
Pistons<00:03:26.489> down<00:03:26.700> just<00:03:27.300> want<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:27.660> be<00:03:27.780> able<00:03:27.870> to

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
Pistons down just want you to be able to

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.420 
Pistons down just want you to be able to
see<00:03:28.380> like<00:03:29.130> how<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.700> fires<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:31.069> you<00:03:32.069> know<00:03:32.190> how

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
see like how it fires and you know how

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.180 
see like how it fires and you know how
it<00:03:32.549> fires<00:03:32.760> in<00:03:33.150> nice<00:03:33.480> order<00:03:34.049> they're<00:03:34.290> going

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
it fires in nice order they're going

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.570 
it fires in nice order they're going
down<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.580> line<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.150> everything

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
down the line and everything

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.320 
down the line and everything
unfortunately<00:03:38.580> I<00:03:38.640> did<00:03:38.819> this<00:03:38.910> little<00:03:39.060> too

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
unfortunately I did this little too

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.699 
unfortunately I did this little too
close<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.630> somebody<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:40.200> there<00:03:40.349> so<00:03:40.500> we're<00:03:40.620> not

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
close to somebody is there so we're not

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:41.990 
close to somebody is there so we're not
going<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.920> build<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.099> repair<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:41.549> time<00:03:41.790> but

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
going to build a repair this time but

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.509 
going to build a repair this time but
there<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.049> go<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.290> first<00:03:43.500> one<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:44.069> second

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
there you go the first one the second

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.400 
there you go the first one the second
one<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:45.660> third<00:03:45.690> one<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.220> fourth<00:03:48.019> so<00:03:49.019> I

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
one the third one and the fourth so I

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.960 
one the third one and the fourth so I
did<00:03:49.769> offset<00:03:50.160> there's<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.400> little<00:03:50.610> bit<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:50.880> you

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
did offset there's a little bit so you

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.580 
did offset there's a little bit so you
could<00:03:51.120> tell<00:03:51.330> like<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.630> front<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.200> back

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
could tell like the front to the back

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.000 
could tell like the front to the back
tip<00:03:53.120> but<00:03:55.430> it's<00:03:56.430> actually<00:03:56.610> pretty<00:03:57.000> simple<00:03:58.010> okay

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
tip but it's actually pretty simple okay

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.710 
tip but it's actually pretty simple okay
let's<00:03:59.280> go<00:03:59.430> ahead<00:03:59.549> and<00:03:59.730> get<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.239> big<00:04:00.420> one<00:04:00.570> out

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
let's go ahead and get the big one out

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.360 
let's go ahead and get the big one out
here<00:04:00.900> what<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.410> was<00:04:01.500> if<00:04:01.620> went<00:04:01.799> ahead<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.070> pre

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
here what it was if went ahead and pre

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.300 
here what it was if went ahead and pre
built<00:04:02.579> this<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.820> bit<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:04.230> it's<00:04:04.530> already<00:04:04.920> set<00:04:05.160> up

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
built this a bit so it's already set up

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.130 
built this a bit so it's already set up
and<00:04:05.549> don't<00:04:06.420> have<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.690> waste<00:04:06.840> your<00:04:07.049> time

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
and don't have to waste your time

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.140 
and don't have to waste your time
okay<00:04:08.890> the<00:04:09.100> piston<00:04:09.550> we're<00:04:09.850> going<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.030> start

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
okay the piston we're going to start

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.120 
okay the piston we're going to start
with<00:04:10.210> number<00:04:10.420> one<00:04:10.540> which<00:04:11.110> pushes<00:04:11.440> it<00:04:11.740> to<00:04:11.890> right

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
with number one which pushes it to right

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.410 
with number one which pushes it to right
number<00:04:13.000> two<00:04:13.030> which<00:04:13.540> pushes<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:14.170> up<00:04:14.350> and<00:04:15.420> let's

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
number two which pushes it up and let's

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.140 
number two which pushes it up and let's
see<00:04:16.720> here<00:04:18.329> fill<00:04:19.329> these<00:04:19.480> in<00:04:19.540> here<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:21.130> just<00:04:21.880> for

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
see here fill these in here and just for

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.610 
see here fill these in here and just for
good<00:04:22.180> contrast<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:22.930> can<00:04:23.050> tell<00:04:23.290> what's<00:04:23.470> moving

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
good contrast you can tell what's moving

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.030 
good contrast you can tell what's moving
we're<00:04:23.950> going<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.130> put<00:04:24.280> this<00:04:24.430> wool<00:04:24.760> in<00:04:25.980> okay<00:04:26.980> so

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
we're going to put this wool in okay so

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.890 
we're going to put this wool in okay so
we're<00:04:27.640> going<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.850> leave<00:04:28.000> this<00:04:28.210> first<00:04:28.570> slot

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
we're going to leave this first slot

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.690 
we're going to leave this first slot
blank<00:04:29.260> because<00:04:29.770> what's<00:04:30.130> going<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.400> do<00:04:30.460> is<00:04:30.580> go

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
blank because what's going to do is go

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.700 
blank because what's going to do is go
push<00:04:30.910> all<00:04:31.090> for<00:04:31.360> those<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:32.140> the<00:04:32.230> right<00:04:32.440> and<00:04:32.680> one

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
push all for those to the right and one

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.430 
push all for those to the right and one
is<00:04:33.400> going<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.610> be<00:04:33.669> on<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:33.850> piston<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.419> push<00:04:35.020> up

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
is going to be on the piston and push up

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.360 
is going to be on the piston and push up
when<00:04:35.830> it<00:04:35.950> fires<00:04:36.930> so<00:04:37.930> go<00:04:38.500> ahead<00:04:38.650> do<00:04:38.950> is<00:04:39.100> fill

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
when it fires so go ahead do is fill

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.550 
when it fires so go ahead do is fill
these<00:04:39.490> in<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:41.400> as<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.550> see<00:04:42.730> that's<00:04:43.140> one<00:04:44.140> two

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
these in and as you see that's one two

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.810 
these in and as you see that's one two
and<00:04:45.130> then<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:47.560> other<00:04:47.650> ones<00:04:47.950> go<00:04:48.310> back<00:04:48.580> behind

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
and then the other ones go back behind

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.100 
and then the other ones go back behind
it<00:04:51.120> now<00:04:52.120> you<00:04:52.180> can<00:04:52.390> wire<00:04:52.570> this<00:04:52.720> any<00:04:52.960> way<00:04:53.080> you

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
it now you can wire this any way you

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.960 
it now you can wire this any way you
want<00:04:53.410> but<00:04:53.500> you<00:04:54.280> know<00:04:54.310> it<00:04:54.430> depends<00:04:54.730> on<00:04:54.820> where

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
want but you know it depends on where

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.110 
want but you know it depends on where
you<00:04:55.030> will<00:04:55.180> put<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.390> circuit<00:04:55.780> at<00:04:56.880> say<00:04:57.880> for

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
you will put the circuit at say for

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.970 
you will put the circuit at say for
instance<00:04:58.180> you<00:04:59.140> don't<00:04:59.290> have<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.530> wire<00:04:59.740> it<00:04:59.770> all

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
instance you don't have to wire it all

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.830 
instance you don't have to wire it all
the<00:05:00.100> way<00:05:00.190> around<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:00.460> back<00:05:00.669> side<00:05:00.700> you<00:05:01.570> could

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
the way around the back side you could

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.770 
the way around the back side you could
wire<00:05:02.320> it<00:05:02.350> around<00:05:02.860> the<00:05:03.370> other<00:05:03.400> way<00:05:03.580> if<00:05:03.970> you<00:05:04.540> want

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
wire it around the other way if you want

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.620 
wire it around the other way if you want
it<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:05.430> matter<00:05:06.430> of<00:05:06.520> fact<00:05:06.700> if<00:05:06.910> you<00:05:07.150> were<00:05:07.419> put

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
it to matter of fact if you were put

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.540 
it to matter of fact if you were put
that<00:05:07.780> part<00:05:07.990> on<00:05:08.230> the<00:05:08.560> other<00:05:08.710> side<00:05:08.950> it<00:05:09.250> would<00:05:09.400> do

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
that part on the other side it would do

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.620 
that part on the other side it would do
it<00:05:10.320> pretty<00:05:11.320> easy<00:05:12.030> we<00:05:13.030> took<00:05:13.180> that<00:05:13.360> line

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
it pretty easy we took that line

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.370 
it pretty easy we took that line
underneath<00:05:13.990> and<00:05:15.330> that's<00:05:16.330> number<00:05:16.720> three<00:05:16.750> which

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
underneath and that's number three which

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.480 
underneath and that's number three which
actually<00:05:17.710> goes<00:05:17.979> around<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.250> back<00:05:18.460> here<00:05:18.850> and

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
actually goes around the back here and

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.830 
actually goes around the back here and
those<00:05:21.490> are<00:05:21.700> just<00:05:21.729> to<00:05:22.030> keep<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.300> circuit<00:05:22.660> live

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
those are just to keep the circuit live

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.519 
those are just to keep the circuit live
you<00:05:23.080> don't<00:05:23.440> have<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:24.010> use<00:05:24.160> a<00:05:24.190> delay<00:05:24.610> on<00:05:24.640> them

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:25.529 
you don't have to use a delay on them

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.159 
you don't have to use a delay on them
okay<00:05:26.189> and<00:05:26.459> that<00:05:26.699> goes<00:05:26.879> up<00:05:27.089> and<00:05:27.269> it<00:05:27.599> pushes<00:05:27.899> them

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
okay and that goes up and it pushes them

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.179 
okay and that goes up and it pushes them
over<00:05:29.779> so<00:05:30.779> the<00:05:30.989> first<00:05:31.139> one<00:05:31.379> pushes<00:05:31.829> them<00:05:31.979> to<00:05:32.009> the

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:32.189 
over so the first one pushes them to the

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:35.379 
over so the first one pushes them to the
right<00:05:32.449> the<00:05:33.449> second<00:05:33.809> one<00:05:33.899> pushes<00:05:34.199> them<00:05:34.349> up<00:05:34.499> and

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
right the second one pushes them up and

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.609 
right the second one pushes them up and
if<00:05:36.389> we're<00:05:36.629> on<00:05:36.749> the<00:05:36.839> other<00:05:36.869> side<00:05:36.989> this<00:05:37.319> would<00:05:37.499> be

00:05:37.609 --> 00:05:37.619 
if we're on the other side this would be

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:43.099 
if we're on the other side this would be
pushing<00:05:37.889> them<00:05:38.219> to<00:05:39.149> the<00:05:39.929> left<00:05:41.839> which<00:05:42.839> would

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:43.109 
pushing them to the left which would

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:45.439 
pushing them to the left which would
feed<00:05:43.469> this<00:05:43.919> piston<00:05:44.579> which<00:05:44.819> is<00:05:44.969> going<00:05:45.119> to<00:05:45.179> push

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
feed this piston which is going to push

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.409 
feed this piston which is going to push
them<00:05:45.659> down<00:05:46.129> which<00:05:47.129> will<00:05:47.309> feed<00:05:47.549> piston<00:05:48.179> number

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
them down which will feed piston number

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.419 
them down which will feed piston number
one<00:05:48.629> again<00:05:48.839> so<00:05:49.589> it's<00:05:49.709> kind<00:05:49.919> of<00:05:49.949> like<00:05:50.099> a<00:05:50.159> loop

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:50.429 
one again so it's kind of like a loop

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:55.669 
one again so it's kind of like a loop
you<00:05:50.969> know<00:05:51.119> one<00:05:52.109> fix<00:05:52.409> to<00:05:52.799> two<00:05:53.219> feet<00:05:53.459> to<00:05:53.669> 33<00:05:54.679> feet

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:55.679 
you know one fix to two feet to 33 feet

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:57.949 
you know one fix to two feet to 33 feet
stew<00:05:55.889> for<00:05:56.159> and<00:05:56.399> the<00:05:56.609> fourth<00:05:56.879> one<00:05:57.089> puts<00:05:57.659> it<00:05:57.779> back

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:57.959 
stew for and the fourth one puts it back

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:02.799 
stew for and the fourth one puts it back
in<00:05:58.019> one's<00:05:58.439> mouth<00:05:59.869> if<00:06:00.869> you<00:06:01.109> like<00:06:01.469> the<00:06:01.649> analogy

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:02.809 
in one's mouth if you like the analogy

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:08.959 
in one's mouth if you like the analogy
it's<00:06:03.809> a<00:06:03.989> giant<00:06:04.349> circle<00:06:04.649> jerk<00:06:05.629> but<00:06:06.629> yeah<00:06:07.969> so

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:08.969 
it's a giant circle jerk but yeah so

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.629 
it's a giant circle jerk but yeah so
let's<00:06:09.239> see<00:06:09.419> here<00:06:09.629> i<00:06:09.659> just<00:06:09.989> noticed<00:06:10.499> something

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
let's see here i just noticed something

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.769 
let's see here i just noticed something
and<00:06:11.639> i'll<00:06:11.789> tell<00:06:11.969> you<00:06:12.029> here<00:06:12.179> in<00:06:12.299> a<00:06:12.329> second<00:06:12.719> you

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:12.779 
and i'll tell you here in a second you

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:17.029 
and i'll tell you here in a second you
probably<00:06:13.109> noticed<00:06:13.379> it<00:06:13.469> too<00:06:15.889> remember<00:06:16.889> how<00:06:17.009> i

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
probably noticed it too remember how i

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:18.679 
probably noticed it too remember how i
said<00:06:17.099> we<00:06:17.369> have<00:06:17.519> to<00:06:17.579> leave<00:06:17.759> that<00:06:17.939> space<00:06:18.209> up<00:06:18.449> for

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:18.689 
said we have to leave that space up for

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:23.389 
said we have to leave that space up for
that<00:06:18.809> block<00:06:19.019> to<00:06:19.169> move<00:06:20.329> yep<00:06:21.329> i<00:06:21.569> forgot<00:06:22.439> i<00:06:22.769> didn't

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:23.399 
that block to move yep i forgot i didn't

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.729 
that block to move yep i forgot i didn't
leave<00:06:23.669> a<00:06:23.699> space<00:06:23.999> in<00:06:24.239> the<00:06:24.269> other<00:06:24.479> corners<00:06:24.899> the

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:25.739 
leave a space in the other corners the

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:27.139 
leave a space in the other corners the
only<00:06:25.919> corner<00:06:26.189> you<00:06:26.279> want<00:06:26.429> to<00:06:26.489> have<00:06:26.609> a<00:06:26.639> block<00:06:26.939> in

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:27.149 
only corner you want to have a block in

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:29.010 
only corner you want to have a block in
is<00:06:27.329> that<00:06:27.509> first<00:06:27.719> one

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
is that first one

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.920 
is that first one
other<00:06:29.410> ones<00:06:29.560> together<00:06:29.650> come<00:06:29.889> out<00:06:30.720> okay<00:06:31.720> let's

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
other ones together come out okay let's

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.749 
other ones together come out okay let's
skip<00:06:32.169> ahead<00:06:32.199> here<00:06:32.440> okay<00:06:33.039> see<00:06:33.099> how<00:06:33.340> there's

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
skip ahead here okay see how there's

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.550 
skip ahead here okay see how there's
only<00:06:33.940> one<00:06:34.360> corner<00:06:34.870> with<00:06:35.020> a<00:06:35.050> block<00:06:35.289> in<00:06:35.470> it

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
only one corner with a block in it

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.369 
only one corner with a block in it
because<00:06:36.340> that's<00:06:36.789> going<00:06:37.030> to<00:06:37.120> move<00:06:37.360> corn<00:06:38.080> plant

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:38.379 
because that's going to move corn plant

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:40.950 
because that's going to move corn plant
now<00:06:39.030> I'll<00:06:40.030> probably<00:06:40.180> hit<00:06:40.389> this<00:06:40.539> here<00:06:40.780> a<00:06:40.810> couple

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
now I'll probably hit this here a couple

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.100 
now I'll probably hit this here a couple
times<00:06:41.139> simulate<00:06:42.069> it<00:06:42.300> okay<00:06:43.300> first<00:06:43.569> one<00:06:43.780> needs

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
times simulate it okay first one needs

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.619 
times simulate it okay first one needs
to<00:06:44.139> the<00:06:44.259> right<00:06:44.440> seg<00:06:44.860> one<00:06:44.889> moves<00:06:45.310> up<00:06:45.490> third<00:06:46.360> one

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:46.629 
to the right seg one moves up third one

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:49.080 
to the right seg one moves up third one
moves<00:06:47.080> to<00:06:47.199> the<00:06:47.289> left<00:06:47.460> fourth<00:06:48.460> one<00:06:48.639> moves<00:06:48.849> back

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
moves to the left fourth one moves back

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.629 
moves to the left fourth one moves back
down<00:06:49.530> okay<00:06:50.530> so<00:06:50.590> let's<00:06:50.830> hit<00:06:51.009> this<00:06:51.099> couple<00:06:51.460> times

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 
down okay so let's hit this couple times

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:56.839 
down okay so let's hit this couple times
in<00:06:52.000> a<00:06:52.270> row<00:06:52.449> to<00:06:53.110> simulate<00:06:53.770> our<00:06:54.690> repeater<00:06:55.690> and

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:56.849 
in a row to simulate our repeater and

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:58.950 
in a row to simulate our repeater and
you<00:06:57.849> see<00:06:58.060> how<00:06:58.180> it<00:06:58.330> goes<00:06:58.449> down<00:06:58.479> the<00:06:58.780> line

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
you see how it goes down the line

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.370 
you see how it goes down the line
they're<00:06:59.169> just<00:06:59.440> like<00:06:59.560> doop<00:07:00.520> doop<00:07:00.789> doop<00:07:01.030> 1<00:07:01.240> to<00:07:01.599> 2

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380 
they're just like doop doop doop 1 to 2

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.480 
they're just like doop doop doop 1 to 2
2<00:07:02.620> to<00:07:03.069> 3<00:07:03.580> and<00:07:04.539> a<00:07:04.690> lot<00:07:04.840> due<00:07:05.020> to<00:07:05.169> deuce<00:07:05.380> but<00:07:05.710> yeah

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
2 to 3 and a lot due to deuce but yeah

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.159 
2 to 3 and a lot due to deuce but yeah
actually<00:07:06.729> that's<00:07:07.060> just<00:07:07.360> it<00:07:07.539> it<00:07:07.569> goes<00:07:07.870> round

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:08.169 
actually that's just it it goes round

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:10.140 
actually that's just it it goes round
and<00:07:08.409> round<00:07:08.440> and<00:07:08.620> round<00:07:08.770> two<00:07:08.979> goes<00:07:09.120> where<00:07:10.120> I

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
and round and round two goes where I

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.029 
and round and round two goes where I
stop<00:07:10.389> nobody<00:07:10.599> knows<00:07:10.810> but<00:07:11.470> I<00:07:11.530> don't<00:07:11.949> recommend

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 
stop nobody knows but I don't recommend

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:13.980 
stop nobody knows but I don't recommend
doing<00:07:12.430> this<00:07:12.550> over<00:07:12.819> like<00:07:13.090> five<00:07:13.360> or<00:07:13.539> six<00:07:13.659> blocks

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
doing this over like five or six blocks

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.939 
doing this over like five or six blocks
because<00:07:15.030> they<00:07:16.030> tend<00:07:16.210> not<00:07:16.300> to<00:07:16.509> move<00:07:16.690> lag<00:07:17.530> or

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:17.949 
because they tend not to move lag or

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:22.320 
because they tend not to move lag or
glitch<00:07:18.310> out<00:07:18.550> sometimes<00:07:19.150> they<00:07:19.300> do<00:07:19.770> but<00:07:21.330> you

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.330 
glitch out sometimes they do but you

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.930 
glitch out sometimes they do but you
know<00:07:22.419> what<00:07:22.479> you'll<00:07:22.719> do<00:07:22.840> is<00:07:22.990> you'll<00:07:23.020> just<00:07:23.940> right

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:24.940 
know what you'll do is you'll just right

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.529 
know what you'll do is you'll just right
over<00:07:24.969> here<00:07:25.330> apply<00:07:25.810> a<00:07:26.370> repeater<00:07:27.370> I<00:07:27.669> do<00:07:28.090> not

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:28.539 
over here apply a repeater I do not

core regular repeater circuit just don't
use<00:07:39.159> a<00:07:39.190> randomizer<00:07:39.759> because<00:07:40.060> they<00:07:40.300> tend<00:07:40.659> to

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:40.810 
use a randomizer because they tend to

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.350 
use a randomizer because they tend to
screw<00:07:41.139> up<00:07:41.199> things<00:07:41.830> like<00:07:42.009> this<00:07:42.190> but<00:07:42.430> if<00:07:43.270> you
