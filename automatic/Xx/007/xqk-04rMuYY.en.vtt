what's<00:00:00.900> up<00:00:01.079> guys<00:00:01.319> so<00:00:01.770> I<00:00:01.979> don't<00:00:02.220> know<00:00:02.310> about<00:00:02.429> you

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
what's up guys so I don't know about you

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.820 
what's up guys so I don't know about you
but<00:00:02.939> I<00:00:03.149> like<00:00:03.419> seeing<00:00:03.689> my<00:00:03.810> phone<00:00:04.110> above<00:00:04.440> 50%

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
but I like seeing my phone above 50%

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.070 
but I like seeing my phone above 50%
charge<00:00:05.490> but<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.180> don't<00:00:06.390> like<00:00:06.540> plugging<00:00:06.839> my

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
charge but I don't like plugging my

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.320 
charge but I don't like plugging my
phone<00:00:07.319> in<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.740> out<00:00:07.799> all<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.069> time<00:00:08.220> nor<00:00:09.059> do<00:00:09.300> I

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
phone in and out all the time nor do I

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.030 
phone in and out all the time nor do I
like<00:00:09.540> spending<00:00:09.809> money<00:00:10.050> on<00:00:10.349> things<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.800> can

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.440 

spec's<00:01:08.530> why's<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:09.130> PCB<00:01:09.579> a<00:01:09.609> takes<00:01:10.030> in<00:01:10.210> five

volts<00:01:12.850> at<00:01:12.999> one<00:01:13.179> amp<00:01:13.390> so<00:01:13.810> you<00:01:14.200> need<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.469> plug

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
volts at one amp so you need to plug

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.219 
volts at one amp so you need to plug
this<00:01:14.859> into<00:01:15.069> a<00:01:15.159> 2<00:01:15.460> amp<00:01:15.640> wall<00:01:15.939> adapter<00:01:16.420> with<00:01:17.049> this

one<00:01:17.500> it'll<00:01:17.829> charge<00:01:18.130> faster<00:01:18.729> but<00:01:18.909> with<00:01:19.030> this

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
one it'll charge faster but with this

one<00:01:19.359> slower<00:01:19.990> it'll<00:01:20.590> still<00:01:20.829> work<00:01:20.859> though<00:01:21.219> the

just<00:01:24.429> take<00:01:24.640> two<00:01:24.880> pieces<00:01:25.119> of<00:01:25.390> scrap<00:01:25.569> wood<00:01:25.689> and

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
just take two pieces of scrap wood and

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.749 
just take two pieces of scrap wood and
hot<00:01:26.289> glue<00:01:26.469> them<00:01:26.619> together<00:01:26.829> at<00:01:27.250> an<00:01:27.369> angle

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
hot glue them together at an angle

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.520

generous<00:01:32.049> on<00:01:32.170> hot<00:01:32.349> glue<00:01:32.590> I<00:01:32.890> added<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.759> little

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
generous on hot glue I added a little

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.520 
generous on hot glue I added a little
wooden<00:01:34.270> barrier<00:01:34.659> so<00:01:34.810> my<00:01:34.959> phone<00:01:35.170> would<00:01:35.349> never

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
wooden barrier so my phone would never

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.339 
wooden barrier so my phone would never
slip<00:01:35.859> off<00:01:36.039> from<00:01:36.369> its<00:01:36.520> optimum<00:01:36.939> position<00:01:37.479> after
