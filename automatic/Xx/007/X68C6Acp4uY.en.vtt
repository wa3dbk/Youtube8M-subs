draw<00:01:07.960> these<00:01:08.170> straight<00:01:08.649> up<00:01:08.890> until<00:01:09.430> they

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
draw these straight up until they

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.770 
draw these straight up until they
actually<00:01:10.990> match<00:01:11.530> up<00:01:11.829> with<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.130> little<00:01:12.780> tail

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
so I'm keeping these these fears rather

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.580 
so I'm keeping these these fears rather
small<00:01:41.880> when<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.869> bring<00:01:43.049> them<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.350> make<00:01:43.500> sure

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
small when I bring them in to make sure

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
the connection goes just underneath this

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.310 
the connection goes just underneath this
piece<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.520> armor<00:01:47.789> and<00:01:47.970> then<00:01:48.509> I'll<00:01:48.630> hit<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.899> to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
piece of armor and then I'll hit a to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.529 
piece of armor and then I'll hit a to
preview<00:01:49.619> my<00:01:49.740> adaptive<00:01:50.159> skin<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.670> I've<00:01:51.270> got<00:01:51.509> a

preview my adaptive skin and I've got a

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.749 
preview my adaptive skin and I've got a
little<00:01:51.750> strap<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.220> each<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.610> other

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
little strap just like each of the other

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.580 
little strap just like each of the other
times<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.360> I've<00:01:54.450> used<00:01:54.659> these<00:01:54.899> fears<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.470> this

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
times that I've used these fears in this

adaptive<00:01:57.869> skin<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.440> this<00:01:59.039> will<00:01:59.190> turn<00:01:59.430> this

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
adaptive skin and this will turn this

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.149 
adaptive skin and this will turn this
into<00:01:59.909> an<00:02:00.179> actual<00:02:00.360> strap<00:02:00.990> which<00:02:01.470> i<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:01.830> append

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
into an actual strap which i can append
