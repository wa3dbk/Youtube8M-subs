00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.779
 People today I do something I do 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:09.490
 quite normal, do not do that 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.830
 Although a technique test of the canon 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.480
 legria mix that does not have the background 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.550
 That she would get some money for that would be nice 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.170
 unfortunately not, but I have with me 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.600
 the purchase decision of this camera very much 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.789
 very hard because videos are online 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.530
 so on youtube exist mostly 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.340
 just unboxing with a bit of a show 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.869
 luck are still a few test shots 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.640
 but this mostly behind 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.260
 really perfect ideal conditions 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.810
 that means no wind 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.160
 sunshine the natural conditions 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.870
 good at every camera 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.850
 But taking pictures is natural 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.410
 especially the difficult conditions in 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.970
 a camera can really shine 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.739
 and that's why I'm in favor 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.239
 I decided to shoot the video 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.850
 so desperately looking for youtube 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.290
 a really tough test of this 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.980
 Camera will be at the whole 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.870
 low light conditions 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.760
 try it and get really strong 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.809
 Wind I'm looking forward to the recordings 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.520
 but I think he preferred the 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.930
 Shots from this camera seen as 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.190
 I've been watching it all the time 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.920
 that's why I'm going to do that now too 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.969
 times do and I am even 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.710
 totally curious how the recordings will be 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.789
 I do not even have the camera in 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.470
 company I hope that 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.299
 works so i have it before 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.040
 language set so not only then 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.530
 let's say you can get up here like this 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.940
 beautiful rumschlatten can see itself because 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.360
 he himself tries to access system 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.440
 look 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.720
 I think that's pretty much right now 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.890
 look stupid because a whole time out 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.479
 Of course, this group was totally too 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.590
 it will be interesting to watch the video clips 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.909
 is not very bright this room 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.409
 the lamps do not make that much light 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.570
 and there's a little bit going on outside 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.770
 not tight rows of day but in itself 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.960
 It is already relatively dark here 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.060
 'd like to see if I say I would 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.380
 against so much picture noise 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.820
 is there only times not so 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.299
 you say I'll go down in the 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.350
 basement, cellar 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.820
 there is definitely one more 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.020
 I'm curious 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.409
 it looks like I'm in the elevator 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.509
 case you light up the under 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.670
 I go out and here is already relative 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.659
 immune but that is true then interpret 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.950
 it is also our child but 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.420
 of course results in installation 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.420
 Now I am going to my childhood illness 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.189
 which may be even darker up here 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.770
 is this little emergency light that 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.569
 product light seen no 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.250
 emergency exit is otherwise it is really 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.629
 completely conscious as you can see 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.280
 By the way, the Kellergang by the 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.510
 hijacked shoot the video if 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.160
 you saw it as said that 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.560
 only light here in the whole 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.250
 The cellar door is from this emergency exit 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.690
 light up here 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.870
 you just could not even do that 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.250
 a little bit lighter but also with yellow 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.260
 Stiche I showed you the whole then 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.640
 Also out there on the street 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.470
 of course something more realistic 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.299
 Conditions are usually one becomes 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.120
 yes, not in a cellar without light 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.410
 it is rare to turn on 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.930
 So I'll take you out with new ones 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.540
 the street as soon as it is really dark 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.280
 is there so dear people meanwhile 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.780
 it has become dark outside that is 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.829
 it is not completely dark you can see 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.849
 the sky still needs to be clear 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.290
 that's just because now 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.019
 just the longest night of the year 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.730
 today 23:00 but I thought 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.329
 now slowly go out makes 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.530
 I do not think so much either 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.780
 You can see a difference as well 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.190
 I find the picture a bit noisy 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.540
 a bit too bad but you recognize 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.060
 Still, if I am right now 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.680
 standing under the light that is possible 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.060
 fairly 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.859
 so much on the subject image quality he sees 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.810
 So like that in low light and low 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.000
 light conditions works now 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.829
 one fixed times but the tone again at 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.030
 Wind works that's why I want 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.889
 say we're catching somewhere 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.669
 where there is so much wind we drive 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.280
 times to the sea 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:19.200
 Hey, you guys are like you see I am 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.609
 but now more than useful broke 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.290
 is not as important as I hoped 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.669
 there was almost no wind at all 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.900
 we may see my cock here 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.069
 that's probably why I have to 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.690
 a little bit different from that too now 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.489
 come with altmann as a microphone 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.720
 right in the winter I do not know if I 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.099
 at home again 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.780
 I 'll do it at home, though 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.709
 a little more extreme test 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.419
 subject 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.099
 be curious but now where I already 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.569
 time here is number one water 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.750
 and show you a little something from 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.750
 the city 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.720
 after what he did with him 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.460
 I now understand quite well in mine 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.430
 bathroom or rather in my 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.630
 wind test channel and I will do the whole thing 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.550
 now just with my former 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.470
 test and watch under which 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.060
 wind conditions that absorbs me 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.020
 I put on headphones that the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.800
 headphones are then the camera 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.110
 affiliated 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.120
 that means I can hear what 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.980
 you hear we wish I want it again 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.150
 my will be hard we can see this 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.150
 women so 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.090
 understand me right 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.090
 it will 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.310
 ending 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.599
 but from the beginning is then no more 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.159
 so much with the audiomaterial 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.199
 In any case you have to start if 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.550
 it really storms right then that is 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.229
 Camera but relatively quickly to her 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.939
 However, you have to limit it 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.710
 Of course , one can also say one 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:54.360
 connect external micro and if that 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.740
 a windbreak has you can 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.870
 possibly even in stronger winds 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.729
 still good recordings get so 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.529
 many small extreme test the canon 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.819
 legria magix I think I do not have to 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.620
 More too much to say I think so 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.999
 that even seen and heard under 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.529
 which conditions the camera is 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.150
 no longer satisfactory recordings 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.919
 This will deliver you under normal conditions 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.629
 really baptize very well 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.219
 delivers and the sound really good 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:14.969
 Sounds like I think he sees and hears 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.169
 just now 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:17.909
 and there are also in the whole 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.830
 I wanted to hear other test videos 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.120
 just show you where the limits of this 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.169
 Camera lie, I think that is relative 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.879
 become clear 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.409
 in a very stormy dark night 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.310
 you should not the camera maybe 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.599
 be sure to unpack 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.580
 at least you can then just really 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.779
 expect no more optimal results 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.949
 what i do this week i use this 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.839
 Camera already noticed 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.639
 I am that she is very well suited 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:37.529
 to take photos on parties where bigger 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.120
 get together and then really 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:40.740
 Everyone wants to get a picture 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.719
 live now with the camera 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.099
 self-timer so you have to provide 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.509
 sees the law next to me 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.680
 a few more people fit in there 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.089
 You can also make larger groups easy 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.949
 take pictures from your hand 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:51.779
 that is very convenient i hope you 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.000
 has this little review a bit 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:55.409
 helped if so, then you more 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.270
 can show with the little German 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.979
 and otherwise I hope 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.449
 We'll meet again someday 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.449
 Nice shots from this camera
