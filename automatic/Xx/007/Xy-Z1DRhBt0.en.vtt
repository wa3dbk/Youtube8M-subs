00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.150 
Square act right and then when you click
down<00:00:31.309> these<00:00:32.309> get<00:00:32.850> take<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.829> which<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.980> right

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
down these get take this which is right

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.660 
down these get take this which is right
here<00:00:35.190> that's<00:00:35.969> like<00:00:36.239> circuit<00:00:36.719> board<00:00:36.930> thing

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
here that's like circuit board thing

charity<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.760> my<00:00:38.850> controller<00:00:39.620> this<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.860> PS

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
charity on my controller this is PS

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.830 
charity on my controller this is PS
button<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:42.120> even<00:00:42.540> comes<00:00:42.750> off<00:00:42.989> say<00:00:44.570> so<00:00:45.570> that

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
button is even comes off say so that

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:55.250 
button is even comes off say so that
really<00:00:46.530> isn't<00:00:46.800> even<00:00:47.190> melted<00:00:47.370> plastic<00:00:51.469> on<00:00:54.260> my

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
bro but this is the r2 came out as you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.100 
bro but this is the r2 came out as you
can<00:01:00.780> tell<00:01:02.600> that's<00:01:03.600> our<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:05.270> these<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.479> analog

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
can tell that's our to these are analog

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.420 
can tell that's our to these are analog
sticks<00:01:07.790> these<00:01:08.790> go<00:01:09.119> into<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:10.260> know<00:01:13.430> they

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
sticks these go into this you know they

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.899 
sticks these go into this you know they
go<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:15.049> too<00:01:16.049> long<00:01:16.939> this<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.020> know<00:01:19.670> if<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.790> can

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
go on too long this as you know if I can

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:31.819 
go on too long this as you know if I can
get<00:01:21.030> them<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.479> time<00:01:30.320> almost<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.650> off

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
get them on this time almost but off

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.390 
get them on this time almost but off
step<00:01:32.790> more<00:01:33.000> difficult<00:01:33.570> least<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.960> seems<00:01:34.400> these

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
are the this like I said analog again

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.960 
are the this like I said analog again
just<00:01:39.720> go<00:01:39.930> around<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.590> show<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.040> press

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
just go around like that show you press

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
when you hit that it goes down and it

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.259 
when you hit that it goes down and it
hits<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.560> one<00:02:58.920> thing<00:02:59.310> it's<00:02:59.519> a<00:02:59.640> green<00:03:00.030> thing

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
hits this one thing it's a green thing
