00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello all these months I will be 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.150
 making videos dedicated to dragon ball 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.400
 z before the new one is released 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.530
 movie to the resurrection of frizer in 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.599
 April of this year today I will talk about the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.370
 origin of the creation of carles good 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.350
 there they went years ago after seeing the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.330
 movie of the super battle I discovered 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.430
 that apart from seeing doc and goten there was another 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.500
 be identical to goku so I started to 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.420
 research online to see if 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.310
 I found some information about the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.410
 kinship of giving them to goku and 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.720
 I discovered two theories the first one 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.669
 give them was a clone of goku and the second 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.340
 that was his twin brother at that time 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.260
 discard the second theory since according to 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.480
 radix he was the only brother he had 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.210
 so nothing started to believe that in 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.460
 actually it was the clone of goku but 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.500
 even so it is not possible that it is a clone of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.420
 good goku there is the explanation 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.129
 give them is a Sayayin warrior and 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.590
 formerly frizer minion 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.539
 curiosity that I did not know that moment was 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.090
 supposed to give it escaped the planet 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.430
 nice because I was on a mission almost 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.890
 30 years after the destruction of 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.019
 planet bellita carles together with his 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.090
 minions made their way to the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.900
 land to verify the existence of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.940
 zaidÃ­n 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.790
 it's about better known broken poop 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.680
 as goku the age of giving them is unknown 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.780
 although it seems to be the same age as 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.760
 Goku is older since he abandoned 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.670
 freezer long before the birth of 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.350
 poop broken good then this moment it 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.570
 discard the two theories before 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.640
 mentioned happened a few years later 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.980
 reading several interviews with akira 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.530
 toriyama I finally discovered that truth that 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.210
 they were both looking for the interview 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.040
 that many dragonball fans that after 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.110
 discover that goku was a sayayin 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.690
 sent to earth to exterminate the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.670
 humanity and that shortly after forget 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.619
 that mission because of a coup in the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.300
 head so they asked toriyama 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.950
 why not create a future 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.140
 alternative as goku arrived and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.300
 exterminate the human race but instead 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.160
 of that toriyama decided to please his 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.500
 fans in another way and was creating a 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.570
 sayayin with dark skin identical to goku 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.340
 but this time in an evil version of 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.979
 how would it have been boku if you never 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.650
 I would have hit my head and in that way 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.870
 was born carles now well in the 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.050
 curiosities of carles 6 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.710
 in dragon ball z budokai tenkaichi 2 he 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.600
 has the brightest hairstyle 5 according to one 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.030
 Japanese magazine in which the 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.220
 Goku carles family tree is your 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.530
 twin brother a consecutive error in 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.890
 different magazines since both are not 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.720
 family 4 the layer that has give them is 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.470
 identical to piccolo because of its 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.450
 3 shoulder pads when creating the artificial moon 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.670
 so that bojan would become nozar 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.040
 he does not transform even though the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.050
 saw himself said during the movie 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.350
 that the moon that he created has few waves 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.510
 blood to transform him 2 the 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.950
 aspect of giving them is not just identical to 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.080
 from goku there is also a slight 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.850
 comparison with the appearance of bardot more 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.270
 similar to the latter for being a 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.730
 murderer 1 his name means lettuce 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.010
 well as goku means carrot or 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.380
 broli is broccoli just to name a few 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.660
 examples well this was all for the 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.430
 moment of German and is up comments 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.260
