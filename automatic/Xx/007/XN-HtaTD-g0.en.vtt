 j 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.459
 I really respect each other's struggle for 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.979
 get here and I see it in you 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:28.110
 clearly this faith this trust and 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:31.080
 And you have a way of singing with the 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.300
 like this, you know I like it 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.470
 much of his voice congratulations brigade 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.540
 stimulate was even commenting with me 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.520
 I'll suggest for her to sing a song. 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.870
 of you you should perhaps when the 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.270
 Sir, I would like to see you sung. 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.030
 naughty boy again 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:52.229
 I think the way to tie it is very good. 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.520
 and comes to just have prevented you 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.530
 imagine that I'll be able to avoid 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.910
 never but I think you 'd stay and 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.250
 singer in search of you have a 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.460
 stage presence we've all talked 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.610
 This is great but I still think 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.770
 it was not the right song choice 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.720
 look for me will go in that alcione 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:16.050
 You'll burst but it will look beautiful. 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:18.660
 Maybe Franciele, I thought this 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.729
 music has arrested you a little, you know 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.130
 it seemed like you wanted to put the voice 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.900
 out to release the voice and not 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.870
 I left because this song demands a 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.240
 interpretation and I saw that 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.800
 You were holding on too much then me. 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.139
 I think music was not a choice 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.419
 good for you is nothing against music 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.840
 Wonderful song but you were not there. 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:42.330
 a good choice is I thought you had 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.729
 you have such a good attitude you have 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.919
 something so different in you and me 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.680
 I'm sure that at some point this 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:52.680
 will appear with everything then have classes of 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.750
 Sing has technique because you 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.729
 Has everyone got to see this in you? 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.440
 because you are different 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.440
 Congratulations and registered 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:10.440
 my dear fans and Ana, I venture into 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:13.710
 say that in terms of attitude above 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:18.930
 of the stage in terms of stage presence 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:21.419
 You've been a star since the beginning. 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.060
 just like that I rarely heard 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.729
 a dog of a candidate with the attitude of 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.560
 stage with so even with a certain is the 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.259
 arrogance of good on stage 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.240
 In this sense you are already a star 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:36.000
 What happens is I am especially 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.550
 rigorous in terms of tuning and 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.300
 terms of tuning you really do not 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.370
 it went well 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.340
 You did not find the tone of this song. 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.770
 you in terms of tuning if you have 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.090
 skating on that song and something that 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.180
 You have to understand the following. 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.280
 some people have the weird voice 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.770
 at the time of singing the boy buarque so 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.750
 the case was so the case is a guy who is 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.759
 tongue trapped but so they do not 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.220
 have given up a business that is 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:04.919
 fundamental that tuning without making 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.889
 singing class for you to create this 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:11.729
 natural statement and you understood nothing 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:15.449
 the next one has to find a way 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:19.470
 search the music more you in my 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:23.099
 opinion is what he said on stage 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:26.159
 no one wins two and not his way 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:29.310
 you sing to express yourself 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:31.699
 if you said I do not see things 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:36.360
 I saw you sang well I found 

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:41.520
 wonder does not change just because 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:46.229
 they khalifa is a head only the uncle regis 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:49.199
 think they speak this index not imagine 

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:51.360
 Of course not I am the first to 

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:53.070
 disagreeing my dear to the game is not even the 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.720
 first to disagree that they think 

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:58.520
 completely different and only so much 

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.520
 nonsense it is possible to respect 

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.180
 op
