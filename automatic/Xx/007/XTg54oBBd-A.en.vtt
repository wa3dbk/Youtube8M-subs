00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
squishy that comes with the bar and I

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.380 
squishy that comes with the bar and I
wouldn't<00:01:44.100> recommend<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.090> honest<00:01:45.329> cause

wouldn't recommend it to be honest cause

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.179 
wouldn't recommend it to be honest cause
I<00:01:45.720> put<00:01:46.140> one<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.439> customers<00:01:46.799> about<00:01:46.920> an

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
I put one on the customers about an

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.030 
I put one on the customers about an
opt-in<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.840> only<00:01:49.020> scuff<00:01:49.259> she<00:01:49.439> did<00:01:49.740> start

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
opt-in and the only scuff she did start

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.389 
opt-in and the only scuff she did start
to<00:01:50.220> crack<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.509> probably<00:01:52.200> more<00:01:52.439> hassle

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
to crack so I probably more hassle

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:01.340 
to crack so I probably more hassle
taking<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.880> off<00:01:55.280> next<00:01:56.280> one<00:01:56.689> is<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.750> next<00:01:58.200> one<00:02:00.350> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
taking it off next one is a next one and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.319 
taking it off next one is a next one and
this<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:01.770> again<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.040> lovely<00:02:02.610> clean<00:02:02.880> looking

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329

back and equally as nice six proof I

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.880 
back and equally as nice six proof I
think<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> only<00:02:07.020> thing<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.320> was<00:02:07.530> holding<00:02:07.560> me

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
think the only thing that was holding me

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.059 
think the only thing that was holding me
back<00:02:08.099> was<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:09.030> little<00:02:09.119> blemish<00:02:09.720> up<00:02:10.440> there<00:02:10.770> with

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
us not really significant and it's not

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.030
