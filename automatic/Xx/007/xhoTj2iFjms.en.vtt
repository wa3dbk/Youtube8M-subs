you know watch collectors but there's a

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.140 
you know watch collectors but there's a
definitely<00:04:31.100> problem<00:04:31.490> this<00:04:31.610> strap<00:04:31.880> I<00:04:32.030> would

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
definitely problem this strap I would

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.390 
definitely problem this strap I would
fit<00:04:32.330> this<00:04:32.479> to<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.690> regular<00:04:33.680> black<00:04:34.010> leather

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
this one at forty four so we're going to

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:25.900 
this one at forty four so we're going to
give<00:05:24.380> it<00:05:24.470> a<00:05:24.530> minute<00:05:24.710> or<00:05:24.860> two<00:05:25.039> under<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.340> lamp

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
give it a minute or two under the lamp

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:34.659 
give it a minute or two under the lamp
and<00:05:26.120> we'll<00:05:26.240> take<00:05:26.389> a<00:05:26.419> look<00:05:26.600> at<00:05:26.720> the<00:05:26.840> Loom<00:05:33.669> okay

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
and we'll take a look at the Loom okay

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.120 
and we'll take a look at the Loom okay
so<00:05:34.729> after<00:05:35.000> a<00:05:35.150> full<00:05:35.450> minute<00:05:35.780> under<00:05:36.139> the<00:05:36.680> halogen

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
so after a full minute under the halogen

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.820 
so after a full minute under the halogen
lamp<00:05:37.340> this<00:05:37.880> is<00:05:38.000> about<00:05:38.180> what<00:05:38.330> you'll<00:05:38.479> see

your wrist on the still of your car and

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.980 
your wrist on the still of your car and
it<00:06:01.669> will<00:06:01.789> charge<00:06:02.000> up<00:06:02.240> in<00:06:02.360> the<00:06:02.479> Sun<00:06:02.660> and<00:06:02.840> that's

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
it will charge up in the Sun and that's

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.260 
it will charge up in the Sun and that's
about<00:06:03.080> what<00:06:03.289> you<00:06:03.380> can<00:06:03.530> expect<00:06:03.970> not<00:06:04.970> with<00:06:05.150> it

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
about what you can expect not with it

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.610 
about what you can expect not with it
not<00:06:05.389> being<00:06:05.630> a<00:06:05.720> dive<00:06:05.930> watch<00:06:06.139> I<00:06:06.289> definitely

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
not being a dive watch I definitely

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.750 
not being a dive watch I definitely
think<00:06:06.770> it<00:06:06.860> could<00:06:06.979> have<00:06:07.070> been<00:06:07.099> better<00:06:07.340> but<00:06:07.610> this

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
think it could have been better but this

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.040 
think it could have been better but this
would<00:06:07.880> live<00:06:08.030> up<00:06:08.150> to<00:06:08.210> pretty<00:06:08.419> much<00:06:08.570> any<00:06:08.780> of<00:06:08.930> its

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
would live up to pretty much any of its

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.360 
would live up to pretty much any of its
peers<00:06:09.380> it's<00:06:09.560> just<00:06:09.710> not<00:06:09.830> going<00:06:09.979> to<00:06:10.039> set<00:06:10.190> any

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370

of 44 millimeters across I suppose you

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.210 
of 44 millimeters across I suppose you
could<00:07:01.730> call<00:07:01.940> this<00:07:02.200> ring<00:07:03.200> here<00:07:03.500> a<00:07:03.530> bezel<00:07:04.040> but

there's almost no bezel to speak of it's

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.650 
there's almost no bezel to speak of it's

and<00:07:08.840> on<00:07:09.260> top<00:07:09.470> of<00:07:09.620> that<00:07:09.740> you'll<00:07:09.980> see<00:07:10.190> the<00:07:10.310> effect

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 
and on top of that you'll see the effect

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:14.680 
and on top of that you'll see the effect

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
of the sapphire crystal here so the

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.350 
of the sapphire crystal here so the
Seiko<00:07:14.990> is<00:07:15.110> not<00:07:15.290> sapphire<00:07:15.830> it's<00:07:15.980> hard<00:07:16.220> Lex<00:07:16.490> but

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 
Seiko is not sapphire it's hard Lex but

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.520 
Seiko is not sapphire it's hard Lex but
you'll<00:07:17.480> see<00:07:17.660> that<00:07:17.840> it<00:07:18.080> doesn't<00:07:18.230> pick<00:07:18.500> up

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
you'll see that it doesn't pick up

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.860 
you'll see that it doesn't pick up
anywhere<00:07:19.070> near<00:07:19.340> as<00:07:19.490> much<00:07:19.669> of<00:07:19.820> the<00:07:20.000> light

that's bouncing around in this space you

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.990 
that's bouncing around in this space you
can<00:07:23.720> see<00:07:23.900> the<00:07:24.260> ceiling<00:07:24.740> and<00:07:25.100> walls<00:07:25.400> in<00:07:25.850> the

can see the ceiling and walls in the

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.880 
can see the ceiling and walls in the

and the Seiko of course is a flat
crystal<00:07:30.910> flatness<00:07:31.910> would<00:07:32.060> have<00:07:32.150> made<00:07:32.270> the

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:32.390 
crystal flatness would have made the

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.670 
crystal flatness would have made the
biggest<00:07:32.510> difference<00:07:32.810> they<00:07:33.140> could<00:07:33.260> also<00:07:33.380> put

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 
biggest difference they could also put

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.980 
biggest difference they could also put
on<00:07:33.800> a<00:07:33.830> couple<00:07:34.130> coatings<00:07:34.550> of<00:07:34.669> AR<00:07:34.970> and<00:07:35.270> use<00:07:35.810> an

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:35.990 
on a couple coatings of AR and use an

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.140 
on a couple coatings of AR and use an
even<00:07:36.320> higher<00:07:36.800> grade<00:07:37.190> sapphire<00:07:37.880> if<00:07:38.030> they

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.150 
even higher grade sapphire if they

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.240 
even higher grade sapphire if they
wanted<00:07:38.479> it<00:07:38.990> would<00:07:39.290> bump<00:07:39.440> up<00:07:39.620> the<00:07:39.740> price<00:07:39.950> but<00:07:40.130> in

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.250 
wanted it would bump up the price but in

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.040 
wanted it would bump up the price but in
my<00:07:40.370> opinion<00:07:40.460> would<00:07:40.970> take<00:07:41.419> this<00:07:41.570> from<00:07:41.780> being<00:07:41.960> a

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.050 
my opinion would take this from being a

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.920
