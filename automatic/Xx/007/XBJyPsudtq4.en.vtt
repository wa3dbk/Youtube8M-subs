DUAL SIM SWITCHER FOR IPHONE 4
REVIEW by Baly23

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That's the switch, it supports 1 MicroSIM and 1 MiniSIM. Avaiable also in TRI-SIM version (1 Micro + 2 Mini).

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That's the black back cover. Note the space for the adaptor. I added the velcro, not inlcuded in the package.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Insert the smaller part of the circuit in the MicroSIM slot.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Put the primary SIM on it.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Insert carefully the slot in the iPhone.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Turn your phone face-down and eventually use an adaptor MicroSIM-&gt;MiniSIM.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Put the secondary SIM in it.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Use the cover to protect your adaptor and your phone.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
WIND is my primary operator.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Settings &gt; Phone &gt; SIM Applications &gt; Switch Number &gt; SIM2.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
&lt;NO SIM INSTALLED&gt;

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
3ITA is my secondary operator.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Auto/SW is for AutoSwitch SIM. It change the number automatically when the signal is low.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Very good design, like rubber at touch. Easy to put in silent mode, bit difficoult press the volume keys.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Easy access for 3.5mm jack and power button.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Connect to quite every dock and with any cable. Speaker and microphone free from cover.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Camera and flash are perfectly usable.
