00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.869
 ah 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.259
 i 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.990
 are very well in this tutorial I'm going 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:27.020
 to teach how to make some and skirts or to 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.829
 the Christmas that we are going to use are the 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.829
 Waistline 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.080
 in contour of hips 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.210
 the length of the skirt that is taken from 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.719
 the waist to the length that we want 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.449
 up to the ankle or until the long where 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:50.989
 you want additional so that 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.989
 want to make a side of the waist 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.129
 we can get down to work 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.949
 we make a rectangle that has the long 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.390
 desired of the skirt and of width half 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.390
 of the contour of hips 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.350
 at this point we increase it from 10 to 15 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.270
 centimeters that depends on the width that 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.030
 we want the skirt 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.100
 here we increase the width up 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.310
 that has the elastic that we are going to 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.310
 put 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.700
 and here we go down one or two centimeters to 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.700
 hem 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.780
 now we mark the measure from here 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.690
 optional that we take for the opening the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.430
 can do on both sides we mark 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.200
 waist side hem plastic 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.350
 cost front and back because this 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.560
 mold serves for both sides cut two 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.259
 times in cloth 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.840
 and what about the fabric and we add a 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.840
 inch of eyelash on each side 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.510
 we cut 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.840
 I 'm going to do it on this canvas 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.060
 cotton here and now I have cut already 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.370
 they know that the same mold is for the 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.100
 front and back we close the 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.860
 costs up to the mark that we left for 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.680
 the fillet opening mash the waist and 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.950
 we make a channel to pass the elastic 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.070
 we pass him sewing but we leave them a 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.610
 space without sewing as two fingers 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.770
 wide here already cooked it this is the 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.660
 space that I left to introduce the 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.940
 elastic 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.670
 with the help of a nurse what 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.120
 we introduce into the channel until we get it out 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.430
 on the other hand I do not tell you what measure 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.400
 they should put the elastic because that varies 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.800
 according to its quality and the width of 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.080
 our waist should only be sure 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.400
 that will not be too tight or 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.630
 very loose 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.990
 we sew the elastic here 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.460
 now we do a seam to fix 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.980
 the elastic 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.210
 this position must be done by stretching the 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.210
 fabric like this 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.410
 I help myself with pins to facilitate 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:34.000
 sewing 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.000
 we do hem 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.280
 and we know the openings 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:47.430
 once cooked we do a final 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.430
 where the opening begins 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.270
 and ready 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.770
 so they can see how it is 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.850
 I hope you have them 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.190
 tutorial you already know that the explanation the 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.889
 you can find written on my blog
