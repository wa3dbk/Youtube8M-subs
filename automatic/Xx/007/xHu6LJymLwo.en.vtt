 with a new resolution at 1080p 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.010
 aesthetically nothing has changed 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.779
 yes it has changed the menus with which 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.489

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.559

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.140
 computers through sharing in 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.030

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.680
 We will have a series of applications 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.449
 third parties in this case to access 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.460

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.300
 to activate the air play as we remember 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.280
 the air play will allow us to see the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.440
 content of iphone ipad ipod touch 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.360
 also from itunes without needing 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.430
 cables simply by activating this 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.170
 function in the device as you see in 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.300
 the example on the ipad we will have to 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.970
 activate it and activating it we will have 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.770
 Also if it's ipad2 or iphone 4s the 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.420
 airplay mirroring that not only will we 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.910
 allow to move wirelessly 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.350
 photos and also video but we 're going to 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.240

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.540
 television everything we are doing 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.950
 in this case on the ipad screen 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.050
 let's see how this also goes to 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.060
 allow a lot of play because with the new 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.550

 we can play movies with all the 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.610
 quality as well as of course the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.660
 best games and the best 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.660
 appstore apps 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.130
 in the option of computers we will have the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.020
 share at home when selecting it we 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.240
 will allow access to libraries 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.850
 of itunes from different computers like 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.530
 We'll see inside the moment if we go 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.270
 to the movies section we will enter 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.190
 the great catalog that is itunes in the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.869
 movie section where we can 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.119
 Buy and rent the best movies 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.649
 premieres of the best classics 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.959
 each movie we will have a complete 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.430
 tab of the movie that even goes 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.409
 to allow to see a trailer 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.040
 This trailer of course we will have to 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.040
 high quality 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.730
 in the music section we will have 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.349
 we have said itunes match that if we have 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.790

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.130
 music in the cloud and also available 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.720
 on the apple tv and as we said to the 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.420
 access computers where we will have 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.069

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.650

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.239
 we can access wirelessly either 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.920
 to our music also to our 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.900
 movies of course even now 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.900
 also to make genius mixes 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.790
 in the movies we will also be able to 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.709
 retransmit via wifi all the 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.190
 movies that we already have to any 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.190
 resolution 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.890
 this is very useful for example to see 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.329
 high definition movies like 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.329

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.480
 Y 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.690
 another of the novelties is that we are going to 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.130
 can access the photo string these are 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.840

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.790
 of the cloud by means of the photos in 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.950
 streaming that we will be able to perform 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.750
 slide passes with them or 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.210
 directly visualize them in our 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.920
 television through the apple tv here in 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.690
 setting slideshow as 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.730

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.900
 of our television screen 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.760
 we will also have access as we say 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.230
 applications of the most services 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.690
 popular video content in 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.590
 internet like for example youtube 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.990
 we also have access to our 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.890
 podcast and to different channels as per 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.890
 example email 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.130
 the appletv becomes a complement 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.220
 perfect for our television the 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.220
 living room 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.750

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:38.409
 OK 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:43.019
 when they have distinguished dave comunication 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:43.019
 It is practical to be possible 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.770
 in this way and space and off 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.680
