00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.139
 Hello everyone, hi-tech mail.ru and I 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.000
 Daniel Golovin robots come 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.769
 another came into our hands 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.550
 class representative home 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.260
 robotics vacuum cleaners irobot rumba 880 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.939
 it has several new ones implemented 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.050
 technologies that are supposed to 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.230
 improve the quality of cleaning we will test 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.359
 880 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.730
 find out how well he collects 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.949
 garbage of different surfaces what at the same time 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.710
 having problems is he comfortable in 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.600
 operation is better than what could be 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.809
 worse than its competitors today 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.050
 in the market a lot in general, we understand how much 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.899
 the benefits of owning justify the price of 27 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.370
 800 thousand rubles at this price 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.980
 devices today can be bought in Russia 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.110
 outwardly irobot rumba 880 is not much 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.480
 different from many other robots 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.989
 vacuum cleaners round black and gray color 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.940
 gamma 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.789
 just a sample of the classics of the genre 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.470
 but the company and the robot is quite possible 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.790
 attributed to the classics in this segment 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.950
 household appliances 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.689
 so everything is logical front end 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.000
 vacuum cleaner there is a rubberized pad 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.100
 which protects furniture and other 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.259
 interior items from damage 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.540
 the robot moves with the help of the main 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.780
 thruster wheels also 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.920
 which is easily removed for cleaning 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.840
 indoor orientation going on 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.420
 thanks to the sensor system which 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.150
 They are located in different places of the vacuum cleaner 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.970
 bottom of the mechanical bumper and 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.979
 above it on top of the hull navigation 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.299
 also help special virtual 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.500
 my movie is battery powered 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.990
 they can work in mode 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.150
 accompaniment prompting the robot way 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.600
 in different rooms and back to the charger 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.970
 the base 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.450
 or be limiting movement 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.979
 create virtual walls important 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.689
 technological difference from 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.759
 predecessors and competitors 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.939
 no brushes in their classic 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.950
 understanding rubber brushes in with bristles 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.350
 instead they revolve here to meet 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.360
 each other two rollers violin 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.159
 they are made of rubber with the addition of 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.649
 silicone have on the outside 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.050
 peculiar convex drawing soft 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.880
 ribs so what happens is capture 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.740
 garbage 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.620
 so on getting into the air channel 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.210
 convened dust collector reason for rejection 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.610
 main brush with bristles 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.560
 problems with winding it wrong 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.840
 hair and other long and thin 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.180
 garbage that always have and similar 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.490
 vacuum cleaners besides such a solution 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.740
 tight rollers with 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.050
 spiral ribs helped increase 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.850
 intake air flow rate 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.880
 except the updated cleaning system 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.040
 sucking in and I'm a robot rumba 880 new 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.530
 motor it is smaller in size but 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.520
 company information more 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.380
 productive motor is in 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.550
 container dust collectors whose volume 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:53.180
 now about 1.2 liters in model 780 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.390
 for example there was a 0.8 liter output filter 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.670
 hepa h12 with its help is delayed 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.860
 fine dust that does not remain in 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.370
 dust collector along with large debris in 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.990
 clean air returns 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.940
 control of the vacuum cleaner produced or with 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.070
 panels on the case or from the remote 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.040
 remote can be activated 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.950
 automatic cleaning mode program 1 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.050
 place with a diameter of about a meter mode of decline 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.120
 or by pressing the arrows on the remote 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.130
 Manage the gadget manually 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.290
 unfortunately supplied 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.210
 the remote can not be called completely 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.160
 functional missing opportunity 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.990
 create and schedule cleaning 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.450
 this can only be done with the buttons on 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.730
 vacuum cleaner or by buying in about three 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.800
 thousand rubles a cult with wider 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.230
 opportunities during testing we 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.910
 vacuuming different surfaces with 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.040
 extremely long for a similar 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.540
 machinery original thread 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.970
 various carpet 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.860
 laminate to the tests were also added 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.380
 various obstacles in the way of the robot 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.800
 furnishings in whom by the way in 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.880
 roomba 780 implemented technology 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.410
 obstructing the tangling of the robot 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.050
 wire and jam 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.180
 if the vacuum cleaner is in the area of ​​the wires 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.770
 and has trouble moving 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.410
 he just tries as fast as possible 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.510
 leave this place but still better 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.640
 minimize the presence of wires on the floor 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.280
 when using any robot vacuum cleaner 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.440
 general on all types of coatings robot 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.930
 I felt confident and after the first 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.930
 cleaning removed most of the garbage around 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.120
 90 percent after the second cleaning one 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.860
 and coating the same purification degree was 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.810
 close to 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.460
 real trash almost not at all 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.979
 there was only a little in 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.530
 hard-to-reach robot places 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.360
 cleaned offended obstacles and not confused 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.479
 wires in parallel reacted to 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.229
 virtual t-shirts and finishing work 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.539
 returned to base 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.789
 the only thing that couldn't do it 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.740
 enters tests on oil in pile clean 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.259
 garbage deep inside 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.599
 coverage but here the whole thing is exactly 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.370
 special structure of the hair that's just make noise 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.800
 he could have fixed less 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.780
 level of about 60 decibels and call 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.120
 user comfort 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.520
 with the robot in the same room the totality 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.139
 merits results cleaning opportunity 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.150
 work on the schedule in the automatic 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.360
 mode roomy dust collector 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.819
 ease of maintenance in our opinion 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.520
 outweighs the disadvantages oi robot rumba 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:14.770
 880 high cost 27 thousand 800 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.900
 rubles is not the lowest noise and 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.310
 limited inbound functionality 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.779

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:24.909
 robot vacuum cleaner irobot roomba 780 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.340
 handle keeping clean in 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:29.349
 apartment but certainly not replace cleaning with 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.629
 using more powerful classic 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.699
 vacuum cleaner families with children and home 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:36.310
 animals subject to lemke as well 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.960
 for allergy sufferers it will be especially helpful 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.629
 But today in stores there 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.440
 alternative robots samsung vacuum cleaners and 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:44.710
 lg 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.199
 You can buy them for less than 20 25 thousand 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.169
 the quality of cleaning is not inferior to 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.449
 here buy a robot vacuum cleaner 15,000 cheaper 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.610
 rubles we do not recommend it at all 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.830
 will be just electrovenik on wheels 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.500
 who haphazardly go around the apartment 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.960
 Cat rolls on itself and of course 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.620
 garbage will collect but high performance 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.020
 cleaning up 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.000
 you should not expect from such models
