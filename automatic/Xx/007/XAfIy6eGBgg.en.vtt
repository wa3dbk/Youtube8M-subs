00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
they're both duo fiber the 187 has a

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.100 
they're both duo fiber the 187 has a
bigger<00:01:11.500> surface<00:01:12.100> area<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:13.540> because<00:01:13.870> of<00:01:13.900> the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
bigger surface area but because of the

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.520 
bigger surface area but because of the
long<00:01:14.320> bristles<00:01:14.710> it's<00:01:15.310> like<00:01:16.230> kind<00:01:17.230> of<00:01:17.290> moves

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530

foundations<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:22.570> one<00:01:22.840> is<00:01:23.170> smaller<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:26.380> it's

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
foundations this one is smaller so it's

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.730 
foundations this one is smaller so it's
more<00:01:26.950> densely<00:01:27.310> packed<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:29.020> find<00:01:29.560> it's

stipple<00:02:07.190> it<00:02:08.229> onto<00:02:09.229> my<00:02:09.320> face

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.030 

and<00:02:13.250> as<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.610> can<00:02:13.760> see<00:02:13.820> I<00:02:14.270> can<00:02:15.200> cover<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.680> lot<00:02:16.010> of

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
and as you can see I can cover a lot of

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.430 
and as you can see I can cover a lot of
area<00:02:16.520> with<00:02:17.120> this<00:02:17.300> brush<00:02:17.540> because<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:18.080> so<00:02:18.230> big

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
area with this brush because it's so big

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.780 
area with this brush because it's so big
and<00:02:20.590> then<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:22.040> take<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.580> kind<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:24.790> move

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
and then I just take it and kind of move

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:38.240 
and then I just take it and kind of move
it<00:02:25.880> in<00:02:26.060> circular<00:02:26.330> motions

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.240 

and<00:02:38.340> that's<00:02:39.090> fine<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.660> feel<00:02:40.530> like<00:02:40.830> with<00:02:41.040> this

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
and that's fine I feel like with this

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.510 
and that's fine I feel like with this
brush<00:02:41.580> though<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:43.110> hairs<00:02:43.350> are<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.830> long<00:02:44.160> but

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
brush though the hairs are so long but

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.930 
brush though the hairs are so long but
they<00:02:44.640> just<00:02:44.850> move<00:02:45.210> around<00:02:46.160> so<00:02:47.160> much<00:02:47.490> that<00:02:47.790> it's

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
they just move around so much that it's

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.790 
they just move around so much that it's
really<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.600> don't<00:02:49.020> feel<00:02:49.230> like<00:02:49.380> I'm<00:02:49.590> going

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
really I don't feel like I'm going

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.070 
really I don't feel like I'm going
blending<00:02:50.490> it<00:02:50.580> in<00:02:50.730> like<00:02:51.300> if<00:02:51.390> this<00:02:51.510> brush<00:02:51.810> was

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
blending it in like if this brush was

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.650 
blending it in like if this brush was
like<00:02:52.430> this<00:02:54.050> more<00:02:55.050> densely<00:02:55.380> packed<00:02:56.480> which<00:02:57.480> I'm

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
like this more densely packed which I'm

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.720 
like this more densely packed which I'm
thinking<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:58.050> getting<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.500> Sigma<00:02:59.130> flat<00:02:59.459> top

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
thinking of getting that Sigma flat top

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.870 
thinking of getting that Sigma flat top
kabuki<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:02.340> Lisa<00:03:02.670> SP<00:03:03.570> I<00:03:04.550> can't<00:03:05.550> remember<00:03:05.670> her

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
kabuki that Lisa SP I can't remember her

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.380 
kabuki that Lisa SP I can't remember her
name<00:03:05.910> but<00:03:06.180> I'll<00:03:06.270> put<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.420> right<00:03:06.540> here<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:09.090> she

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
name but I'll put it right here that she

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.540 
name but I'll put it right here that she
always<00:03:09.800> recommends<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.040> I'm<00:03:11.280> really

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
always recommends and I'm really

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.920 
always recommends and I'm really
thinking<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.880> getting<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.270> because<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.750> like

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
thinking of getting that because I like

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.979 
thinking of getting that because I like
this<00:03:13.110> brush<00:03:13.440> but<00:03:13.709> I<00:03:13.890> just<00:03:14.100> feel<00:03:14.280> like<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.989> don't

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
this brush but I just feel like I don't

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.840 
this brush but I just feel like I don't
know<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.380> hairs<00:03:16.590> are<00:03:16.770> too<00:03:16.920> long<00:03:17.070> I<00:03:17.370> feel<00:03:17.730> like

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
know the hairs are too long I feel like

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.490 
know the hairs are too long I feel like
I'm<00:03:17.970> working<00:03:18.180> too<00:03:18.480> hard<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.870> like<00:03:19.050> make<00:03:19.350> sure

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
I'm working too hard to like make sure

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:27.670 
I'm working too hard to like make sure
it's<00:03:19.739> blended<00:03:19.920> in<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.940> that's<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.570> 187

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.800 

now<00:03:28.640> on<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:28.939> side<00:03:29.120> we're<00:03:29.329> going<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.510> use<00:03:29.659> the

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
now on this side we're going to use the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.410 
now on this side we're going to use the
130<00:03:30.340> I'm<00:03:31.340> gonna<00:03:31.549> take<00:03:31.700> it<00:03:31.819> back<00:03:31.939> to<00:03:32.090> my<00:03:32.239> see

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
130 I'm gonna take it back to my see

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.210 
130 I'm gonna take it back to my see
this<00:03:33.220> of<00:03:34.220> course<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.610> has<00:03:34.819> much<00:03:35.360> less<00:03:36.220> surface

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
this of course it has much less surface

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.929 
this of course it has much less surface
area<00:03:37.519> so<00:03:38.480> I'm<00:03:39.519> stippling<00:03:40.519> it<00:03:40.670> on<00:03:42.189> and<00:03:43.189> then

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:43.939 
area so I'm stippling it on and then

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.369 
area so I'm stippling it on and then
going<00:03:44.810> in<00:03:44.930> circular<00:03:45.409> motions<00:03:45.920> I<00:03:47.319> tend<00:03:48.319> to

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
going in circular motions I tend to

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.300 
going in circular motions I tend to
favor<00:03:48.620> this<00:03:48.950> brush<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:51.799> reason<00:03:52.159> is

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
favor this brush and the reason is

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.220 
favor this brush and the reason is
because<00:03:52.609> it's<00:03:52.939> so<00:03:53.090> small<00:03:53.329> I<00:03:53.569> mean<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:53.900> takes<00:03:54.109> a

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
because it's so small I mean it takes a

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.960 
because it's so small I mean it takes a
little<00:03:54.379> extra<00:03:54.859> work<00:03:55.010> and<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.370> little<00:03:55.489> extra

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
little extra work and a little extra

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.550 
little extra work and a little extra
time<00:03:56.209> but<00:03:57.109> I<00:03:57.590> feel<00:03:58.340> like<00:03:58.609> it<00:03:58.849> blends<00:03:59.239> in<00:03:59.690> a<00:03:59.989> lot

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
time but I feel like it blends in a lot

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.979 
time but I feel like it blends in a lot
better<00:04:00.859> and<00:04:01.220> as<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.209> can<00:04:02.329> see<00:04:02.389> me<00:04:02.659> even<00:04:02.780> going

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
better and as you can see me even going

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.369 
better and as you can see me even going
on<00:04:03.109> this<00:04:03.260> side<00:04:03.500> like<00:04:04.280> make<00:04:04.489> sure<00:04:04.730> that<00:04:05.480> 187

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
on this side like make sure that 187

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:12.819 
on this side like make sure that 187
side<00:04:06.590> is<00:04:06.739> blended<00:04:07.129> in<00:04:07.250> I<00:04:11.290> have<00:04:12.290> two<00:04:12.500> mirrors

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.450 
as you can see I favor favor the 130
brush<00:04:32.400> I<00:04:32.700> just<00:04:33.180> think<00:04:33.600> it's<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:35.010> takes<00:04:35.160> a

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
brush I just think it's it takes a

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.000 
brush I just think it's it takes a
little<00:04:35.580> bit<00:04:35.730> longer<00:04:36.080> but<00:04:37.080> I<00:04:37.320> feel<00:04:37.650> like<00:04:37.770> it

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
little bit longer but I feel like it

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.660 
little bit longer but I feel like it
does<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.250> better<00:04:38.580> job<00:04:39.230> really<00:04:40.230> blending<00:04:41.130> the

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
does a better job really blending the

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.750 
does a better job really blending the
product<00:04:42.090> into<00:04:42.390> my<00:04:42.510> skin<00:04:43.250> really<00:04:44.250> getting<00:04:44.640> it

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
product into my skin really getting it

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.270 
product into my skin really getting it
in<00:04:44.910> there<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.750> plus<00:04:46.680> your<00:04:46.860> face<00:04:47.040> it's<00:04:47.220> not

in there and plus your face it's not

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
okay's officers here's the verdict if I

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.440 
okay's officers here's the verdict if I
was<00:05:27.620> going<00:05:27.860> to<00:05:27.920> choose<00:05:28.100> between<00:05:28.280> 187<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:29.360> a

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
was going to choose between 187 and a

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.810 
was going to choose between 187 and a
130<00:05:29.900> I<00:05:30.020> would<00:05:30.320> definitely<00:05:30.740> pick<00:05:30.920> the<00:05:31.160> 130

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
130 I would definitely pick the 130

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.940 
130 I would definitely pick the 130
because<00:05:32.300> I<00:05:32.330> think<00:05:32.570> what<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.840> 187<00:05:33.560> are<00:05:33.680> kind<00:05:33.890> of

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
because I think what the 187 are kind of

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.070 
because I think what the 187 are kind of
locked<00:05:34.220> into<00:05:34.520> just<00:05:34.760> being<00:05:35.150> able<00:05:35.330> to<00:05:35.510> apply

locked into just being able to apply

nose
it's<00:05:54.800> very<00:05:55.160> multi-purpose<00:05:55.640> and<00:05:56.570> that's<00:05:57.290> why<00:05:57.500> I

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
it's very multi-purpose and that's why I

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.750 
it's very multi-purpose and that's why I
think<00:05:57.650> you<00:05:57.800> get<00:05:57.950> more<00:05:58.070> bang<00:05:58.250> for<00:05:58.280> your<00:05:58.580> buck

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
think you get more bang for your buck

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.550 
think you get more bang for your buck
with<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.090> 130<00:05:59.540> even<00:05:59.930> though<00:06:00.080> it's<00:06:00.350> a<00:06:00.440> lot

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
with the 130 even though it's a lot

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.190 
with the 130 even though it's a lot
smaller<00:06:00.980> I<00:06:01.220> think<00:06:01.400> it's<00:06:01.520> a<00:06:01.580> lot<00:06:01.700> more<00:06:01.910> useful

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
smaller I think it's a lot more useful

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.290 
smaller I think it's a lot more useful
so<00:06:03.200> there<00:06:04.010> you<00:06:04.250> have<00:06:04.280> it<00:06:04.460> all<00:06:04.730> faces<00:06:05.150> I<00:06:05.240> know
