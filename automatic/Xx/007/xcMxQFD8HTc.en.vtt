00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.710
 to draw the face of an old man 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.269
 looks strong and determined there are 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.980
 several features to take in 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.000
 account 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.440
 start by making a vertical line 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.440
 is divided the hm3 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.180
 the horizontal line does not go through the 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.590
 center of the vertical line but 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.980
 slightly below the second 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.050
 Mark 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.450
 it corresponds to two-thirds of those 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:42.140
 here's an old man 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:43.730
 his features are pulled down this is 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.860
 for that reason his forehead is no longer 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.860
 bigger than normal and so we have 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.030
 drawn the horizontal line as low 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.960
 marked the four points for the eyes 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.710
 divide the line in 5 for that 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.440
 draw two more vertical lines 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.280
 to make the contours of the face as 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.090
 he's an old man 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.800
 they stand out more the face is very 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.649
 square what will give him a good side 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.220
 built is more serious the eyebrows are 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.220
 quite thick 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.360
 when we draw his face we will give 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.450
 the impression that everything comes from the center and 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.980
 part outward nose and eyes 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.490
 go slightly upwards towards 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:28.800
 the outside we make him a big nose he has 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.970
 also a pronounced chin but his 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.970
 cheeks always pulls down 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 finish his eyebrows 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.030
 make his eyes 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.000
 make him his wrinkles first 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.369
 by duo of a hedge going down 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.869
 and goes to the outside here we get him 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.940
 draw a big mustache for him 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.470
 give a more imposing air also makes 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.410
 his features to mark the relief of the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.180
 chin mouth remains hidden behind the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.620
 mustache 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.620
 here we also make him a goatee 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.550
 give him his ears they are enough 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.550
 big 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.590
 there is also the hair that is rather 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.459
 well coiffed what is important for 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.459
 a serious character 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.819
 glomel and very useless does the finishing 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.819
 eyes 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.620
 do not forget the reflection and the outlines 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.620
 eyes 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.800
 finalize the eyebrows add a few 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.300
 wrinkles in the middle of the eyebrows makes the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.459
 outlines making it stand out 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.670
 the framework to support the old age of 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.150
 character finalize the mustache and the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.150
 goatee 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.980
 finalize the hair you can see 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.900

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.349
