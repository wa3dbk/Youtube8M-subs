00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.620 
that even if you die you will still have
this<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.340> obviously<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.970> soldier<00:01:48.420> could

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
this so obviously that soldier could

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.359 
this so obviously that soldier could
pump<00:01:48.869> out<00:01:49.020> more<00:01:49.259> damage<00:01:49.710> than<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.979> could<00:01:50.159> heal

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
pump out more damage than I could heal

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.880 
pump out more damage than I could heal
up<00:01:50.579> essentially<00:01:51.479> 100<00:01:51.960> damage<00:01:52.229> per<00:01:52.500> rocket

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
up essentially 100 damage per rocket

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.830 
up essentially 100 damage per rocket
that's<00:01:53.070> too<00:01:53.430> much<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.210> my<00:01:54.329> health<00:01:54.540> pool

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that's too much just for my health pool

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.289 
that's too much just for my health pool
and<00:01:55.140> with<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> over<00:01:56.490> heal<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
and with the over heal and with the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:57.999 
and with the over heal and with the
quick<00:01:57.509> fix

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
quick fix

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.980 
quick fix
essentially<00:01:59.009> quick<00:01:59.310> fix<00:01:59.549> heal<00:01:59.820> rate<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:00.810> we

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
essentially quick fix heal rate so as we

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.660 
essentially quick fix heal rate so as we
respawn<00:02:01.409> here<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.860> kind<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.100> showing<00:02:02.399> and

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
care of this with a simple hot fix I

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.100 
care of this with a simple hot fix I
imagine<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.670> was<00:03:17.790> just<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.120> simple<00:03:18.570> oversight

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
imagine it was just a simple oversight

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.130 
imagine it was just a simple oversight
with<00:03:19.500> all<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.519> weapon<00:03:21.000> balances<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.720> changes

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
with all the weapon balances and changes

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.160 
with all the weapon balances and changes
and<00:03:22.440> it'll<00:03:23.100> just<00:03:23.250> be<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.459> business<00:03:24.360> as<00:03:24.540> usual

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
and it'll just be a business as usual

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.380 
and it'll just be a business as usual
within<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.100> couple<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.489> hours<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:27.150> hope

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
within a couple of hours I hope

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.410 
within a couple of hours I hope
something<00:03:28.140> else<00:03:28.500> might<00:03:28.860> suggest<00:03:29.130> is<00:03:29.670> shibby

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
something else might suggest is shibby
