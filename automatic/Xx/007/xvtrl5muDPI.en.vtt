00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
clans well surprisingly it doesn't go by

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
clans well surprisingly it doesn't go by
trophies<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:14.280> very<00:01:14.490> good<00:01:14.549> reason

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
trophies and for very good reason

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.260 
trophies and for very good reason
supercell<00:01:15.689> has<00:01:15.990> pretty<00:01:16.860> much<00:01:17.270> fine-tuned

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
supercell has pretty much fine-tuned

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.880 
supercell has pretty much fine-tuned
this<00:01:18.600> system<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.259> looked<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:19.650> both

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
this system and they looked at both

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.800 
this system and they looked at both
sides<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.430> coin<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:20.909> which<00:01:21.090> direction

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
sides of the coin to see which direction

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.679 
sides of the coin to see which direction
works<00:01:22.409> better<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:23.280> clan<00:01:23.520> vs<00:01:23.880> clan<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.630> you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
works better for clan vs clan so you

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.330

against<00:01:35.729> other<00:01:35.909> players<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.630> are<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.200> same

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
against other players that are the same

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
or near the level of the heroes you have

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.010 
or near the level of the heroes you have
and<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.310> you've<00:01:41.460> trained<00:01:41.790> up<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.360> also<00:01:42.659> be

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
and that you've trained up you also be

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.230 
and that you've trained up you also be
paired<00:01:43.350> up<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:43.649> people<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.310> somewhat

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
paired up with people that have somewhat

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.389 
paired up with people that have somewhat
same<00:01:45.509> similar<00:01:46.049> upgraded<00:01:46.680> weapon<00:01:47.040> levels

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
same similar upgraded weapon levels

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.090 
same similar upgraded weapon levels
townhall<00:01:48.149> levels<00:01:48.509> also<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.649> level<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:50.040> your

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
townhall levels also the level of your

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.910 
townhall levels also the level of your
walls<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.479> stats<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.899> your<00:01:52.020> base<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.740> this

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
walls and the stats of your base so this

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.980 
walls and the stats of your base so this
is<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> lot<00:01:53.340> more<00:01:53.369> detailed<00:01:54.240> information

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
is a lot more detailed information

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.510 
is a lot more detailed information
that's<00:01:55.439> going<00:01:55.560> into<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.979> game<00:01:56.130> rather<00:01:56.399> than

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
that's going into the game rather than

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.850 
that's going into the game rather than
just<00:01:56.850> trophy<00:01:57.329> count<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.049> what<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.409> means<00:01:58.710> is

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
just trophy count so what this means is

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.380 
just trophy count so what this means is
basically<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.729> be<00:01:59.820> paired<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.180> with

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
basically you can be paired up with

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.260 
basically you can be paired up with
people<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:01.049> leaderboards<00:02:01.439> even<00:02:02.090> people<00:02:03.090> at

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
people on leaderboards even people at

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.330 
people on leaderboards even people at
the<00:02:03.390> very<00:02:03.600> top<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:04.049> number<00:02:04.290> one<00:02:04.469> spot<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.009> this

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
the very top on number one spot and this

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.550 
the very top on number one spot and this
all<00:02:05.549> depends<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.060> how<00:02:06.119> far<00:02:06.600> you've<00:02:07.020> progressed

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
all depends on how far you've progressed

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.499 
all depends on how far you've progressed
throughout<00:02:08.220> clash<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.729> clans<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.179> your

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
throughout clash of clans in your

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.390 
throughout clash of clans in your
accumulation<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.640> upgrading<00:02:11.640> and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
accumulation of upgrading and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.759 
accumulation of upgrading and
farming<00:02:12.790> etc<00:02:13.510> now<00:02:13.720> another<00:02:14.230> thing<00:02:14.349> you<00:02:14.650> will

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
farming etc now another thing you will

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.130 
farming etc now another thing you will
notice<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:16.299> will<00:02:16.450> also<00:02:16.659> be<00:02:16.810> matched

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
notice is that you will also be matched

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.080 
notice is that you will also be matched
up<00:02:17.409> by<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.709> number<00:02:18.069> of<00:02:18.099> players<00:02:18.519> in<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:18.909> other

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
up by the number of players in the other

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.869 
up by the number of players in the other
clan<00:02:19.360> so<00:02:19.900> let's<00:02:20.110> say<00:02:20.170> for<00:02:20.470> example<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:21.159> clan<00:02:21.849> of

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
clan so let's say for example a clan of

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.970 
clan so let's say for example a clan of
25<00:02:22.780> people<00:02:23.110> will<00:02:23.950> find<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:25.030> clan<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.810> 20<00:02:26.439> well

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
25 people will find a clan of 20 well

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.559 
25 people will find a clan of 20 well
what<00:02:27.189> they<00:02:27.310> do<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.610> they<00:02:27.790> round<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.209> numbers

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
what they do is they round the numbers

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.800 
what they do is they round the numbers
by<00:02:28.780> five<00:02:29.109> so<00:02:29.680> if<00:02:29.859> a<00:02:29.950> clan<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.250> 20<00:02:30.879> finds<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.599> clan

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
by five so if a clan of 20 finds a clan

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.259 
by five so if a clan of 20 finds a clan
of<00:02:31.840> 25<00:02:32.409> they<00:02:33.099> will<00:02:33.310> round<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.730> number<00:02:34.060> by

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
of 25 they will round the number by

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.839 
of 25 they will round the number by
fives<00:02:34.659> to<00:02:35.140> make<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.470> even<00:02:35.829> so<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.220> would<00:02:36.370> be<00:02:36.489> 20

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
fives to make it even so it would be 20

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.449 
fives to make it even so it would be 20
verses<00:02:37.150> 20<00:02:37.480> now<00:02:38.409> you<00:02:38.470> guys<00:02:38.680> we've<00:02:38.980> asked<00:02:39.370> them

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.059 
verses 20 now you guys we've asked them
every<00:02:39.849> question<00:02:40.120> we<00:02:40.420> could<00:02:40.569> think<00:02:40.810> of<00:02:41.019> I<00:02:41.260> think

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
every question we could think of I think

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.009 
every question we could think of I think
one<00:02:42.250> we<00:02:42.519> did<00:02:42.819> ask<00:02:43.000> them<00:02:43.269> was<00:02:43.450> why<00:02:43.720> don't<00:02:43.900> you

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
again looked at both sides and they've

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.300 
again looked at both sides and they've
worked<00:02:52.180> everything<00:02:52.510> out<00:02:52.780> even<00:02:53.590> today<00:02:53.739> if<00:02:54.190> you

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
worked everything out even today if you

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.520 
worked everything out even today if you
look<00:02:54.459> at<00:02:54.609> the<00:02:54.639> clans<00:02:55.000> on<00:02:55.359> leaderboards<00:02:55.989> or

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
look at the clans on leaderboards or

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.099 
look at the clans on leaderboards or
