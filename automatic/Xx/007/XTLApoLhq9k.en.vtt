Phil Collins you're a good thing about
space<00:01:37.429> designer<00:01:38.830> it's<00:01:39.830> got<00:01:39.979> eq<00:01:40.429> a<00:01:41.979> real

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
space designer it's got eq a real

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.499 
space designer it's got eq a real
standard<00:01:43.429> thing<00:01:43.580> that<00:01:43.700> people<00:01:43.940> do<00:01:44.090> is<00:01:44.270> take

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
standard thing that people do is take

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.120 
standard thing that people do is take
the<00:01:44.630> bottom<00:01:44.899> and<00:01:45.050> eq<00:01:45.410> off<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.560> drum<00:01:45.770> reverb

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
the bottom and eq off a drum reverb

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.169 
the bottom and eq off a drum reverb
because<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.399> don't<00:01:46.580> want<00:01:46.640> too<00:01:46.819> much<00:01:46.940> reverb

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
because you don't want too much reverb

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.699 
because you don't want too much reverb
on<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.479> kick<00:01:47.690> drum<00:01:47.720> side<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.259> things<00:01:48.380> or

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
on the kick drum side of things or

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.169 
on the kick drum side of things or
everything<00:01:48.950> can<00:01:49.190> get<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.340> bit<00:01:49.429> cloudy<00:01:49.729> so

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
everything can get a bit cloudy so

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:58.570 
everything can get a bit cloudy so
that's<00:01:53.179> an<00:01:53.270> example<00:01:56.830> this<00:01:57.830> shows<00:01:58.069> you<00:01:58.250> mean<00:01:58.459> if

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
that's an example this shows you mean if

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.109 
that's an example this shows you mean if
you<00:01:58.670> did<00:01:58.819> there<00:02:03.489> you<00:02:04.489> can<00:02:04.640> know<00:02:04.729> all<00:02:04.849> the<00:02:04.940> sheen

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
you did there you can know all the sheen

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.790 
you did there you can know all the sheen
on<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.360> top<00:02:05.509> end<00:02:05.690> happens<00:02:06.050> they<00:02:06.530> don't<00:02:06.679> want

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
on the top end happens they don't want

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.900 
on the top end happens they don't want
to<00:02:06.860> do<00:02:06.950> that<00:02:06.979> because<00:02:07.190> that's<00:02:07.399> a<00:02:07.459> bit

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
to do that because that's a bit

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.999 
to do that because that's a bit
ridiculous<00:02:07.970> but<00:02:08.360> if<00:02:09.319> you<00:02:09.410> do<00:02:09.500> on<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.649> week<00:02:09.800> here

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
ridiculous but if you do on a week here

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.050 
ridiculous but if you do on a week here
you<00:02:10.160> might<00:02:10.310> want<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.520> do<00:02:10.610> something<00:02:10.789> like<00:02:11.000> that

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
you might want to do something like that

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.839 
you might want to do something like that
and<00:02:11.770> sometimes<00:02:12.770> it's<00:02:13.130> nice<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.400> have<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.640> bit<00:02:13.760> of

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
and sometimes it's nice to have a bit of

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.670 
and sometimes it's nice to have a bit of
low-end<00:02:14.239> reverb<00:02:14.599> anyway<00:02:14.930> because<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.560> just

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
low-end reverb anyway because it just

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.420 
low-end reverb anyway because it just
adds<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.980> bit<00:02:16.099> of<00:02:16.130> boom<00:02:16.489> to<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.760> drums<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:19.370> you

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
adds a bit of boom to the drums so you

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.280 
adds a bit of boom to the drums so you
might<00:02:19.640> wanna<00:02:19.819> know<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.120> might<00:02:20.300> not<00:02:23.290> that's

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
might wanna know you might not that's

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:55.660 
might wanna know you might not that's
that's<00:02:24.530> nice<00:02:24.739> for<00:02:24.770> me<00:02:25.040> FC

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:12.259 

original<00:03:01.790> right<00:03:07.549> so<00:03:09.110> kind<00:03:10.110> of<00:03:10.200> long<00:03:10.349> but<00:03:11.269> if

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
original right so kind of long but if

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.750 
original right so kind of long but if
you<00:03:12.390> follow<00:03:12.660> those<00:03:12.900> steps<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.590> use<00:03:14.459> your<00:03:14.579> ear

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
you follow those steps and use your ear

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.520 
you follow those steps and use your ear
then<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.810> know<00:03:15.930> you'll<00:03:16.110> have<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.260> pretty

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
then you know you'll have a pretty

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.750 
then you know you'll have a pretty
decent<00:03:16.860> drum<00:03:17.010> sound<00:03:17.190> by<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.370> end<00:03:17.549> of<00:03:17.610> things

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
decent drum sound by the end of things

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.160 
decent drum sound by the end of things

nice and big and fat and quite
controlled<00:03:19.650> dynamically<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:20.970> should

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
controlled dynamically and it should

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.550 
controlled dynamically and it should
just<00:03:21.329> sit<00:03:21.420> in<00:03:21.540> your<00:03:21.569> mix<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.900> bit<00:03:22.049> better<00:03:22.170> so

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.589 
few options for extras but if you did
all<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.459> stuff<00:03:26.640> then<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.060> pretty<00:03:27.480> much
