it's right through onto the exhaust wrap
there<00:01:08.100> which<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.580> part<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> top<00:01:09.270> box<00:01:09.450> rack

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
there which is part of the top box rack

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.910 
there which is part of the top box rack
so<00:01:09.780> that's<00:01:09.960> why<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.170> need<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.560> that's<00:01:10.710> one

so that's why you need that that's one
of<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.100> key<00:01:11.479> securing<00:01:12.479> points<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> frame

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
of the key securing points for the frame

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.770 
of the key securing points for the frame
so<00:01:13.439> there's<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.710> necessary<00:01:14.280> part<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.479> bear<00:01:15.659> that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
so there's a necessary part do bear that

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.260 
so there's a necessary part do bear that
in<00:01:15.930> mind<00:01:16.250> in<00:01:17.250> terms<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> ranting<00:01:18.119> them

in mind in terms of the ranting them
aren't<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.570> three<00:01:18.840> points<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> side<00:01:19.740> they

mount down here through the pillion foot
peg<00:01:22.350> up<00:01:23.100> here<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.670> said<00:01:23.850> onto<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> top<00:01:24.390> box

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
peg up here as I said onto the top box

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.170 
peg up here as I said onto the top box
right<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> cost<00:01:26.040> about<00:01:26.310> as<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.670> crossbar

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
frames on is actually the most simple

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.899 
frames on is actually the most simple
part<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:39.229> of<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> whole<00:01:40.470> installation<00:01:40.950> as

part of the of the whole installation as

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.819 
part of the of the whole installation as
I<00:01:41.970> will<00:01:42.270> show<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.509> moving<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> indicators<00:01:43.680> is

I will show you moving the indicators is

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.710 
I will show you moving the indicators is
the<00:01:43.979> tricky<00:01:44.549> part<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:46.579> I<00:01:47.579> don't<00:01:48.149> know<00:01:48.360> about

the tricky part and I don't know about
it<00:01:49.340> so<00:01:50.340> yeah<00:01:50.399> that's<00:01:50.610> basically<00:01:50.729> how<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
it so yeah that's basically how the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.060 
it so yeah that's basically how the
amount<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:52.290> did<00:01:52.439> get<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> structures<00:01:53.009> from

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
amount you did get a structures from

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.069 
amount you did get a structures from
Givi<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> clearest<00:01:54.390> instructions<00:01:54.990> we've

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
Givi not the clearest instructions we've

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.440 
Givi not the clearest instructions we've
ever<00:01:55.200> seen<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.619> do<00:01:55.939> yeah<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.329> look

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
ever seen but they do yeah if you look

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.660 
ever seen but they do yeah if you look
at<00:01:57.600> them<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.840> then<00:01:57.930> comparing<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.380> your<00:01:58.409> bike

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
at them and then comparing to your bike

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.120 
at them and then comparing to your bike
the<00:01:59.670> actual<00:02:00.590> installation<00:02:01.590> isn't<00:02:01.920> that

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
the actual installation isn't that

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.670 
the actual installation isn't that
tricky<00:02:02.479> as<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.689> said<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> indicators<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
tricky as I said the indicators the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.399 
tricky as I said the indicators the
indicators<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.310> difficult<00:02:06.299> bit<00:02:06.450> I'll

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
indicators of the difficult bit I'll

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.219 
indicators of the difficult bit I'll
point<00:02:07.619> down<00:02:07.890> here<00:02:08.209> that<00:02:09.209> hole<00:02:09.450> there<00:02:09.690> that's

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
point down here that hole there that's

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.770 
point down here that hole there that's
where<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> indicators<00:02:10.979> are<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.340> stock<00:02:11.879> on<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
where the indicators are a stock on the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.610 
where the indicators are a stock on the
other<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.319> it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
other is it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.300 
other is it
they<00:02:14.069> need<00:02:14.220> moving<00:02:14.519> right<00:02:15.830> now<00:02:16.830> they<00:02:17.010> supply

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
they need moving right now they supply

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.530 
they need moving right now they supply
with<00:02:17.519> these<00:02:17.640> two<00:02:17.790> little<00:02:18.000> brackets<00:02:18.330> here

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
with these two little brackets here

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.170 
with these two little brackets here
which<00:02:18.930> broke<00:02:19.140> into<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.590> top<00:02:19.950> box<00:02:20.129> wrap<00:02:20.370> there

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
which broke into the top box wrap there

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.610 
which broke into the top box wrap there
another<00:02:21.450> reason<00:02:21.629> why<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.870> need<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.080> talk<00:02:22.200> Martin

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
another reason why I need to talk Martin

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.460 
another reason why I need to talk Martin
really<00:02:22.879> and<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:24.569> can<00:02:24.599> then<00:02:25.200> route<00:02:25.409> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
really and you can then route the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.710 
really and you can then route the
indicator<00:02:26.400> wires<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.970> through<00:02:27.000> there<00:02:27.510> and

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
indicator wires up through there and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.720 
indicator wires up through there and
remount<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.170> things<00:02:28.459> they<00:02:29.459> were<00:02:29.549> quite

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
remount the things they were quite

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.630 
remount the things they were quite
difficult<00:02:29.909> to<00:02:30.120> get<00:02:30.239> off<00:02:31.250> there<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.400> little

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
difficult to get off there is a little

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.030 
difficult to get off there is a little
rubber<00:02:32.870> section<00:02:33.870> there<00:02:34.230> which<00:02:34.379> I<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.680> got

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
rubber section there which I just got

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.970 
rubber section there which I just got
fed<00:02:35.220> up<00:02:35.280> with<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.579> cut<00:02:35.730> off<00:02:35.819> basically<00:02:36.299> you

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
fed up with and cut off basically you

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.259 
fed up with and cut off basically you
should<00:02:37.980> probably<00:02:38.190> keep<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.670> remove<00:02:39.120> it

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
should probably keep that remove it

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.319 
should probably keep that remove it
properly<00:02:39.920> because<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.280> bolts<00:02:41.970> all<00:02:42.150> down

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
properly because the bolts all down

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.640 
properly because the bolts all down
inside<00:02:42.659> the<00:02:42.810> rubber<00:02:42.959> thing<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.379> you<00:02:43.440> can't

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
inside the rubber thing and you can't

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.039 
inside the rubber thing and you can't
get<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.159> it's<00:02:44.310> just<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.750> pain<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:45.810> the

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
get to it and it's just a pain in the

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.449 
get to it and it's just a pain in the
bum<00:02:46.200> really<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:46.560> either<00:02:46.650> sort<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.040> them<00:02:47.190> cut

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
bum really so either sort of them cut

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.490 
bum really so either sort of them cut
them<00:02:47.549> off<00:02:47.640> basically<00:02:48.090> cut<00:02:48.629> for<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.810> wire<00:02:48.989> took

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
them off basically cut for the wire took

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.160 
them off basically cut for the wire took
them<00:02:49.620> off<00:02:49.680> like<00:02:49.799> that<00:02:50.690> underneath<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:51.930> side

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
them off like that underneath this side

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.170 
them off like that underneath this side
panel<00:02:52.349> here<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.890> where<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.340> indicators<00:02:53.910> plug

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
panel here is where the indicators plug

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.280 
panel here is where the indicators plug
in<00:02:54.329> you've<00:02:54.540> got<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:54.660> brown<00:02:54.840> connector<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.260> the

in you've got a brown connector on the
white<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:56.099> normal<00:02:56.340> plug<00:02:56.519> connects<00:02:57.299> there

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
white just normal plug connects there

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.800

which<00:02:58.530> run<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.859> wires<00:02:59.069> normally<00:03:00.060> out

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
which run the wires normally out

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.440 
which run the wires normally out
underneath<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.349> exhaust<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.430> out<00:03:02.579> behind

underneath the exhaust and out behind
them<00:03:03.629> on<00:03:03.750> guard<00:03:03.900> here<00:03:04.170> for<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.769> indicators

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
them on guard here for the indicators

them on guard here for the indicators
obviously<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.359> needs<00:03:06.480> moving<00:03:06.780> well<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.799> did

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
obviously that needs moving well I did

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.360 
obviously that needs moving well I did
was<00:03:09.120> as<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.359> can<00:03:09.510> see<00:03:09.920> I've<00:03:10.920> waited<00:03:11.159> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
was as you can see I've waited the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.539 
was as you can see I've waited the
cables<00:03:11.730> out<00:03:11.849> from<00:03:12.060> underneath<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:13.079> just

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
cables out from underneath and just

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.240 
cables out from underneath and just
cable<00:03:14.549> tied<00:03:14.700> them<00:03:14.909> to<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.150> top<00:03:15.299> box<00:03:15.420> rack<00:03:15.659> arm

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
cable tied them to the top box rack arm

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.849 
cable tied them to the top box rack arm
going<00:03:17.250> up<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.669> left<00:03:17.819> hand<00:03:18.030> indicator<00:03:18.859> and

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
going up to the left hand indicator and

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.099 
going up to the left hand indicator and
then<00:03:20.130> across<00:03:21.349> up<00:03:22.349> here<00:03:22.889> to<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.430> right<00:03:23.579> hand

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
then across up here to the right hand

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.809 
then across up here to the right hand
now<00:03:25.109> unfortunately<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:26.099> cable<00:03:26.910> for<00:03:27.030> the

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
now unfortunately the cable for the

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.069 
now unfortunately the cable for the
stock<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.120> had<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.329> splice<00:03:30.599> in<00:03:30.780> some<00:03:30.959> more

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
stock so I had to splice in some more

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.430 
stock so I had to splice in some more
wire<00:03:31.260> there<00:03:32.209> which<00:03:33.209> isn't<00:03:33.389> sort<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.780> ideal<00:03:34.139> but

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
wire there which isn't sort of ideal but

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.940 
wire there which isn't sort of ideal but
I<00:03:34.470> managed<00:03:36.139> left<00:03:37.139> hand<00:03:37.319> one<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.590> long<00:03:37.739> enough

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
I managed left hand one is long enough

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.670 
I managed left hand one is long enough
to<00:03:38.220> run<00:03:38.790> straight<00:03:38.970> in<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:40.049> you<00:03:40.109> do<00:03:40.319> better<00:03:40.500> at

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
to run straight in so you do better at

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.839 
to run straight in so you do better at
mine<00:03:40.799> if<00:03:40.919> you're<00:03:41.010> gonna<00:03:41.099> do<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.549> need

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
mine if you're gonna do this you need

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.659 
mine if you're gonna do this you need
some<00:03:42.090> extension<00:03:42.840> wires<00:03:43.500> just<00:03:43.829> that's<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.579> way

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
some extension wires just that's the way

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:45.979 
some extension wires just that's the way
I<00:03:44.699> did<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.180> you're<00:03:45.359> probably<00:03:45.449> gonna<00:03:45.720> do<00:03:45.870> it

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
I did it you're probably gonna do it

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.960 
I did it you're probably gonna do it
different<00:03:46.230> way<00:03:46.319> but<00:03:46.530> that's<00:03:47.430> why<00:03:47.609> I<00:03:47.730> did<00:03:47.940> it

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
different way but that's why I did it

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.490 
different way but that's why I did it
and<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.180> works<00:03:48.419> is<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:48.750> can<00:03:48.870> see<00:03:49.169> it's<00:03:49.379> quite

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
and it works is you can see it's quite

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.129 
and it works is you can see it's quite
messy<00:03:49.799> horrible<00:03:50.459> isn't<00:03:50.609> it<00:03:50.840> I've<00:03:51.840> got

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
messy horrible isn't it I've got

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.839 
messy horrible isn't it I've got
electrical<00:03:52.889> jointer<00:03:53.190> blocks<00:03:53.430> there<00:03:53.669> there

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
electrical jointer blocks there there

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.759 
electrical jointer blocks there there
their<00:03:54.090> backs<00:03:54.780> on<00:03:54.900> from<00:03:55.019> black<00:03:55.169> tape<00:03:55.410> sort<00:03:55.709> of

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
their backs on from black tape sort of

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.939 
their backs on from black tape sort of
mix<00:03:55.919> make<00:03:56.250> them<00:03:56.430> um<00:03:57.079> join<00:03:58.079> in<00:03:58.319> and<00:03:58.560> pushing<00:03:58.859> my

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
mix make them um join in and pushing my

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.819 
mix make them um join in and pushing my
soldering<00:03:59.579> iron<00:03:59.609> went<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.120> broke<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.680> did<00:04:01.680> this

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
soldering iron went and broke I did this

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.069 
soldering iron went and broke I did this
so<00:04:02.519> put<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:02.940> Jordan<00:04:03.239> blocks<00:04:03.419> in<00:04:03.569> order<00:04:03.690> no

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
so put the Jordan blocks in order no

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.800 
so put the Jordan blocks in order no
solder<00:04:04.410> on<00:04:04.560> then<00:04:04.769> I'll<00:04:04.859> just<00:04:05.129> sold<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.810> the

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
solder on then I'll just sold to the the

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.420 
solder on then I'll just sold to the the
wires<00:04:07.019> together<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.470> shrink-wrap<00:04:07.980> summer

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
wires together and shrink-wrap summer

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.729 
wires together and shrink-wrap summer
it's<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.269> new<00:04:09.449> plastic<00:04:10.049> wrap<00:04:10.199> around<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.560> wires

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
it's a new plastic wrap around the wires

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.670 
it's a new plastic wrap around the wires
they<00:04:11.010> look<00:04:11.190> so<00:04:11.879> professional<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.599> that<00:04:13.560> would

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
they look so professional and that would

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.029 
they look so professional and that would
improve<00:04:13.919> thanks<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.250> lot<00:04:15.680> we<00:04:16.680> can<00:04:16.829> see<00:04:16.949> the

improve thanks a lot we can see the

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.560 
improve thanks a lot we can see the
world<00:04:17.190> read<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.519> wires<00:04:17.729> but<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.120> think<00:04:18.389> all

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
world read the wires but I think all

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.379 
world read the wires but I think all
right<00:04:18.780> that's<00:04:19.019> right<00:04:21.950> lovely<00:04:22.950> British

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
right that's right lovely British

right that's right lovely British
wherever<00:04:24.659> you<00:04:25.020> can<00:04:25.169> see<00:04:25.349> cloudy<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:25.860> know

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
wherever you can see cloudy you know

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.080 
wherever you can see cloudy you know
what<00:04:26.569> can<00:04:27.569> you<00:04:27.659> see<00:04:27.780> those<00:04:27.930> words<00:04:28.219> no<00:04:29.219> I<00:04:29.490> can't

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
what can you see those words no I can't

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.279 
what can you see those words no I can't
and<00:04:30.270> you've<00:04:30.419> got<00:04:30.539> wide-angle<00:04:30.960> lens<00:04:31.139> so<00:04:31.259> you

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
and you've got wide-angle lens so you

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.159 
and you've got wide-angle lens so you
definitely<00:04:31.499> won't<00:04:32.150> know<00:04:33.150> all<00:04:33.330> right<00:04:33.509> there

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
definitely won't know all right there

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.489 
definitely won't know all right there
okay<00:04:34.439> like<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:34.969> took<00:04:35.969> me<00:04:36.240> two<00:04:37.199> and<00:04:37.229> a<00:04:37.349> half

00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:37.499 
okay like that took me two and a half

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:40.040 
okay like that took me two and a half
hours<00:04:37.800> I<00:04:37.830> think<00:04:37.979> to<00:04:38.330> fit<00:04:39.330> those<00:04:39.509> racks<00:04:39.840> in

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
hours I think to fit those racks in

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.409 
hours I think to fit those racks in
total<00:04:40.439> you<00:04:41.219> should<00:04:41.430> not<00:04:41.639> mechanically-minded

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.429 

mmm<00:04:45.509> it's<00:04:45.840> tricky<00:04:46.169> one

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:46.439 
mmm it's tricky one

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:47.869 
mmm it's tricky one
it's<00:04:46.620> not<00:04:46.770> particularly<00:04:47.099> difficult<00:04:47.400> on<00:04:47.729> the

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:47.879 
it's not particularly difficult on the

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.850 
it's not particularly difficult on the
sort<00:04:48.240> of<00:04:48.270> face<00:04:48.449> of<00:04:48.689> things<00:04:48.870> but<00:04:49.229> you're

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
sort of face of things but you're

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.080 
sort of face of things but you're
probably<00:04:50.009> gonna<00:04:50.219> come<00:04:50.430> across<00:04:50.639> some<00:04:50.789> issues

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
probably gonna come across some issues

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.159 
probably gonna come across some issues
and<00:04:51.300> you're<00:04:51.389> gonna<00:04:51.479> need<00:04:51.659> a<00:04:51.719> bit<00:04:51.930> of<00:04:52.020> them

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
and you're gonna need a bit of them

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.969 
and you're gonna need a bit of them
mechanical<00:04:53.159> mouse<00:04:53.550> about<00:04:53.939> you<00:04:54.090> to<00:04:54.240> fix<00:04:54.419> those

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
mechanical mouse about you to fix those

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.179 
mechanical mouse about you to fix those
of<00:04:55.979> course<00:04:57.500> if<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.620> would<00:04:58.740> have<00:04:58.860> guessed<00:04:59.069> by

00:04:59.179 --> 00:04:59.189 
of course if you would have guessed by

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.159 
of course if you would have guessed by
the<00:04:59.219> possessor<00:05:00.180> so<00:05:00.360> let's<00:05:00.870> get<00:05:00.960> this<00:05:01.080> on

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
the possessor so let's get this on

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.969 
the possessor so let's get this on
property<00:05:01.580> this<00:05:02.580> by<00:05:03.180> that<00:05:03.300> factor<00:05:03.719> yeah<00:05:03.990> I<00:05:04.259> have

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
property this by that factor yeah I have

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.429 
property this by that factor yeah I have
made<00:05:05.250> things<00:05:05.610> before<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:06.870> attach<00:05:07.169> things

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:07.439 
made things before and attach things

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:15.320 
made things before and attach things
before<00:05:07.889> so<00:05:08.550> we're<00:05:10.129> about<00:05:11.990> to<00:05:12.990> do<00:05:13.139> it<00:05:14.330> yes

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
before so we're about to do it yes

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.999 
before so we're about to do it yes
reasonably<00:05:15.960> simple<00:05:16.169> I<00:05:16.349> suppose<00:05:16.589> if<00:05:16.740> this<00:05:16.830> was

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
reasonably simple I suppose if this was

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:18.469 
reasonably simple I suppose if this was
a<00:05:17.039> Hanes<00:05:17.219> menu<00:05:17.550> it<00:05:17.610> would<00:05:17.699> probably<00:05:17.879> be<00:05:18.120> free

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
a Hanes menu it would probably be free

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.610 
a Hanes menu it would probably be free
spotless<00:05:18.930> I<00:05:19.199> reckon<00:05:20.099> so<00:05:20.279> yeah<00:05:21.319> there<00:05:22.319> we<00:05:22.439> go

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
spotless I reckon so yeah there we go

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.230 
spotless I reckon so yeah there we go
that's<00:05:22.889> how<00:05:23.039> you<00:05:23.099> mount<00:05:23.339> them<00:05:25.969> to<00:05:26.969> you<00:05:27.089> in<00:05:27.210> a

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
that's how you mount them to you in a

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.269 
that's how you mount them to you in a
very<00:05:27.360> short<00:05:27.629> period<00:05:28.020> of<00:05:28.050> time<00:05:28.229> if<00:05:28.889> you<00:05:28.979> do<00:05:29.099> need

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:29.279 
very short period of time if you do need

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:30.709 
very short period of time if you do need
any<00:05:29.430> advice<00:05:29.639> that's<00:05:30.029> by<00:05:30.150> no<00:05:30.360> means<00:05:30.599> a

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
any advice that's by no means a

any advice that's by no means a
