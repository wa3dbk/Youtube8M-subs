00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
that's good to hear I don't know we just

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.550 
that's good to hear I don't know we just
we<00:00:06.180> ran<00:00:06.359> him<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.569> lot<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:06.990> we<00:00:07.140> did<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.319> lot<00:00:07.500> of

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
we ran him a lot and we did a lot of

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.339 
we ran him a lot and we did a lot of
stuff<00:00:07.890> it<00:00:08.040> was<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.189> hard<00:00:08.309> practice<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:09.349> thought

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
stuff it was a hard practice I thought

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.799 
stuff it was a hard practice I thought
we<00:00:10.500> needed<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.889> off<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.250> trip<00:00:11.570> you<00:00:12.570> know<00:00:12.690> we

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
we needed it off the trip you know we

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.330 
we needed it off the trip you know we
took<00:00:12.990> two<00:00:13.170> days<00:00:13.349> off<00:00:13.590> what<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.860> would<00:00:14.160> never

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
took two days off what you would never

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.269 
took two days off what you would never
do<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.759> training<00:00:14.940> camp<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.170> think<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.250> have

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
do in training camp and I think we have

do in training camp and I think we have
to<00:00:17.400> get<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.789> better<00:00:17.910> shape<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.779> with<00:00:19.740> all<00:00:19.949> those

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
to get in better shape so with all those

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.950

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
just look for different combinations

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.280 
just look for different combinations
which<00:01:23.260> will<00:01:23.500> do<00:01:23.710> throughout<00:01:23.980> training<00:01:24.460> camp

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
which will do throughout training camp

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
don't know until they all get together

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.210 
don't know until they all get together
see<00:01:30.430> that<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:32.320> know<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.500> think<00:01:32.710> we<00:01:33.070> have<00:01:33.190> a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220

chance<00:01:33.400> to<00:01:33.580> be<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.700> really<00:01:33.850> good<00:01:34.090> team<00:01:34.240> in<00:01:34.630> the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
chance to be a really good team in the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.510 
chance to be a really good team in the
week<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:40.140> guess<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.380> know<00:01:41.530> this<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:41.980> like<00:01:42.400> I

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
week I guess you know this and like I

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.760 
week I guess you know this and like I
told<00:01:42.550> you<00:01:42.880> after<00:01:43.030> game<00:01:43.360> one<00:01:43.690> it's<00:01:44.620> an

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
told you after game one it's an

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.720 
told you after game one it's an
exhibition<00:01:45.100> game<00:01:45.400> one<00:01:46.260> you<00:01:47.260> know<00:01:47.440> if<00:01:48.010> coaches

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
exhibition game one you know if coaches

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.610 
exhibition game one you know if coaches
made<00:01:49.090> decisions<00:01:49.630> on<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.110> first<00:01:50.320> three<00:01:50.530> or

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
made decisions on the first three or

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.110 
made decisions on the first three or
four<00:01:50.800> exhibition<00:01:51.280> game<00:01:51.430> they<00:01:51.580> probably<00:01:51.820> cut

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
four exhibition game they probably cut

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.690 
four exhibition game they probably cut
half<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.480> leak<00:01:52.660> and<00:01:53.440> it<00:01:53.950> would<00:01:54.160> be<00:01:54.250> left<00:01:54.460> with

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
half the leak and it would be left with

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.940 
half the leak and it would be left with
nothing<00:01:54.850> now<00:01:55.630> so<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.050> just<00:01:56.380> don't<00:01:56.620> over

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
nothing now so you just don't over

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.030 
nothing now so you just don't over
