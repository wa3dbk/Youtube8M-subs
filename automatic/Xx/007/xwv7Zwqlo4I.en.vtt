00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.600
 yes people today make the windows 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.740
 Repair at bmw e36 it is 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.910
 around the electric window of the 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.639
 no longer handles properly and that 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.260
 window just goes down wrong 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.840
 to remove the door panel 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.900
 first two screws out one sits 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.699
 down here and the other one is behind 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.539
 the switch for the electric mirrors 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.320
 disguise and that's a talk size 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.910
 25 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:40.110
 I'll write the first under 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:43.590
 out and then with a little one 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:50.129
 screwdriver the switch for the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:55.640
 Remove electrical adjustment and 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:01:01.340
 behind it, it's still up here 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.340
 a top screw we turn out synonymous 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:16.409
 After that we have to cover the for the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.540
 Send the door opener forward 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.560
 and take out 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.470
 then i just go in the screwdriver 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:29.909
 purely solve the clips because easy 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:34.520
 not a bit with taste and arrive 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.520
 then lift off to the top 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:49.500
 still stake out the speaker and the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:55.340
 Door trim ever outside 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.340
 also remove this styrofoam math 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:04.909
 it is simply stuck here 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.909
 Be careful not to break them 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.670
 a bit of fumbling is when you get the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.769
 Glue a bit in the screwdriver 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.500
 Unfortunately, it often does not stay in place 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.970
 was ready that the one you have to travel 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.480
 Then just stick it back on it 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:28.799
 this is a noise protection or learning because 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.239
 math so if that is gone now you have to 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.239
 raise the window again piece 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:44.190
 please until we see the rail here 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.480
 and here we see the reason 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.380
 why he ran out 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:54.690
 the one has his out of one 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.540
 guide rail we have to solve now 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.010
 try again too green as you 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.390
 can see here 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.709
 the window easily bent the bend 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.579
 we now with a water pump pliers 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.579
 Just a little bit straight 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.009
 [Music] 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:30.560
 and then we have time to guide 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.380
 piece is push back where the 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.660
 the windows are sitting on the windows 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.020
 that can then go up and one 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.140
 clips until you click this one 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.750
 and it is completely scaffolded 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:50.830
 after that I still play that 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.830
 whole a bit with a promise 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.520
 everything nice again 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.050
 Now the window should be nice again 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.500
 up and down test mails 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.500
 equal 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.899
 [Music] 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.760
 Afterwards we will see everything together again 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.100
 often because enough on the styrofoam 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.370
 matte the alpiq is still on it 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:31.120
 We can do a bit of the land here 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.400
 to work on it with second adhesive 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.509
 before installing the door panel beforehand 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.919
 again not control whether 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.490
 any recordings like this one 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.180
 case is 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:45.229
 from the cliffs with departed from 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:53.510
 the door panel then simply too 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:55.660
 get out and then where they leave 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.990
 have gone with the door trim 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:05.410
 easy with second adhesive again 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.410
 then stick it on again 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.450
 now the door panel again 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.170
 hang in there we start first 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.170
 or 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:27.590
 first and foremost the speaker again 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:31.400
 plug in the cable for the mirrors 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:40.190
 put adjustment back through and then 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:41.180
 well in front of these clips in front of it 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.260
 Of course, pay attention 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:48.440
 in flow indicator the guide through 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.640
 lead if the door panel up 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.830
 then again received the clips 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.920
 as you see it here again in the 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:02.150
 insert holes and cling firmly and 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:16.190
 then with pressure then back in 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:20.330
 then beat the two screws 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:25.880
 again a screw the longer the 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:31.250
 both sit in the cover up inside 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:34.010
 from the door opener will be back from 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:37.150
 inserted in front and then back to 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.150
 pushed and locked at the back 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:53.489
 here compassionate work that lips 

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:56.319
 do not break off and in there is the whole thing 

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:58.779
 then the plug for the 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:06.009
 electric window adjustment 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:08.949
 flash and back one piece 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.719
 small towns yes people like you seen 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:13.049

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:15.519
 you can do it yourself and 

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:17.769
