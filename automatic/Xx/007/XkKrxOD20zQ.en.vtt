00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.790
 hello friends today what I'm going to 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:10.809
 explain is how to get in a way 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:14.529
 simple that the iphone have a little 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.779
 more than volume is not magic nor is anything 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.850
 difficult simply by using a 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.610
 little logic and I'm sure more than 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.710
 one will have approved it and there will be 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.050
 discovered is also nothing of 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.030
 software is not any application is 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.760
 just a little trick 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.990
 simple okay then let's go to 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.820
 it 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.060
 good as you see I have here my iphone 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.309
 I have already selected a song that 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.430
 we could select any other 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:49.010
 agreement let's put this for example 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.010
 then we are going to listen to it 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.550
 that's how the volume would sound 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.550
 butt 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.570
 that's how it would sound like normal then 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.449
 a very simple trick is to put something to the 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.570
 side of the speaker to make the box 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.570
 resonance 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:12.950
 in this case the sound bounces on my hand 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.950
 and hear a lot more here without a hand 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.020
 it will be appreciated too much in the video but 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.790
 the truth in person you can try it and 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.130
 yes it shows 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.310
 another option is to put for example a 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.310
 glass 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.609
 what happens with a glass 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.750
 it changes the sound quite then what 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.670
 that I prefer is either to use the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.979
 hand or look for something more open 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.150
 good in this case well, well, 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.150
 any position 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.250
 almost 50 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.450
 well this I do not know if it's too good 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.330
 to stop the music a little 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.819
 I do not know if it sounds too good in the 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.310
 video but good is a simple trick 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.319
 when you're at a friend's house or 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.810
 something you want is to show a video or a 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.090
 song and you do not hear enough then 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.330
 good then anything or with the same 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.590
 hand if you take it like that simply with no 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.860
 cover 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.920
 the speaker what you have to do is 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.260
 try to make sounding board 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.640
 they also sell some gadgets that they 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.450
 you put here and they make the soundboard 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.700
 but this is something that we 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.830
 catch it out there and we want to make it just 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.650
 a little bit more is a simple trick I hope 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.480
 that serves you and if you do not know it then 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.480
 well you know something more about the iphone
