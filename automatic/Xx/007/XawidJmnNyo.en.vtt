00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.240
 good 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.700
 there are categories like you but it is 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.200
 very good and good guys today we are 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.939
 I return with a mode called mountain 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.099
 criticism good guys we are 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.739
 frustrated by the psir created and then 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.809
 he said he was going to update what 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.880
 that exists that is the way that aduriz 

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:27.670
 and well for now we have now 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.370
 4 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.230
 spam eggs in it when it has 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.040
 added mut the skeleton of the mutant 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.470
 zombies 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.690
 in a mutual way between what are the 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.309
 main the good guys how can 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.160
 see this here on the map I already have what 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.450
 destroyed now you will see why but 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.000
 well let's start at the moment we have 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.920
 almudena skeleton not as you can see is 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.739
 a skeleton what is a little more 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.970
 I do not know, but it has the same 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.840
 mentality of what a skeleton is 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.699
 normal as you can see if he attacks it then 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.750
 throws us what are the arrows this to 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:05.379
 the norm we're not going to kill him do not let go 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.050
 dies dies dies and then good guys to the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.600
 to kill him is going to appropriate what they are 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.010
 three skeletons that well this 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.650
 It would be great the guys because if 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.210
 we kill face another three more but 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.850
 well we go to the next the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.830
 next would be the zombie mutant like 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.740
 can see guys is a lot more zombie 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.160
 big and stronger and good guys 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.200
 I think that as he is told kill him 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.030
 double and so good to attack it gives us a 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.880
 sound of a zombie pig but to see 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.590
 dies and if they are fixed or what are the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.670
 particles as if they were of res so 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.100
 dying dies dies dies 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.799
 and good guys to kill it also goes 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.540
 to hit what are three zombies that 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.680
 Well, I think that would be everyone 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.810
 the all the maps of the implant mods 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.600
 even not the next one would be the mutan 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.640
 in derman that as we can see is the most 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.680
 double from where the brother and win 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.930
 you saw, and well, he has four 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.330
 eyes and four arms and they are bigger 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.280
 so let me kill him and well 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.539
 every time we attack it, that is what we 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.440
 that this one to transport to another place 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.750
 as you can see so dies spectrum 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.940
 it's kind of boring the guys but 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.830
 Well, I'll see if you're already a 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.540
 great youtube and creates very good ways the 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.540
 I really like the monset circle 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.240
 but good stupid good German the one 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.700
 follow would be the mutant as you can see 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.530
 It is the mutant clipper and good for you 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.540
 aggravates what is this what is the face 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.770
 from here as you can say you can 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.500
 fix on what has your face with a 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.510
 little smaller and so good when attacking 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.580
 we are going to be overwhelmed what are mini clippers 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.650
 babies who are also going to 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.750
 explode as well as good right now 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.900
 that's how the basic one died, but it does not die 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.400
 dies dies dead and your babies die 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.400
 die die die 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.459
 dies dies dies the mutant that I believe 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.680
 which is something as you can see us 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.379
 destroys almost half of the map 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.879
 guys better I feel more to destroy what 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.220
 which are the structures as you can see 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.500
 destroy what is a part of the air 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.330
 because you're angry a part of the map 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.819
 that has built and so good this 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.069
 is the mold mutates in criteria if they want 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.260
 know with the circus will do us the 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.830
 updates of what this mode is 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.930
 in the description is the download your 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.010
 twitter so they are reporting and 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.560
 well 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.720
 it is not what is investigated and 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.040
 true then to eat that poster your 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.209
 twitter and then yes who also my 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.159
 twitter and there I'm going to 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.480
 remove them the fence and well 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.959

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.959
