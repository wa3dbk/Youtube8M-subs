okay<00:00:01.680> we<00:00:01.770> decided<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.310> redo<00:00:02.639> this<00:00:02.820> video

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
okay we decided to redo this video

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.789 
okay we decided to redo this video
because<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.600> last<00:00:03.810> one<00:00:04.020> was<00:00:04.140> poorly<00:00:04.470> made

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
because the last one was poorly made

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.099 
because the last one was poorly made
what<00:00:05.490> you<00:00:05.609> do<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.910> go<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.509> middle<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.049> the

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
what you do you go to the middle of the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.799 
what you do you go to the middle of the
staircase<00:00:07.529> for<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.550> glitch<00:00:08.790> right<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
staircase for the glitch right in the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.980 
staircase for the glitch right in the
middle<00:00:10.019> kill<00:00:10.500> yourself<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.190> then<00:00:12.179> wait<00:00:12.809> till

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
middle kill yourself and then wait till

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.910 
middle kill yourself and then wait till
the<00:00:13.049> next<00:00:13.200> round<00:00:14.660> so<00:00:15.660> we'll<00:00:16.289> cut<00:00:16.590> straight<00:00:16.859> to

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
the next round so we'll cut straight to

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.410 
the next round so we'll cut straight to
the<00:00:17.070> next<00:00:17.400> round<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.000> don't<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.270> to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
the next round so you don't have to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:27.109 
the next round so you don't have to
watch<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:23.840> okay<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:25.650> finally<00:00:26.340> got<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.880> start

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
watch it okay we finally got it to start

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.589 
watch it okay we finally got it to start
glitching<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.070> there<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.220> go<00:00:29.390> they<00:00:30.390> should

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
glitching so there you go they should

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.389 
glitching so there you go they should
start<00:00:30.929> launching<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.529> second<00:00:32.480> and<00:00:34.399> we

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
start launching in a second and we

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.150 
start launching in a second and we
actually<00:00:35.430> got<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.360> go<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.570> them<00:00:36.870> much

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
actually got it to go on them much

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.389 
actually got it to go on them much
earlier<00:00:38.160> round<00:00:38.629> so<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.290> exactly<00:00:40.739> in

earlier round so if you get exactly in

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.340 
earlier round so if you get exactly in
the<00:00:41.520> middle<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.270> stairs<00:00:42.660> you'll<00:00:43.079> start

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
the middle of this stairs you'll start

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:52.430 
the middle of this stairs you'll start
flying<00:00:46.489> up<00:00:47.489> there<00:00:47.969> they<00:00:48.120> go<00:00:51.020> see<00:00:52.020> they<00:00:52.199> start

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
doing you also fly over there I also go

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.820 
doing you also fly over there I also go
all<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.480> way<00:01:47.510> up<00:01:47.660> there<00:01:47.870> and<00:01:48.200> some<00:01:48.560> of<00:01:48.680> them

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
all the way up there and some of them

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.520 
all the way up there and some of them
even<00:01:48.920> hit<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.250> guy<00:01:49.550> and<00:01:49.940> then<00:01:50.180> rip<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:51.350> half

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
even hit the guy and then rip in half

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:03.670 
even hit the guy and then rip in half
and<00:01:51.830> die<00:02:01.479> yeah<00:02:02.479> as<00:02:02.690> you<00:02:02.930> get<00:02:03.170> higher<00:02:03.350> in<00:02:03.410> the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
and die yeah as you get higher in the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.580 
and die yeah as you get higher in the
rounds<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.580> more<00:02:04.790> zombies<00:02:05.330> come<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:05.960> they

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
rounds the more zombies come and they

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.910 
rounds the more zombies come and they
run<00:02:06.890> faster<00:02:07.610> so<00:02:07.910> they<00:02:08.210> start<00:02:09.170> flying<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.710> lot

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
run faster so they start flying a lot

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.900 
run faster so they start flying a lot
more<00:02:10.220> give<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.210> an<00:02:11.330> example<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.900> that<00:02:11.990> in<00:02:12.260> the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
more give you an example of that in the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:21.850 
more give you an example of that in the
probably<00:02:13.910> about<00:02:14.090> 30<00:02:14.390> seconds<00:02:20.500> okay<00:02:21.500> we<00:02:21.620> just

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
probably about 30 seconds okay we just

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.610 
probably about 30 seconds okay we just
went<00:02:22.040> ahead<00:02:22.160> one<00:02:22.550> round<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.350> they've<00:02:24.350> already

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
went ahead one round and they've already

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.710 
went ahead one round and they've already
started<00:02:24.950> flying<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.670> lot<00:02:25.790> farther<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.420> faster

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
started flying a lot farther and faster

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.260 
started flying a lot farther and faster
one<00:02:27.320> through<00:02:27.560> there<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.250> all<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:28.970> way<00:02:29.030> over

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
one through there and all the way over

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:37.150 
one through there and all the way over
there<00:02:30.220> let's<00:02:31.220> eat<00:02:31.310> there<00:02:31.550> they<00:02:31.640> go<00:02:33.160> oh<00:02:36.160> there

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
there let's eat there they go oh there

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
bit faster if it was one more round he

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.490 
bit faster if it was one more round he
would<00:02:40.670> have<00:02:40.760> cleared<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.540> cabinet<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.260> gone

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
10 and we just started so wait for the

10 and we just started so wait for the
somme<00:04:24.250> used<00:04:24.520> to<00:04:24.580> come<00:04:24.760> here<00:04:25.050> we<00:04:26.050> should<00:04:26.110> see

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
somme used to come here we should see

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.290 
somme used to come here we should see
some<00:04:27.390> pretty<00:04:28.390> good<00:04:28.570> flights<00:04:30.120> since<00:04:31.120> we

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
some pretty good flights since we

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.969 
some pretty good flights since we
started<00:04:31.510> from<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.900> beginning<00:04:32.050> we<00:04:32.500> can't<00:04:32.740> miss

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
started from the beginning we can't miss

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.500 
started from the beginning we can't miss
any<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.580> stuff<00:04:33.820> that<00:04:34.030> we<00:04:34.120> normally<00:04:34.330> do<00:04:36.510> it

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
any of the stuff that we normally do it

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.100 
any of the stuff that we normally do it
seems<00:04:37.720> like<00:04:37.900> they<00:04:38.020> fly<00:04:38.350> best<00:04:38.680> on<00:04:38.950> round<00:04:39.220> 12

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
seems like they fly best on round 12

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.930 
seems like they fly best on round 12
yeah<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.800> only<00:04:41.950> problems<00:04:42.460> is<00:04:42.580> when<00:04:42.729> you<00:04:42.820> get

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
yeah the only problems is when you get

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.360 
yeah the only problems is when you get
to<00:04:43.060> a<00:04:43.090> higher<00:04:43.360> rounds<00:04:43.990> make<00:04:44.890> sure<00:04:44.919> you<00:04:45.160> don't
