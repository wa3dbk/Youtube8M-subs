is incredibly slippery and we're going
to<00:00:48.420> show<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.629> how<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.649> works<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.340> your<00:00:50.430> guns

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
to show you how that works on your guns

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.900 
to show you how that works on your guns
let<00:00:52.050> me<00:00:52.140> demonstrate<00:00:52.289> how<00:00:52.710> thin<00:00:53.280> super<00:00:53.699> works

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
let me demonstrate how thin super works

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.209 
let me demonstrate how thin super works
I<00:00:54.210> will<00:00:54.690> take<00:00:54.870> these<00:00:55.050> two<00:00:55.260> business<00:00:55.680> cards<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
I will take these two business cards and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.319 
I will take these two business cards and
tear<00:00:56.879> them<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.149> half<00:00:57.410> these<00:00:58.410> pieces<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.980> paper

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
tear them in half these pieces of paper

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.689 
tear them in half these pieces of paper
will<00:01:00.329> simulate<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:01.649> example<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> slide<00:01:02.489> on

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
will simulate for example the slide on

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.119 
will simulate for example the slide on
my<00:01:02.809> semi-automatic<00:01:03.809> let<00:01:04.409> me<00:01:04.500> show<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.769> why

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
my semi-automatic let me show you why

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.030 
my semi-automatic let me show you why
gun<00:01:05.430> oil<00:01:05.640> does<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:05.970> work<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:07.530> half<00:01:07.799> of

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
gun oil does not work on one half of

gun oil does not work on one half of
these<00:01:08.220> pee<00:01:08.520> business<00:01:09.030> cards<00:01:09.450> we<00:01:09.960> will<00:01:10.080> put

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
these pee business cards we will put

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.609 
these pee business cards we will put
normal<00:01:10.799> gun<00:01:11.040> oil<00:01:13.909> co<00:01:14.909> easily<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.960> leaks<00:01:16.350> out

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
normal gun oil co easily it leaks out

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.039 
normal gun oil co easily it leaks out
when<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.400> push<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:19.670> makes<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.790> mess<00:01:21.049> also

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
when I push on it and makes a mess also

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.780 
when I push on it and makes a mess also
notice<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.530> when<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.799> put<00:01:23.070> pressure<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
notice that when I put pressure on the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.450 
notice that when I put pressure on the
paper<00:01:24.200> approximately<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.650> hundred<00:01:25.950> pounds<00:01:26.250> per

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
paper approximately a hundred pounds per

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.230 
paper approximately a hundred pounds per
square<00:01:26.490> inch<00:01:27.020> there's<00:01:28.020> actually<00:01:28.439> no<00:01:28.650> oil

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
square inch there's actually no oil

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.490 
square inch there's actually no oil
where<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.420> need<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> most<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
where you need it the most to the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.670 
where you need it the most to the
pressure<00:01:31.710> points<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.420> add<00:01:33.600> sand<00:01:34.140> into

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
pressure points now if I add sand into

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.999 
pressure points now if I add sand into
this<00:01:34.829> mix<00:01:35.189> you'll<00:01:36.000> see<00:01:36.240> how<00:01:36.390> big<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> mess<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
this mix you'll see how big a mess the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.560 
this mix you'll see how big a mess the
wet<00:01:38.189> gun<00:01:38.520> oil<00:01:38.729> makes<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:40.579> how<00:01:41.579> abrasive<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.780> is

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
wet gun oil makes and how abrasive it is

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.969 
wet gun oil makes and how abrasive it is
now<00:01:45.570> we're<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> same<00:01:46.259> test<00:01:46.619> with

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
now we're going to do the same test with

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.569 
now we're going to do the same test with
inner<00:01:47.460> fawns<00:01:47.930> fin<00:01:48.930> super<00:01:49.439> dry<00:01:49.799> lubricant<00:01:50.430> and
