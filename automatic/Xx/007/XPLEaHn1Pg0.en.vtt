got a three cylinder engine which is a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.880 
got a three cylinder engine which is a
very<00:01:27.570> different<00:01:27.840> design<00:01:28.140> from<00:01:28.619> what<00:01:28.740> you've

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
very different design from what you've

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.649 
very different design from what you've
seen<00:01:29.100> before<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.790> cylinders<00:01:30.360> are<00:01:30.390> not

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
seen before the cylinders are not

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.410 
seen before the cylinders are not
connected<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.259> one<00:01:31.409> another<00:01:31.439> there<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.100> one

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
connected to one another there is one

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.149 
connected to one another there is one
thick<00:01:33.420> beam<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.960> between<00:01:34.290> each<00:01:34.470> cylinders<00:01:34.979> so

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
thick beam in between each cylinders so

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.410 
thick beam in between each cylinders so
that's<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.460> neat<00:01:35.670> design<00:01:37.579> okay<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.790> before<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.270> do

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
that's a neat design okay so before I do

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.530 
that's a neat design okay so before I do
a<00:01:39.540> quick<00:01:39.810> demonstration<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.860> want<00:01:41.040> to

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
windshield wipers and we've actually got

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.410 
windshield wipers and we've actually got
two<00:01:57.659> speed<00:01:58.110> working<00:01:58.469> windshield<00:01:59.009> wipers<00:01:59.420> so

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
two speed working windshield wipers so

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.580 
two speed working windshield wipers so
here<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.780> slow<00:02:01.079> speed<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:03.110> this<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.320> fast

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
here are the slow speed and this is fast

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.870 
here are the slow speed and this is fast
speed

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
speed

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.090 
speed
okay<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.090> next<00:02:07.240> is<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.690> retractable<00:02:08.319> roof

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.030 

power<00:02:15.100> functions<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.800> then<00:02:18.370> it's<00:02:18.610> got

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
power functions and then it's got

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.770 
power functions and then it's got
front-wheel<00:02:21.040> drive<00:02:21.069> as<00:02:21.880> you<00:02:22.090> can<00:02:22.209> see<00:02:22.420> and

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
front-wheel drive as you can see and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.830 
front-wheel drive as you can see and
there<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.739> a<00:02:23.770> large<00:02:24.550> motor<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.209> drives<00:02:25.239> each

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
there is a large motor that drives each

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.380 
there is a large motor that drives each
front<00:02:26.319> wheel<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.430> there's<00:02:27.610> no<00:02:27.790> differential

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
front wheel so there's no differential

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.340 
front wheel so there's no differential
in<00:02:28.510> or<00:02:28.600> anything<00:02:28.750> in<00:02:29.050> here<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.880> all<00:02:31.060> just

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
in or anything in here it is all just

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.410 
in or anything in here it is all just
two<00:02:32.350> separate<00:02:32.770> motors<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.760> then<00:02:34.030> finally

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
two separate motors and then finally

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.840 
two separate motors and then finally
you've<00:02:34.540> got<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.720> servo<00:02:35.170> motor<00:02:35.730> for<00:02:36.730> your

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
you've got a servo motor for your

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.140 
you've got a servo motor for your
steering<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:39.340> you've<00:02:39.519> got<00:02:39.640> returned<00:02:39.970> to

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
steering so you've got returned to

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.080 
steering so you've got returned to
Center<00:02:40.420> steering<00:02:40.780> on<00:02:40.900> everything<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:42.090> let's

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
Center steering on everything so let's

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.910 
Center steering on everything so let's
do<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.300> quick<00:02:43.600> demonstration<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:44.560> can<00:02:44.709> see

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
do a quick demonstration so you can see

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.620 
do a quick demonstration so you can see
how<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.519> works<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.120> here<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.450> we're<00:02:46.570> gonna

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
how it works so here it is we're gonna

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.590 
how it works so here it is we're gonna
do<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> real<00:02:47.140> quick<00:02:47.170> demonstration<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:49.330> again

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
do a real quick demonstration so again

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:58.220 
do a real quick demonstration so again
just<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.989> convertible<00:02:50.680> roof

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:13.559 

and<00:02:58.890> then<00:02:59.099> let's<00:02:59.310> drive<00:02:59.550> it

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.250 

then<00:03:14.409> the<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.859> convertible<00:03:15.489> roof<00:03:18.959> just<00:03:19.959> turn

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
then the the convertible roof just turn

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
then the the convertible roof just turn
it<00:03:20.349> around<00:03:20.469> here<00:03:20.859> and<00:03:20.980> we'll<00:03:21.069> take<00:03:21.219> another

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
it around here and we'll take another

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:41.440 
it around here and we'll take another
look<00:03:21.639> at<00:03:21.879> the<00:03:21.969> windshield<00:03:22.359> wipers

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.670 

so<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.599> thing<00:03:42.780> is<00:03:42.900> pretty<00:03:42.930> neat<00:03:43.260> guys<00:03:43.470> has

so this thing is pretty neat guys has
about<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:43.950> thousand<00:03:44.459> pieces<00:03:44.610> this<00:03:45.000> thing<00:03:45.180> is

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
about a thousand pieces this thing is

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.149 
about a thousand pieces this thing is
loaded<00:03:45.629> and<00:03:45.989> loaded<00:03:46.379> loaded<00:03:46.620> with<00:03:46.890> power

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
loaded and loaded loaded with power

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.929 
loaded and loaded loaded with power
functions<00:03:47.640> it's<00:03:48.120> really<00:03:48.510> neat<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.579> uses

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:50.939 
functions it's really neat it it uses

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.569 
functions it's really neat it it uses
some<00:03:51.360> 2014<00:03:52.170> parts<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.739> are<00:03:52.860> not<00:03:53.010> available

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
some 2014 parts that are not available

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.270 
some 2014 parts that are not available
here<00:03:54.120> in<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.269> US<00:03:54.480> yet<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.079> uses<00:03:55.500> about<00:03:55.650> four<00:03:56.099> or

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
here in the US yet it uses about four or

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.349 
here in the US yet it uses about four or
five<00:03:56.930> pieces<00:03:57.930> from<00:03:58.230> 2014<00:03:59.010> sets<00:03:59.340> so<00:03:59.640> if<00:03:59.849> you

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
five pieces from 2014 sets so if you

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.789 
five pieces from 2014 sets so if you
want<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.780> build<00:04:01.019> this<00:04:01.170> model<00:04:01.379> you're<00:04:01.680> either

want to build this model you're either

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.319 
want to build this model you're either
gonna<00:04:01.980> have<00:04:02.099> to<00:04:02.280> order<00:04:02.519> some<00:04:02.790> of<00:04:02.819> those<00:04:02.970> parts

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
gonna have to order some of those parts

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.229 
gonna have to order some of those parts
off<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:04.140> brick<00:04:04.349> link<00:04:04.620> or<00:04:04.769> wait<00:04:04.950> until<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.430> the
