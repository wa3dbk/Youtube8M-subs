the tank destroyer will bless her

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.530 
the tank destroyer will bless her
firepower<00:01:35.590> they<00:01:36.250> weren't<00:01:36.550> exactly<00:01:36.790> able<00:01:37.360> to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
firepower they weren't exactly able to

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.050

up<00:01:37.780> gun<00:01:38.080> it<00:01:38.260> nor<00:01:38.590> they<00:01:39.070> were<00:01:39.130> able<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:39.670> really

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
up gun it nor they were able to really

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.720 
up gun it nor they were able to really
use<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.140> effectively<00:01:41.410> because<00:01:42.040> by<00:01:42.220> then<00:01:42.460> the
