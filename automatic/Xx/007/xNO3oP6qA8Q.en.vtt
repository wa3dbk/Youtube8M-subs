00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:10.700
 Heuwaage 1975, a shuttle train leaves for Binningen 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.440
 From 1974 ticket machines were introduced 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:33.440
 The old Heuwaagen_gebÃ¤ude is in Rheinfelden today 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:47.860
 The depot in Oberwil, it was in the middle of the village 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.140
 But the rolling stock was labeled BTB 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.060
 Already 1 year later the BLT lettering was applied 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.280
 The towing vehicle 11, already with billboards 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.800
 That did not exist at the BTB 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.180
 as before, 6 old middle cars were in use 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.220
 Watch the BTB-VW bus 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.220
 Motor vehicle 12 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.080
 Railroad crossing Willmattstrasse still open 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.000
 The railroad crossing was closed in 1978 after a collision with a Porsche for cars 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.320
 The old railway station Therwil. It was demolished later that year. 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.300
 In Ettingen direction station. Today, everything is double track. 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.640
 oberwil 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.260
 Between Bottmingen and Bottminger mill, today is the station battery terrace 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.120
 at that time already double track 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.360
 Binningen, direction Basel 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.320
 Upstream, the commuter trains were always pushed. Control car always up the valley 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.780
 Once again in Binningen 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.900
 Here two commuter trains regularly crossed, also on Sunday 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.400
 Even then people have saved points. 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.060
 Doubling the track costs less at such a short distance 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.100
 Oberdorf direction Binningen 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.040
 THE END
