with our little earth box that little
thing<00:00:57.569> is<00:00:57.659> responsible<00:00:58.229> for<00:00:58.350> something<00:00:58.499> quite

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
thing is responsible for something quite

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.309

special<00:00:59.069> isn't<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.519> it<00:00:59.729> certainly<00:01:00.089> is<00:01:00.420> there

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:01.319 
special isn't it it certainly is there

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.439 
special isn't it it certainly is there
is<00:01:01.559> how<00:01:02.460> vehicle<00:01:02.729> it's<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> little<00:01:03.120> shelf

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
is how vehicle it's like a little shelf

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.820 
is how vehicle it's like a little shelf
that's<00:01:03.629> about<00:01:03.870> three<00:01:04.140> or<00:01:04.230> four<00:01:04.380> inches<00:01:04.410> off

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
that's about three or four inches off

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.130 
that's about three or four inches off
the<00:01:05.100> base<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.850> aeration<00:01:06.180> screen<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.900> allows

the base the aeration screen that allows

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.750 
the base the aeration screen that allows
the<00:01:07.350> oxygen<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.070> get<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> roots<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.700> the

the oxygen to get to the roots of the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.490 
the oxygen to get to the roots of the
plant<00:01:09.060> very<00:01:09.450> very<00:01:09.750> important<00:01:10.050> people<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.380> get

plant very very important people to get

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.590 
plant very very important people to get
that<00:01:10.650> oxygen<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.280> vital<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.210> roots<00:01:12.390> to

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
that oxygen is vital for the roots to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.420 
that oxygen is vital for the roots to
keep<00:01:12.780> alive<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.800> this<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.220> first

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
principle is good aeration of the roots

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.020 
principle is good aeration of the roots
that's<00:01:16.200> exactly<00:01:16.770> right<00:01:16.800> and<00:01:17.190> blue<00:01:17.550> generation

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that's exactly right and blue generation

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.720 
that's exactly right and blue generation

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
can see right under here you don't see

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.250 
can see right under here you don't see
it<00:01:26.790> from<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.030> front<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.510> is<00:01:27.660> under<00:01:27.960> here

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
it from the front but it is under here

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.710 
it from the front but it is under here
and<00:01:28.440> any<00:01:29.070> excess<00:01:29.580> water<00:01:29.760> will<00:01:30.120> drain<00:01:30.330> out<00:01:30.390> at

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and any excess water will drain out at

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.510 
and any excess water will drain out at
the<00:01:30.810> box<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.350> never<00:01:31.560> over<00:01:32.100> water<00:01:32.280> the

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
then once you have that mound you add

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.640 
then once you have that mound you add
your<00:02:32.909> fertilizer<00:02:33.480> now<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.840> fertilizer<00:02:34.439> you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
the plant and that's why you create this

like a fitted mattress cover you put

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.710 
like a fitted mattress cover you put
that<00:03:57.690> top<00:03:58.019> and<00:03:58.949> this<00:03:59.159> is<00:03:59.370> unusual<00:03:59.970> but<00:04:00.359> what<00:04:00.569> it

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
that top and this is unusual but what it

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.719 
that top and this is unusual but what it
is<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.199> controlling<00:04:01.680> component<00:04:02.459> of<00:04:02.609> the

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
earth box with this no weeds grow you

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.550 
earth box with this no weeds grow you
control<00:04:06.389> the<00:04:06.510> amount<00:04:06.599> of<00:04:06.840> water<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:07.260> gets<00:04:07.379> in

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
control the amount of water that gets in

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.229 
control the amount of water that gets in
the<00:04:07.650> box<00:04:07.829> just<00:04:08.159> imagine<00:04:08.639> if<00:04:08.760> rain<00:04:08.970> came

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
the box just imagine if rain came

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.000 
the box just imagine if rain came
flowing<00:04:09.629> through<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:10.260> would<00:04:10.470> diffuse<00:04:10.829> too

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
flowing through it would diffuse too

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.530 
flowing through it would diffuse too
much<00:04:11.159> fertilizer<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.790> burn<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.120> roots<00:04:12.299> I

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
much fertilizer and burn the roots I

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.490 
much fertilizer and burn the roots I
would<00:04:12.659> wash<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:12.900> out

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
would wash it out

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.229 
would wash it out
we<00:04:13.769> wouldn't<00:04:13.979> be<00:04:14.069> sustainable<00:04:14.669> so<00:04:14.790> we<00:04:14.970> want<00:04:15.150> to

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
we wouldn't be sustainable so we want to

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.180 
we wouldn't be sustainable so we want to
understand<00:04:15.720> but<00:04:15.989> having<00:04:16.470> seen<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.739> results

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
understand but having seen the results

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.370 
understand but having seen the results
and<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:18.030> science<00:04:18.359> is<00:04:18.479> good<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:19.169> works

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
and the science is good it works

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.229 
and the science is good it works
brilliantly<00:04:19.560> now<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.609> other<00:04:20.729> thing<00:04:20.909> I<00:04:21.000> kind

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
brilliantly now the other thing I kind

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.969 
brilliantly now the other thing I kind
of<00:04:21.269> think<00:04:21.389> of<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.630> stops<00:04:21.900> evaporation<00:04:22.740> as<00:04:22.830> well

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
of think of it stops evaporation as well

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.589 
of think of it stops evaporation as well
that's<00:04:23.340> exactly<00:04:23.820> right<00:04:23.849> well<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.330> one<00:04:24.419> Dave<00:04:24.539> a

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
that's exactly right well the one Dave a

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.060 
that's exactly right well the one Dave a
parade<00:04:24.779> at<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:24.900> saw<00:04:25.050> means<00:04:25.289> less<00:04:25.710> watering

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
parade at the saw means less watering

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.360 
parade at the saw means less watering
yeah

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
yeah

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.379 
yeah
yes<00:04:26.639> 52

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
yes 52

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.540 
yes 52
xD<00:04:27.569> %<00:04:27.960> less<00:04:28.169> watering<00:04:28.560> than<00:04:28.800> in<00:04:28.949> traditional

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
xD % less watering than in traditional

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.730 
xD % less watering than in traditional
methods<00:04:30.030> of<00:04:30.180> conventional<00:04:30.810> farming<00:04:31.259> it's
