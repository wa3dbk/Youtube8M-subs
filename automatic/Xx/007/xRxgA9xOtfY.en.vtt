00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.350
 with the right model selection are 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.880
 can be the runner and 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.680
 Body weight is crucial 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.470
 factors at the right lengths 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.359
 selection helps on the one hand the fishermen 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.490
 length recommendation and then it goes to 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.099
 individual fine tuning on the fischer 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.320
 hard disk before the ski on the 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.909
 hard disk comes over los point of 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.849
 skis by means of a blade stall 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:31.640
 Definitely we'll keep it under here 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.559
 if you have the ballons point take 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.010
 we set the ski and set the ballons point 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.640
 on the zero to measure de ski provides 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.699
 the customer on the ski and with the 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.590
 foot tips to the zero point we simulate 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.870
 now the same position on the ski 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.260
 both shoot equally loaded 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.289
 it should be possible the test 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.949
 plate about 35 centimeters to the front 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.239
 move and about to the verses 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.940
 to push backwards 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.129
 if that is possible then that lies 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.540
 staig zone with wax or with the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.670
 The crowns were not cut on the bottom 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.619
 snow on and thus is an optimal 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.259
 glide possible if it is not possible 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.259
 then the ski is too strong on the 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.509
 underlay on the brake when running and 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.130
 the fun factor naturally sinks in 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.560
 next step will be a leg 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.680
 Gliding simulates the runner 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.930
 all over on one foot should now 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.530
 it may be possible the hard disk to about 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.390
 20 inches forward and up to the 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.909
 midfoot to move backwards 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.040
 then 1 1 is optimal when gliding 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.409
 it becomes possible in the third step 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.869
 Safe repulsion simulates this 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.939
 The runner on the forefoot now 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.369
 it should not be possible anymore 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.350
 to move the ruler if that 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.509
 case then any time a 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.310
 Optimal graduation possible if 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.469
 let the measuring staff move now 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.350
 then there is no interlocking between 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.329
 the snow and the wax or the wax 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.430
 crowns cut a flourish and 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.530
 a sure repulsion are not now 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.180
 more guaranteed if the optimal 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.799
 is found then the 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.920
 individual wax marks 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.950
 appropriate 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.690
 will accompany the far from the far 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.819
 area in which the hard disk is free 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.660
 lets move for dry waxes 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.660
 marked 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.300
 analogously, it will slide on a leg 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.069
 the area in which the hard disk 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:36.069
 lets move freely for the cluster 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:38.620
 Wax marks after we have the 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.040
 have found matching classic search 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.900
 we now have the right skating skis 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.130
 Runner is standing with both foot tips in the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.680
 Area of zero points 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.959
 starting from when are now sliding 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.760
 both ski evenly loaded now 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.980
 should be the hard drive forward 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.500
 let move to +40 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.569
 and back to just behind the heel 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.940
 in the next step it will be a leg 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.700
 slide tested while the runner stands 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.519
 on a foot all over the ski 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.130
 Now the hard drive should be up front 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.780
 plus 30 to be movable and to the rear 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.450
 to minus 15 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.400
 So in the ratio of two-thirds 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.560
 one third can be the hard drive too 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.360
 then be moved a lot or too little 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.400
 is an optimal glide for this 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.500
 runners are not possible to graduate 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.410
 the repulsion tested is the 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.650
 runners on the ball of foot now should be 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.870
 the hard drive forward to +20 and 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.630
 move back to -10 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.700
 the hard disk should become noticeable too 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.709
 then move a lot or too little 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.090
 is an optimal repulsion for the runners 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.739
 not possible now we have the 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.450
 right ski for both techniques 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.829
 now we can start 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.829
 Have fun while cross-country skiing
