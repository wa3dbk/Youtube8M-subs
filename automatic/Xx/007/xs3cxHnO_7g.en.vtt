maybe it gives Ozzy Alonso a chance to
recover<00:01:34.259> from<00:01:34.560> injury<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.310> if<00:01:35.670> that's<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
recover from injury so if that's the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.999 
recover from injury so if that's the
case<00:01:36.299> then<00:01:36.540> yes<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.960> does<00:01:37.110> favor<00:01:37.350> Seattle<00:01:37.829> but

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
case then yes it does favor Seattle but

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950 
case then yes it does favor Seattle but
in<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.460> end<00:01:38.579> based<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.119> form<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.630> everything

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
in the end based on form and everything

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.480 
in the end based on form and everything
else<00:01:40.140> I'm<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.530> sure<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.829> really<00:01:40.890> makes<00:01:41.280> that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
else I'm not sure it really makes that

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.789 
else I'm not sure it really makes that
much<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.909> difference<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:43.380> know<00:01:43.409> la<00:01:43.770> is

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
much of a difference you know la is

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.710 
much of a difference you know la is
coming<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> 50<00:01:44.610> win<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.390> I'm<00:01:45.540> sure

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
coming out of the 50 win and I'm sure

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.910 
coming out of the 50 win and I'm sure
they<00:01:45.840> would<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.259> play<00:01:46.409> right<00:01:46.619> away<00:01:46.770> but

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
they would like to play right away but

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.590 
they would like to play right away but
but<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> end<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.939> game's<00:01:48.149> going<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.360> come

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
but in the end the game's going to come

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.510 
but in the end the game's going to come
down<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> performance<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.649> field<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.189> now

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
down to performance on the field and now

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.730 
down to performance on the field and now
who's<00:01:50.759> ready<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.030> compete<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:51.990> Alonso's<00:01:52.530> so

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
who's ready to compete in Alonso's so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.679 
who's ready to compete in Alonso's so
important<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.280> know<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:54.060> how<00:01:54.299> important

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
important we know we know how important

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.940 
important we know we know how important
is<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.840> think<00:01:54.990> probably<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.290> best<00:01:55.500> defensive

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
is I think probably the best defensive

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.590 
is I think probably the best defensive
midfielder<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.399> MLS<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:57.119> probably<00:01:57.329> five

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
midfielder in MLS for probably five

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.380 
midfielder in MLS for probably five
years<00:01:57.869> running<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.770> far<00:01:59.040> he's<00:01:59.670> very<00:01:59.909> important

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
years running so far he's very important

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.719 
years running so far he's very important
not<00:02:00.540> just<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.140> recovery<00:02:01.530> process<00:02:02.219> but<00:02:02.520> he

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
not just in that recovery process but he

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.039 
not just in that recovery process but he
does<00:02:02.969> play<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> ball<00:02:03.570> into<00:02:03.719> dangerous

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
does play the ball into dangerous

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.510 
does play the ball into dangerous
positions<00:02:04.439> he's<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> circulator<00:02:05.189> back<00:02:05.340> there

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
positions he's a circulator back there

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.580 
positions he's a circulator back there
he<00:02:05.820> finds<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> guys<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.570> wing<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.899> lot<00:02:07.110> he's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
he finds the guys on the wing a lot he's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.320 
he finds the guys on the wing a lot he's
important<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.069> both<00:02:08.190> side<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.729> couple<00:02:08.970> playoff

important on both side a couple playoff
goals<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.780> his<00:02:09.929> career<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.530> he<00:02:10.619> comes<00:02:10.860> through

think there's any chance because Robbie

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.539 
think there's any chance because Robbie
Keane<00:02:32.049> will<00:02:32.200> be<00:02:32.319> on<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.560> field<00:02:32.709> Omar<00:02:33.400> Gonzalez

will be on the field those are two

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.690 
will be on the field those are two
pretty<00:02:35.349> important<00:02:35.920> players<00:02:36.129> relay<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.670> I

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
pretty important players relay and I

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.190 
pretty important players relay and I
don't<00:02:36.849> think<00:02:37.030> Jaime<00:02:37.269> peinado<00:02:37.569> is<00:02:37.750> going<00:02:38.140> to

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
don't think Jaime peinado is going to

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.050 
don't think Jaime peinado is going to
have<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:38.379> shocker<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:39.190> he<00:02:39.310> did<00:02:39.489> in<00:02:39.670> that

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
have the shocker that he did in that

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.119 
have the shocker that he did in that
final<00:02:40.420> game<00:02:40.810> in<00:02:40.840> Seattle<00:02:41.349> so<00:02:41.860> no<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.010> don't

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
final game in Seattle so no I don't

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.319 
final game in Seattle so no I don't
think<00:02:42.400> it's<00:02:42.519> going<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.670> be<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.909> same<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.209> one

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
think it's going to be the same the one

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.550 
think it's going to be the same the one
thing<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.569> can't<00:02:43.599> take<00:02:44.049> away<00:02:44.079> from<00:02:44.379> the<00:02:44.440> three

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
thing you can't take away from the three

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.839 
thing you can't take away from the three
games<00:02:44.829> between<00:02:44.980> these<00:02:45.190> two<00:02:45.340> teams<00:02:45.549> this<00:02:45.700> year

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
games between these two teams this year

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.839 
games between these two teams this year
is<00:02:46.000> really<00:02:46.480> all<00:02:47.379> that<00:02:47.620> much<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:48.069> think<00:02:48.610> because

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
is really all that much I think because

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.059 
is really all that much I think because
in<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.510> 30<00:02:49.780> win<00:02:49.989> for<00:02:50.170> LA<00:02:50.379> no<00:02:50.590> Chad<00:02:50.829> Marshall

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
in the 30 win for LA no Chad Marshall

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.130 
in the 30 win for LA no Chad Marshall
there<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.760> two<00:02:51.879> games<00:02:52.090> big<00:02:52.450> losses<00:02:52.750> for<00:02:53.079> the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
there the two games big losses for the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.830 
there the two games big losses for the
other<00:02:53.319> two<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.709> I<00:02:53.739> think<00:02:53.859> as<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.700> stands<00:02:55.060> you

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
other two so I think as it stands you

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.839 
other two so I think as it stands you
take<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.079> little<00:02:56.319> bit<00:02:56.560> from<00:02:56.829> each<00:02:56.980> but<00:02:57.400> on<00:02:57.700> the

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
take a little bit from each but on the

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.150 
take a little bit from each but on the
big<00:02:58.030> picture<00:02:58.060> side<00:02:58.629> not<00:02:59.140> that<00:02:59.319> much<00:02:59.500> yeah<00:03:00.040> I'd

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
big picture side not that much yeah I'd

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.819 
big picture side not that much yeah I'd
agree<00:03:00.310> i<00:03:00.519> think<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.299> sets<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.780> drama<00:03:02.290> quite<00:03:02.799> a

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
agree i think it sets the drama quite a

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.949 
agree i think it sets the drama quite a
bit<00:03:03.069> for<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.400> series<00:03:03.819> because<00:03:04.450> these<00:03:04.750> two

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
bit for the series because these two

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.809 
bit for the series because these two
teams<00:03:05.200> absolutely<00:03:06.069> know<00:03:06.220> each<00:03:06.370> other<00:03:06.579> they've

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
teams absolutely know each other they've

teams absolutely know each other they've

about<00:03:38.980> on<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.250> same<00:03:39.489> and<00:03:39.700> it's<00:03:39.910> mostly

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
about on the same and it's mostly

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.479 
about on the same and it's mostly
because<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.630> think<00:03:41.079> they<00:03:41.230> match<00:03:41.530> up<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:42.040> well

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
because I think they match up so well

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.190 
because I think they match up so well
against<00:03:42.940> each<00:03:43.030> other<00:03:43.209> position<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:44.019> position

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
against each other position to position

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.949 
against each other position to position
and<00:03:44.739> really<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.730> thing<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.060> watch<00:03:46.269> will<00:03:46.750> be

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
and really the thing to watch will be

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.170 
and really the thing to watch will be
well<00:03:47.739> Ziggy<00:03:47.980> Schmidt<00:03:48.310> give<00:03:48.489> freedom<00:03:48.730> for<00:03:49.000> yet

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
well Ziggy Schmidt give freedom for yet

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.150 
well Ziggy Schmidt give freedom for yet
Linda<00:03:49.480> go<00:03:49.599> into<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.930> attack<00:03:50.200> thus<00:03:50.590> possibly

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
Linda go into the attack thus possibly

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.620 
Linda go into the attack thus possibly
leaving<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.579> space<00:03:51.730> there<00:03:52.120> on<00:03:52.269> their<00:03:52.450> right

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
leaving a space there on their right

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.759 
leaving a space there on their right
flank<00:03:52.810> or<00:03:53.370> will<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.400> be<00:03:54.900> Bruce<00:03:55.900> Arena<00:03:56.109> allowing

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
flank or will it be Bruce Arena allowing

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.440 
flank or will it be Bruce Arena allowing
Robbie<00:03:56.950> Rogers<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.669> go<00:03:57.790> up<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.030> field<00:03:58.239> and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
Robbie Rogers to go up the field and

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.789 
Robbie Rogers to go up the field and
then<00:03:58.599> what<00:03:58.810> does<00:03:58.959> that<00:03:58.989> mean<00:03:59.260> for<00:03:59.440> Seattle

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
then what does that mean for Seattle

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.470 
then what does that mean for Seattle
being<00:03:59.980> able<00:04:00.160> Tech<00:04:00.370> attack<00:04:00.940> on<00:04:01.120> their<00:04:01.299> right

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
being able Tech attack on their right

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.240 
being able Tech attack on their right
side<00:04:01.720> so<00:04:01.989> Ziggy<00:04:02.349> Schmidt<00:04:02.650> can't<00:04:02.919> you<00:04:03.040> let

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
side so Ziggy Schmidt can't you let

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.039 
side so Ziggy Schmidt can't you let
DeAndre<00:04:03.489> Yedlin<00:04:03.700> run<00:04:04.239> all<00:04:04.419> day<00:04:04.450> because<00:04:04.840> he

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
DeAndre Yedlin run all day because he

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.349 
DeAndre Yedlin run all day because he
gets<00:04:05.200> back<00:04:05.470> so<00:04:05.769> quickly<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.579> can<00:04:06.849> but<00:04:07.120> if<00:04:07.209> he's

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
gets back so quickly you can but if he's

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.940 
gets back so quickly you can but if he's
coming<00:04:07.660> back<00:04:07.900> in<00:04:08.079> a<00:04:08.109> situation<00:04:08.319> where<00:04:08.769> Robbie

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
coming back in a situation where Robbie

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.319 
coming back in a situation where Robbie
Keane's<00:04:09.280> gotten<00:04:09.669> the<00:04:09.760> ball<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.120> already

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
Keane's gotten the ball and already

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.629 
Keane's gotten the ball and already
faced<00:04:10.629> up<00:04:10.900> on<00:04:11.109> you<00:04:11.319> that's<00:04:11.949> a<00:04:12.129> tough<00:04:12.340> position

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
faced up on you that's a tough position

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.250 
faced up on you that's a tough position
for<00:04:13.090> him<00:04:13.150> because<00:04:13.329> Landon<00:04:13.690> Donovan's<00:04:14.079> no

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
for him because Landon Donovan's no

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.629 
for him because Landon Donovan's no
slouch<00:04:14.560> either<00:04:14.739> in<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.069> open<00:04:15.310> field<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.609> I

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
slouch either in the open field and I

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.699 
slouch either in the open field and I
think<00:04:15.849> his<00:04:16.030> movement<00:04:16.630> is<00:04:16.750> one<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:17.530> could

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
think his movement is one that could

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.229 
think his movement is one that could
throw<00:04:17.889> down<00:04:18.130> river<00:04:18.340> yet<00:04:18.609> one<00:04:18.760> person<00:04:19.030> yeah

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
throw down river yet one person yeah

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.819 
throw down river yet one person yeah
when<00:04:19.479> Robbie<00:04:19.720> Keane<00:04:20.079> goes<00:04:20.320> into<00:04:20.590> that<00:04:20.709> little

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
when Robbie Keane goes into that little

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.500 
when Robbie Keane goes into that little
channel<00:04:21.280> that's<00:04:21.459> when<00:04:21.640> Landon<00:04:21.969> comes<00:04:22.180> inside

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
channel that's when Landon comes inside

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.450 
channel that's when Landon comes inside
and<00:04:22.719> find<00:04:22.870> space<00:04:23.229> almost<00:04:23.469> like<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:23.770> forward<00:04:24.219> so

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
and find space almost like a forward so

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.250 
and find space almost like a forward so
you<00:04:25.060> know<00:04:25.180> that<00:04:25.360> that<00:04:25.599> that<00:04:25.960> will<00:04:26.169> be

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
you know that that that will be

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.330 
you know that that that will be
intriguing<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.560> see<00:04:26.830> interesting

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
air that's good on set pieces and then a

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.550 
air that's good on set pieces and then a
guy<00:05:12.850> who<00:05:12.910> complements<00:05:13.810> his<00:05:13.990> weaknesses

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
guy who complements his weaknesses

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.290 
guy who complements his weaknesses
really<00:05:14.979> well<00:05:15.190> then<00:05:15.700> you<00:05:15.820> can<00:05:15.970> go<00:05:16.090> to<00:05:16.210> the

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
really well then you can go to the

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.060 
really well then you can go to the
midfield<00:05:16.660> and<00:05:16.810> look<00:05:16.930> at<00:05:17.050> sarvis<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:17.770> Jeanine

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070

own the way they play against Alonso and
Pineda<00:05:21.039> and<00:05:21.370> I<00:05:21.789> think<00:05:22.060> there's<00:05:22.270> a<00:05:22.330> lot<00:05:22.479> of

Pineda and I think there's a lot of
similar<00:05:23.020> these<00:05:23.139> similarities<00:05:23.770> there<00:05:24.160> in

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
similar these similarities there in

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.120 
similar these similarities there in

below 20 LA for me not that Seattle
won't<00:06:02.260> play<00:06:02.530> well<00:06:02.770> I<00:06:02.950> just<00:06:02.979> think<00:06:03.340> robbie

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
won't play well I just think robbie

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.950 
won't play well I just think robbie
keane<00:06:03.940> and<00:06:04.180> landon<00:06:04.450> donovan<00:06:04.780> in<00:06:04.840> their

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
keane and landon donovan in their

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.710 
keane and landon donovan in their
current<00:06:05.169> form<00:06:05.320> and<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:06.340> onus<00:06:06.820> on<00:06:07.030> LA<00:06:07.479> to<00:06:07.539> go

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
current form and the onus on LA to go

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.909 
current form and the onus on LA to go
out<00:06:07.780> and<00:06:07.900> get<00:06:07.990> a<00:06:08.050> result<00:06:08.410> at<00:06:08.530> home<00:06:08.710> I<00:06:08.740> think

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
out and get a result at home I think

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.770 
out and get a result at home I think
they<00:06:09.250> push<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:09.700> issue<00:06:09.789> I<00:06:09.970> think<00:06:10.120> they<00:06:10.419> get<00:06:10.570> two

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
they push the issue I think they get two

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.600 
they push the issue I think they get two
goals<00:06:11.020> Seattle<00:06:11.560> you<00:06:12.039> know<00:06:12.130> they'll<00:06:12.460> get

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
goals Seattle you know they'll get

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.860 
goals Seattle you know they'll get
chances<00:06:12.940> in<00:06:13.090> every<00:06:13.240> game<00:06:13.389> doesn't<00:06:13.750> happen

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
chances in every game doesn't happen

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.420 
chances in every game doesn't happen
form<00:06:14.229> in<00:06:14.320> this<00:06:14.410> one<00:06:14.590> I<00:06:14.620> think<00:06:14.710> la<00:06:15.310> is

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
form in this one I think la is

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.339 
form in this one I think la is
particularly<00:06:15.940> good<00:06:16.150> at<00:06:16.599> clogging<00:06:17.080> up<00:06:17.169> that

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:17.349 
particularly good at clogging up that

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.620 
particularly good at clogging up that
middle<00:06:17.530> and<00:06:17.830> keeping<00:06:18.190> Oba<00:06:18.520> keeping<00:06:18.940> Clint<00:06:19.510> in

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
middle and keeping Oba keeping Clint in

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.719 
middle and keeping Oba keeping Clint in
front<00:06:19.930> of<00:06:20.020> them<00:06:20.110> so<00:06:20.590> 20<00:06:20.830> and<00:06:21.220> then<00:06:21.370> everything

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:21.729 
front of them so 20 and then everything

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:23.310 
front of them so 20 and then everything
to<00:06:21.940> play<00:06:22.120> for<00:06:22.150> one<00:06:22.479> that<00:06:22.630> win<00:06:22.780> a<00:06:22.810> hit<00:06:22.960> Seattle

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
to play for one that win a hit Seattle

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.469 
to play for one that win a hit Seattle
yeah<00:06:23.770> i<00:06:23.800> think<00:06:24.310> that<00:06:24.639> Ziggy<00:06:25.000> Schmidt<00:06:25.330> will

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
yeah i think that Ziggy Schmidt will

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.150 
yeah i think that Ziggy Schmidt will
start<00:06:25.750> with<00:06:25.870> a<00:06:25.900> conservative<00:06:26.530> approach<00:06:26.620> much

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
start with a conservative approach much

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.040 
start with a conservative approach much
like<00:06:27.400> he<00:06:27.490> did<00:06:27.520> in<00:06:27.789> the<00:06:27.880> Dallas<00:06:28.270> series<00:06:28.479> and<00:06:28.840> in

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
like he did in the Dallas series and in

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.570 
like he did in the Dallas series and in
that<00:06:29.200> I<00:06:29.260> think<00:06:29.410> you<00:06:29.770> won't<00:06:29.979> see<00:06:30.250> the<00:06:30.400> outside

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
that I think you won't see the outside

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.969 
that I think you won't see the outside
backs<00:06:31.090> for<00:06:31.330> Seattle<00:06:31.750> attacking<00:06:32.349> that<00:06:32.500> far<00:06:32.770> up

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
backs for Seattle attacking that far up

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:34.379 
backs for Seattle attacking that far up
the<00:06:33.190> field<00:06:33.460> I<00:06:33.639> think<00:06:33.849> they're<00:06:34.000> going<00:06:34.120> to<00:06:34.180> try

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.389 
the field I think they're going to try

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:36.510 
the field I think they're going to try
to<00:06:34.419> protect<00:06:34.840> their<00:06:35.020> backline<00:06:35.469> and<00:06:35.800> limit<00:06:36.490> the

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
to protect their backline and limit the

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.690 
to protect their backline and limit the
space<00:06:36.909> for<00:06:37.180> Donovan<00:06:37.659> and<00:06:37.780> keen<00:06:38.050> but<00:06:38.860> i<00:06:39.159> think

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
space for Donovan and keen but i think

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.100 
space for Donovan and keen but i think
that<00:06:39.760> la<00:06:40.210> still<00:06:40.599> going<00:06:40.840> to<00:06:40.900> make

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
that la still going to make

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.230 
that la still going to make
to<00:06:41.350> be<00:06:41.470> dangerous<00:06:41.950> still<00:06:42.580> going<00:06:42.730> to<00:06:42.790> manage<00:06:43.060> to

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
to be dangerous still going to manage to

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.510 
to be dangerous still going to manage to
find<00:06:43.480> chances<00:06:44.110> and<00:06:44.350> they'll<00:06:44.830> be<00:06:45.010> dangerous<00:06:45.370> on

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
find chances and they'll be dangerous on

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.730 
find chances and they'll be dangerous on
set<00:06:45.730> pieces<00:06:45.880> I<00:06:46.270> think<00:06:46.960> they'll<00:06:47.110> get<00:06:47.200> a<00:06:47.260> 2-0

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
set pieces I think they'll get a 2-0

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.650 
set pieces I think they'll get a 2-0
lead<00:06:47.800> in<00:06:47.980> this<00:06:48.190> one<00:06:48.400> too<00:06:48.610> and<00:06:48.910> it'll<00:06:49.480> be

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
lead in this one too and it'll be

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.240 
lead in this one too and it'll be
interesting<00:06:49.900> going<00:06:50.230> back<00:06:50.530> to<00:06:50.830> Seattle

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
interesting going back to Seattle

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.040 
interesting going back to Seattle
because<00:06:51.340> I<00:06:51.460> don't<00:06:51.970> think<00:06:52.060> it's<00:06:52.480> that<00:06:52.540> much<00:06:53.020> of

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
because I don't think it's that much of

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.250 
because I don't think it's that much of
an<00:06:53.350> edge<00:06:53.560> other<00:06:54.010> than<00:06:54.730> it<00:06:54.880> allows<00:06:55.240> LA<00:06:55.780> to<00:06:55.840> sit

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
an edge other than it allows LA to sit

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.410 
an edge other than it allows LA to sit
back<00:06:56.440> a<00:06:56.500> little<00:06:56.680> bit<00:06:57.010> play<00:06:57.670> for<00:06:57.910> the<00:06:58.000> counter

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
back a little bit play for the counter

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.970 
back a little bit play for the counter
and<00:06:58.600> if<00:06:58.780> they<00:06:58.900> can<00:06:59.080> get<00:06:59.230> that<00:06:59.380> one<00:06:59.680> goal<00:06:59.950> in

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980 
and if they can get that one goal in

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.950 
and if they can get that one goal in
Seattle<00:07:00.820> that<00:07:01.210> pretty<00:07:01.450> much<00:07:01.600> shuts<00:07:01.840> the

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
Seattle that pretty much shuts the

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.830 
Seattle that pretty much shuts the
series<00:07:02.290> down<00:07:02.500> both<00:07:02.830> these<00:07:03.010> guys<00:07:03.250> think<00:07:03.670> 20<00:07:04.000> for

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 
series down both these guys think 20 for
