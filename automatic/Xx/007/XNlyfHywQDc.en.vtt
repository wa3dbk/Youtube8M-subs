ends you always want to leave the front
the<00:03:24.320> longest<00:03:24.740> point<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.670> don't<00:03:25.790> want<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.030> ever

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
the longest point you don't want to ever

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.570 
the longest point you don't want to ever
have<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.600> front<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.930> shortest<00:03:27.350> and<00:03:27.590> I'm<00:03:28.490> just

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
have the front the shortest and I'm just

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.770 
have the front the shortest and I'm just
going<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:28.790> go<00:03:28.940> around<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.240> whole<00:03:29.420> head<00:03:29.600> and

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
going to go around the whole head and

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.010 
going to go around the whole head and
I'm<00:03:30.500> going<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.650> cut<00:03:30.860> this<00:03:30.980> all<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.430> same

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
I'm going to cut this all the same

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.300 
I'm going to cut this all the same
length<00:03:33.020> because<00:03:33.170> all<00:03:33.500> we<00:03:33.680> need<00:03:33.920> is<00:03:34.070> to<00:03:34.160> have

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
length because all we need is to have

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.430 
length because all we need is to have
length<00:03:34.970> riding<00:03:35.330> through<00:03:35.450> here<00:03:35.660> so<00:03:36.110> let's<00:03:36.260> do

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
length riding through here so let's do

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.260 
length riding through here so let's do
that<00:03:36.650> then<00:03:37.190> we'll<00:03:37.310> come<00:03:37.459> back<00:03:37.490> and<00:03:37.880> we'll<00:03:38.060> put

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
that then we'll come back and we'll put

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.180 
that then we'll come back and we'll put
it<00:03:38.390> in<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.810> top<00:03:39.050> all<00:03:39.680> right<00:03:39.860> now<00:03:39.950> we're<00:03:40.070> going

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
it in the top all right now we're going

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.890 
it in the top all right now we're going
to<00:03:40.250> go<00:03:40.400> over<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.670> actual<00:03:41.090> man<00:03:41.330> bun<00:03:41.540> or<00:03:41.720> top

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
to go over the actual man bun or top

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.740 
to go over the actual man bun or top
knot<00:03:42.110> part<00:03:42.380> of<00:03:42.470> this<00:03:42.530> so<00:03:42.770> what<00:03:43.250> I<00:03:43.310> did<00:03:43.670> is<00:03:43.880> I<00:03:44.330> put

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
knot part of this so what I did is I put

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.120 
knot part of this so what I did is I put
some<00:03:44.930> pomade<00:03:45.350> in<00:03:45.500> through<00:03:45.650> here<00:03:45.860> now<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.040> can

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
some pomade in through here now you can

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.730 
some pomade in through here now you can
dry<00:03:46.520> it<00:03:46.550> fully<00:03:46.970> you<00:03:47.600> can<00:03:47.750> dry<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:47.959> or<00:03:48.110> just<00:03:48.470> damp

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
dry it fully you can dry it or just damp

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.800 
dry it fully you can dry it or just damp
so<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.190> dried<00:03:49.520> it<00:03:49.550> to<00:03:49.700> where<00:03:49.850> just<00:03:50.030> damp<00:03:50.480> not

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
so I dried it to where just damp not

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.150 
so I dried it to where just damp not
completely<00:03:51.260> fully<00:03:51.500> dries<00:03:51.770> to<00:03:51.890> have<00:03:51.980> a<00:03:52.010> little

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
completely fully dries to have a little

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.000 
completely fully dries to have a little
more<00:03:52.250> control<00:03:52.610> and<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:53.270> used<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.720> pomade<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.530> I

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
more control and I used a pomade and I

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.120 
more control and I used a pomade and I
worked<00:03:55.310> it<00:03:55.430> through<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:56.360> entire<00:03:56.860> top<00:03:57.860> of<00:03:58.040> the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
worked it through the entire top of the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.949 
worked it through the entire top of the
head<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.430> I'm<00:03:58.580> continuing<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.360> do<00:03:59.510> that<00:03:59.720> and

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
head and I'm continuing to do that and

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.360 
head and I'm continuing to do that and
what<00:04:00.320> that<00:04:00.410> does<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:00.800> it<00:04:00.920> helps<00:04:01.040> eliminate

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
what that does is it helps eliminate

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.270 
what that does is it helps eliminate
frizz<00:04:01.970> now<00:04:02.690> if<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:02.990> just<00:04:03.290> use<00:04:03.590> your<00:04:03.620> hands

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
frizz now if you just use your hands

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.340 
frizz now if you just use your hands
it's<00:04:05.120> going<00:04:05.270> to<00:04:05.330> give<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:05.630> more<00:04:05.840> of<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:06.080> kind<00:04:06.290> of

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
it's going to give it more of a kind of

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.650 
it's going to give it more of a kind of
natural<00:04:06.440> look<00:04:07.100> where<00:04:07.790> if<00:04:07.910> you<00:04:08.000> comb<00:04:08.300> it<00:04:08.480> it's

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
basically invisible to visible elastic

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.810 
basically invisible to visible elastic
this<00:04:32.720> thing<00:04:32.900> is<00:04:32.990> so<00:04:33.169> tiny<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:34.250> can't<00:04:34.490> even<00:04:34.580> see

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
just like this you're going to keep the

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.400 
just like this you're going to keep the
elastic<00:04:43.660> open<00:04:44.660> obviously<00:04:44.870> you're<00:04:45.260> going<00:04:45.350> to

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
elastic open obviously you're going to

that<00:04:55.760> through<00:04:56.260> one<00:04:57.260> more<00:04:57.440> time<00:04:57.650> there<00:04:57.830> we<00:04:57.860> go

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
that through one more time there we go

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.560 
that through one more time there we go
you're<00:04:58.760> going<00:04:58.910> to<00:04:58.970> pull<00:04:59.120> it<00:04:59.210> through<00:04:59.240> and
