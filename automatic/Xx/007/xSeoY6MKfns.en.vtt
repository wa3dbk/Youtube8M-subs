00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
basically I've had a problem with my

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.230 
basically I've had a problem with my
xbox<00:00:16.199> controller<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:17.100> if<00:00:17.640> any<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.940> having

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
xbox controller so if any of you having

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.179 
xbox controller so if any of you having
the<00:00:18.330> same<00:00:18.510> problem<00:00:19.020> then<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.859> might<00:00:20.100> be

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the same problem then this might be

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.290 
the same problem then this might be
worth<00:00:20.369> for<00:00:21.029> you

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
worth for you

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.689 
worth for you
I<00:00:21.330> was<00:00:21.810> watching<00:00:22.109> if<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.859> turn<00:00:23.039> mine<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.640> I

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
I was watching if you turn mine on and I

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.230 
I was watching if you turn mine on and I
may<00:00:24.390> up<00:00:24.539> fight<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> side<00:00:25.910> then<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> power

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
may up fight on the side then the power

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.720 
may up fight on the side then the power
in<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.779> batteries<00:00:28.170> inside<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:29.250> literally

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
in the batteries inside just literally

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.880 
in the batteries inside just literally
go<00:00:29.849> off<00:00:29.939> look<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.050> sensitive<00:00:31.500> NAT<00:00:31.710> went

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
go off look it's that sensitive NAT went

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.020 
go off look it's that sensitive NAT went
to<00:00:32.009> nine<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.610> push<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> bit<00:00:32.969> of

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
to nine so I have to push a bit of

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.549 
to nine so I have to push a bit of
pressure<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> back<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.780> battery<00:00:34.200> back

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
pressure on the back of the battery back

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.220 
pressure on the back of the battery back
and<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.520> turn<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.300> then<00:00:36.750> even<00:00:37.020> if<00:00:37.110> I

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
and then turn it on and then even if I

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.700 
and then turn it on and then even if I
you<00:00:37.290> know<00:00:37.620> tap<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.070> again<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.670> turns<00:00:38.969> off<00:00:39.710> so

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you know tap it again it turns off so

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.100 
you know tap it again it turns off so
this<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.070> actually<00:00:41.610> really<00:00:41.969> really<00:00:42.090> easy<00:00:42.629> fix

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
this is actually really really easy fix

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.369 
this is actually really really easy fix
I<00:00:43.579> took<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.850> bad<00:00:45.180> case<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.450> fix<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.930> was<00:00:46.050> trying

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
I took the bad case of fix I was trying

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.360 
I took the bad case of fix I was trying
to<00:00:46.440> figure<00:00:46.530> out<00:00:46.710> how<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.190> then<00:00:47.309> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
to figure out how to do it but then I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.369 
to figure out how to do it but then I
realized<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:47.940> how<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.719> take

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
realized this is how we do it so take

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.340 
realized this is how we do it so take
the<00:00:49.469> batteries<00:00:49.770> out<00:00:49.860> your<00:00:50.120> case<00:00:51.120> your<00:00:51.449> Xbox

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
the batteries out your case your Xbox

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.380 
the batteries out your case your Xbox
controller<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.579> next<00:00:53.969> you're<00:00:54.059> gonna<00:00:54.120> need

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
controller and next you're gonna need

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.430 
controller and next you're gonna need
about<00:00:55.079> some<00:00:55.500> tape<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:55.980> need<00:00:56.250> some<00:00:56.370> tape

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
about some tape or you need some tape

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.110 
about some tape or you need some tape
for<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> tape<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.340> need<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.579> enough<00:00:59.910> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
for the tape all you need is enough to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.630 
for the tape all you need is enough to
go<00:01:00.239> around<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.570> battery<00:01:00.750> four<00:01:01.590> times<00:01:01.949> four<00:01:02.399> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
go around the battery four times four to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.990 
go around the battery four times four to
five<00:01:02.879> times<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.510> each<00:01:03.629> battery<00:01:04.189> so<00:01:05.189> grab<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
five times in each battery so grab a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.109 
five times in each battery so grab a
piece<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.299> tape<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> shelf<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.119> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
piece of tape it's on the shelf so you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.170 
piece of tape it's on the shelf so you
won't<00:01:09.299> yeah<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.740> about

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
won't yeah it's it but this is about

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.250 
won't yeah it's it but this is about
obviously<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.390> tree<00:01:12.570> see<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.080> tape

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
obviously you can tree see this tape

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.200 
obviously you can tree see this tape
very<00:01:13.500> well<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.580> about<00:01:14.700> how<00:01:14.850> long<00:01:14.880> you

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
very well this is about how long you

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.120 
very well this is about how long you
need<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:15.930> about<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
need it you can just about see it and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.100 
need it you can just about see it and
all<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:18.000> take<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> tape<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.780> obviously

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
all we do is take the tape and obviously

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.130 
all we do is take the tape and obviously
it's<00:01:19.500> quite<00:01:19.680> easy<00:01:21.290> we<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:22.560> one<00:01:22.890> two<00:01:25.790> three

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
it's quite easy we go one two three

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.800 
it's quite easy we go one two three
three-and-a-half<00:01:28.140> that'll<00:01:28.710> probably<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
three-and-a-half that'll probably do it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.130 
three-and-a-half that'll probably do it
possibly<00:01:30.810> go<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.170> about<00:01:31.320> four<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.280> five<00:01:33.140> just

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
possibly go with about four to five just

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.749 
possibly go with about four to five just
to<00:01:34.259> give<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> make<00:01:34.590> sure<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.579> it's

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
to give a make sure you know so it's

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.980 
to give a make sure you know so it's
worth<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.150> because<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.810> get<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
worth it because you can get the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.800 
worth it because you can get the
batteries<00:01:37.380> out<00:01:37.500> easy<00:01:38.009> enough<00:01:38.369> when<00:01:38.670> doing<00:01:39.659> it

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
batteries out easy enough when doing it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.370 
batteries out easy enough when doing it
so<00:01:40.020> that's<00:01:40.140> one<00:01:40.470> battery<00:01:40.950> done<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.170> grab<00:01:43.170> some

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
so that's one battery done and grab some

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:52.749 
so that's one battery done and grab some
more<00:01:43.409> tape<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:47.960> just<00:01:49.579> put<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.880> that

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
more tape and just put it on like that

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.100 
more tape and just put it on like that
and<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.509> wrap<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.930> around<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.290> battery

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
and I wrap it around the battery

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.860 
and I wrap it around the battery
like<00:01:57.980> so<00:01:58.610> obviously<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.510> can<00:01:59.600> just<00:01:59.720> set<00:01:59.810> the

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
like so obviously you can just set the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
like so obviously you can just set the
when<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.050> batteries<00:02:00.320> are<00:02:00.410> flat<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.650> can<00:02:00.770> just

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
when the batteries are flat you can just

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.310 
when the batteries are flat you can just
take<00:02:01.010> them<00:02:01.130> out<00:02:01.220> and<00:02:01.310> checking<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.760> VIN<00:02:02.320> so

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
take them out and checking the VIN so

make sure you can sort of tap them on a

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.200 
make sure you can sort of tap them on a
desk<00:02:12.440> or<00:02:12.620> something<00:02:12.800> like<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.850> can<00:02:14.000> see

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
desk or something like that you can see

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.830 
desk or something like that you can see
look<00:02:14.360> see<00:02:15.520> me<00:02:16.520> just<00:02:16.700> event<00:02:17.390> obviously<00:02:17.570> it's

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
look see me just event obviously it's

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.180 
look see me just event obviously it's
quite<00:02:17.960> tight<00:02:18.290> which<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.590> actually<00:02:18.950> quite<00:02:19.160> good

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
quite tight which is actually quite good

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.310 
quite tight which is actually quite good
just<00:02:20.030> make<00:02:20.180> sure<00:02:20.420> they're<00:02:20.600> not<00:02:20.660> asleep<00:02:20.990> too

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
just make sure they're not asleep too

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.200 
just make sure they're not asleep too
tight<00:02:21.590> because<00:02:21.800> that<00:02:21.980> could<00:02:22.190> end<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.550> disaster

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
tight because that could end in disaster

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.890 
tight because that could end in disaster
when<00:02:23.780> trying<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.080> get<00:02:24.200> them<00:02:24.320> back<00:02:24.350> out<00:02:24.710> but

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
when trying to get them back out but

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.260 
when trying to get them back out but
basically<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:27.400> think<00:02:28.400> this<00:02:28.580> one<00:02:28.790> here<00:02:29.000> is<00:02:29.090> done

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
basically I think this one here is done

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
basically I think this one here is done
a<00:02:29.300> bit<00:02:29.680> too<00:02:30.680> tight<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:32.600> I'm<00:02:32.750> going<00:02:32.960> to<00:02:33.020> take<00:02:33.140> off

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
a bit too tight so I'm going to take off

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.660 
a bit too tight so I'm going to take off
a<00:02:33.320> layer<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:33.740> tape<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.190> that's<00:02:34.280> all<00:02:34.490> to<00:02:34.550> see

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
a layer of tape and that's all to see

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.830 
a layer of tape and that's all to see
easily<00:02:35.510> done<00:02:35.900> by<00:02:36.260> just<00:02:36.530> picking<00:02:36.709> up<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:36.980> tape

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
easily done by just picking up the tape

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.310 
easily done by just picking up the tape
try<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:38.990> take<00:02:39.080> it<00:02:39.200> off<00:02:40.810> like<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:43.870> there<00:02:44.870> we<00:02:45.140> go

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
try and take it off like so there we go

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.790 
try and take it off like so there we go
is<00:02:45.530> that

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
is that

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:54.070 
is that
start<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.370> oh<00:02:51.730> yeah<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.760> took<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.080> second

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
start of it oh yeah I took the second

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.260 
start of it oh yeah I took the second
layer<00:02:54.200> tape<00:02:54.470> put<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:54.650> off<00:02:55.459> that<00:02:55.880> should<00:02:56.090> make<00:02:56.240> a

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
layer tape put it off that should make a

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.050 
layer tape put it off that should make a
bit<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.510> difference<00:02:56.840> when<00:02:57.050> going<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.440> oh

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
bit of a difference when going in oh

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.860 
bit of a difference when going in oh
yeah<00:02:59.060> that's<00:02:59.420> easy

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
yeah that's easy

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.720
