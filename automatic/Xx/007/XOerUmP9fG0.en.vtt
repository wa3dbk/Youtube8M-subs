does<00:04:45.940> not<00:04:46.150> really<00:04:46.390> make<00:04:46.630> any<00:04:46.810> sense<00:04:47.260> to<00:04:47.620> me

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
does not really make any sense to me

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.910 
does not really make any sense to me
because<00:04:48.880> that<00:04:49.030> disproportionately<00:04:49.770> was<00:04:50.770> an

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
because that disproportionately was an

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.350 
because that disproportionately was an
American<00:04:51.310> fortunately<00:04:51.610> that<00:04:51.820> does<00:04:51.970> not<00:04:52.150> make

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
American fortunately that does not make

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.540 
American fortunately that does not make
sense<00:04:52.420> and<00:04:53.230> other<00:04:53.410> things<00:04:53.650> obviously<00:04:54.130> we<00:04:54.460> use

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
sense and other things obviously we use

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.100 
sense and other things obviously we use
the<00:04:54.640> metric<00:04:54.910> system<00:04:54.940> in<00:04:55.240> Japan<00:04:55.510> just<00:04:55.990> like

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
the metric system in Japan just like

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.440 
the metric system in Japan just like
most<00:04:56.320> countries<00:04:56.800> do<00:04:57.010> so<00:04:57.370> if<00:04:57.670> you're<00:04:58.000> from<00:04:58.210> a

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
most countries do so if you're from a

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.810 
most countries do so if you're from a
system<00:04:58.840> is<00:04:59.100> not<00:05:00.100> a<00:05:00.130> system<00:05:00.340> if<00:05:00.490> you're<00:05:00.580> having

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
system is not a system if you're having

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.730 
system is not a system if you're having
a<00:05:00.970> cock<00:05:01.150> into<00:05:01.360> a<00:05:01.570> country<00:05:01.900> that<00:05:01.990> uses<00:05:02.170> inches

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
a cock into a country that uses inches

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.220 
a cock into a country that uses inches
the<00:05:02.890> appearance<00:05:03.220> system<00:05:03.520> obviously<00:05:04.050> you<00:05:05.050> need

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
the appearance system obviously you need

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.420 
the appearance system obviously you need
to<00:05:05.440> understand<00:05:06.010> what<00:05:06.100> that<00:05:06.130> is<00:05:06.310> in

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
to understand what that is in

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.520 
to understand what that is in
centimeters<00:05:06.660> but<00:05:07.660> since<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.900> cop<00:05:08.080> sizing<00:05:08.440> is

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
centimeters but since the cop sizing is

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.310 
centimeters but since the cop sizing is
completely<00:05:09.130> freaking<00:05:09.730> different<00:05:10.120> if<00:05:11.080> you<00:05:11.200> go

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
completely freaking different if you go

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.540 
completely freaking different if you go
to<00:05:11.380> a<00:05:11.470> brush<00:05:11.650> up<00:05:11.830> and<00:05:12.010> you<00:05:12.070> need<00:05:12.190> to<00:05:12.310> do<00:05:12.430> some
