hey<00:00:00.810> guys<00:00:01.020> I<00:00:01.319> just<00:00:01.350> wanted<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.860> give<00:00:02.010> you<00:00:02.040> a

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hey guys I just wanted to give you a

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.630 
hey guys I just wanted to give you a
quick<00:00:02.370> update<00:00:02.520> on<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:04.009> the<00:00:05.009> new<00:00:05.160> injection

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
quick update on the the new injection

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.820 
quick update on the the new injection
molded<00:00:05.940> parts<00:00:06.240> versus<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.899> 3d<00:00:07.259> printed<00:00:07.589> parts

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
molded parts versus the 3d printed parts

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.070 
molded parts versus the 3d printed parts
here<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.280> just<00:00:08.760> wanted<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.000> show<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.210> how<00:00:09.660> how

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
here I just wanted to show you how how

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.690 
here I just wanted to show you how how
drastic<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.650> difference<00:00:10.920> actually<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.429> in

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
drastic the difference actually is in

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.220 
drastic the difference actually is in
quality<00:00:12.210> strength<00:00:12.980> and<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.400> other<00:00:14.670> aspects<00:00:15.230> so

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
quality strength and in other aspects so

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.140 
quality strength and in other aspects so
these<00:00:16.410> two<00:00:16.650> right<00:00:16.830> here<00:00:16.890> are<00:00:17.100> 3d<00:00:17.789> printed

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
these two right here are 3d printed

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.929 
these two right here are 3d printed
parts<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:19.109> if<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.010> if<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.400> take<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.609> look<00:00:20.820> at

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
parts and if you if you take a look at

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.140 
parts and if you if you take a look at
them<00:00:22.189> you<00:00:23.189> should<00:00:23.430> be<00:00:23.519> able<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.760> see<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
them you should be able to see the the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.660 
them you should be able to see the the
stratification<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.779> just<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.949> lines

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
stratification and just the the lines

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.250 
stratification and just the the lines
that<00:00:30.060> there<00:00:30.240> are<00:00:30.359> from<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> printing<00:00:31.050> process

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that there are from the printing process

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.830 
that there are from the printing process
on<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.420> surface<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> part<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
on the on the surface of the part so the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.690 
on the on the surface of the part so the
part<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.170> actually<00:00:37.290> built<00:00:37.710> vertically<00:00:38.460> like

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
part is actually built vertically like

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.250 
part is actually built vertically like
this<00:00:39.230> layer<00:00:40.230> by<00:00:40.440> layer<00:00:40.469> upwards<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:42.200> as<00:00:43.200> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
this layer by layer upwards and as a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.299 
this layer by layer upwards and as a
result<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.890> there<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:45.559> it's<00:00:46.559> prone<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
result of that there is a it's prone to

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.240 
result of that there is a it's prone to
fracture<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.930> particular<00:00:49.500> direction<00:00:49.770> so

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
fracture in this particular direction so

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.400 
fracture in this particular direction so
see<00:00:50.430> how<00:00:50.550> easily<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.239> broke<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:52.289> I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
see how easily that just broke and I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.689 
see how easily that just broke and I
should<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.649> able<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> break<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.070> there<00:00:53.280> too<00:00:53.489> so

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
should be able to break it there too so

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.200 
should be able to break it there too so
it<00:00:54.239> wants<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.899> break<00:00:55.140> along<00:00:55.670> these<00:00:56.670> particular

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
it wants to break along these particular

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.900 
it wants to break along these particular
printing<00:00:58.140> lines<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.620> that's<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:59.129> true

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
printing lines and that's that's true

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.930 
printing lines and that's that's true
for<00:01:00.210> all<00:01:00.449> 3d<00:01:01.230> printed<00:01:01.680> parts<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.370> use<00:01:02.520> fused

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
for all 3d printed parts that use fused

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.640 
for all 3d printed parts that use fused
deposition<00:01:03.000> modeling<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.260> slit<00:01:04.500> which

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
deposition modeling like this slit which

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.120 
deposition modeling like this slit which
is<00:01:05.369> layer<00:01:05.549> by<00:01:05.729> layer<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.930> there<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.830> this

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
is layer by layer so there is this

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
is layer by layer so there is this
inherent<00:01:08.900> fracture<00:01:09.900> plane<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.890> called

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
inherent fracture plane it's called

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.240 
inherent fracture plane it's called
which<00:01:12.150> 3d<00:01:12.600> parts<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.619> them<00:01:13.799> not<00:01:14.100> to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
which 3d parts have in them not to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.190 
which 3d parts have in them not to
mention<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.820> fact<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.119> they<00:01:15.840> break<00:01:16.049> in

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
mention the fact that they break in

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.630 
mention the fact that they break in
other<00:01:16.320> directions<00:01:16.590> also<00:01:17.130> much<00:01:17.280> easier

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
other directions also much easier

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.429 
other directions also much easier
because<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.270> honeycomb<00:01:18.780> pattern<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
because it's a honeycomb pattern on the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.609 
because it's a honeycomb pattern on the
inside<00:01:19.939> so<00:01:20.939> even<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> solid<00:01:21.840> fill<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.320> 3d

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
inside so even on the solid fill of a 3d

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.580 
inside so even on the solid fill of a 3d
part<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.820> not<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> solid<00:01:24.659> fill<00:01:25.049> as<00:01:25.350> if

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
part it's not really a solid fill as if

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.719 
part it's not really a solid fill as if
it<00:01:25.710> were<00:01:26.180> just<00:01:28.070> completely<00:01:29.070> filled<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.520> with

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
it were just completely filled in with

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.600 
it were just completely filled in with
the<00:01:29.790> material<00:01:30.180> itself<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.259> how<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.280> differs

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the material itself so how that differs

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.480 
the material itself so how that differs
from<00:01:32.820> our<00:01:33.000> injection<00:01:33.450> molded<00:01:33.750> parts<00:01:34.310> if<00:01:35.310> you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
from our injection molded parts if you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.030 
from our injection molded parts if you
take<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> look<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
take a look at this one this is the the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.280 
take a look at this one this is the the

can't you can barely even bend it let

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.120 
can't you can barely even bend it let
alone<00:02:09.090> break<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:09.929> it's

alone break it so it's

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.890 
alone break it so it's
it's<00:02:13.130> much<00:02:13.790> much<00:02:14.090> stronger<00:02:14.390> in<00:02:14.720> all

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
it's much much stronger in all

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.320 
it's much much stronger in all
directions<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:15.620> there's<00:02:16.430> if<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.000> get<00:02:17.150> in<00:02:17.240> a

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
directions so there's if you get in a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.820 
directions so there's if you get in a
crash<00:02:17.540> with<00:02:17.750> our<00:02:17.930> new<00:02:18.050> with<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.380> new<00:02:18.500> parts

crash with our new with the new parts

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.090 
crash with our new with the new parts
it's<00:02:19.580> very<00:02:19.790> unlikely<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.570> to<00:02:20.920> four<00:02:21.920> to

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
it's very unlikely for it to four to

it's very unlikely for it to four to
break<00:02:23.470> second<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.250> way<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.550> they<00:02:25.700> that

the way that the part is installed onto
the<00:02:27.860> camera<00:02:28.250> has<00:02:28.610> also<00:02:28.790> been<00:02:29.030> changed<00:02:29.290> before

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
the camera has also been changed before

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.350 
the camera has also been changed before
it<00:02:30.590> was<00:02:30.710> it<00:02:30.950> was<00:02:31.100> sort<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.460> a<00:02:31.550> clunky<00:02:32.000> matter

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
it was it was sort of a clunky matter

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.720 
it was it was sort of a clunky matter
you<00:02:32.690> had<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.080> hold<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:34.010> camera<00:02:34.460> in<00:02:34.640> a

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
you had to hold the camera in a

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.140 
you had to hold the camera in a
particular<00:02:35.630> way<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.320> had<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.970> press<00:02:37.970> it

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
particular way and you had to press it

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.440 
particular way and you had to press it
down<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.450> place<00:02:39.220> but<00:02:40.220> now<00:02:40.400> it's<00:02:40.760> it's<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.270> much

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
down in place but now it's it's a much

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.890 
down in place but now it's it's a much
simpler<00:02:41.840> simple<00:02:42.560> process<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.220> simply<00:02:43.900> put

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
simpler simple process you simply put

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.310 
simpler simple process you simply put
the<00:02:45.050> one<00:02:45.260> nib<00:02:45.620> into<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.040> ear<00:02:46.220> here<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:47.320> pull

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
the one nib into the ear here and pull

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.100 
the one nib into the ear here and pull
down<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:49.240> then<00:02:50.240> you<00:02:50.390> can<00:02:50.540> install<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.080> the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
down and then you can install the the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.680 
down and then you can install the the
screw<00:02:51.980> into<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.220> ear<00:02:52.400> here<00:02:52.760> for<00:02:53.120> for

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
screw into the ear here for for

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.290 
screw into the ear here for for
additional<00:02:54.050> safety<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:55.700> camera<00:02:56.000> is<00:02:56.060> kept

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
additional safety and the camera is kept

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.140 
additional safety and the camera is kept
perfectly<00:02:56.720> perfectly<00:02:57.350> level<00:02:57.970> with<00:02:58.970> respect

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
perfectly perfectly level with respect

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.090 
perfectly perfectly level with respect
to<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.750> pitch<00:03:00.560> motor<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:01.390> it's<00:03:02.390> an<00:03:02.510> easy

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
to the pitch motor and it's an easy

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.470 
to the pitch motor and it's an easy
dismount<00:03:04.100> as<00:03:04.250> well<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:06.230> there<00:03:06.410> are<00:03:06.590> a

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
dismount as well so there are a

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.430 
dismount as well so there are a
significant<00:03:08.480> improvement<00:03:08.870> over<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.140> 3d

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
significant improvement over the 3d

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.950 
significant improvement over the 3d
printed<00:03:09.710> parts
