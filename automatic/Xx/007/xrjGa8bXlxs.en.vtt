certainly won't be you know for the want

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.910 
certainly won't be you know for the want

day for 21 days and and and get into

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.690 
day for 21 days and and and get into
Paris<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.770> knowing<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.040> did<00:01:17.189> everything<00:01:17.400> right

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
Paris and knowing I did everything right

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.760 
Paris and knowing I did everything right
and<00:01:17.970> whereas<00:01:18.630> perhaps<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.170> time<00:01:19.380> last<00:01:19.590> year

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and whereas perhaps this time last year

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.130 
and whereas perhaps this time last year
I<00:01:20.189> knew<00:01:20.700> before<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.750> there<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> lot

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
I knew before going in there was a lot

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.570 
I knew before going in there was a lot
of<00:01:22.170> doubt<00:01:22.380> perhaps<00:01:22.710> us<00:01:22.890> whether<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.250> was<00:01:23.400> ready

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
of doubt perhaps us whether I was ready

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.630 
of doubt perhaps us whether I was ready
or<00:01:23.729> not<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.409> complete<00:01:25.979> contrast<00:01:26.430> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
or not so that's a complete contrast to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.819 
or not so that's a complete contrast to
last<00:01:26.670> year's<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.630> see<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> dolphin<00:01:28.740> II

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
last year's and I see one the dolphin II

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.200 
last year's and I see one the dolphin II
Robert<00:01:29.070> Miller<00:01:29.250> said<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.850> think<00:01:30.060> you

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
Robert Miller said that you think you

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.210 
Robert Miller said that you think you
can<00:01:30.360> get<00:01:30.540> top<00:01:30.900> five<00:01:31.110> maybe<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> shot<00:01:32.159> at

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
can get top five maybe and so I shot at

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.499 
can get top five maybe and so I shot at

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
me now which obviously didn't ever last

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.570 
me now which obviously didn't ever last
year<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.799> yeah<00:02:01.799> we<00:02:01.950> were<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.250> fantastic

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
year so yeah we were in a fantastic

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.609 
year so yeah we were in a fantastic
position<00:02:02.820> as<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.330> team<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.810> as<00:02:03.930> myself<00:02:04.229> as<00:02:04.530> an

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
position as a team and as myself as an

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.340 
position as a team and as myself as an
individual<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.970> into<00:02:06.330> it<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.570> know<00:02:06.720> ready

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
individual going into it you know ready

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.020 
individual going into it you know ready
to<00:02:07.530> go<00:02:07.679> and<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.950> think<00:02:08.160> that's<00:02:08.340> that's<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
to go and I think that's that's the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.940 
to go and I think that's that's the
difference<00:02:09.209> from<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.720> year<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.590> last<00:02:10.619> year

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
difference from this year to last year

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.020 
difference from this year to last year
and<00:02:11.750> yeah<00:02:12.750> i<00:02:12.780> mean<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:13.470> stay<00:02:13.980> put<00:02:14.190> put<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.610> 21

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
and yeah i mean just stay put put the 21

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.970 
and yeah i mean just stay put put the 21
days<00:02:15.209> together<00:02:15.480> really<00:02:15.900> as<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.200> back-to-back

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
days together really as a back-to-back

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.240 
days together really as a back-to-back
and<00:02:17.480> yeah<00:02:18.480> i<00:02:18.540> think<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.620> great<00:02:19.799> position<00:02:19.950> to

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
and yeah i think in a great position to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.130 
and yeah i think in a great position to
do<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:21.060> identified<00:02:21.630> some<00:02:21.780> key<00:02:21.989> moments

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
do that you identified some key moments

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.920 
do that you identified some key moments
and<00:02:22.530> key<00:02:22.650> stages<00:02:23.040> would<00:02:23.390> change<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.510> roots<00:02:24.690> I

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
and key stages would change the roots I

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.590 
and key stages would change the roots I
haven't<00:02:25.590> really<00:02:25.830> kind<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.370> overly<00:02:27.209> looked<00:02:27.420> at

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
haven't really kind of overly looked at

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.270 
haven't really kind of overly looked at
the<00:02:27.780> root<00:02:27.959> as<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.140> whole<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.650> know<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:29.040> first

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
the root as a whole I know the first

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.770 
the root as a whole I know the first
weekend<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.790> us<00:02:29.910> who<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.060> team<00:02:30.299> time<00:02:30.540> trial

that's been the first part after that
I'm<00:02:33.269> not<00:02:33.390> too<00:02:33.569> short<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.989> stages<00:02:34.410> are<00:02:34.560> or

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
I'm not too short the stages are or
