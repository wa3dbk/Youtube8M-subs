00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 when you come online and the guys come 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.660
 time to answer questions number three what 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.269
 there were many, many new ones 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.549
 comments comments with questions let's say 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.789
 so the previous series was difficult 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.380
 select some of the most frequently specified 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.760
 here but let's not waste time 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.789
 let's get to the answers only the first question 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.400
 after the wedding you close the channel no 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.619
 Chekhov suddenly the video will go out like 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.880
 earlier one by one this is nothing 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.930
 will interfere let's say so the second question 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.960
 will you play mini games on 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.120
 there are no pirate servers for that 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.160
 bought guys a license to go on 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.620
 pirate server oh support exactly 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.600
 they have a licensed server 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.340
 minecraft i play them all that way 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.829
 will you shoot other games except 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.570
 minecraft but guys this question already 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.879
 repeated a second time but to this 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.949
 time I already have the exact answer for 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.949
 separate games I'm going to do the second 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.920
 channel is imperative if i create it 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.979
 the link will be to him in the descriptions under 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.560
 this video under this subsequent it does not matter 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.180
 the subject of this channel is no longer suitable 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.890
 in order to shoot something other than 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.680
 construction in the near future will be 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.119
 more time and more information on 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.820
 whether there will be contests on the channel 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.280
 Well guys contests on the channel is held 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.140
 as soon as sponsors appear on this 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.710
 moment there is one contest for the best 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.079

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.259

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.250
 waiting for you why you are not shooting letplay 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.009
 on minecraft 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.960
 Well, I have already answered this question 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.880
 a long time ago she 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.390
 Well, here are too requirements for 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.670
 time is sad and I see no reason to play 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.350
 3-4 hours to make yourself 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.520
 some kind of industrial machine or 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.630
 get resources to build a house here 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.830
 just think and count 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.620
 territorial tough time consuming 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:23.010
 joint play video with his wife 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.489
 probably yes definitely there are more 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.290
 Find out a little later you 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.860
 It was scary from the statement that youtube 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.260
 will close 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.880
 I personally am not afraid of everything 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.310
 schoolchildren who started in a panic 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.440
 spread this nonsense youtube close 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.709
 the government doesnâ€™t have enough strength 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.780
 too much money he brings 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.269
 The next question I would like to know if 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.410
 you have hobbies and favorite activities free 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.269
 time besides creating video in the game 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.870
 Mainkravt Hall ate read on one 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.300
 breathing and what you like i am very 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.090
 I love animal science programs 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.489
 especially reptiles snakes my lizards 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.860
 favorite subjects such programs i 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.350
 I can watch my free time for hours 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.870
 friends we often climb the city 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.989
 speak until the summer very often we go for 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.000
 a city to the forest or to the beach for relaxation too 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.299
 one of the hobbies can be called 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.980
 reading i'm a fan of the stalker series and read 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.420
 about 20 of them although I can not stand the game 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.430
 the next question is how did you start your 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.099
 activities on youtube and 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.920
 were you afraid to shoot before 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.620
 I began to think for a long time if I needed 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.019
 This is a very long time checking a bunch of channels 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.170
 watched what i can provide people 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.510
 so that it is somehow different from 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.349
 the whole gray mass which is now packed 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.260
 on yu tuba 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.239
 so after that my first one was posted 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.189
 I was still fascinated by the video even without 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.959
 table us do fun arrangements 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.719
 who wants can flip through 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.299
 the very end of all my videos and see 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:59.760
 on this video or write yu tuba machine 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.389
 waves einkrad something like that and you 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.459
 you will see this whole thing but you were afraid 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.560
 or not it's hard to say more 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.980
 experienced and the first couple of videos in general 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.379
 Were without voice acting I really wanted to 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.959
 do I sound or not need well this 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:19.019
 then with time it came all the more clearly 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:22.740
 that time is still very difficult to talk 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.620
 sails in Russian very much if u 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.169
 you have no pets but maybe 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.539
 would like to have a spider in the future 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.389
 some tarantula the size of 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.080
 palm well or iguana some in 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.780
 terrarium 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.900
 I'm a fan of non-standard pets and then 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.580
 seals and dogs is all somehow 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.159
 a hackneyed theme 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.590
 last question for today whether you look 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:49.380
 you are other video mine bloggers 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.440
 yes guys look there are a few for everything 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.159
 they are american and english from russians 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.630
 video bloggers don't watch anyone out 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:59.159
 surprise me now with a Russian audience 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.220
 few can 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:05.159
 but the British are taking off now pretty 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.440
 cool videos I will not call the channel 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.509
 and do not want to do some kind of third-party 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.389
 advertising here on i just want to say 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.130
 what exactly is overseas on tiptoe 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.009
 some or people who are engaged 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.229
 releases in other games videos they 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.580
 somehow more interesting this is all you 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.409
 somehow responsible attitude to 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.320
 video creation 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:29.759
 interfered there for example the Ukrainian part or 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.300
 Russian part of the tube 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.349
 Well on this we will probably finish 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.690
 I hope answered 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.620
 if you began to insert this question 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.620

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.030
 I will try to answer them in the following 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.380
 the fourth issue subscribe to 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.780
