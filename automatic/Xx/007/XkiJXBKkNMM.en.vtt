00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
make it like around here then the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.030 
make it like around here then the
headsets<00:02:12.569> come<00:02:12.780> still<00:02:13.080> touch<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.319> ground

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
headsets come still touch the ground

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.820 
headsets come still touch the ground
make<00:02:15.040> sure<00:02:15.069> it's<00:02:15.400> off<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.879> ground<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.830> then

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
on the top here's where it gets a little

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.650 
on the top here's where it gets a little
bit<00:02:21.040> earlier<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.400> could<00:02:21.879> have<00:02:22.060> just<00:02:22.300> bought<00:02:22.480> in

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
bit earlier I could have just bought in

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.610 
bit earlier I could have just bought in
the<00:02:22.810> round<00:02:23.910> wood<00:02:24.910> strips<00:02:25.330> but<00:02:26.110> it's<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.500> I

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
since I wanted to build us as fast as I

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.910 
since I wanted to build us as fast as I
can<00:02:30.069> I<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:31.840> took<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.170> wood<00:02:32.379> wood<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.739> just

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
can I just took the wood wood and I just

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.229 
can I just took the wood wood and I just
like<00:02:34.560> file<00:02:35.560> them<00:02:35.799> down<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.220> then<00:02:36.610> sanded<00:02:37.120> them

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
like file them down and then sanded them

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.970 
like file them down and then sanded them
down<00:02:37.299> to<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:37.780> perfect<00:02:38.470> as<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.769> can<00:02:38.860> see

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
down to this perfect as you can see

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.740 
down to this perfect as you can see
they're<00:02:39.129> not<00:02:39.250> perfectly<00:02:39.640> round<00:02:39.730> but<00:02:40.660> they're

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
they're not perfectly round but they're

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.860 
they're not perfectly round but they're
close<00:02:40.959> enough<00:02:40.989> you<00:02:41.799> don't<00:02:41.920> want<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.280> we<00:02:42.940> took<00:02:43.720> a

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
close enough you don't want to we took a

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.660 
close enough you don't want to we took a
fel<00:02:44.140> square<00:02:44.410> but<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:45.040> only<00:02:45.129> if<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.340> just<00:02:45.549> have

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
fel square but you only if you just have

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.309 
fel square but you only if you just have
the<00:02:45.760> top<00:02:46.030> around<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.480> off<00:02:46.599> it's<00:02:46.840> good<00:02:47.079> because

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
the top around it off it's good because

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.670 
the top around it off it's good because
you<00:02:47.769> do<00:02:47.890> not<00:02:48.010> want<00:02:48.069> squirt<00:02:48.849> and<00:02:49.090> just<00:02:49.680> like

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
you do not want squirt and just like

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.210 
you do not want squirt and just like
this<00:02:50.980> ticking<00:02:51.310> on<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.790> can<00:02:52.030> damage<00:02:52.209> your<00:02:52.420> pad

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
this ticking on it can damage your pad

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.160 
this ticking on it can damage your pad
or<00:02:54.220> time<00:02:54.670> so<00:02:55.480> that's<00:02:55.750> why<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:55.900> head<00:02:56.110> around<00:02:56.560> and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
or time so that's why I head around and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.050 
or time so that's why I head around and
you<00:02:59.170> want<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.709> make<00:02:59.860> sure<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.129> as<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.970> can

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
you want to make sure that as you can

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.509 
you want to make sure that as you can
see<00:03:01.209> if<00:03:01.390> I<00:03:01.810> put<00:03:02.019> a<00:03:02.049> two-pound<00:03:02.650> weight<00:03:02.950> on<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.340> or

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
see if I put a two-pound weight on it or

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.330 
see if I put a two-pound weight on it or
like<00:03:03.879> a<00:03:03.910> five-pound<00:03:04.569> headset<00:03:04.989> I<00:03:05.260> know<00:03:06.069> there

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
like a five-pound headset I know there

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.309 
like a five-pound headset I know there
is<00:03:06.370> no<00:03:06.670> such<00:03:06.879> thing<00:03:06.910> but<00:03:07.299> let's<00:03:07.900> say<00:03:08.079> I<00:03:08.110> put<00:03:08.290> a

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
is no such thing but let's say I put a

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.960 
is no such thing but let's say I put a
real<00:03:08.530> some<00:03:08.890> too<00:03:09.129> many<00:03:09.280> hits<00:03:09.519> it's<00:03:09.700> on<00:03:09.849> your

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
real some too many hits it's on your

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.210 
real some too many hits it's on your
accidentally<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:11.319> make<00:03:11.470> sure<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.799> base<00:03:12.040> is

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
accidentally to make sure the base is

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.910 
accidentally to make sure the base is
big<00:03:12.459> enough<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:13.140> support<00:03:14.140> all<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:14.530> weight

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
big enough to support all that weight

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.280 
big enough to support all that weight
that's<00:03:15.910> why<00:03:16.060> I<00:03:16.090> have<00:03:16.360> this<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.989> this<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:19.290> you

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
that's why I have this and this and you

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.990 
that's why I have this and this and you
also<00:03:20.440> make<00:03:20.859> sure<00:03:20.889> this<00:03:21.160> fits<00:03:21.430> in<00:03:21.639> the<00:03:21.730> area

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
also make sure this fits in the area

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.270 
also make sure this fits in the area
you're<00:03:22.720> going<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.350> make<00:03:23.410> first<00:03:23.739> in<00:03:24.130> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
you're going to make first in the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.509 
you're going to make first in the
beginning<00:03:24.400> else<00:03:24.639> will<00:03:24.760> make<00:03:24.940> this<00:03:25.060> bigger<00:03:26.519> but

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
beginning else will make this bigger but

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.309 
beginning else will make this bigger but
I<00:03:27.700> decided<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.150> put<00:03:28.329> it<00:03:28.420> there<00:03:28.600> I'm<00:03:28.870> zooming<00:03:29.200> in

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
I decided to put it there I'm zooming in

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.960 
I decided to put it there I'm zooming in
at<00:03:29.470> that<00:03:29.650> place<00:03:29.859> right<00:03:30.069> now<00:03:30.250> like<00:03:30.760> around

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
at that place right now like around

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.960 
at that place right now like around
there<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:32.739> then<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.010> had<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.280> reduce<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.760> size

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
there so then I had to reduce the size

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.300 
there so then I had to reduce the size
and<00:03:34.209> everything<00:03:34.299> so<00:03:35.200> then<00:03:35.440> this<00:03:35.799> what<00:03:36.160> I<00:03:36.190> came

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
and everything so then this what I came

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.580 
and everything so then this what I came
up<00:03:36.430> with<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:37.799> then<00:03:38.799> I<00:03:38.889> put<00:03:39.069> two<00:03:39.220> nails<00:03:39.430> on<00:03:39.609> top

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
up with and then I put two nails on top

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.379 
up with and then I put two nails on top
just<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.709> secure<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.130> and<00:03:42.400> it's<00:03:43.180> pretty

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
just to secure that and it's pretty

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.550 
just to secure that and it's pretty
smooth<00:03:43.599> I<00:03:43.720> didn't<00:03:43.959> paint<00:03:44.139> it<00:03:44.260> yet<00:03:44.530> but<00:03:45.690> i<00:03:46.690> did

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
smooth I didn't paint it yet but i did

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.589 
smooth I didn't paint it yet but i did
