receiving in this game now I noticed

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.560 
receiving in this game now I noticed
that<00:00:35.190> they<00:00:35.370> stopped<00:00:35.610> counting<00:00:35.880> for<00:00:36.360> Steve

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
that they stopped counting for Steve

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
just one pass or 10 yards and notice at

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.950 
just one pass or 10 yards and notice at
the<00:00:44.190> computer<00:00:44.610> started<00:00:44.940> counting<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the computer started counting for a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.139 
the computer started counting for a
Muhammad<00:00:47.840> now<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.899> point<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.410> these<00:00:49.530> videos

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
Muhammad now the point of these videos

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.709 
Muhammad now the point of these videos
that<00:00:51.149> I've<00:00:51.270> made<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.039> it's<00:00:53.039> not<00:00:53.219> that

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
that I've made like this it's not that

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.600 
that I've made like this it's not that
1000<00:00:54.719> yards<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.260> possible<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.010> again<00:00:56.250> even

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
1000 yards is possible and again even

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.310 
1000 yards is possible and again even
though<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:56.940> possible<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.660> team<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.140> just

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
though it is possible a team can just

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.799 
though it is possible a team can just
completely<00:00:58.710> quit<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.399> a<00:01:00.030> guy<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.510> keep

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
completely quit and a guy can just keep

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.630 
completely quit and a guy can just keep
receiving<00:01:01.199> passes<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.160> possible

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
receiving passes that is possible

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.090 
receiving passes that is possible
anything<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.090> possible<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.719> human<00:01:04.019> doing<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
anything is possible for human doing the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.710 
anything is possible for human doing the
point<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:06.950> why<00:01:07.950> does<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.369> computer<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
point is why does the computer have the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.250 
point is why does the computer have the
authority<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.560> power<00:01:11.390> to<00:01:12.390> say<00:01:12.689> what<00:01:13.110> is

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
authority and the power to say what is

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.820 
authority and the power to say what is
possible<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.189> human<00:01:14.310> being<00:01:14.990> is<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.619> me<00:01:16.799> or

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
possible for a human being is it me or

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.780 
possible for a human being is it me or
is<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.479> little<00:01:18.840> backwards<00:01:19.729> why<00:01:20.729> do

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
is that just a little backwards why do

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.260 
is that just a little backwards why do
they<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.390> authority<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.170> tell<00:01:22.830> us<00:01:23.270> what

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
they have the authority to tell us what

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.969 
they have the authority to tell us what
we<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.020> what<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.380> can't<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.220> again

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
we can and what we can't do and again

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.160 
we can and what we can't do and again
yes<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.220> know<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.640> thousand<00:01:30.150> yards<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.750> I

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
yes I know it's a thousand yards and I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.429 
yes I know it's a thousand yards and I
know<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:32.790> far<00:01:33.210> out<00:01:33.240> there<00:01:33.659> but

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
know it's a little far out there but

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.420 
know it's a little far out there but
what<00:01:34.619> if<00:01:34.650> next<00:01:35.040> year<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:36.270> computer<00:01:36.810> says<00:01:37.430> 500

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
what if next year the computer says 500

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.880 
what if next year the computer says 500
yards<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.329> impossible<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.229> they<00:01:40.619> stopped

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
yards it's impossible and they stopped

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.770 
yards it's impossible and they stopped
counting<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:43.320> if<00:01:43.439> Matt<00:01:44.130> in

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
counting for you and what if Matt in

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.620 
counting for you and what if Matt in
2011<00:01:45.780> says<00:01:46.170> 300<00:01:47.070> yards<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.630> impossible

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
2011 says 300 yards is impossible

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.389 
2011 says 300 yards is impossible
against<00:01:48.930> AI<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.560> then<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.159> stopped

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
against AI and then they stopped

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.969 
against AI and then they stopped
counting<00:01:50.670> or<00:01:50.970> one<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.659> computer<00:01:52.170> decides

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
counting or one of the computer decides

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.050 
counting or one of the computer decides
to<00:01:53.610> say<00:01:53.850> 40<00:01:54.840> points<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> game<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:56.060> not

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
to say 40 points in the game is not

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.480 
to say 40 points in the game is not
possible<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.960> anything<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.680> score<00:01:59.159> beyond

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
possible and anything you score beyond

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.740 
possible and anything you score beyond
40<00:01:59.880> they<00:02:00.719> won't<00:02:00.990> record<00:02:02.060> now<00:02:03.060> regardless<00:02:03.570> of

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.010 
statistic and the game if they don't
then<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.160> game<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.700> being<00:02:24.090> altered<00:02:24.570> somehow

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
then the game is being altered somehow

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.700 
then the game is being altered somehow
and<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.460> evidence<00:02:26.970> more<00:02:27.360> evidence<00:02:27.960> I've

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
and this is evidence more evidence I've

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.600 
and this is evidence more evidence I've
shown<00:02:29.460> plenty<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.270> footage<00:02:31.080> showing<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.490> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
shown plenty of footage showing that the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.990 
shown plenty of footage showing that the
computer<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.270> altering<00:02:34.310> possessions<00:02:35.310> they're

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
computer is altering possessions they're

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.080 
computer is altering possessions they're
altering<00:02:36.510> plays<00:02:36.950> now<00:02:37.950> they're<00:02:38.580> altering

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
altering plays now they're altering

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.550 
altering plays now they're altering
stats<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:41.430> maybe<00:02:41.730> one<00:02:42.690> day<00:02:42.900> I'll<00:02:43.080> prove<00:02:43.320> that

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
stats and maybe one day I'll prove that

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.050 
stats and maybe one day I'll prove that
they<00:02:43.740> alter<00:02:44.310> scores<00:02:45.380> maybe<00:02:46.640> however<00:02:47.640> again

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
they alter scores maybe however again

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.620 
they alter scores maybe however again
point<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.500> computer<00:02:50.090> never<00:02:51.090> should<00:02:51.600> a

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
point is the computer never should a

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.040 
point is the computer never should a
computer<00:02:52.230> have<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.920> authority<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.700> limit<00:02:54.660> a
