made a video of her taking the really
large<00:00:15.630> images<00:00:16.500> on<00:00:16.949> stamping<00:00:17.670> plates<00:00:17.970> and

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
large images on stamping plates and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.529 
large images on stamping plates and
making<00:00:19.500> them<00:00:19.740> smaller<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.250> they<00:00:20.640> will<00:00:23.330> fit<00:00:24.330> on

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
making them smaller so they will fit on

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.060 
making them smaller so they will fit on
your<00:00:24.570> nails<00:00:24.900> better<00:00:25.580> this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:27.830> infinity<00:00:28.830> nails

image here is really large and this is

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.080 
image here is really large and this is
on<00:00:36.840> my<00:00:36.870> magno<00:00:37.700> Stamper<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.890> even<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.010> my<00:00:41.219> long

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
on my magno Stamper and even on my long

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.910 
on my magno Stamper and even on my long
thumbnail<00:00:42.719> right<00:00:42.930> now<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:43.410> really<00:00:43.469> that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
thumbnail right now it's not really that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.380 
thumbnail right now it's not really that
long<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:46.460> how<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.670> right<00:00:47.850> now<00:00:48.030> but

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
long but it's how it is right now but

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.840 
long but it's how it is right now but
sterling<00:00:48.989> will<00:00:49.289> miss<00:00:49.620> some<00:00:49.890> putts<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.520> this

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
sterling will miss some putts and this

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.750 
sterling will miss some putts and this
on<00:00:51.149> my<00:00:51.390> left<00:00:51.629> hand<00:00:51.980> yeah<00:00:52.980> well<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.190> won't<00:00:53.489> get

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
on my left hand yeah well I won't get

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.029 
on my left hand yeah well I won't get
the<00:00:53.910> whole<00:00:54.059> image<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.930> what<00:00:58.829> she

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the whole image on that one so what she

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.310 
the whole image on that one so what she
did<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.570> basically<00:01:00.770> showing<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.010> technique<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
did is basically showing a technique to

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.380 
did is basically showing a technique to
make<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.939> images<00:01:06.290> smaller<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:07.830> Stamper

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
make the images smaller on your Stamper

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.850 
make the images smaller on your Stamper
so<00:01:09.390> what<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.930> need<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.380> kind<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
so what you need is that kind of a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.609 
so what you need is that kind of a
squishy<00:01:11.220> Stamper<00:01:11.909> head<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:13.080> I'm<00:01:13.140> gonna<00:01:13.290> try<00:01:13.560> it

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
squishy Stamper head so I'm gonna try it

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.940 
squishy Stamper head so I'm gonna try it
on<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.880> Magno<00:01:15.270> stamp<00:01:15.840> at<00:01:16.049> first<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.799> I

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
on the Magno stamp at first and as I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
on the Magno stamp at first and as I
said<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.369> my<00:01:17.850> first<00:01:18.840> time<00:01:19.350> trying<00:01:19.799> this

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
said this is my first time trying this

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.310 
said this is my first time trying this
on<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.240> video<00:01:23.119> I've<00:01:24.119> watched<00:01:24.390> her<00:01:24.659> video<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
on this video I've watched her video a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.260 
on this video I've watched her video a
few<00:01:25.619> times<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.670> will<00:01:26.820> link<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.090> down

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
few times and I will link that down

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.499 
few times and I will link that down
below<00:01:27.740> so<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.790> do<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.060> pinch

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
below so what you have to do is pinch

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.390 
below so what you have to do is pinch
the<00:01:30.930> Stamper<00:01:31.470> head<00:01:31.590> slightly<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.900> while<00:01:33.900> you

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
the Stamper head slightly and while you

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.760 
the Stamper head slightly and while you
are<00:01:35.400> painting<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.720> pick<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.409> image

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
are painting it you pick up the image

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.219 
are painting it you pick up the image
and<00:01:37.979> then<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.400> release<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:39.000> once<00:01:39.420> image<00:01:39.840> is

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and then you release it once image is

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.730 
and then you release it once image is
picked<00:01:41.070> up<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> Stamper<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.320> as<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.530> can

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
picked up on the Stamper and as you can

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.480 
picked up on the Stamper and as you can
see<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.360> slightly<00:01:46.140> narrower<00:01:46.740> than<00:01:47.189> it

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
see it is a slightly narrower than it

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.780 
see it is a slightly narrower than it
was<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.079> guess<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.560> depends<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.220> which<00:01:53.399> way

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
was so I guess it depends on which way

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.810 
was so I guess it depends on which way
you<00:01:53.850> pinch<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:55.020> Stamper<00:01:55.680> before<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.460> pick

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
you pinch your Stamper before you pick

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.139 
you pinch your Stamper before you pick
it<00:01:57.210> up<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.950> what<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.040> looks<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.700> me<00:01:59.820> but

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
it up is what it looks like to me but

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.450 
it up is what it looks like to me but
anyway<00:02:01.640> it<00:02:02.640> looks<00:02:02.670> like<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:04.680> an<00:02:05.070> idea

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
anyway it looks like it's a it's an idea

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.190 
anyway it looks like it's a it's an idea
that<00:02:05.520> will<00:02:05.880> work<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:07.399> this<00:02:08.479> magno<00:02:09.479> Stamper<00:02:09.989> is

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
that will work and this magno Stamper is

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.059 
that will work and this magno Stamper is
very<00:02:11.190> squishy

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
very squishy

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.270 
very squishy
so<00:02:12.219> I<00:02:12.609> didn't<00:02:13.269> have<00:02:13.359> any<00:02:13.420> problems<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.650> know

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
so I didn't have any problems you know

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.410 
so I didn't have any problems you know
pinching<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.530> Stamper<00:02:17.530> head<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.549> this<00:02:19.150> is

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
pinching the Stamper head and this is

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.860 
pinching the Stamper head and this is
the<00:02:19.689> extra-large<00:02:20.430> Stamper<00:02:21.430> head<00:02:21.790> from<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:24.870> XL

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
the extra-large Stamper head from the XL

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.440 
the extra-large Stamper head from the XL
squishy<00:02:26.799> Stamper<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.549> either<00:02:27.700> comes<00:02:28.030> in<00:02:28.269> a

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
squishy Stamper that either comes in a

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.690 
squishy Stamper that either comes in a
black<00:02:28.719> or<00:02:29.079> purple<00:02:29.319> handle<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:33.340> I'm<00:02:33.489> going<00:02:33.639> to

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
black or purple handle so I'm going to

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.119 
black or purple handle so I'm going to
try<00:02:33.849> that<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.780> same<00:02:35.079> technique<00:02:35.530> with<00:02:35.859> that

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
try that the same technique with that

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.530 
try that the same technique with that
and<00:02:36.400> see<00:02:36.519> if<00:02:36.549> that<00:02:36.819> works<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:38.260> exhale<00:02:39.540> wish

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
and see if that works the exhale wish

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.559 
and see if that works the exhale wish
you<00:02:40.719> Stamper<00:02:41.109> is<00:02:41.319> a<00:02:41.530> bit<00:02:42.280> firmer<00:02:42.879> than<00:02:43.060> my<00:02:43.299> mag

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
you Stamper is a bit firmer than my mag

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.490 
you Stamper is a bit firmer than my mag
no<00:02:43.780> Stamper<00:02:44.349> and<00:02:45.569> it's<00:02:46.569> a<00:02:46.840> bit<00:02:47.019> smaller<00:02:47.349> of

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
no Stamper and it's a bit smaller of

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.199 
no Stamper and it's a bit smaller of
course<00:02:47.620> but<00:02:49.889> still<00:02:50.889> we'll<00:02:51.459> have<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.879> give<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.150> a

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
course but still we'll have to give it a

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:00.899 
course but still we'll have to give it a
try<00:02:57.689> so<00:02:58.769> pick<00:02:59.769> the<00:02:59.799> stamp<00:03:00.280> right<00:03:00.430> up<00:03:00.579> and<00:03:00.819> then

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
try so pick the stamp right up and then

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.679 
try so pick the stamp right up and then
pinch<00:03:01.269> it<00:03:01.449> slightly<00:03:02.250> pick<00:03:03.250> up<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.730> image<00:03:04.480> and

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
pinch it slightly pick up the image and

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.220 
pinch it slightly pick up the image and
release<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.500> pitch<00:03:05.889> on<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.280> Stamper<00:03:06.699> head

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
release the pitch on the Stamper head

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.750 
release the pitch on the Stamper head
and<00:03:08.230> as<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.799> can<00:03:09.040> see<00:03:09.099> it<00:03:09.609> is<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.239> bit<00:03:10.510> smaller

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
and as you can see it is a bit smaller

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.330 
and as you can see it is a bit smaller
but<00:03:12.760> wider<00:03:13.329> so<00:03:13.810> yeah<00:03:14.169> it<00:03:14.409> definitely<00:03:14.620> depends

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
but wider so yeah it definitely depends

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:24.830 
but wider so yeah it definitely depends
on<00:03:18.930> on<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.169> way<00:03:20.439> you<00:03:20.500> kind<00:03:21.099> of<00:03:21.189> pick<00:03:21.430> up<00:03:21.669> the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.659 

pinch<00:03:25.840> on<00:03:26.139> your<00:03:26.319> Stamper<00:03:26.680> how<00:03:26.889> well<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.549> way

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
pinch on your Stamper how well the way

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:33.809 
pinch on your Stamper how well the way
you<00:03:27.729> pinch<00:03:29.729> and<00:03:30.729> pick<00:03:31.060> up<00:03:31.949> so<00:03:32.949> this<00:03:33.250> is<00:03:33.489> the

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
you pinch and pick up so this is the

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.330 
you pinch and pick up so this is the
double-sided<00:03:34.689> and<00:03:35.109> as<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.709> can<00:03:35.859> see<00:03:35.919> that<00:03:36.220> is

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
double-sided and as you can see that is

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.179 
double-sided and as you can see that is
a<00:03:36.370> full<00:03:38.310> size<00:03:39.310> image<00:03:39.849> right<00:03:40.090> there<00:03:40.299> and<00:03:41.259> let's

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 
a full size image right there and let's

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.909 
a full size image right there and let's
see<00:03:42.400> look<00:03:42.729> at<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:42.909> differences<00:03:44.280> from<00:03:45.280> these

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
see look at the differences from these

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:52.619 
see look at the differences from these
two<00:03:47.919> tests<00:03:49.859> you<00:03:50.859> can<00:03:51.040> see<00:03:51.250> yeah<00:03:51.729> there<00:03:52.060> is<00:03:52.209> size

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
two tests you can see yeah there is size

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.890 
two tests you can see yeah there is size
difference<00:03:53.169> so<00:03:53.889> it<00:03:54.069> doesn't<00:03:54.459> work<00:03:54.609> and<00:03:55.000> that's

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
difference so it doesn't work and that's

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.549 
difference so it doesn't work and that's
it<00:03:56.169> thanks<00:03:56.889> for<00:03:56.949> watching<00:03:57.069> bye
