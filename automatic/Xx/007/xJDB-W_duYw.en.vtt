00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 the lousy there music better report 2013 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.319
 is presented by comics man of 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.740
 really professional solution for 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.139
 online mastering and recording hello and 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.280
 welcome to messias 2013 by 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.020
 the frankfurt music fair 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.010
 Now I am at the peter of bayer 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.590
 dynamics hello hello you told me 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.109
 you have done her a facelift what 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.180
 Can I imagine the times 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.130
 So we have the 13 50 right 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
 Two years already here at the fair 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.820
 had presented that almost mobile 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.520
 Overlaid handsets 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.030
 We've just revised that 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.170
 Say you have a new head turn 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.090
 in one piece compared to the old one 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.540
 version where we have two-piece head end 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.360
 to have 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.940
 there we had the earpads or 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.399
 the headless stuck on the left then 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.379
 Stop painting after a while 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.020
 i also made by the customer 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.420
 interchangeable so to speak if the post 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.359
 two three four five years close to that 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.399
 head pad times closed 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.840
 then you can easily stop it 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.710
 exist and have to trade yourself there 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.720
 we are visually a bit 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.479
 revised to unobtrusive made 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.760
 was that in itself today almost in the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.650
 broadcast listen is there you have it 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.150
 always unobtrusive now too 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.520
 really completely closed 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.780
 he is completely closed just about that 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.850
 we still have support now 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.430
 even a little bigger buses on it 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.530
 So made a little bigger diameter 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.160
 I believe at four to five 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.990
 millimeter larger diameter and we 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.750
 have another version 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:42.880
 So made the pc version for cold 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.440
 case speak spiralkabel stop the user 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.750
 to give more freedom, so to speak 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.030
 Do not replace the cable 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.940
 they can swap but nothing is 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.610
 but i could there is one 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.680
 version without spiral is also available 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.280
 a game to the quasi-normal version 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.649
 13 50 without cc addition and that's the 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.840
 version with one and a half meters straight in 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.899
 cable the cable is also a by the way 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.509
 cable with polyurethane conversion so 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.070
 that is quasi still something 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.170
 a bit more stable than normal pvc 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.850
 Conversion you can stop in times 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.010
 a flight case between them 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.530
 without it starting from 2 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.520
 Now my question about the impedance like 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.420
 high is 80 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.600
 Of course we have the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.019
 tesla drivers are installed as well 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.340
 that means we have magnets in place 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:39.640
 center of the spiral we have one 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.519
 ring magnet held around the school 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.049
 larger magnetic handset magnetic 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.360
 field strength and thereby keep higher 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.120
 it then still makes me louder 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.610
 louder than a conventional 80 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.989
 You can almost say euro but yes it 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.239
 it's mainly about what we need 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.570
 less input power at more 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.830
 output power and there to have 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.320
 of course also made sure that 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.549
 he plays a bit louder just like 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.560
 For example, here at the fair is yes 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.950
 relatively loud you have to hear it well 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.190
 can 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.110
 He is also thought of as a musician 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.459
 percussion studio shots and so 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.769
 further and as you need it to stop 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.820
 a bit louder especially need 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.820
 it's a bit louder 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.380
 they often have such a problem with the 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.630
 many terminals for example my ipad 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.610
 For example, relatively little performance 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.260
 So much battery saved he comes 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.820
 not so much power out of that question 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.530
 I then always how loud the things 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.610
 because many headphones are always sometimes 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.650
 really too quiet 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.810
 that's exactly why the tesla is 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.760
 technology as I said less 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.980
 entrance fee for more 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.770
 output power therefore higher efficiency 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.840
 they come eventually and the whole 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:53.150
 So the whole higher plays that way too 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:57.380
 is about up to 130 db volume then 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:00.470
 According to exactly what it costs is 299 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.160
 euro uvp and is already available or 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.540
 have it only presented so the 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.030
 previous version is still available 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.480
 the new facelift and the new cd 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.540
 version will be available from june 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.540
 Many Thanks
