00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
medical ninjutsu I don't know if it's

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.820 
medical ninjutsu I don't know if it's
just<00:02:30.970> because<00:02:31.060> he's<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.450> fucking<00:02:31.930> god<00:02:32.200> or<00:02:32.769> I

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
just because he's a fucking god or I

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.140 
just because he's a fucking god or I
don't<00:02:33.190> know<00:02:33.280> if<00:02:33.550> it's<00:02:33.670> just<00:02:33.790> because<00:02:33.910> it's

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
don't know if it's just because it's

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.509 
don't know if it's just because it's
fucking<00:02:34.480> naruto<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.620> it's<00:02:35.739> just<00:02:35.980> kishimoto

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
fucking naruto and it's just kishimoto

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.970 
fucking naruto and it's just kishimoto
logic<00:02:37.030> that's<00:02:37.480> most<00:02:37.720> likely<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:38.200> or<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.440> don't

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
logic that's most likely it or I don't

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.800 
logic that's most likely it or I don't
know<00:02:39.190> just<00:02:39.640> because<00:02:39.880> it's<00:02:40.239> just<00:02:40.390> moderate

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
know just because it's just moderate

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.130 
know just because it's just moderate
chea<00:02:41.019> but<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:41.769> guy<00:02:42.070> lost<00:02:42.910> her<00:02:43.150> arm<00:02:43.180> took

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
chea but this guy lost her arm took

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.250 
chea but this guy lost her arm took
white<00:02:44.410> zetsu's<00:02:44.860> arm<00:02:45.100> cut<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:46.030> shit<00:02:46.390> put<00:02:47.140> it

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
white zetsu's arm cut that shit put it

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.740 
white zetsu's arm cut that shit put it
back<00:02:47.590> on<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:48.100> arm<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.670> he<00:02:48.850> had<00:02:49.030> lost<00:02:49.360> like<00:02:49.540> it

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
back on the arm that he had lost like it

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.199 
back on the arm that he had lost like it
was<00:02:49.870> nothing<00:02:50.170> stood<00:02:50.950> there<00:02:51.220> no<00:02:51.640> stitches<00:02:52.060> no

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
was nothing stood there no stitches no

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.509 
was nothing stood there no stitches no
nothing<00:02:52.570> which<00:02:53.079> kind<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.860> probably<00:02:54.160> makes

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
nothing which kind of probably makes

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.600 
nothing which kind of probably makes
more<00:02:54.700> sense<00:02:54.970> than<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.180> eye<00:02:55.799> because<00:02:56.799> he<00:02:57.400> has

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
more sense than the eye because he has

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.530 
more sense than the eye because he has
senju<00:02:58.360> DNA<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.290> he<00:03:00.100> has<00:03:00.310> sage<00:03:00.640> mode<00:03:00.910> that<00:03:01.209> came

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
senju DNA and he has sage mode that came

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.930 
senju DNA and he has sage mode that came
from<00:03:01.750> hashirama<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.680> then<00:03:03.160> took<00:03:03.489> white

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
from hashirama and then took white

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.930 
from hashirama and then took white
zetsu's<00:03:04.540> arm<00:03:04.840> which<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.590> pretty<00:03:05.980> much<00:03:06.100> nothing

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
zetsu's arm which is pretty much nothing

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.720 
zetsu's arm which is pretty much nothing
but<00:03:07.420> senju<00:03:08.019> DNA<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:09.340> I<00:03:10.440> in<00:03:11.440> terms<00:03:11.769> of<00:03:11.920> manga

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
but senju DNA so I in terms of manga

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.340 
but senju DNA so I in terms of manga
logic<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.239> guess<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:13.630> makes<00:03:13.750> sense<00:03:13.840> for<00:03:14.140> just

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
logic I guess it makes sense for just

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.770 
logic I guess it makes sense for just
Boop<00:03:14.620> back<00:03:15.310> right<00:03:15.579> back<00:03:15.700> on<00:03:15.910> like<00:03:16.090> nothing<00:03:16.420> ok

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
Boop back right back on like nothing ok

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.350 
Boop back right back on like nothing ok
I<00:03:16.810> guess<00:03:17.140> but<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.920> eye<00:03:17.970> he<00:03:18.970> didn't<00:03:19.180> have<00:03:19.329> to

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
I guess but the eye he didn't have to

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.539 
I guess but the eye he didn't have to
reattach<00:03:19.810> his<00:03:20.079> nerves<00:03:20.709> or<00:03:21.100> anything<00:03:21.519> like

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
reattach his nerves or anything like

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.449 
reattach his nerves or anything like
that<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.850> was<00:03:21.970> like<00:03:22.060> oh<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:23.530> can<00:03:23.560> see<00:03:23.860> you<00:03:23.980> get<00:03:24.190> off

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
that I was like oh I can see you get off

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.340 
that I was like oh I can see you get off
oh<00:03:25.650> shit<00:03:26.700> holy<00:03:27.700> fuck<00:03:28.030> despite<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.019> fact<00:03:29.230> that

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
oh shit holy fuck despite the fact that

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.650 
oh shit holy fuck despite the fact that
this<00:03:29.590> chapter<00:03:30.010> had<00:03:30.190> some<00:03:30.910> inconsistencies

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
this chapter had some inconsistencies

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.050 
this chapter had some inconsistencies
I've<00:03:32.320> actually<00:03:32.829> find<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.489> fact<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:33.820> he<00:03:33.910> was

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
I've actually find the fact that he was

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.030 
I've actually find the fact that he was
able<00:03:34.239> to<00:03:34.390> plot<00:03:34.720> his<00:03:34.780> eye<00:03:35.110> back<00:03:35.650> into<00:03:35.950> the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
able to plot his eye back into the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.580 
able to plot his eye back into the
socket<00:03:36.280> so<00:03:36.640> easily<00:03:37.230> more<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.470> an

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
socket so easily more of an

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.100 
socket so easily more of an
inconsistency<00:03:39.310> then<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.510> whole<00:03:40.690> Susanoo

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
inconsistency then the whole Susanoo

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.110 
inconsistency then the whole Susanoo
thing<00:03:41.410> that's<00:03:41.950> pretty<00:03:42.310> much<00:03:42.579> like<00:03:42.790> just

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
thing that's pretty much like just

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.830 
thing that's pretty much like just
grasping<00:03:43.989> at<00:03:44.019> shit<00:03:44.530> just<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.459> hate<00:03:46.239> on<00:03:46.269> Naruto

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
grasping at shit just to hate on Naruto

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.660 
grasping at shit just to hate on Naruto
for<00:03:47.049> no<00:03:47.139> reason

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
for no reason

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.630 
for no reason
much<00:03:47.910> it's<00:03:48.900> logical<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.860> people<00:03:50.340> be<00:03:50.430> like<00:03:50.459> oh

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
much it's logical that people be like oh

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.100 
much it's logical that people be like oh
he<00:03:50.760> doesn't<00:03:50.910> have<00:03:51.150> his<00:03:51.240> eyes<00:03:51.450> how<00:03:51.720> can<00:03:51.900> he<00:03:51.959> do

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
he doesn't have his eyes how can he do

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.900 
he doesn't have his eyes how can he do
that<00:03:52.140> but<00:03:52.860> then<00:03:52.980> at<00:03:53.069> the<00:03:53.099> same<00:03:53.190> time<00:03:53.640> it's<00:03:53.880> like

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
that but then at the same time it's like

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.180 
that but then at the same time it's like
