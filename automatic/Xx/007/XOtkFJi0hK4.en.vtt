 sandra bullock because we like it has 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.850
 closest to the oscar awards and 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.489
 asking us to think that he could take 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.210
 between July the musician album know I've 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.940

 his talent like you but also his 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.030
 ability to have learned from each 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.070
 screwed up to recognize well that you 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.170
 it's fine for a carpet what do you 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.300
 It seems Sandra Bullock has a beautiful 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.970
 rectangular face like your 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.729
 body is to say it's all a rectangle 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.830
 his eyebrows have a very sharp angle and 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.869
 his children are small and brown 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.850
 complete this with a long straight hair 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.009
 and dark brown and you'll see a woman who 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.600
 it could well be that the hair 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.729
 sandra bullock's hair is the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.890
 perfect representation of man in 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.960
 girls with hair this is a man 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.090
 prevent your hair you just need to have 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.520
 a scare that is in that returned it a 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.070
 a movement to your hair and it's almost 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.110
 as a discoloration now well if 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.600
 you have a rectangular face the hair 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.030
 very divided in the center is not 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.250
 gaining comment strength 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.950
 It looks much cooler when it uses waves 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.080
 the hair collected or divided to half 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.619
 wool the rectangular face and in the 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.119
 Broad front is the ideal to use 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.100
 our clothes one of the elements 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.740
 constants in the gala dresses that 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.659
 has used lately has been the lace to 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.790
 have a dark brown hair with 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.310
 clear skin the color red is one of the 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.830
 better days now when the occasion is 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.450
 allows it, sandra does not hesitate to show her 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.820
 These legs for the jocks 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.649
 it always covers the top because there 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.539
 that maintain elegance throughout 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.989
 moment they show the legs cover 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.989
 the torso 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.409
 at the same time with the verb to bleed 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:19.360
 legs a secret weapon a detail 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.430
 interesting when it comes to showing the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.470
 a miniskirt is doing it with a dress 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.780
 straight without waist marked in the style of 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.090
 the 60s this style emphasizes them still 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.370
 more and commandments than innocence 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.079
 sensuality and a lot of elegance 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.780
 Now a dress is not the same 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.040
 straight years 60 than a 22 or so that way 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.780
 like I see you in for everything 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.670
 when one while very careful with 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.859
 x-men also knows how to flirt with 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.319
 masculine style is analyzing if your 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.180
 look dominates how to achieve won female 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.390
 with panties or with sets of pants 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.849
 and blazer emphasizing the important that 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.280
 never forget to give prominence to your 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.780
 site which front but careful 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.609
 but only a forward enjoyment as 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.150
 I am quite and not fall into what 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.220
 vulgar 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.520
 It is important to have a taste of sending 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.110
 to little ones in cheating 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.500
 has made several mistakes in the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.810
 shadows and almost everything are terrible summary 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.430
 in the deception of a dress is what you 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.720
 will make you look like a tail star and not 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.940
 as being a friend I lend you my 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.220
 style makeup like watermelon are 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.560
 small and somewhat sunken the smoked 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.390
 is the best action to open your sights 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.700
 with part makeup you will need 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.650
 creamy black eyeliner shadow color 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.140
 brown satin shade champagne color 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.540
 satin brushed blur with a 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.850
 important amount attached to the line of 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.710
 your eyelashes and do not go over your eyelid 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.870
 mobile to blur or with the 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.880
 brush thus erasing the strong lines and 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.650
 creating a creamy base for the 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.600
 shadow does not move then the part 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.580
 inside of your eye places the shadow more 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.770
 clear is your skill your look and in the 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.960
 rest of the mobile eyelid the shadow more 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.480
 dark do not rise above the eyelid 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.220
 mobile the idea is elegant nordo is not 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.900
 Do not forget to apply a little bit of 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.270
 the dark shadow attached to your lashes 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.280
 inferiors leave the protagonism to your 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.710
 eyes and on your cheeks and lips are a 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.000
 touch of femininity with pink tones 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.700
 pale attitude once 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.220
 in daily life and nothing of a star 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.840
 Hollywood winner of the facts I 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.200
 I see it and I think of super ants 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.540
 relaxed to take me some margaritas 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.459
 that improvement attitude of mine is the one that 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.350
 arrives well walks on the carpet not the 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.750
 look in this first look we will take 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.270
 shine that dandy look you love so much 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.160
 he so much wore a collared shirt 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.500
 structured so you will not need a collar 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.660
 the neck will do all the combined work 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.700
 with a button blazer in trench coat and 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.710
 as opposed to some pants with 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.560
 leggins with another texture some sandals 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.540
 of strips and liz what I like the most about 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.220
 this second look is the daring of 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.900
 combine the informal with the formal 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.820
 we will take this fault in the unethical 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.430
 knee-length pencil and we'll walk it 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.840
 with a shirt with an illustration 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.520
 fun to make even more contrast 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.830
 with the shirt we will take it with a 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.110
 large shiny and elegant necklace about 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.139
 fine black stilettos a clutch 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.600
 with chain and liszt of this third what 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.370
 What I like most is that it is monochromatic 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.800
 and this is the best way to see us more 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.810
 thin and even a sleeveless cap with 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.639
 striking neck will emphasize your 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.560
 shoulders and arms wear it with pants 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.419
 to dress in the same tone as the top ones 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.040
 striking band-aid sandals and a 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.490
 belt that matches with them and 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.130
