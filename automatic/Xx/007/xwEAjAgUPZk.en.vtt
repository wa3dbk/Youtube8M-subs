00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi to all the guys that would come 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.000
 come in this new dragon video 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.770
 ball xeno towards finally we return to 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.599
 make some clash on this game 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.179
 since the big boys finally came out 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.759
 the first episode of super dragon ball 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.800
 the new series dedicated to dragon ball 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.930
 it is a true sequel to the series 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.090
 of dragon ball z so guys me 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.830
 would like to do weekly 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.320
 get out a couple of videos where 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.269
 we use characters or otherwise 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.250
 let's make the fights we've seen 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.470
 even episodes could be one 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.160
 very very cool thing I remember him 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.530
 episodes 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.750
 obviously they came out in Japan here 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.300
 in Italy we will probably see them on TV 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.950
 so in a few years, boy, will you 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.230
 I recommend searching online because 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.969
 you will probably find a possibility 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.980
 to look at them somehow I don't 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.870
 ask for links and stuff like that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.640
 because guys I can't give you 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.530
 obviously in the first episode there is a 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.539
 small re.cup of what happened 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.789
 at the end of dragon ball z for which 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.129
 regazzoli we will go to choose precisely 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.780
 goku that can obviously be transformed 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.239
 the third tier super saiyan 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.850
 I don't think this is what it is instead 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.830
 right here 15 we choose him and 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.960
 we're going to fight against the book 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.479
 obviously boyfriend them for this video 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.850
 we try to exceed 2,000 like and 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.979
 I recommend you ragazzoni here it is e 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.229
 then start this epic fight e 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.780
 we do it obviously to the world of kyu 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.880
 shin here we are so boy there 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.890
 let's go to relive the dragon ending 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.990
 ball ze I can assure you that later 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.240
 having seen the first episode I really did 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.040
 I have very high expectations for this 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.430
 series apparently will be about one 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.010
 hundred episodes and then tell me you 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.310
 20 if you would like that when I do these 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.870
 videos dedicated precisely dragon ball super 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.730
 you want me to tell you about the last ones 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.140
 they succeeded if you want in practice 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.180
 that I make you a very small spoiler 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.330
 you must tell me if you don't want them 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.600
 precisely when I speak I will try to 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.940
 focus more on the fight anyway 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.680
 boy there how I was just saying the 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.360
 first episode without entering too much now 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.250
 in detail and then make spoilers 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.840
 you really liked the draw it was 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.690
 quite simple 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.580
 to be honest we have not seen things 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.760
 then details more than that though 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.620
 in fact they have opposed some beautiful bases 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.440
 let's get married because there is a superstar 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.000
 evanescent because in practice we repeat 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.450
 a character but I believe that 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.520
 you will know the god of destruction 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.140
 boys bills is present in the first 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.830
 episode and therefore probably 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.959
 regazzoli we will see a lot again a 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.430
 short i 'm sure in the poo in this one 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.950
 series will be cool 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.380
 then maybe I talk even being a little more 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.570
 in part because there are still a lot 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.549
 fond of the b series in the meantime 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.920
 ours asks for an envelope taking blows 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.340
 I saw an attack as you have seen 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.620
 supreme trying to destroy it 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.019
 completely benjamin is beating into 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.459
 absurd way I tell you guys that 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.290
 however these series of dragon balls 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.470
 super is set about six months later 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.330
 precisely the defeat of majin bu then 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.090
 i where i was league i 'm too stocky with 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.519
 a nice truck and it hit it just fine 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.790
 then wait for there is also this historical one 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.799
 who loves it ok I failed to 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.769
 peck him really pity we try again 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.000
 now guys unfortunately like you see 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.459
 when it hits me 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.250
 I can do little then we do so 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.829
 I try to fix the super again 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.880
 he hopes he gives you, but admitted that he does 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:32.840
 move move I don't know we hit it 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.760
 I have done raga is not possible 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.519
 he counterattacked with a move e 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.500
 so in this way the siena auto data 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.660
 by john the chance to stop mine 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.000
 attack apparently is recovering 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.400
 really a lot dear dear chivu attention 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.830
 then go with third personal 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.330
 level and then try to do these 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.380
 spheres that I want even from a gift 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.140
 make table here nothing to do 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.900
 my dear then while you attack me 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.209
 so I move roger and the barrier 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.800
 I can't believe I can't believe it 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.860
 we immediately hoped for the super 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.310
 he calls and he tells me I'm up for 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.160
 to die 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.530
 this time maybe the story will go into 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.390
 different way I hope not I have to 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.180
 absolutely move away from the bartender who 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.510
 as you can see I am put on a lily 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.419
 tension look at the book hit pro 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.700
 hit harder so we have to win 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:31.330
 cabbage I have to top up as soon as possible 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.190
 my listened and I died also was missing 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.000
 a second symbol and therefore little is here 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.890
 been defeated 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.480
 it doesn't matter, guys, because now there 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.460
 let's go to another fight and vi 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.169
 I explain why I have it with the characters on 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.970
 next character then that 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.190
 obviously bis because as I told you 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.580
 a little while ago it is present in the first 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.130
 bet him as well as the carolis 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.350
 let's see where we go fight the 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.000
 so says capsules corporation at least 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.160
 let's even go a little to recall that 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.770
 which was the film dedicated precisely to 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.600
 dragon ball z the battle of the gods 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.520
 I really liked that movie there 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.680
 are a bit of inconsistencies can conceal 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.780
 but there have always been boys 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.720
 in dragonball so it's not the thing now 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.400
 particular however we look for a 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.560
 they try to beat wings 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.260
 that I remember you guys and put it 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.650
 even the guide bills itself is much more 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.620
 strong of mills that is to say in practice 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.930
 his teacher therefore we should 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.190
 go a little with your feet of lead 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.229
 predict if we can defeat them 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.030
 for boys in the next videos 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.830
 obviously others will also arrive 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.750
 large or mitch so not dedicated 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.180
 just to the dragon ball episodes 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.490
 super but my idea was in fact 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.750
 which inspired us to super dragonball 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.150
 so as to have even in quotation marks 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.470
 an excuse to bring other videos of 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.050
 telecom and urgent because precisely 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.180
 I know that you like to draw then 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.550
 we continue to hit like this and stay 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.890
 taking doors gift impossible fury 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.599
 of the god of destruction st move I believe 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.580
 never having done it in my life 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.729
 and then there is anger of the god of 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.010
 destruction and then destroy oneself 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.890
 I have to see if making me hit 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:09.160
 hits watch wiz a va well be here now me 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:11.800
 destroy no I must try to beat him 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.840
 to recover some kate no me it 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.789
 beak, however, I do hit a little 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.780
 because I want to get a lot of aura 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.150
 from try it 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.650
 if my teacher can take you in 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.460
 around so i was doing the lap tour 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.010
 round about him 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.930
 farmyard and as I was saying then guys 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.300
 I want to try to eliminate it look like 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.410
 does the kids I used little bills 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.479
 when it comes back 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.240
 if you look at the way I come back 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:36.849
 back there is really very nice from 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.640
 hit you have the courage don't make it 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:41.410
 and useless before we lost it guys 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.890
 but now we are splitting everything 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:47.050
 go with the sphere of destruction 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:50.140
 hit bills show that if the god 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.690
 so here it is completely 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.159
 destroyed and therefore ragazzoni at least in 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.050
 we have won this fight from 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:57.789
 really very very well then 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.710
 legations I greet you, please 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:01.210
 we try to overcome the 2000 I hunt for 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.430
 this video dedicated a little dragon ball 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.570
 super and above all I also remind you of 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.520
 sign up if you haven't done it yet 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.500
 other videos from 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.360
 dragon ball servers are not dedicated to 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.460
 super dragonball but also a little frog c 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.750
 or some nice to mind because of me 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.640
 I recommend the connected states 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.289
 so guys follow me on facebook and 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.880
