00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.839
 This is clear because the pilots immediately feel their own 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.369
 Compare this with facts Kristian Meier 30 

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:13.629
 last year Olympia Seventh in Nagano 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.640
 and 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.779
 In the garbage World Cup overall, I also stay in ninth place with Christoph 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.749
 long 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:25.749
 by that 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.049
 my position in the first starting group for the Swiss 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.700
 his new team at the start 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.560
 only her conspecifics overheard and software around as his team 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.450
 seven hundredths behind 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.850
 when will start to invite to the recent west side of Ground 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.340
 but already ahead 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.220
 if a minus before the comparison test pages appears over viewers 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.610
 does that mean 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.670
 the drive got a head start 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.670
 a plus sign travels 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.190
 he starts his lead from about the same speed 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
 the invitees at this point 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.020
 the Swiss must have had excellent material at least in the two but 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.080
 Respect for their time Well there is now clearly undercut 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.390
 the court so far is from a blogger 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.380
 55 Coma 6 2 seconds that could be 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.830
 a house number, so to speak, for the following competition 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.159
 Christian Reich has to be in his best position yesterday 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.070
 Two-competition here are among the favorites to be counted from the second 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.000
 Start group out 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.050
 he sure has 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.640
 After all, the fourth position was despite the first run 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.020
 who placed on and even race number even second 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.069
 and the pages started with Macy that means he has to drive very well and 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.199
 above all 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.849
 AFO advise the material to have the high speeds last they look into 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.489
 the moment 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.400
 since the light barriers happened the heads come up so high on the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.219
 Air resistance grows Donath 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:27.499
 Braking action 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:28.159
 that would
