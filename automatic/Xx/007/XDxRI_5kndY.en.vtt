00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.750
 but let's argue what are the 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.120
 properties of the interiors of a 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.390
 kitchen saints and in this particular case 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.219
 of how prepared come equipped in 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.690
 its interior appearance in this case drawer 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.839
 this is an argument that we 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.469
 we use a lot in which we prioritize 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.839
 inner capacity drawer support 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.170
 weight that can reach endure it 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:01.119
 is between 50 and 65 kilos extraction 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.579
 total is to say that in other manufacturers 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.289
 of the drawer that was inside and here the 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.880
 exploitation is always done but 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:10.130
 to avoid 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.260
 shock 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.490
 it is totally produced 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.480
 you can see elements of this size 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.340
 although the variety of dimensions 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.560
 really very broad ranging from 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.210
 practically 30 to 40 centimeters up 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.750
 one meter 20 here we can see 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.530
 perfectly how they take advantage 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.220
 entirely 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.520
 they also incorporate 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.980
 the modular ones I suspect inside and 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.780
 we can organize the space really 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.250
 as we want and built on boards 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.840
 sailors that in 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.700
 what they do is that they resist 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.700
 perfectly moisture 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.640
 at the top also with its 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.890
 pour the components also done without 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.220
 marine board and perfectly 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.020
 modular and you can choose between what 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.090
 that are traditional buckets for 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.790
 free cutlery to equip them as 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.320
 we want very practical cutlery for 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.720
 get the space organized in 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.790
 pick them up safely and keep what 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.950
 next computer and spicemasters 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.660
 dedicated preferably to spice 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.250
 fully removable kitchen for 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.410
 to be able to work with them on top of the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.660
 countertop and one of the aspects that more 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.180
 we also like what is the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.160
 integral use the bars we have 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.570
 spoken that your drawer has naturally 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.570
 closing and brake 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.329
 one of respect, we said who else 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.819
 like is the use of the part 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.560
 top in the furniture detached in this 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.959
 case we have equipped you with a system of 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.409
 security expressly provided for 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.500
 children in which they avoid that you can 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.050
 access the interior of the drawer 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.880
 as we see so well done in built 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.320
 Humanism delivery the whole structure of 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.880
 furniture and we have the option to manufacture 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.040
 not only the box but the 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.230
 body the structure of the furniture also 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.180
 he struck nuances that is to come 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.040
 To spoil the furniture should have 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.620
 a lot of water leakage for a long time 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.240
 because to get to spoil it and the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.980
 advantage of course the part 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.500
 superior not only of the lower 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.750
 but also from the top of the 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.430
 sink regardless of the format 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.420
 of sink that we have of a bucket 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.860
 of two or cube and a half 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.260
 I have seen that that is something a key 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.980
 special to open the drawer if it's a 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.650
 simple key is a security key 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.959
 very basic that is simply when 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.430
 we leave the drawer hooked the access 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.840
 that we have the minimum the child can not 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.310
 access it and when it's time to give 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.459
 simply enter the key 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.459
 and move it very easy and very simple
