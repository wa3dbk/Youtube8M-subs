so many courses you want to take and you

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.060 
so many courses you want to take and you
know<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.810> have<00:00:19.020> four<00:00:19.199> years<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.770> but

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
you kind of want to take them all at

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.480 
you kind of want to take them all at
once<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.410> lot<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.650> decisions<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.310> have<00:00:23.340> to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
once it's a lot of decisions you have to

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
many science classes as I can and try to

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.420 
many science classes as I can and try to
like<00:00:38.989> kind<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.050> coordinate<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.160> AP

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
like kind of coordinate that with the AP

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.680 
like kind of coordinate that with the AP
credit<00:00:41.820> because<00:00:42.000> that's<00:00:42.149> that's<00:00:42.450> where

he's won the big teaching prize what

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.130 
he's won the big teaching prize what
what<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> would<00:01:59.549> take<00:01:59.820> if<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.390> were<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
what I would take if I were you one of

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.410 
what I would take if I were you one of
the<00:02:01.229> things<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.680> take<00:02:01.979> you've<00:02:02.640> got<00:02:02.909> down<00:02:03.180> here

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the things I take you've got down here

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.580 
the things I take you've got down here

you<00:02:07.950> don't<00:02:08.069> need<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.550> stuff<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:09.030> already

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
you don't need this stuff you already

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.550 
you don't need this stuff you already
got<00:02:09.479> credit<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.160> go<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.310> 121

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
got credit for it you can go to 121

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.440 
got credit for it you can go to 121
and<00:02:12.650> get<00:02:12.920> into<00:02:13.190> Hutchinson's<00:02:13.790> section<00:02:14.180> eight

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
and get into Hutchinson's section eight

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.660 
and get into Hutchinson's section eight
o'clock<00:02:14.660> in<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.900> morning<00:02:15.260> terrific<00:02:15.670> now

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
o'clock in the morning terrific now

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.120 
o'clock in the morning terrific now
that's<00:02:16.940> that's<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:18.050> argument<00:02:18.530> for<00:02:18.650> chemistry

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
that's that's the argument for chemistry

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.309 
that's that's the argument for chemistry
there's<00:02:19.700> no<00:02:19.970> better<00:02:20.239> chemistry<00:02:20.599> teacher<00:02:21.080> in

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
there's no better chemistry teacher in

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.500 
there's no better chemistry teacher in
America<00:02:21.410> than<00:02:22.069> John<00:02:22.280> Hutchinson<00:02:22.700> all<00:02:23.180> right

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
America than John Hutchinson all right

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.150 
America than John Hutchinson all right
but<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:23.930> don't<00:02:24.110> see<00:02:24.319> a<00:02:24.349> point<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.830> not<00:02:24.980> doing

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
but I don't see a point of not doing

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.000 
but I don't see a point of not doing
organic<00:02:25.880> no<00:02:26.569> no<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.989> don't<00:02:27.170> want<00:02:27.410> physics

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
organic no no you don't want physics

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.130 
organic no no you don't want physics
more<00:02:28.220> one<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.940> already<00:02:29.120> have<00:02:29.300> credit<00:02:29.959> for

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
more one you already have credit for

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.710 
more one you already have credit for
physics<00:02:30.560> one<00:02:31.150> today<00:02:32.150> I

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
physics one today I

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.059 
physics one today I
if<00:02:33.050> I<00:02:33.230> were<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.530> wouldn't<00:02:33.800> take<00:02:33.980> any<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:36.069> I

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
if I were you I wouldn't take any I I

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.059 
if I were you I wouldn't take any I I
would<00:02:37.610> take<00:02:37.849> sophomore<00:02:38.390> physics<00:02:38.840> next<00:02:39.769> year

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
would take sophomore physics next year

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.460 
would take sophomore physics next year
all<00:02:40.880> right<00:02:41.060> now<00:02:41.480> if<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:41.810> want<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.290> take

all right now if you want to take

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.430 
all right now if you want to take
physics<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:44.480> like<00:02:44.660> physics<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.230> best

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
physics I you like physics the best

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.890 
physics I you like physics the best
right<00:02:45.769> didn't<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:46.519> remember<00:02:46.580> reading<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.420> well

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
right didn't I remember reading it well

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.580 
right didn't I remember reading it well
take<00:02:48.110> physics<00:02:48.590> 201<00:02:49.220> 201<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.390> mean<00:02:51.260> even<00:02:51.530> though

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
take physics 201 201 I mean even though

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.289 
take physics 201 201 I mean even though
I<00:02:51.620> got<00:02:51.769> four<00:02:51.890> fives<00:02:52.069> on<00:02:52.280> my<00:02:52.430> physics<00:02:52.760> AP<00:02:52.970> tests

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
I got four fives on my physics AP tests

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.280 
I got four fives on my physics AP tests
I<00:02:53.450> don't<00:02:53.600> think<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.900> don't<00:02:54.049> feel<00:02:54.170> comfortable

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
I don't think I don't feel comfortable

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.500 
I don't think I don't feel comfortable
enough<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.739> go<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.010> sophomore<00:02:55.280> okay<00:02:55.880> that's<00:02:56.390> a

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
enough to go to sophomore okay that's a

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.720 
enough to go to sophomore okay that's a
very<00:02:56.780> good<00:02:57.019> reason<00:02:57.230> take<00:02:57.590> physics<00:02:57.980> 101<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.580> like

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
very good reason take physics 101 I like

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.789 
very good reason take physics 101 I like
it<00:02:58.849> the<00:02:58.940> best

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
it the best

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.680 
it the best
okay<00:03:00.799> fine<00:03:01.160> take<00:03:01.549> yeah<00:03:01.940> you're<00:03:02.299> weak<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.660> got

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
okay fine take yeah you're weak you got

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:11.940 
okay fine take yeah you're weak you got
a<00:03:02.840> five<00:03:03.049> minute<00:03:03.470> out<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.620> five<00:03:03.860> okay
