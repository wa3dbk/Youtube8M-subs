there<00:00:55.860> was<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> market<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.579> more<00:00:57.109> heavy-duty

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
there was a market for a more heavy-duty

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.299 
there was a market for a more heavy-duty
version<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.719> this<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.140> result<00:01:02.039> of

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
version of it and this is the result of

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.850 
version of it and this is the result of
their<00:01:03.769> design<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.250> new<00:01:05.850> robust<00:01:06.860> so

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
their design it's the new robust so

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.070 
their design it's the new robust so
pretty<00:01:08.100> much<00:01:08.450> when<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.510> look<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.810> toothy

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
pretty much when you look at the toothy

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840 
pretty much when you look at the toothy
or<00:01:10.229> see<00:01:10.380> there's<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.860> lot<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.010> similarities<00:01:11.700> but

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
or see there's a lot of similarities but

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.160 
or see there's a lot of similarities but
actually<00:01:12.090> when<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.270> pick<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.780> robust

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
actually when you pick up the robust

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.109 
actually when you pick up the robust
it's<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.470> heavy<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.740> knife<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.400> feels<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.000> more

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
it's a heavy a knife it feels a more

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.300 
it's a heavy a knife it feels a more
solid<00:01:15.390> knife<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.710> hand<00:01:16.950> there's<00:01:17.189> more

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
solid knife in the hand there's more

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.730 
solid knife in the hand there's more
weight<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:19.229> blade<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.530> actually

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
weight to it the blade is actually

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.530 
weight to it the blade is actually
slightly<00:01:19.860> longer<00:01:20.189> looks<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.580> thing<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.150> 100

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
slightly longer looks the thing is 100

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
slightly longer looks the thing is 100
mils<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:22.049> about<00:01:22.200> sending<00:01:22.560> me<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> longer

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
mils it's about sending me the longer

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.530 
mils it's about sending me the longer
and<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.119> little<00:01:24.360> bit<00:01:24.450> wider<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:27.390> big

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and it's a little bit wider to the big

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.310 
and it's a little bit wider to the big
difference<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:28.229> well<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.130> thickness

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
difference as well as in the thickness

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.219 
difference as well as in the thickness
just<00:01:31.320> see<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.710> there<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:33.240> original<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.570> 2.5

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
just see that there the original is 2.5

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.260 
just see that there the original is 2.5
is<00:01:34.439> pretty<00:01:34.710> much<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.860> standard<00:01:35.270> thickness

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
is pretty much the standard thickness

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.530 
is pretty much the standard thickness
for<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.720> young<00:01:37.220> more<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> blade<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.420> new

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
for a young more a blade but the the new

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.230 
for a young more a blade but the the new
robust<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.990> 3.2<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.890> its<00:01:41.009> thickest<00:01:41.759> bladed

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
robust is 3.2 and its thickest bladed

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.920 
robust is 3.2 and its thickest bladed
more<00:01:42.750> are<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.930> combine<00:01:44.750> another<00:01:45.750> feature

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
more are you combine another feature

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.840 
more are you combine another feature
which<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.320> nice<00:01:46.530> actually<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.340> they've

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
which is nice actually is they've

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.940 
which is nice actually is they've
actually<00:01:48.000> put<00:01:48.299> more<00:01:48.450> belly<00:01:48.720> onto<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.409> handle

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
actually put more belly onto this handle

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.620 
actually put more belly onto this handle

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
still we know perfectly not to think

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.670 
still we know perfectly not to think
that<00:03:09.450> would<00:03:09.540> be<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.690> great<00:03:09.900> slicing<00:03:10.380> knife<00:03:10.470> as

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
that would be a great slicing knife as

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.070 
that would be a great slicing knife as
well<00:03:11.060> that's<00:03:12.060> another<00:03:12.480> little<00:03:12.630> feature<00:03:12.900> they

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
well that's another little feature they

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.320 
well that's another little feature they
have<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.380> on<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> shoes<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:14.209> didn't<00:03:15.209> figure

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
have is on the shoes I didn't figure

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.440 
have is on the shoes I didn't figure
before<00:03:15.570> about<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.140> use<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.290> these<00:03:17.450> keyhole

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
before about the use of these keyhole

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.120 
before about the use of these keyhole
attachments<00:03:19.170> for<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.380> buttons<00:03:19.680> on<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.890> pence

attachments for the buttons on the pence

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.009 
attachments for the buttons on the pence
but<00:03:21.000> then<00:03:21.090> what<00:03:21.209> they've<00:03:21.360> done<00:03:21.510> here<00:03:21.570> which<00:03:21.900> is

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
but then what they've done here which is

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.270 
but then what they've done here which is
quite<00:03:22.170> nice<00:03:22.290> as<00:03:22.530> they<00:03:22.650> put<00:03:22.860> one<00:03:22.980> on<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.130> front

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
quite nice as they put one on the front

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.400 
quite nice as they put one on the front
mmm<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.420> essentially<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.810> means<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:25.320> you

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
mmm so essentially that means that you

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.600 
mmm so essentially that means that you
can<00:03:26.959> attach<00:03:27.959> with<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.440> keyhole<00:03:28.830> one<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.459> can

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
can attach with the keyhole one you can

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.539 
can attach with the keyhole one you can
attach<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.360> yen<00:03:31.130> sheath<00:03:32.130> on<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.430> other

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
attach it to the yen sheath on the other

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.360 
attach it to the yen sheath on the other
so<00:03:33.209> you<00:03:33.269> can<00:03:33.390> basically<00:03:33.570> double<00:03:34.110> sheath

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
so you can basically double sheath

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.250 
so you can basically double sheath
mmmhmmm<00:03:35.370> sorry<00:03:35.670> there<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.900> here<00:03:37.110> obviously

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
mmmhmmm sorry there so here obviously

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.990 
mmmhmmm sorry there so here obviously

same but you know more do such a big

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.460 
same but you know more do such a big
range<00:03:41.579> you<00:03:41.760> could<00:03:41.910> carry<00:03:42.150> one<00:03:42.390> hmm<00:03:42.930> one<00:03:43.260> knife

and a specialist knife on that on the
sheath<00:03:47.000> touching<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.120> like<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.480> it's<00:03:49.140> quite

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
sheath touching it like that it's quite

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.539 
sheath touching it like that it's quite
good<00:03:49.380> system<00:03:49.739> really<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.010> does<00:03:50.130> gives<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.400> bit

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
good system really it does gives a bit

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.550 
good system really it does gives a bit
of<00:03:50.610> flexibility<00:03:51.120> for<00:03:51.390> really<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:52.049> know<00:03:52.200> it's

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
of flexibility for really you know it's

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.220 
of flexibility for really you know it's
not<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:52.829> lot<00:03:52.920> of<00:03:53.540> extra<00:03:54.540> work<00:03:54.570> so<00:03:54.989> I'm<00:03:55.049> going<00:03:55.200> to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
not a lot of extra work so I'm going to

good solid knife for great length you

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.520 
good solid knife for great length you
know<00:04:07.350> so<00:04:07.620> your<00:04:07.739> usual<00:04:09.019> typical<00:04:10.019> more<00:04:10.200> equality

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
know so your usual typical more equality

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.319 
know so your usual typical more equality
the<00:04:11.010> 12c<00:04:11.430> there's<00:04:11.730> actually<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.150> is<00:04:12.269> a

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
the 12c there's actually this is a

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.940 
the 12c there's actually this is a
carbon<00:04:12.570> steel<00:04:12.959> this<00:04:13.110> is<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.470> first<00:04:13.739> ones<00:04:13.890> a

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
carbon steel this is the first ones a

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.050 
carbon steel this is the first ones a
car<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:14.310> don't<00:04:14.519> know<00:04:14.640> they're<00:04:14.760> going<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:14.910> do<00:04:15.030> a

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
car I don't know they're going to do a

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.909 
car I don't know they're going to do a
stainless<00:04:15.480> version<00:04:15.840> these<00:04:16.229> ones<00:04:16.350> are<00:04:16.500> carbon

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
stainless version these ones are carbon

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.229 
stainless version these ones are carbon
a<00:04:17.100> high<00:04:18.090> carbon<00:04:18.540> steel

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
a high carbon steel

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.129 
a high carbon steel
nice<00:04:20.359> comfortable<00:04:20.840> handle<00:04:21.639> it's<00:04:22.639> not<00:04:22.759> soft

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
nice comfortable handle it's not soft

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.659 
nice comfortable handle it's not soft
plastic<00:04:24.139> this<00:04:24.289> but<00:04:24.620> it's<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:24.770> very<00:04:24.800> durable<00:04:25.310> I

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
plastic this but it's a very durable I

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.300 
plastic this but it's a very durable I
think<00:04:25.970> I<00:04:26.060> polypropylene<00:04:26.780> you<00:04:27.680> know<00:04:27.800> it<00:04:27.919> would

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
think I polypropylene you know it would

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.710 
think I polypropylene you know it would
take<00:04:28.460> years<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:28.910> years<00:04:28.970> to<00:04:29.180> wear<00:04:29.360> on<00:04:29.569> these

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
take years and years to wear on these

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.710 
take years and years to wear on these
out<00:04:30.580> but<00:04:31.580> yeah<00:04:31.699> the<00:04:31.910> more<00:04:32.030> robust<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.449> i<00:04:32.479> think

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
out but yeah the more robust the i think

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.360 
out but yeah the more robust the i think
is<00:04:32.810> a<00:04:32.840> really<00:04:32.960> good<00:04:33.740> knife<00:04:33.889> and<00:04:34.069> i<00:04:34.160> think<00:04:34.310> a

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
is a really good knife and i think a

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.770 
is a really good knife and i think a
real<00:04:34.520> winner<00:04:34.699> for<00:04:34.910> Maura<00:04:35.090> excellent<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:37.780> you
