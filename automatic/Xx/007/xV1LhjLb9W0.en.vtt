there we go kind of show you the speed

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.969 
there we go kind of show you the speed
here<00:06:49.430> at<00:06:49.849> which<00:06:50.180> both<00:06:50.599> these<00:06:50.810> candles<00:06:51.199> move<00:06:51.379> so

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099 
I'm going to just do a page turn and you

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.089 
I'm going to just do a page turn and you
see<00:06:55.250> it's<00:06:55.370> fairly<00:06:55.550> similar<00:06:56.889> there's<00:06:57.889> not

00:06:58.089 --> 00:06:58.099 
see it's fairly similar there's not

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:02.309 
see it's fairly similar there's not
really<00:06:59.979> you<00:07:00.979> know<00:07:01.039> depending<00:07:01.729> on<00:07:01.819> the<00:07:01.909> page

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 
really you know depending on the page

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:05.709 
really you know depending on the page
one<00:07:03.319> Kindle<00:07:03.800> is<00:07:04.159> fashion<00:07:04.610> the<00:07:04.759> other<00:07:04.879> the<00:07:05.539> new

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:05.719 
one Kindle is fashion the other the new

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:08.399 
one Kindle is fashion the other the new
version<00:07:06.020> is<00:07:06.110> definitely<00:07:06.680> not<00:07:06.889> a<00:07:07.400> step<00:07:08.180> above

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:08.409 
version is definitely not a step above

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:13.839 
version is definitely not a step above
the<00:07:09.409> last<00:07:09.620> version<00:07:09.889> as<00:07:10.520> far<00:07:11.509> as<00:07:12.520> page<00:07:13.520> turn

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:13.849 
the last version as far as page turn

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:18.520 
the last version as far as page turn
speed<00:07:14.180> goes<00:07:14.479> and<00:07:14.979> so<00:07:16.000> but<00:07:17.000> again<00:07:17.259> it<00:07:18.259> actually

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
speed goes and so but again it actually

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.480 
speed goes and so but again it actually
seems<00:07:18.710> like<00:07:18.740> it<00:07:18.919> might<00:07:19.009> even<00:07:19.099> be<00:07:19.280> a<00:07:19.310> little

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490 
seems like it might even be a little

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.110 
seems like it might even be a little
slower<00:07:19.699> but<00:07:20.020> don't<00:07:21.020> quote<00:07:21.199> me<00:07:21.349> on<00:07:21.379> that<00:07:22.120> go

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 
slower but don't quote me on that go

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.059 
slower but don't quote me on that go
back<00:07:23.270> to<00:07:23.360> the<00:07:23.419> home<00:07:23.569> page<00:07:23.719> here<00:07:23.949> the<00:07:24.949> new

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:29.019 
back to the home page here the new
Kindle<00:07:25.330> isn't<00:07:26.330> meant<00:07:26.569> to<00:07:26.659> be<00:07:26.750> a<00:07:27.199> real<00:07:27.909> you<00:07:28.909> know

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:29.029 
Kindle isn't meant to be a real you know

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:30.700 
Kindle isn't meant to be a real you know
big<00:07:29.330> differentiator<00:07:30.050> it's<00:07:30.349> this<00:07:30.560> is

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:30.710 
big differentiator it's this is

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.040 
big differentiator it's this is
definitely<00:07:31.099> just<00:07:31.699> an<00:07:31.909> entry-level<00:07:32.419> Kindle

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.050

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.589 
model meant to be inexpensive cheap
I<00:07:36.800> guess<00:07:37.550> those<00:07:37.729> words<00:07:37.940> mean<00:07:38.090> the<00:07:38.150> same<00:07:38.360> thing

00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:38.599 
I guess those words mean the same thing

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:40.719 
I guess those words mean the same thing
