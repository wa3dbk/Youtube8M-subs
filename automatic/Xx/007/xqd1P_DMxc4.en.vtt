this<00:00:14.180> presentation<00:00:14.420> we're<00:00:14.780> going<00:00:14.810> to<00:00:14.960> be

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.050 
this presentation we're going to be

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.540 
this presentation we're going to be
looking<00:00:15.140> at<00:00:15.380> doing<00:00:15.590> two<00:00:15.890> simple<00:00:16.340> cloth

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
looking at doing two simple cloth

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.550 
looking at doing two simple cloth
simulations<00:00:17.510> the<00:00:18.019> first<00:00:18.230> one<00:00:18.380> that<00:00:18.439> we're

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
simulations the first one that we're

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.260 
simulations the first one that we're
going<00:00:18.680> to<00:00:18.740> do<00:00:18.860> is<00:00:18.980> going<00:00:19.190> to<00:00:19.280> be<00:00:19.369> a<00:00:19.400> flag<00:00:19.789> prison

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
going to do is going to be a flag prison

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.750 
going to do is going to be a flag prison
simulation<00:00:20.990> of<00:00:21.140> this<00:00:21.770> piece<00:00:21.949> of<00:00:22.070> geometry<00:00:22.250> so

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
simulation of this piece of geometry so

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.250 
simulation of this piece of geometry so
the<00:00:22.880> first<00:00:23.119> step<00:00:23.270> in<00:00:23.510> this<00:00:23.630> is<00:00:23.840> to<00:00:23.960> go<00:00:24.080> ahead

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
the first step in this is to go ahead

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.930 
the first step in this is to go ahead
and<00:00:24.350> create<00:00:24.500> a<00:00:24.740> cloth<00:00:25.010> object<00:00:25.550> from<00:00:25.789> this

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
and create a cloth object from this

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.750 
and create a cloth object from this
piece<00:00:26.119> of<00:00:26.270> geometry<00:00:27.400> so<00:00:28.400> now<00:00:28.520> that<00:00:28.550> we've

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
piece of geometry so now that we've

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.640 
piece of geometry so now that we've
generated<00:00:29.150> a<00:00:29.390> cloth<00:00:29.779> object<00:00:30.260> from<00:00:30.350> that<00:00:30.500> piece

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
generated a cloth object from that piece

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.349 
generated a cloth object from that piece
of<00:00:30.770> geometry<00:00:30.949> if<00:00:31.400> we<00:00:31.520> start<00:00:31.760> our<00:00:31.880> playback

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:32.359 
of geometry if we start our playback

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:34.029 
of geometry if we start our playback
you'll<00:00:32.899> notice<00:00:33.140> that<00:00:33.199> the<00:00:33.350> cloth<00:00:33.559> starts<00:00:33.920> to

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:34.039 
you'll notice that the cloth starts to

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.799 
you'll notice that the cloth starts to
drop<00:00:34.219> down<00:00:34.519> so<00:00:34.760> gravity's<00:00:35.179> taking<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:35.569> effect

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
drop down so gravity's taking the effect

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.419 
drop down so gravity's taking the effect
of<00:00:35.929> that<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:36.229> it's<00:00:36.319> pointed<00:00:36.679> down<00:00:36.829> onto<00:00:37.399> the

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:37.429 
of that and it's pointed down onto the

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:39.549 
of that and it's pointed down onto the
ground<00:00:37.539> what<00:00:38.539> we<00:00:38.659> need<00:00:38.809> to<00:00:38.899> do<00:00:39.050> is<00:00:39.229> we<00:00:39.350> need<00:00:39.379> to

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
ground what we need to do is we need to

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:40.930 
ground what we need to do is we need to
tag<00:00:39.769> a<00:00:39.800> couple<00:00:40.159> of<00:00:40.219> points<00:00:40.550> on<00:00:40.609> this<00:00:40.760> to

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
tag a couple of points on this to

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.329 
tag a couple of points on this to
suspend<00:00:41.359> it<00:00:41.510> from<00:00:41.690> this<00:00:41.899> flagpole<00:00:42.190> this<00:00:43.190> is<00:00:43.309> a

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
suspend it from this flagpole this is a

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.549 
suspend it from this flagpole this is a
very<00:00:43.609> very<00:00:43.850> simple<00:00:44.089> process<00:00:44.449> inside<00:00:45.170> of<00:00:45.350> Maya

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
very very simple process inside of Maya

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.200 
very very simple process inside of Maya
all<00:00:45.889> we<00:00:46.280> have<00:00:46.399> to<00:00:46.489> do<00:00:46.609> is<00:00:46.729> go<00:00:46.850> back<00:00:46.999> to<00:00:47.059> our

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
all we have to do is go back to our

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.079 
all we have to do is go back to our
beginning<00:00:47.659> animate<00:00:48.019> frame<00:00:48.699> grab<00:00:49.699> a<00:00:49.729> couple<00:00:50.030> of

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
beginning animate frame grab a couple of

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.209 
beginning animate frame grab a couple of
vertices<00:00:50.510> that<00:00:50.569> we<00:00:50.809> want<00:00:50.989> to<00:00:51.079> work<00:00:51.199> with<00:00:51.260> and

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.459 

tag<00:00:55.219> them<00:00:55.489> into<00:00:55.909> this<00:00:56.030> flagpole<00:00:56.959> so<00:00:57.350> we'll

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
tag them into this flagpole so we'll

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:58.750 
tag them into this flagpole so we'll
create<00:00:57.679> a<00:00:57.769> simple<00:00:57.979> transformation

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
create a simple transformation

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.719 
create a simple transformation
constraint<00:00:59.179> to<00:00:59.299> do<00:00:59.420> this<00:01:00.429> now<00:01:01.429> that<00:01:01.579> that

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
constraint to do this now that that

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.189 
constraint to do this now that that
transformation<00:01:02.329> constraints<00:01:02.749> been<00:01:02.899> added

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
transformation constraints been added

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.020 
transformation constraints been added
into<00:01:03.319> our<00:01:03.589> simulation<00:01:04.220> if<00:01:04.369> we<00:01:04.489> replay<00:01:04.879> it

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
into our simulation if we replay it

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.550 
into our simulation if we replay it
obviously<00:01:05.900> we're<00:01:06.049> going<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.229> get<00:01:06.320> a<00:01:06.350> different

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
obviously we're going to get a different

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.350 
obviously we're going to get a different
look<00:01:06.710> than<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.280> we<00:01:07.550> did<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.790> first<00:01:07.820> time<00:01:08.090> so

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
look than the we did the first time so

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.630 
look than the we did the first time so
the<00:01:08.450> cape<00:01:09.350> or<00:01:09.620> the<00:01:09.770> flag<00:01:09.950> is<00:01:10.130> just<00:01:10.310> hanging

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
the cape or the flag is just hanging

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.610 
the cape or the flag is just hanging
here<00:01:10.760> on<00:01:10.880> this<00:01:11.000> flagpole<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:12.290> next<00:01:12.530> thing

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
here on this flagpole the next thing

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
here on this flagpole the next thing
that<00:01:12.650> we<00:01:12.770> want<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:12.980> do<00:01:13.070> is<00:01:13.220> want<00:01:13.370> to<00:01:13.430> look<00:01:13.550> at

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
that we want to do is want to look at

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.680 
that we want to do is want to look at
some<00:01:13.790> of<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.940> environmental<00:01:14.210> parameters

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
some of the environmental parameters

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.050 
some of the environmental parameters
that<00:01:15.140> go<00:01:15.290> into<00:01:15.440> this<00:01:15.590> simulation<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:16.910> we're

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
that go into this simulation so we're

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.340 
that go into this simulation so we're
going<00:01:17.150> to<00:01:17.240> go<00:01:17.330> back<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:17.600> our<00:01:17.750> beginning<00:01:18.230> and

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
going to go back to our beginning and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.630 
going to go back to our beginning and
we're<00:01:18.440> going<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:18.590> start<00:01:18.800> to<00:01:18.890> introduce<00:01:19.220> some

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
we're going to start to introduce some

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.160 
we're going to start to introduce some
wind<00:01:19.880> into<00:01:20.330> our<00:01:20.420> environment<00:01:22.870> so<00:01:23.870> if<00:01:23.930> we<00:01:24.020> go<00:01:24.110> to

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
wind into our environment so if we go to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.420 
wind into our environment so if we go to
the<00:01:24.290> nucleus<00:01:24.620> note<00:01:24.830> here<00:01:25.010> you'll<00:01:25.160> notice<00:01:25.250> that

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
the nucleus note here you'll notice that

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.070 
the nucleus note here you'll notice that
there's<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.700> wind<00:01:25.970> speed<00:01:26.240> parameter<00:01:26.510> and<00:01:26.870> if<00:01:26.990> we

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
there's a wind speed parameter and if we

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.590 
there's a wind speed parameter and if we
start<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.440> increase<00:01:27.830> some<00:01:28.130> wind<00:01:28.340> speed<00:01:28.640> on<00:01:28.820> the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
start to increase some wind speed on the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.470 
start to increase some wind speed on the
simulation<00:01:30.940> something<00:01:31.940> very<00:01:32.090> interesting<00:01:32.240> is

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
simulation something very interesting is

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.090 
simulation something very interesting is
going<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:32.720> happen<00:01:33.050> you'll<00:01:33.650> notice<00:01:33.890> that<00:01:33.920> the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
going to happen you'll notice that the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.890 
going to happen you'll notice that the
flag<00:01:34.370> starts<00:01:34.910> to<00:01:35.060> lift<00:01:35.240> up<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:35.660> this<00:01:35.750> is

paint a selection here across the air

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.520 
paint a selection here across the air
will<00:02:17.510> get<00:02:17.629> a<00:02:17.659> nice<00:02:17.810> chunk<00:02:18.050> that's<00:02:18.290> going<00:02:18.470> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
will get a nice chunk that's going to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.780 
will get a nice chunk that's going to
fall<00:02:18.680> off<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:19.099> we'll<00:02:19.220> do<00:02:19.310> another<00:02:19.340> little

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
fall off and we'll do another little

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.850 
fall off and we'll do another little
line<00:02:20.000> across<00:02:20.299> here<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:20.900> now<00:02:21.470> all<00:02:21.620> we<00:02:21.709> have<00:02:21.830> to

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
line across here and now all we have to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.470 
line across here and now all we have to
do<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.190> click<00:02:22.370> another<00:02:22.580> button<00:02:22.700> on<00:02:23.090> our<00:02:23.209> shelf

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
do is click another button on our shelf

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.479 
do is click another button on our shelf
to<00:02:23.900> go<00:02:24.019> ahead<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.349> define<00:02:24.440> those<00:02:24.890> edges<00:02:25.400> that

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
to go ahead and define those edges that

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.690 
to go ahead and define those edges that
we've<00:02:25.640> previously<00:02:25.940> selected<00:02:26.299> as<00:02:26.659> tears<00:02:27.700> so

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
we've previously selected as tears so

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.600 
we've previously selected as tears so
now<00:02:28.819> that<00:02:28.970> we've<00:02:29.090> done<00:02:29.269> that<00:02:29.480> if<00:02:30.010> we<00:02:31.010> select

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
now that we've done that if we select

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.160 
now that we've done that if we select
those<00:02:31.849> guys<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.299> that<00:02:32.420> we<00:02:32.510> can<00:02:32.629> modify<00:02:32.900> some

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
those guys so that we can modify some

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.910 
those guys so that we can modify some
parameters<00:02:33.440> here<00:02:33.830> we'll<00:02:34.790> play<00:02:34.910> this<00:02:35.060> back<00:02:35.920> our

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
parameters here we'll play this back our

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
cloth goes ahead and it starts to break

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.930 
cloth goes ahead and it starts to break
apart<00:02:38.840> now<00:02:39.620> for<00:02:39.950> my<00:02:40.040> simulation<00:02:40.610> here<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:40.760> don't

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
apart now for my simulation here I don't

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.430 
apart now for my simulation here I don't
really<00:02:41.120> want<00:02:41.269> it<00:02:41.330> to<00:02:41.390> break<00:02:41.540> apart<00:02:41.720> right<00:02:42.319> at

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
really want it to break apart right at

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.750 
really want it to break apart right at
the<00:02:42.500> very<00:02:42.530> beginning<00:02:42.799> of<00:02:43.069> my<00:02:43.190> animation<00:02:43.640> so

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
the very beginning of my animation so

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.490 
the very beginning of my animation so
I'm<00:02:43.849> going<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.030> modify<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.569> couple<00:02:44.900> attributes

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
I'm going to modify a couple attributes

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.140 
I'm going to modify a couple attributes
on<00:02:45.620> those<00:02:46.099> constraints<00:02:46.549> that<00:02:46.670> we<00:02:46.790> just<00:02:47.030> added

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
on those constraints that we just added

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.330 
on those constraints that we just added
those<00:02:47.329> tear<00:02:47.599> constraints<00:02:48.170> again<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.190> thing

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
those tear constraints again the thing

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.069 
those tear constraints again the thing
to<00:02:49.760> realize<00:02:50.060> here<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.239> I'm<00:02:50.420> doing<00:02:50.450> this<00:02:50.750> on<00:02:50.930> a

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
to realize here is I'm doing this on a

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.319 
to realize here is I'm doing this on a
very<00:02:51.379> fast<00:02:52.069> real-time<00:02:52.640> interactive<00:02:53.060> manner

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
very fast real-time interactive manner

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.780 
very fast real-time interactive manner
it's<00:02:53.569> totally<00:02:54.019> revolutionary<00:02:54.560> super<00:02:55.370> cool<00:02:55.549> I

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
it's totally revolutionary super cool I

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.309 
it's totally revolutionary super cool I
love<00:02:56.329> it<00:02:56.480> give<00:02:57.349> very<00:02:57.500> excited<00:02:57.829> about<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:59.319> so

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
love it give very excited about it so

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.020 
love it give very excited about it so
let's<00:03:00.500> go<00:03:00.590> ahead<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:00.859> go<00:03:01.670> back<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:02.000> our

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.050 
what we're going to do is we're going to
modify<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.920> glue<00:03:07.250> strike<00:03:07.549> so<00:03:07.760> it's<00:03:07.879> got<00:03:08.030> a

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
modify the glue strike so it's got a

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.880 
modify the glue strike so it's got a
very<00:03:08.269> low<00:03:08.510> value<00:03:08.720> right<00:03:09.019> now<00:03:09.140> if<00:03:09.260> point<00:03:09.470> 1<00:03:09.680> so

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
very low value right now if point 1 so

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.309 
very low value right now if point 1 so
it<00:03:10.010> drops<00:03:10.430> down<00:03:10.579> and<00:03:10.879> it<00:03:10.940> tears<00:03:11.209> if<00:03:12.170> we

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
it drops down and it tears if we

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.349 
it drops down and it tears if we
increase<00:03:12.739> that<00:03:12.890> value<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.549> little<00:03:14.030> bit<00:03:14.150> higher

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
increase that value a little bit higher

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.050 
increase that value a little bit higher
and<00:03:14.629> we<00:03:15.620> replay<00:03:15.980> back<00:03:16.129> our<00:03:16.310> animation<00:03:16.819> or<00:03:16.940> our

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
and we replay back our animation or our

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.789 
and we replay back our animation or our
simulation<00:03:17.629> here<00:03:17.810> you'll<00:03:18.319> notice<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.590> it's

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
simulation here you'll notice that it's

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.069 
simulation here you'll notice that it's
not<00:03:18.920> tearing<00:03:19.340> anymore<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:20.720> we're<00:03:20.900> going<00:03:20.989> to

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
not tearing anymore so we're going to

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.180 
not tearing anymore so we're going to
make<00:03:21.169> the<00:03:21.290> simulation<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.829> little<00:03:22.040> more

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
make the simulation a little more

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.470 
make the simulation a little more
complicated<00:03:22.489> we're<00:03:22.790> going<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:22.970> add<00:03:23.060> another

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
complicated we're going to add another

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.599 
complicated we're going to add another
object<00:03:23.870> into<00:03:24.200> our<00:03:24.410> into<00:03:24.859> our<00:03:24.950> simulation<00:03:25.459> here

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
object into our into our simulation here

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.339 
object into our into our simulation here
we're<00:03:26.150> going<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.329> take<00:03:26.389> a<00:03:26.480> boulder<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.139> lives

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
we're going to take a boulder that lives

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.199 
we're going to take a boulder that lives
back<00:03:27.530> here<00:03:27.889> and<00:03:28.639> we're<00:03:28.760> going<00:03:28.849> to<00:03:28.910> use<00:03:29.090> that

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
back here and we're going to use that

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.030 
back here and we're going to use that
Boulder<00:03:29.599> to<00:03:29.810> bash<00:03:30.079> this<00:03:30.380> flag<00:03:30.620> around<00:03:30.829> a

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
Boulder to bash this flag around a

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.159 
Boulder to bash this flag around a
little<00:03:31.190> bit<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:32.209> this<00:03:32.389> is<00:03:32.510> this<00:03:32.780> is<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:32.930> really

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
little bit so this is this is a really

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:34.659 
little bit so this is this is a really
fun<00:03:33.319> part<00:03:33.530> of<00:03:33.590> my<00:03:33.680> job<00:03:33.859> i<00:03:34.040> get<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.280> destroy

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
fun part of my job i get to destroy

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.720 
fun part of my job i get to destroy
things<00:03:34.849> and<00:03:35.150> bash<00:03:35.329> them<00:03:35.569> around<00:03:35.720> with<00:03:35.870> rocks

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
things and bash them around with rocks

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.500 
things and bash them around with rocks
everyone<00:03:37.730> should<00:03:37.819> become<00:03:38.030> animators<00:03:38.480> and

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
everyone should become animators and

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.780 
everyone should become animators and
you'd<00:03:38.660> get<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.870> do<00:03:38.959> this<00:03:39.079> also<00:03:39.549> so<00:03:40.549> what<00:03:40.669> we're

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
you'd get to do this also so what we're

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:41.530 
you'd get to do this also so what we're
going<00:03:40.880> to<00:03:40.970> do<00:03:41.060> is<00:03:41.150> we're<00:03:41.269> going<00:03:41.359> to<00:03:41.419> go<00:03:41.510> ahead

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
going to do is we're going to go ahead

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.000 
going to do is we're going to go ahead
and<00:03:41.690> we're<00:03:41.840> going<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:41.989> find<00:03:42.290> this<00:03:42.500> Boulder<00:03:42.859> as

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
and we're going to find this Boulder as

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.000 
and we're going to find this Boulder as
a<00:03:43.040> collision<00:03:43.790> object<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:45.620> now<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:45.889> we've

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
a collision object and now that we've

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.470 
a collision object and now that we've
done<00:03:46.190> that<00:03:46.400> if<00:03:46.579> we<00:03:46.669> go<00:03:46.790> back<00:03:47.030> into<00:03:47.269> our

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
done that if we go back into our

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.680 
done that if we go back into our
interactive<00:03:48.380> playback<00:03:48.889> mode<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.480> we<00:03:50.480> start

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
interactive playback mode and we start

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.150 
interactive playback mode and we start
that<00:03:50.840> simulation<00:03:51.230> again<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:51.739> I<00:03:51.769> start<00:03:52.040> to

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
that simulation again and I start to

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.650 
that simulation again and I start to
take<00:03:52.310> this<00:03:52.430> rock<00:03:52.700> and<00:03:52.910> bash<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.269> into<00:03:53.299> the<00:03:53.480> flag

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
take this rock and bash it into the flag

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.089 
take this rock and bash it into the flag
obviously<00:03:54.230> everything<00:03:54.440> happens<00:03:54.829> in<00:03:54.919> real

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
obviously everything happens in real

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.250 
obviously everything happens in real
time<00:03:55.280> here<00:03:55.430> if<00:03:55.549> I<00:03:55.609> really<00:03:55.910> wallop<00:03:56.209> it<00:03:56.329> there

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260

this off we're going to do a kind of
similar<00:04:06.980> animation<00:04:07.579> here<00:04:07.730> we're<00:04:07.819> going<00:04:07.910> to

similar animation here we're going to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.970 
similar animation here we're going to
take<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.299> string<00:04:08.540> of<00:04:08.690> flags<00:04:08.959> that<00:04:09.709> lives

cloth object in our scene same workflow
that<00:04:16.760> we<00:04:16.970> just<00:04:17.150> did<00:04:17.239> previously<00:04:17.510> I<00:04:17.720> create<00:04:18.019> a

down<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:20.900> fall<00:04:21.769> in<00:04:21.859> a<00:04:21.919> realistic<00:04:22.220> manner<00:04:22.639> we

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
down and fall in a realistic manner we

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.540 
down and fall in a realistic manner we
want<00:04:23.510> to<00:04:23.599> have<00:04:23.690> those<00:04:23.840> flags<00:04:24.169> collide<00:04:24.890> with

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
want to have those flags collide with

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.909 
want to have those flags collide with
the<00:04:25.580> roof<00:04:25.880> of<00:04:26.030> this<00:04:26.120> OP<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.810> building<00:04:27.469> so

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
the roof of this OP the building so

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.320 
the roof of this OP the building so
we'll<00:04:28.070> grab<00:04:28.250> that<00:04:28.400> piece<00:04:28.550> of<00:04:28.700> geometry<00:04:28.909> will

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
we'll grab that piece of geometry will

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.800 
we'll grab that piece of geometry will
add<00:04:29.390> another

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
add another

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.740 
add another
an<00:04:30.050> object<00:04:30.139> on<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:31.240> now<00:04:32.240> if<00:04:32.360> we<00:04:32.480> play<00:04:32.630> it

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
an object on to it now if we play it

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.879 
an object on to it now if we play it
back<00:04:32.870> one<00:04:33.080> more<00:04:33.230> time<00:04:33.290> you'll<00:04:33.620> see<00:04:33.650> those

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
back one more time you'll see those

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.620 
back one more time you'll see those

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
flags come down and hit it and start to

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.080

collide with it realistically and what

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.190 
collide with it realistically and what
we<00:04:38.180> want<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.389> do<00:04:38.540> is<00:04:38.630> we<00:04:38.690> want<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:38.900> suspend

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
we want to do is we want to suspend

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.590 
we want to do is we want to suspend
these<00:04:39.860> flags<00:04:40.220> between<00:04:40.730> that<00:04:40.850> flagpole<00:04:41.120> in

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
these flags between that flagpole in

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.330 
these flags between that flagpole in
this<00:04:41.840> roof<00:04:42.080> so<00:04:42.830> we're<00:04:42.950> going<00:04:43.010> to<00:04:43.130> do<00:04:43.190> another

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
this roof so we're going to do another

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.860 
this roof so we're going to do another
transformation<00:04:43.850> constraint<00:04:44.570> I'm<00:04:44.660> going<00:04:44.780> to

transformation constraint I'm going to

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.440 
transformation constraint I'm going to
go<00:04:44.930> ahead<00:04:44.960> and<00:04:45.230> grab<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.470> vertice<00:04:45.980> on<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:47.180> flag

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
go ahead and grab a vertice on that flag

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.090 
go ahead and grab a vertice on that flag
there<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:48.050> add<00:04:48.200> to<00:04:48.350> my<00:04:48.470> selection<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:49.010> other

there and add to my selection and other

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.500 
there and add to my selection and other
vertice<00:04:49.520> down<00:04:49.669> here<00:04:49.940> and<00:04:50.060> do<00:04:50.120> that<00:04:50.270> same

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
vertice down here and do that same

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.970 
vertice down here and do that same
transformation<00:04:50.930> constraint<00:04:51.650> that<00:04:51.710> we<00:04:51.860> did

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
transformation constraint that we did

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.570 
transformation constraint that we did
previously<00:04:52.450> and<00:04:53.889> now<00:04:54.889> if<00:04:54.980> we<00:04:55.070> play<00:04:55.280> back<00:04:55.430> the

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
previously and now if we play back the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.340 
previously and now if we play back the
simulation<00:04:56.030> obviously<00:04:56.510> those<00:04:56.690> two<00:04:56.900> flags<00:04:57.169> are

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
simulation obviously those two flags are

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.810 
simulation obviously those two flags are
pinned<00:04:57.620> they've<00:04:58.040> been<00:04:58.310> transformed

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
pinned they've been transformed

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.150 
pinned they've been transformed
constrained<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.510> those<00:04:59.660> points<00:05:00.110> in<00:05:00.230> space<00:05:00.500> but

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
constrained to those points in space but

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.500 
constrained to those points in space but
those<00:05:01.310> other<00:05:01.340> ten<00:05:01.820> flags<00:05:02.090> don't<00:05:02.360> have<00:05:02.479> a

those other ten flags don't have a

those other ten flags don't have a
relationship<00:05:03.020> between<00:05:03.410> each<00:05:03.530> other<00:05:03.680> so<00:05:03.889> we

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
relationship between each other so we

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.430 
relationship between each other so we
need<00:05:04.190> to<00:05:04.280> add<00:05:04.430> another<00:05:04.639> constraint<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:06.200> build

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
need to add another constraint to build

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.570 
need to add another constraint to build
up<00:05:06.560> a<00:05:06.620> relationship<00:05:06.770> between<00:05:07.490> these

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
up a relationship between these

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.580 
up a relationship between these
different<00:05:07.639> flag<00:05:08.120> objects<00:05:08.600> this<00:05:09.169> again<00:05:09.440> is<00:05:09.560> a

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
different flag objects this again is a

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.159 
different flag objects this again is a
very<00:05:09.950> simple<00:05:10.250> process<00:05:10.430> inside<00:05:10.910> of<00:05:11.090> Maya<00:05:11.300> so

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
very simple process inside of Maya so

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.210 
very simple process inside of Maya so
we'll<00:05:12.320> go<00:05:12.410> ahead<00:05:12.530> and<00:05:12.620> we'll<00:05:12.710> weld<00:05:12.979> those

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
we'll go ahead and we'll weld those

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.920 
we'll go ahead and we'll weld those
objects<00:05:13.639> together<00:05:13.760> now<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.389> if<00:05:14.600> we<00:05:14.630> play<00:05:14.900> this

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
objects together now and if we play this

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.930 
objects together now and if we play this
back<00:05:15.460> obviously<00:05:16.460> they're<00:05:16.580> going<00:05:16.700> to<00:05:16.760> drop

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
back obviously they're going to drop

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.129 
back obviously they're going to drop
down<00:05:17.000> here<00:05:17.510> they're<00:05:17.660> going<00:05:17.780> to<00:05:17.840> blow<00:05:17.990> around

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
down here they're going to blow around

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.620 
down here they're going to blow around
and<00:05:18.650> they're<00:05:19.010> all<00:05:19.210> joined<00:05:20.210> together<00:05:20.300> with

and they're all joined together with
this<00:05:20.750> weld<00:05:20.990> constraint<00:05:21.530> we<00:05:22.070> go<00:05:22.190> back<00:05:22.400> to<00:05:22.520> the

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
this weld constraint we go back to the

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.250 
this weld constraint we go back to the
nucleus<00:05:23.030> node<00:05:23.300> add<00:05:23.600> a<00:05:23.660> little<00:05:23.870> bit<00:05:23.990> of<00:05:24.080> wind

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
nucleus node add a little bit of wind

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.360 
nucleus node add a little bit of wind
into<00:05:24.500> my<00:05:24.620> environment<00:05:24.889> they're<00:05:25.160> going<00:05:25.280> to

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
into my environment they're going to

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.520 
into my environment they're going to
start<00:05:25.460> to<00:05:25.639> blow<00:05:25.790> around<00:05:25.960> maybe<00:05:26.960> go<00:05:27.139> back<00:05:27.320> to

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
start to blow around maybe go back to

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.680 
start to blow around maybe go back to
the<00:05:27.650> in<00:05:28.370> cloth<00:05:28.669> shape<00:05:29.000> which<00:05:29.180> is<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:29.419> flags

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
the in cloth shape which is the flags

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.120 
the in cloth shape which is the flags
here<00:05:29.960> and<00:05:30.110> add<00:05:30.229> a<00:05:30.260> little<00:05:30.560> more<00:05:30.740> lift<00:05:30.950> they're

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
here and add a little more lift they're

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.379 
here and add a little more lift they're
going<00:05:31.250> to<00:05:31.310> start<00:05:31.400> to<00:05:31.550> flutter<00:05:31.820> a<00:05:31.910> little<00:05:32.240> more

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
going to start to flutter a little more

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.930 
going to start to flutter a little more
chaotically<00:05:33.020> and<00:05:33.290> all<00:05:34.070> of<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:34.490> constraints

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
chaotically and all of the constraints

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.700 
chaotically and all of the constraints
inside<00:05:35.150> of<00:05:35.270> Maya<00:05:35.479> working<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:35.960> same<00:05:36.260> approach

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
inside of Maya working the same approach

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.710 
inside of Maya working the same approach
so<00:05:37.039> the<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.910> ter<00:05:38.120> constraint<00:05:38.539> had<00:05:38.690> a

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
so the the ter constraint had a

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.420 
so the the ter constraint had a
threshold<00:05:39.289> that<00:05:39.440> got<00:05:39.560> exceeded<00:05:40.010> to<00:05:40.100> make<00:05:40.250> the

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
threshold that got exceeded to make the

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.820 
threshold that got exceeded to make the
the<00:05:40.669> tear<00:05:40.910> happen<00:05:41.510> the<00:05:42.020> weld<00:05:42.229> constraint<00:05:42.680> has

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
the tear happen the weld constraint has

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.830 
the tear happen the weld constraint has
the<00:05:42.950> same<00:05:43.160> type<00:05:43.400> of<00:05:43.430> attribute<00:05:43.940> on<00:05:44.060> it<00:05:44.210> called

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
the same type of attribute on it called

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.360 
the same type of attribute on it called
glue<00:05:45.050> strength<00:05:45.380> so<00:05:45.530> if<00:05:45.620> we<00:05:45.740> drop<00:05:45.979> that<00:05:46.130> glue

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
glue strength so if we drop that glue

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.580 
glue strength so if we drop that glue
strength<00:05:46.700> down<00:05:46.970> the<00:05:47.630> flags<00:05:47.870> will<00:05:48.080> break<00:05:48.289> once

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
strength down the flags will break once

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.159 
strength down the flags will break once
the<00:05:48.740> tension<00:05:49.370> level<00:05:49.400> is<00:05:49.669> exceeded<00:05:50.120> so<00:05:51.020> we'll

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
the tension level is exceeded so we'll

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:52.960 
the tension level is exceeded so we'll
go<00:05:51.260> ahead<00:05:51.410> to<00:05:51.590> that<00:05:51.710> dynamic<00:05:52.160> constraint<00:05:52.580> and

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
go ahead to that dynamic constraint and

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.340 
go ahead to that dynamic constraint and
we'll<00:05:53.300> just<00:05:53.450> start<00:05:53.570> dropping<00:05:54.020> that<00:05:54.110> glue

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
we'll just start dropping that glue

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.320 
we'll just start dropping that glue
level<00:05:54.620> down<00:05:54.740> and<00:05:55.070> there<00:05:55.490> they<00:05:55.669> go<00:05:55.700> flying<00:05:56.090> off

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
and they're going to swirl around and

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.820
