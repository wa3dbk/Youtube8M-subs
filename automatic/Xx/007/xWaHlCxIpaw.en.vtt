the root directory of your nuke I'm
gonna<00:02:21.350> put<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:22.220> link<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.540> firmware<00:02:23.810> here

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
gonna put the link to the firmware here

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.130 
gonna put the link to the firmware here

to on a laptop mac.com

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:53.259 
to on a laptop mac.com
Ephraim<00:02:48.480> did<00:02:49.469> this<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.069> there's<00:02:50.609> also<00:02:50.909> link

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
Ephraim did this and there's also link

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.530 
Ephraim did this and there's also link
to<00:02:54.269> download<00:02:55.909> this<00:02:56.909> very<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.629> here<00:02:58.049> we<00:02:58.140> go

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
to download this very so here we go

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.190 
to download this very so here we go
that's<00:03:00.540> it

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
that's it

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:20.160 
that's it
and<00:03:01.530> now<00:03:03.200> let's<00:03:04.200> disconnect<00:03:04.889> the<00:03:05.310> milk

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.180 

and<00:03:20.319> then<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.340> just<00:03:21.700> have<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.860> wait<00:03:23.860> for<00:03:23.890> a

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
and then you just have to wait for a

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.400 
and then you just have to wait for a
couple<00:03:24.550> of<00:03:24.670> minutes<00:03:25.030> until<00:03:25.270> it<00:03:25.840> falls<00:03:26.170> asleep

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
couple of minutes until it falls asleep

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.150 
couple of minutes until it falls asleep
and<00:03:27.310> it's<00:03:27.790> going<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.090> restart<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.160> install

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
and it's going to restart and install

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.020 
and it's going to restart and install
the<00:03:30.910> new<00:03:31.740> automatically<00:03:32.740> installing<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:34.000> new

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
the new automatically installing the new

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.750 
the new automatically installing the new
firmware<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:35.350> I<00:03:35.740> guess<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.220> don't<00:03:36.400> want<00:03:36.550> to

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
firmware so I guess you don't want to

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.130 
firmware so I guess you don't want to
wait<00:03:36.880> that<00:03:36.910> long<00:03:37.300> and<00:03:37.570> so<00:03:37.630> I'm<00:03:37.690> gonna<00:03:37.870> pause

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
wait that long and so I'm gonna pause

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.370 
wait that long and so I'm gonna pause
here<00:03:39.780> okay<00:03:40.780> here<00:03:41.050> we<00:03:41.170> go

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
here okay here we go

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.860 
here okay here we go
it<00:03:41.740> took<00:03:42.010> me<00:03:42.220> almost<00:03:42.400> like<00:03:42.850> I<00:03:43.300> would<00:03:43.510> guess

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
it took me almost like I would guess

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.729 
it took me almost like I would guess
five<00:03:44.440> minutes<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:46.000> get<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.930> point<00:03:47.230> where

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
five minutes to get to the point where

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.920 
five minutes to get to the point where
it<00:03:48.010> completely<00:03:49.800> installed<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.980> new<00:03:51.100> firmware

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
it completely installed the new firmware

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.740 
it completely installed the new firmware
hopefully<00:03:52.930> it's<00:03:53.890> working<00:03:54.340> now<00:03:54.489> so<00:03:54.760> my<00:03:55.390> nuke<00:03:55.570> is

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
hopefully it's working now so my nuke is

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.570 
hopefully it's working now so my nuke is
starting<00:03:56.140> up<00:03:56.790> fingers<00:03:57.790> crossed<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:59.580> we

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
starting up fingers crossed and we

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.290 
starting up fingers crossed and we
should<00:04:00.820> definitely<00:04:01.540> see<00:04:01.930> an<00:04:02.290> improvement<00:04:03.300> on

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
should definitely see an improvement on

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.300 
should definitely see an improvement on
the<00:04:04.660> page<00:04:05.050> turning<00:04:05.380> animation<00:04:05.890> that<00:04:06.040> would<00:04:06.160> be

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
the page turning animation that would be

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.370 
the page turning animation that would be
should<00:04:06.640> be<00:04:06.700> way<00:04:07.030> quicker<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.660> refresh<00:04:08.080> rate

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
should be way quicker the refresh rate

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.650 
should be way quicker the refresh rate
of<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.650> screen<00:04:08.860> and<00:04:11.700> black<00:04:12.700> should<00:04:13.450> be

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
of the screen and black should be

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.220 
of the screen and black should be
definitely<00:04:14.170> a<00:04:14.560> little<00:04:14.980> bit<00:04:15.130> more<00:04:15.430> black<00:04:15.730> and

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
definitely a little bit more black and

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.610 
definitely a little bit more black and
we<00:04:17.230> might<00:04:17.440> even<00:04:17.709> see<00:04:18.220> a<00:04:18.250> better<00:04:18.579> quality<00:04:18.880> of

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
we might even see a better quality of

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.620 
we might even see a better quality of
our<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:21.489> characters<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.240> how<00:04:22.390> they<00:04:22.540> are

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
our the characters and how they are

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:31.140 
our the characters and how they are
rendered<00:04:26.280> okay<00:04:27.280> almost<00:04:28.060> there

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.850 

can<00:04:31.660> I<00:04:31.720> already<00:04:31.960> see<00:04:32.169> a<00:04:32.199> difference<00:04:32.260> I<00:04:32.800> don't

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
can I already see a difference I don't

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.790 
can I already see a difference I don't
know<00:04:34.919> just<00:04:35.919> don't<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:37.440> mean<00:04:38.440> it's<00:04:38.650> been

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
know just don't I mean it's been

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:48.570 
know just don't I mean it's been
brilliant<00:04:39.070> before<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:43.710> okay

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.499 

it<00:04:49.030> seems<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:50.379> be<00:04:50.650> a<00:04:51.069> little<00:04:51.550> bit<00:04:51.849> more<00:04:52.120> clear

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
it seems to be a little bit more clear

00:04:52.509 --> 00:05:00.080 
it seems to be a little bit more clear
right<00:04:52.810> now<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:54.419> let's<00:04:55.419> give<00:04:55.629> it<00:04:55.690> a<00:04:55.780> try<00:04:55.990> oh<00:04:58.470> yeah

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
right now so let's give it a try oh yeah

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.309 
right now so let's give it a try oh yeah
Jesus<00:05:01.090> that's<00:05:01.750> a<00:05:02.050> huge<00:05:02.470> difference<00:05:03.039> I<00:05:04.319> would

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
Jesus that's a huge difference I would

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.550 
Jesus that's a huge difference I would
say<00:05:05.560> it's<00:05:05.710> almost<00:05:05.919> like<00:05:06.220> twice<00:05:07.060> as<00:05:07.330> fast<00:05:07.629> can

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
say it's almost like twice as fast can

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.450 
say it's almost like twice as fast can
you<00:05:08.590> see<00:05:08.860> that<00:05:09.099> they<00:05:09.819> also<00:05:10.919> they<00:05:11.919> also<00:05:12.099> ran

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
you see that they also they also ran

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.510 
you see that they also they also ran
with<00:05:12.639> the<00:05:13.530> font<00:05:14.530> a<00:05:14.620> little<00:05:14.650> bit<00:05:15.009> differently

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
with the font a little bit differently

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.580 
with the font a little bit differently
so<00:05:16.349> the<00:05:17.349> whole<00:05:17.530> layout<00:05:17.830> looks<00:05:19.590> quite

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
so the whole layout looks quite

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.939 
so the whole layout looks quite
different<00:05:21.069> to<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:23.340> 1.0<00:05:24.340> point<00:05:24.819> over<00:05:25.949> let's

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
different to the 1.0 point over let's

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.309 
different to the 1.0 point over let's
check<00:05:27.280> this<00:05:27.490> out<00:05:27.729> and<00:05:28.409> go<00:05:29.409> into<00:05:29.680> device<00:05:30.039> info
