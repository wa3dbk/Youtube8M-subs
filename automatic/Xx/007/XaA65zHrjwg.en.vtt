00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.900 
improvement of the University and one of
the<00:04:52.660> top<00:04:52.870> demands<00:04:53.350> was<00:04:53.650> more<00:04:54.310> access<00:04:54.670> to<00:04:54.790> the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
the top demands was more access to the

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.690 
the top demands was more access to the
Internet<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.570> so<00:04:56.470> once<00:04:56.740> they<00:04:56.980> have<00:04:57.160> access<00:04:57.580> to
