00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.169
 we have it with its captain 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:19.810
 we'll go 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.509
 coming 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.339
 stop interns 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.519
 together they are accessories 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.159
 headphones 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.789
 cables with say everything 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.169
 switches for 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.080
 the plugs of the united states 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.790
 the Europeans 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.010
 happens with its application the user manual the parana wipe 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.200
 clean the screen 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.180
 and that little thing 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.650
 we take it 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.100
 and the first thing that catches our attention 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.100
 3 its screen that is quite large 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.530
 we open it 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.780
 and we can see 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.090
 this fourth keyboard 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.350
 that characterizes so much when talking about ruiz 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.970
 can be in particular that your screen these types to that not only from 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.450
 I only use the blackberry in fact the first device that does not 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.010
 who copied the stop 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 Floor manufacturers estimate 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.930
 i 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.930
 good but the screen is very sensitive 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.460
 télam 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.450
 the menus 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.290
 and simply with 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.910
 I did not talk about that 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.760
 we are moving from one side to the other 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.960
 besides apart also as it is usually normal do not prosper 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.660
 has tel proton with which we can move 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.710
 everywhere 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.710
 the fairy that the adage very easy and intuitive 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.790
 even though that him 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.910
 at this time you should call the phone you will find German 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.210
 good will come 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.870
 we understand with him 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.020
 but also what is already usual in this type of phone 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.300
 What are the 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.890
 different motion sensors 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.890
 what do they do not 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.240
 that the screen adapts when brown the horizontal phone 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.470
 to see how 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.600
 apart from the physical keyboard that we have seen how is also the mobile CD 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.499
 corporate and virtual keyboard 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:17.369
 I think we could say 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:20.369
 in fact before the screen touching in a way 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:25.329
 It was pretty good here in this case, the search engine does not take away 4 letters and 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:26.269
 They do not know 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.269
 the colors of their neighbors 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.319
 after cd 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.559
 for a little democratic 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:38.619
 we are going we are going to look for 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:41.219
 All applications 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.219
 here and we're going to get the galleries fall 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.560
 here and then in the case of music we would have 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.359
 in this case the partner we have nothing inside 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.380
 but another day 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.830
 in a way also very easy and intuitive percent could return everything 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.830
 to what situation by artists by title 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.919
 going back 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.040
 we also have 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.249
 we could to pequivén the videos 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:08.999
 was named one of them that show 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.589
 crime demonstrates 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.599
 irala which is not surprising because the fall of orders 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.869
 which is pretty good 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:18.869
 in this case 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.869
 I 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.429
 yes 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:36.949
 Coming back 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.429
 Knowing how to give 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:41.429
 video gallery we get into the gallery of images 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.599
 pole of power some of the images that we have project 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:46.700
 which also 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.570
 It surprises us because it is the quality of 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.099
 e this device that frankly 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.649
 has a green screen 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:56.149
 of very very high resolution 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:58.100
 How do we see the war 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.219
 in any case of the empty screen of spare parts 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.079
 very, very good 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.679
 plus 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:08.249
 3 pretty curious how can we 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:11.769
 do are different parties and in November issue 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.939
 and more 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.340
 After Chernobyl include varied applications also typical 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.759
 from within to float as an example by the messenger 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.819
 already known with which we can not exchange messages with another as everything 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:29.930
 user of the green wave 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.539
 i money a very interesting thing is that of the farc and that is called social cis 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.919
 which has varied incorporated 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:42.999
 in this case in a moment is attacked 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.050
 from here we see how all notifications are incorporated 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.220
 referring to the different social networks we have so many little master credit 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.020
 district of trenton báez messenger 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.719
 and other imposing synchronize and have everything in one place 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.889
 will provide 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.030
 then for a hundred the Internet browsing is presented frankly 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.839
 putin 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:09.639
 why is it here we have 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.159
 in some web page 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.779
 perazzo website by the way 15th 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:18.719
 i can is very curious how it was invented by double clicking we can 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:19.919
 come closer 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.620
 adocco to the different segments of the san plant just this we are 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.569
 doing 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.499
 but good as moving 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:30.559
 from one side afp also pinching we can undo the matter 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:32.589
 just like we can not 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.589
 expand and unemployment 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.589
 i also that allows us to navigate in different screen 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:43.589
 we would expel in here that little corner 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.400
 here we could there was another new tab 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.370
 with their different search positions 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.660
 and at the same time they know each other very well very comfortable and easy to be a 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.610
 mobile we are always accustomed to Pablo Alboran's pass 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.919
 from internal computers 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.750
 and then finally finally highlight that 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.680
 Edgar the camera 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.460
 that was 5 megapixels 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.330
 in ability to 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.809
 d coach efe 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:13.460
 the high resolution video 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.690
 also has in this case incorporates a flash read 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.059
 which we can see 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:21.389
 that allows to do lived feder 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.639
 the at night and as well as 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.650
 get a better quality of the photo we can have 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.139
 and well those are more or less at first impression that will do on the 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.599
 blackberry torch 909 thousand 800 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:38.230
 which of course comes ready to revolutionize the market of 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.089
 of asthmatics 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:41.780
 and yes, of course 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.370
 3 percent 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.189
 a pretty new salary and that 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:49.129
 for sure it's going to stop what to talk about 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:52.129
 during the passage and cooperation between different markets 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:55.639
 for the moment everything is fine, it was accepted 

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:59.129
 your visit the team well punctual 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:01.270
