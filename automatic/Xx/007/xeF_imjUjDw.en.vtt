right now I'm gonna cook up a really

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.470 
right now I'm gonna cook up a really
quick<00:00:06.299> meal<00:00:06.560> very<00:00:07.560> nutritious<00:00:08.220> easy<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.210> fix

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
quick meal very nutritious easy to fix

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.930 
quick meal very nutritious easy to fix
only<00:00:09.719> takes<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.139> couple<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.440> minutes<00:00:10.590> it's<00:00:11.490> way

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
only takes a couple of minutes it's way

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.509 
only takes a couple of minutes it's way
better<00:00:12.300> than<00:00:12.509> stopping<00:00:13.080> at<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.769> fast-food

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
better than stopping at the fast-food

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.790 
better than stopping at the fast-food
restaurant<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:15.809> all<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.020> need<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
restaurant so all we need for this is a

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.310 
restaurant so all we need for this is a
stainless<00:00:17.369> steel<00:00:17.520> pen<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.390> use<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.720> pan<00:00:19.020> and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
stainless steel pen we use this pan and

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.920 
stainless steel pen we use this pan and
it<00:00:20.279> doesn't<00:00:20.640> release<00:00:20.910> toxins<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.660> Teflon

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
it doesn't release toxins like Teflon

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.660 
it doesn't release toxins like Teflon
can<00:00:22.699> next<00:00:23.699> thing<00:00:23.850> we<00:00:24.000> want<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.390> corn<00:00:24.769> now<00:00:25.769> corn

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
can next thing we want is corn now corn

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.320 
can next thing we want is corn now corn
as<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.750> may<00:00:28.019> or<00:00:28.199> may<00:00:28.230> not<00:00:28.529> know<00:00:28.740> sweet<00:00:29.730> corn

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
as you may or may not know sweet corn

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.520 
as you may or may not know sweet corn
I<00:00:31.130> can<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.279> genetically<00:00:32.790> modified<00:00:33.380> ok<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
I can be genetically modified ok the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.160 
I can be genetically modified ok the
problem<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.360> there's<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.480> Bt<00:00:37.140> toxin

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
problem with that there's a Bt toxin

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.490 
problem with that there's a Bt toxin
that<00:00:37.829> they<00:00:38.480> genetically<00:00:39.480> graft<00:00:39.930> into<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that they genetically graft into the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.190 
that they genetically graft into the
cell<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> corn<00:00:41.309> plant<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.660> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
cell of the corn plant that that is a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.950 
cell of the corn plant that that is a
toxin<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.860> kills<00:00:44.160> insects<00:00:44.670> well<00:00:45.450> there<00:00:45.660> may

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
toxin that kills insects well there may

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.590 
toxin that kills insects well there may
be<00:00:45.989> some<00:00:46.620> health<00:00:47.039> consequences<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.059> consuming

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
be some health consequences to consuming

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.189 
be some health consequences to consuming
that<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> think<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.469> want<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.829> avoid<00:00:50.340> all<00:00:51.199> Bt

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
that so I think we want to avoid all Bt

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.209 
that so I think we want to avoid all Bt
toxin<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.949> our<00:00:53.070> food<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:54.329> want<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.690> get

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
toxin in our food so we want to get

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.189 
toxin in our food so we want to get
natural<00:00:56.219> corn<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:57.239> other<00:00:57.360> words<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:58.050> don't

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
natural corn in other words we don't

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.319 
natural corn in other words we don't
want<00:00:58.530> genetically<00:00:59.250> modified<00:00:59.760> sweet<00:01:00.059> corn

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
want genetically modified sweet corn

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.510 
want genetically modified sweet corn
there's<00:01:00.649> two<00:01:01.649> companies<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.129> make<00:01:02.399> this

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
there's two companies that make this

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.520 
there's two companies that make this
they're<00:01:02.760> another<00:01:03.270> gene<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.629> they<00:01:03.899> splice

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
they're another gene that they splice

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.450 
they're another gene that they splice
into<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> corn<00:01:05.220> plant<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.869> a<00:01:07.220> gene<00:01:08.220> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
into the corn plant is a gene that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.539 
into the corn plant is a gene that
allows<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.119> resist<00:01:10.130> glyphosate<00:01:11.130> which<00:01:11.369> is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
allows it to resist glyphosate which is

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.330 
allows it to resist glyphosate which is
the<00:01:12.590> herbicide<00:01:14.030> roundup<00:01:15.030> now<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:16.229> has<00:01:17.100> been

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the herbicide roundup now this has been

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.330 
the herbicide roundup now this has been
shown<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.350> several<00:01:19.350> studies<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> be

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
shown in several studies now to be

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.120 
shown in several studies now to be
building<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.360> soils<00:01:22.350> building<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:22.950> in

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
building up in the soils building up in

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.999 
building up in the soils building up in
the<00:01:23.250> water<00:01:23.490> supply<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.630> highly<00:01:24.960> toxic

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
the water supply and it's highly toxic

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.569 
the water supply and it's highly toxic
so<00:01:26.009> what<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:27.290> try<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.680> corn<00:01:29.009> from

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
so what we do is we try to get corn from

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.480 
so what we do is we try to get corn from
a<00:01:29.700> local<00:01:30.090> grower<00:01:30.780> hopefully<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.860> uses<00:01:32.250> some

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
a local grower hopefully that uses some

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.770 
a local grower hopefully that uses some
traditional<00:01:33.270> seeds<00:01:33.540> now<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.490> even<00:01:35.780> try

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
traditional seeds now you can even try

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.550 
traditional seeds now you can even try
to<00:01:36.840> get<00:01:37.079> ancient<00:01:38.040> corn<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.700> older<00:01:39.299> porn<00:01:39.630> like

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
to get ancient corn or older porn like

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.280 
to get ancient corn or older porn like
the<00:01:40.740> blue<00:01:40.979> corn<00:01:41.340> or<00:01:41.780> varieties<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.960> haven't

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
the blue corn or varieties that haven't

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.469 
the blue corn or varieties that haven't
been<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.770> hybridized<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:45.000> sure<00:01:45.240> you're

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
been so hybridized to be sure you're

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.660 
been so hybridized to be sure you're
getting<00:01:45.600> something<00:01:46.020> that's<00:01:46.350> unnatural

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
getting something that's unnatural

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.170 
getting something that's unnatural
now<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.149> corn<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.170> little<00:01:49.560> bit<00:01:49.710> old

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
now this corn is a little bit old

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.130 
now this corn is a little bit old
because<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.299> forgot<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.780> was<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
because I forgot it was in the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.999 
because I forgot it was in the
refrigerator<00:01:53.990> but<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.110> will<00:01:55.229> probably<00:01:55.470> still

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
refrigerator but it will probably still

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.050 
refrigerator but it will probably still
taste<00:01:56.250> good<00:01:56.460> now<00:01:56.640> corn<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:59.189> grain<00:01:59.369> that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
taste good now corn is a grain that

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.899 
taste good now corn is a grain that
contains<00:02:00.509> anti<00:02:01.290> nutrients<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.579> we<00:02:02.700> don't

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
contains anti nutrients and so we don't

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.810 
contains anti nutrients and so we don't
want<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.240> rely<00:02:03.540> solely<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:05.130> food<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.579> this

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
want to rely solely on a food like this

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.609 
want to rely solely on a food like this
we<00:02:06.000> don't<00:02:06.149> want<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> eat<00:02:06.509> corn<00:02:06.840> every<00:02:07.170> day<00:02:07.320> or

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
we don't want to eat corn every day or

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.420 
we don't want to eat corn every day or
be<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> totally<00:02:09.060> corn<00:02:09.509> diet<00:02:09.890> but<00:02:10.890> corn<00:02:11.190> can

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
be on a totally corn diet but corn can

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.870 
be on a totally corn diet but corn can
be<00:02:11.550> healthy

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
be healthy

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.680 
be healthy
in<00:02:12.970> moderation<00:02:14.550> now<00:02:15.550> we<00:02:15.610> want<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.030> cook<00:02:16.270> corn

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
in moderation now we want to cook corn

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.380 
in moderation now we want to cook corn
and<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.470> helps<00:02:18.400> break<00:02:18.670> down<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.910> anti

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
and that helps break down the anti

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.980 
and that helps break down the anti
nutrients<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:20.200> makes<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.590> more<00:02:20.800> digestible

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
nutrients it makes it more digestible

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.490 
nutrients it makes it more digestible
now<00:02:22.990> corn<00:02:23.790> actually<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:24.940> what<00:02:25.240> allowed<00:02:25.780> the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
now corn actually is what allowed the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.980 
now corn actually is what allowed the
North<00:02:26.740> American<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.730> Central<00:02:28.300> American

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
North American and Central American

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.070 
North American and Central American
native<00:02:29.890> populations<00:02:30.670> thrive<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:31.420> without

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
native populations thrive so without

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.460 
native populations thrive so without
corn<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:33.580> wouldn't<00:02:33.940> have<00:02:34.030> been<00:02:34.470> these

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
corn that wouldn't have been these

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.950 
corn that wouldn't have been these
highly<00:02:36.280> developed<00:02:36.510> populations<00:02:37.510> here<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:37.840> the

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
highly developed populations here in the

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.600 
highly developed populations here in the
Americas<00:02:40.200> now<00:02:41.200> we<00:02:41.260> want<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.770> save<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.160> husk<00:02:42.370> of

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
Americas now we want to save the husk of

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.900 
Americas now we want to save the husk of
course<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.600> put<00:02:43.930> into<00:02:44.290> our<00:02:44.320> compost<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.700> be

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
course to put into our compost to be

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.650 
course to put into our compost to be
green<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:47.080> we<00:02:47.110> take<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.620> corn<00:02:47.950> ears<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.390> we

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
green so we take the corn ears and we

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.020 
green so we take the corn ears and we
just<00:02:49.900> place<00:02:50.110> them<00:02:50.320> in<00:02:50.500> boiling<00:02:50.680> water<00:02:51.030> which

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
just place them in boiling water which

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.140 
just place them in boiling water which
I'm<00:02:52.180> going<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.510> do<00:02:52.660> here<00:02:52.960> and<00:02:53.910> hopefully<00:02:54.910> I

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
I'm going to do here and hopefully I

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.700 
I'm going to do here and hopefully I
won't<00:02:55.390> burn<00:02:55.690> myself<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.780> we<00:02:58.960> just<00:02:59.200> boil<00:02:59.590> them

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
won't burn myself and we just boil them

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.070 
won't burn myself and we just boil them
for<00:03:00.010> about<00:03:00.130> 20<00:03:00.640> minutes<00:03:00.820> very<00:03:01.120> simple<00:03:01.570> now<00:03:02.020> the

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
for about 20 minutes very simple now the

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.370 
for about 20 minutes very simple now the
next<00:03:02.530> part<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.800> our<00:03:02.950> meal<00:03:03.160> is<00:03:04.680> grass-fed<00:03:06.180> beef

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
next part of our meal is grass-fed beef

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.760 
next part of our meal is grass-fed beef
burgers<00:03:09.000> now<00:03:10.000> we<00:03:10.060> know<00:03:10.300> grass-fed<00:03:10.840> beef<00:03:11.140> is<00:03:11.500> a

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
burgers now we know grass-fed beef is a

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.640 
burgers now we know grass-fed beef is a
great<00:03:12.280> way<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:12.580> get<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.090> energy<00:03:13.630> from<00:03:14.350> grass

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
great way to get the energy from grass

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.740 
great way to get the energy from grass
that's<00:03:15.040> so<00:03:15.220> abundant<00:03:15.790> on<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.060> planet<00:03:16.570> and

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
that's so abundant on the planet and

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.040 
that's so abundant on the planet and
make<00:03:17.350> it<00:03:17.530> something<00:03:17.710> that<00:03:17.950> humans<00:03:18.850> can<00:03:19.750> digest

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
make it something that humans can digest

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.400 
make it something that humans can digest
so<00:03:20.710> here<00:03:20.950> we<00:03:21.070> have<00:03:21.390> grass-fed<00:03:22.390> beef<00:03:22.690> from

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
so here we have grass-fed beef from

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.220 
so here we have grass-fed beef from
local<00:03:24.220> cows<00:03:24.430> they're<00:03:25.180> wandering<00:03:25.810> out<00:03:25.990> in<00:03:26.200> the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
local cows they're wandering out in the

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.400 
local cows they're wandering out in the
desert<00:03:26.500> eating<00:03:27.070> little<00:03:27.600> blades<00:03:28.600> of<00:03:28.840> grass<00:03:28.990> I

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
desert eating little blades of grass I

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.220 
desert eating little blades of grass I
don't<00:03:29.590> know<00:03:29.680> where<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.400> water<00:03:30.610> comes<00:03:30.910> from<00:03:31.300> to

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
don't know where the water comes from to

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.980 
don't know where the water comes from to
support<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.770> grass<00:03:32.980> but<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:34.360> cows<00:03:34.600> are<00:03:34.870> out

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
support the grass but the cows are out

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.800 
support the grass but the cows are out
there<00:03:35.290> eating<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.100> grass<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:37.420> we<00:03:37.540> want<00:03:37.720> to

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
there eating the grass so we want to

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.510 
there eating the grass so we want to
make<00:03:37.960> some<00:03:38.140> burgers<00:03:38.580> now<00:03:39.580> I<00:03:40.620> usually<00:03:41.620> get<00:03:42.130> a

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
make some burgers now I usually get a

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.330 
make some burgers now I usually get a
higher<00:03:42.910> fat<00:03:43.240> content<00:03:43.480> in<00:03:44.020> my<00:03:44.170> burgers<00:03:44.620> than

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
higher fat content in my burgers than

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.370 
higher fat content in my burgers than
what<00:03:45.910> people<00:03:46.060> usually<00:03:46.630> want<00:03:46.870> we've<00:03:47.230> been

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
what people usually want we've been

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.040 
what people usually want we've been
brainwashed<00:03:47.650> into<00:03:48.220> believing<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:49.030> low<00:03:49.720> fat

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
brainwashed into believing that low fat

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.610 
brainwashed into believing that low fat
is<00:03:50.260> good<00:03:51.840> but<00:03:52.840> in<00:03:52.959> my<00:03:52.990> opinion<00:03:53.820> beef<00:03:54.820> fat

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
is good but in my opinion beef fat

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.760 
is good but in my opinion beef fat
tallow<00:03:56.620> is<00:03:57.070> one<00:03:58.000> of<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.209> safest<00:03:59.200> fats<00:03:59.470> and

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
tallow is one of the safest fats and

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.949 
tallow is one of the safest fats and
healthiest<00:04:00.190> fats<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.580> we<00:04:00.640> can<00:04:01.030> take<00:04:01.540> in<00:04:01.750> so

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
healthiest fats that we can take in so

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.750 
healthiest fats that we can take in so
we<00:04:02.170> want<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.680> take<00:04:02.860> advantage<00:04:03.340> of<00:04:03.490> that<00:04:03.580> when

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
we want to take advantage of that when

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.490 
we want to take advantage of that when
we<00:04:03.880> have<00:04:04.090> organic<00:04:04.930> cows<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:06.840> get<00:04:07.840> their<00:04:08.170> fat

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
we have organic cows and get their fat

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.030 
we have organic cows and get their fat
so<00:04:08.980> we<00:04:09.190> ask<00:04:09.520> the<00:04:09.790> rancher<00:04:10.330> to<00:04:11.140> make<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.740> higher

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
so we ask the rancher to make a higher

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.370 
so we ask the rancher to make a higher
fat<00:04:12.370> content<00:04:12.640> if<00:04:13.270> possible<00:04:13.690> and<00:04:13.780> these<00:04:14.050> are

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
fat content if possible and these are

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.670 
fat content if possible and these are

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
people want the low fat burgers but when

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.820 
people want the low fat burgers but when
I<00:04:20.170> have<00:04:20.919> a<00:04:20.950> chance<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.640> order<00:04:21.820> them<00:04:22.830> customized

I have a chance to order them customized
I<00:04:24.130> try<00:04:24.490> to<00:04:24.550> get<00:04:24.790> 20%<00:04:25.150> fat

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
typical mixture for restaurant burgers

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.060 
typical mixture for restaurant burgers
is<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.700> 24<00:04:31.180> 20<00:04:31.810> percent<00:04:32.200> fat<00:04:32.410> which<00:04:32.680> is<00:04:32.860> better

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
is the 24 20 percent fat which is better

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.120 
is the 24 20 percent fat which is better

if it's healthy fat if you're getting

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
probably has toxins in it so we wouldn't

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.680 
probably has toxins in it so we wouldn't
wouldn't<00:04:47.560> want<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.370> fat<00:04:48.610> having<00:04:49.090> a<00:04:49.180> low<00:04:49.360> fat

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
wouldn't want the fat having a low fat

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.720 
wouldn't want the fat having a low fat
burger<00:04:50.170> in<00:04:50.320> that<00:04:50.950> case<00:04:51.220> is<00:04:51.460> probably

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
burger in that case is probably

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.910 
burger in that case is probably
healthier<00:04:52.510> but<00:04:53.230> when<00:04:53.410> we<00:04:53.530> know<00:04:53.680> it's<00:04:53.830> a

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
healthier but when we know it's a

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.460 
healthier but when we know it's a
healthy<00:04:54.190> animal<00:04:54.720> raised<00:04:55.720> in<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:56.020> pristine

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
healthy animal raised in a pristine

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.680 
healthy animal raised in a pristine
environment<00:04:56.500> we<00:04:57.310> want<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.730> fat<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.210> fat<00:04:58.240> is

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
environment we want the fat the fat is

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.770 
environment we want the fat the fat is
healthy<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:59.620> fact<00:05:00.030> actually<00:05:01.030> makes<00:05:01.390> the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
healthy the fact actually makes the

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.230 
healthy the fact actually makes the
burger<00:05:02.140> cook<00:05:02.590> better<00:05:02.860> it<00:05:03.220> cooks<00:05:03.700> in<00:05:03.910> its<00:05:04.060> own

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
burger cook better it cooks in its own

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.810 
burger cook better it cooks in its own
oils<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:04.870> we<00:05:05.080> place<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:06.130> burgers<00:05:06.520> on<00:05:06.670> there

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
oils and we place the burgers on there

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.080 
oils and we place the burgers on there
actually<00:05:07.150> I'm<00:05:07.210> gonna<00:05:07.420> use<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:08.370> spatula<00:05:09.370> so<00:05:09.970> we

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
actually I'm gonna use the spatula so we

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.350 
actually I'm gonna use the spatula so we
place<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:10.960> burgers<00:05:11.320> on<00:05:11.500> here<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:15.210> there<00:05:16.210> will

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
place the burgers on here and there will

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.340 
place the burgers on here and there will
be<00:05:16.390> enough<00:05:17.790> fat<00:05:18.790> content<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:19.420> didn't<00:05:19.690> put<00:05:20.200> any

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
be enough fat content I didn't put any

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.840 
be enough fat content I didn't put any
oil<00:05:20.470> on<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.010> bottom<00:05:21.130> of<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.370> pan<00:05:21.580> there'll<00:05:21.820> be

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
oil on the bottom of the pan there'll be

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.200 
oil on the bottom of the pan there'll be
a<00:05:21.970> enough<00:05:22.660> fat<00:05:22.930> content<00:05:23.700> now<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.760> way<00:05:24.910> I<00:05:24.940> like

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
a enough fat content now the way I like

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.650 
a enough fat content now the way I like
to<00:05:25.360> cook<00:05:25.390> the<00:05:25.720> burgers<00:05:25.930> is<00:05:26.970> cook<00:05:27.970> them<00:05:28.180> down<00:05:28.450> on

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
to cook the burgers is cook them down on

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.460 
to cook the burgers is cook them down on
the<00:05:28.780> outside<00:05:28.930> and<00:05:29.590> leave<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.580> center<00:05:31.470> red

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
the outside and leave the center red

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.640 
the outside and leave the center red
almost<00:05:32.770> raw<00:05:33.340> and<00:05:33.790> the<00:05:34.480> reason<00:05:34.780> for<00:05:34.810> that<00:05:35.110> is<00:05:35.350> is

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
almost raw and the reason for that is is

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.030 
almost raw and the reason for that is is
we<00:05:35.920> can<00:05:36.190> leave<00:05:37.180> some<00:05:37.630> of<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.990> enzymes<00:05:38.560> that

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
we can leave some of the enzymes that

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.570 
we can leave some of the enzymes that
are<00:05:39.580> contained<00:05:40.060> in<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.270> meat<00:05:41.010> intact<00:05:42.010> and<00:05:42.430> not

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
are contained in the meat intact and not

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.090 
are contained in the meat intact and not
denature<00:05:43.270> them<00:05:43.480> with<00:05:43.660> heat<00:05:43.930> this<00:05:44.620> just<00:05:44.890> aids

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
denature them with heat this just aids

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.120 
denature them with heat this just aids
in<00:05:45.370> digestion<00:05:46.240> to<00:05:47.080> some<00:05:47.290> extent<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:47.860> so

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
in digestion to some extent and so

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.100 
in digestion to some extent and so
eating<00:05:48.400> a<00:05:48.610> small<00:05:48.850> amount<00:05:49.210> of<00:05:49.300> raw<00:05:49.540> meat<00:05:49.780> is

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
eating a small amount of raw meat is

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.800 
eating a small amount of raw meat is
good<00:05:51.070> and<00:05:51.310> that<00:05:51.400> it<00:05:51.520> gives<00:05:51.730> us<00:05:51.880> a<00:05:52.150> little<00:05:52.660> bit

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
good and that it gives us a little bit

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.650 
good and that it gives us a little bit
of<00:05:53.260> a<00:05:55.680> nightís<00:05:56.680> of<00:05:56.980> living<00:05:57.910> enzymes<00:05:58.120> to<00:05:58.630> help

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
of a nightís of living enzymes to help

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.500 
of a nightís of living enzymes to help
us<00:05:59.050> begin<00:05:59.350> the<00:05:59.470> digestion<00:05:59.920> process<00:06:00.760> and<00:06:01.300> then

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
us begin the digestion process and then

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.900 
us begin the digestion process and then
our<00:06:01.660> own<00:06:01.810> digestive<00:06:02.080> enzymes<00:06:02.800> can<00:06:03.490> come<00:06:03.730> in

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
our own digestive enzymes can come in

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.480 
our own digestive enzymes can come in
and<00:06:04.150> take<00:06:04.570> over<00:06:04.750> so<00:06:05.710> we<00:06:05.860> leave<00:06:06.010> the<00:06:06.070> corn

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
and take over so we leave the corn

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.020 
and take over so we leave the corn
cooking<00:06:06.940> for<00:06:07.240> 20<00:06:07.570> minutes<00:06:07.900> we<00:06:08.820> cook<00:06:09.820> the

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
cooking for 20 minutes we cook the

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.410 
cooking for 20 minutes we cook the
burgers<00:06:10.480> on<00:06:11.260> the<00:06:11.400> outside<00:06:12.400> char<00:06:12.850> though<00:06:13.030> to

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:13.420 
burgers on the outside char though to

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.140 
burgers on the outside char though to
leave<00:06:13.630> the<00:06:13.870> center<00:06:14.380> bread<00:06:15.250> with<00:06:15.730> some<00:06:15.970> of<00:06:16.060> the

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
leave the center bread with some of the

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.110 
leave the center bread with some of the
enzyme<00:06:16.480> still<00:06:16.750> alive<00:06:17.110> and<00:06:17.710> we<00:06:17.890> have<00:06:18.040> a

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
enzyme still alive and we have a

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.940 
enzyme still alive and we have a
wonderful<00:06:19.120> meal<00:06:19.330> we<00:06:19.990> have<00:06:20.110> the<00:06:20.200> carbohydrates

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
wonderful meal we have the carbohydrates

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.500 
wonderful meal we have the carbohydrates
we<00:06:21.790> have<00:06:22.150> the<00:06:22.870> fiber<00:06:23.200> from<00:06:23.770> the<00:06:23.860> corn<00:06:24.280> and<00:06:24.760> we

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
we have the fiber from the corn and we

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.660 
we have the fiber from the corn and we
have<00:06:25.750> the<00:06:25.960> vitamins<00:06:26.410> and<00:06:26.530> minerals<00:06:26.740> from<00:06:27.520> the

have the vitamins and minerals from the

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.940 
have the vitamins and minerals from the
meat<00:06:27.850> and<00:06:28.090> then<00:06:28.540> we<00:06:28.690> have<00:06:28.900> the<00:06:29.170> healthy

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
meat and then we have the healthy

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.510 
meat and then we have the healthy
saturated<00:06:30.310> fats<00:06:30.910> and<00:06:31.120> omega-3<00:06:31.840> fats<00:06:32.110> from<00:06:32.380> the

grass-fed cow so simple meal it's way
better<00:06:37.180> than<00:06:37.360> getting<00:06:37.840> the<00:06:37.960> genetically

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
better than getting the genetically

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.190 
better than getting the genetically
modified<00:06:39.040> crap

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
modified crap

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.460
