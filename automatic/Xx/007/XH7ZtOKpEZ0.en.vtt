00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.970
 Welcome like raids in the online shop of 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.529
 lÃ¼demann and zankl give what I have 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.559
 today for you today I still have 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.540
 once the front headlights with 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.170
 integrated daytime running light that 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.490
 daytime running light is also standlight so 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.240
 if you complete this afterwards 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.480
 has built there for a 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.369
 procedures around the ECUs because there 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.349
 are ECUs with recognize the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.620
 whether the vehicle has load or not 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.370
 and accordingly, that also stands 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.350
 nonsense that daytime lights so this 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.420
 einrichtungs procedure I show you 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.670
 Now we have this complete 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.539
 affiliated 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.480
 I'll take that one now 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.690
 backup from this day before not 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.300
 down and just let yourself 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.590
 be open at short notice because that must 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.660
 you make it take about 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.210
 one minute and then you go there again 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.609
 at the time of explanation these are 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.229
 by the way, this headlight 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.439
 away a heartfelt thank you 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.290
 The company covered the headlights 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.350
 after that will be exclusive 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.060
 in germany will be the first before 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.580
 pattern of bacteria, however, get 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.970
 there was a problem in the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.159
 employment of the main lights i 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.049
 Press the fuse for a moment 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.040
 back on the minute should be about 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.040
 be around now 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.359
 the same would have to flash ten times if 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:44.479
 we did everything right 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:49.439
 now we have a total again 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:53.429
 wait three minutes and then will 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.979
 Left it three times and then 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.899
 is it set up 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.200
 So these ECUs are directed 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.000
 automatically one stopped 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.259
 we had that at the first prototype 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.880
 problem that we in the 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.149
 Headlamp leveling if the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.750
 light range was set correctly 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:17.160
 now we have that three times that 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.319
 the reflector from the high beam to one 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.099
 quarter behind the headlight mask 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.890
 has entered 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.549
 Furthermore , we had a problem that 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:30.030
 very much distance between the lights 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:33.060
 and the headlight mask insisted that 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.609
 doing it with the lens still 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.450
 however, when we see here how close 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:41.400
 now practically the reflector of 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.480
 high beam is already on the mask is 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.750
 This is not great anymore 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.190
 change, however, has covered in this 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.660
 direction already reacts when you 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.579
 now here in the lamp body 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.590
 You can not see any colorful cables anymore 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.290
 or something like that 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.750
 In that sense, the specifications we are now 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.919
 have been done wonderfully 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.829
 from Dect excellent response to the 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:07.319
 problems have existed 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.870
 distance now as he is me 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.040
 absolutely tolerable 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.419
 and i will deal with bacteria 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.870
 Of course, now again in connection 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.519
 put 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.930
 and I'm curious when the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.609
 headlights then really on the market 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.019
 I'll show you now 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:26.660
 how the whole works normally 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.660
 I would have to turn on the ignition now 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:34.560
 First of all the light on that is now 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:38.099
 standlicht and if it is now the ignition 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.569
 Anmache should actually everything was 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.849
 have everything working properly 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.849
 set up the daytime running lights there 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.280
 and ghost up 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.379
 also likes 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.219
 disposals 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.620
 So everything works great 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.300
 if I switch the car dealership now 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.220
 is also indicative of our inside 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.440
 Battery is currently being the whole 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.780
 tests a bit flat that does not mean yes 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.750
 more so much tension 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.970
 it is enough to start and then 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.270
 we have if you turn off the car 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:52.500
 as it were, coming home function as well 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.820
 it always stays a little bit and 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.460
 it will take a while until it does 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.000
 I'm trying now only the time 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.560
 to press 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.330
 we are here at the dacia duster admiral 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.830
 Of course, the dinos as always 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:10.710
 Candidate Candidate this vehicle was in 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.620
 frack amusement park mammoth man now 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:18.270
 here behind the bumper a whole 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:20.160
 amount of dirt left lying is we 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.010
 of course, rinse off properly 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.180
 be so by means of a steam radiator 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:29.460
 we will not again 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:32.310
 mount the deeper the battery in 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.620
 your stream is the longer stay 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.350
 these lamps here 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.870
 so at least the description will be 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.350
 They are going to be very long now 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.420
 me but they also take as good as 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.100
 no electricity because he is just led 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:52.530
 technology or happens to me too much 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.850
 furthermore we do not need the 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.860
 camera are all the time on it 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.270
 leave as well as for example the 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:03.419
 bumpers from the rear 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.349
 we have the osram led lighting here 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.250
 ford in it 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:13.979
 we'll set the corner here tomorrow 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:16.199
 Hope you can see it there they are something 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.569
 I wanted to show you are the 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:21.569
 connections that are now here around 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:23.759
 absolutely clean the lamp is 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:27.000
 excellent the automotive connections 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.860
 are great and that's why I wanted you 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.960
 just showed it is a great 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.620
 quality product makes itself the 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.849
 hardest bets with and you can do without 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.550
 recommend problems 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:42.449
 and if it did not know this yet 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.860
 add has five years warranty as well 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:47.880
 if they are a little more expensive in the 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.289
 I am well worth buying 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.780
 I did not do anything here on the car or 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:57.860
 the same are the daytime running lights 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:07:00.960
 again the beautiful is we can with 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:03.419
 Standlicht driving and it consumes a lot 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.969
 very little current general i 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.940
 daytime running lights highly recommended 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:12.240
 high performance birn like her osram 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:15.060
 sorry braker we are now the ultimate 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.840
 in it have optimal in the headlights 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.560
 to protect 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.300
 because many ride with daytime running lights 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.000
 stinks normal dipped beam through the 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.800
 area and have high performance there 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.930
 find that in the summer in these 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.240
 Temperatures over the weekend should be there 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.550
 35 degrees will do that 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.190
 light bulbs do not last long with that 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.930
 the lifetime is extreme and from there it is 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.610
 also recommended daytime running lights 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.650
 retrofit it uses less power 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.029
 thereby less achievement on the 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.090
 less alternator 

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:46.740
 fuel consumption is not much 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:49.080
 but that pays off in the long run 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.449
 Of course I hope that as always I will 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.360
 with this video a little bit enlightening 

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:56.550
 could do and a bit 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.770
 I could give help 

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.659
 me as I said with dagsay again 

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.789
 Thanks for the support with 

00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:04.780
 this new product 

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:07.750
 put under want to look when that 

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:11.070
 Great in this sense I say how 

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.070
 always change
