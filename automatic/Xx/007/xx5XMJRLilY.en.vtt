00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.480
 month ago with crew 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.520
 we decided to start the experiment chosen 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.980
 heroine and obliged and engage each 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.600
 day that's what came out of it 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.210
 tell today to the choice of the heroine 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.410
 experiment we approached very 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.750
 Responsibly we needed a young lady with 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.640
 certain criteria first she has 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.239
 should have been not very strong 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.160
 health 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.379
 questions to herself and she is 100 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.539
 percent had to deal with each 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.160
 Day for the first time on the Rights leading 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.929
 decided to participate in the study 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.089
 practicing master Victoria Kovalev 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.339
 developed for me a complex of 7 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.010
 exercise and more than a month my morning 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.600
 begins with him at first exercises 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 it was difficult to take into account that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.929
 never before physical exertion 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.980
 I was not engaged but before the body was 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.680
 tasked 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.420
 and she began to perform her individual 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.300
 the complex is strictly defined 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.670
 protective combination for specific 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.240
 women therefore these three magic 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.979
 exercise specifically affects her 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.110
 correct aligns harmonizes 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.990
 physical health what is included 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.149
 physical health is internal 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.930
 organs of the internal organs are 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.710
 external beauty this figure is 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.600
 musculoskeletal system 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.759
 The following three exercises are responsible for 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.100
 the mental state of the woman is decided so 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.049
 called urgent relationship issues 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.060
 with opposite sex with parents with 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.430
 children and even with work colleagues 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.320
 it seems you are doing some 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.590
 exercise some figures every day 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.110
 but they really change but there is just necessary 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.060
 try it yourself when doing data 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.710
 exercise activates glands 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.280
 endocrine secretion normalizes 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.049
 female hormones 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.479

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.640
 chest and back and abdomen and female genital 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.619
 organs this gymnastics can be done 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.750
 throughout her pregnancy she 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.670
 beneficial effect on childbirth 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.860
 the hallmark of this gymnastics 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.600
 is lower back deflection which you are not 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.850
 will find in any other complexes 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.739
 exercise for female 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.540
 the body of this deflection is natural 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.250
 it is especially pronounced during 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.500
 pregnancy and another feature 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.390
 the position of the hands behind the back in the area 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.020
 adrenal glands in this way occurs 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.950
 their stimulation six months later my 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.340
 the body stopped hurting at all 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.959
 unique about flu viruses 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.830
 colds i hear now mushroom passes 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.019
 congratulating began to go on 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.840
 heels I have this here absolutely not 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.090
 causes them no inconvenience 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.860
 your back has become smoother posture better and you 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.010
 you sit down already automatically straight to you not 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.290
 I want it here so the boy you 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.840
 uncomfortable I'm a year old baby mom from not 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.010
 I have great physical exertion 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.930
 surprisingly for yourself only one thing 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.570
 exercise removes accumulated for the day 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.489
 back pain and a few more facts this 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.410
 unbelievable on what's really going on 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.420
 The topic is just that I put in front 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.150
 themselves before the start of classes were resolved 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.380
 and it happened by itself if you 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.269
 born a woman need yourself 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.549
 realize how women need to think 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.140
 as a woman and here is the first problem with 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.820
 which I actually started to fight 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.329
 because I was always thinking manly and 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.920
 very hard now I understood what was needed 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:30.010
 it is necessary to perceive situations differently 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.350
 there is a flexible brain you have to give in somewhere 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.239
 or the node where you listen to them because in 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.049
 other people can find the answer to it 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.359
 your questions 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.560
 Slavic gymnastics is exclusively 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.569
 women's practice 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.069
 very soft and very effective in 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.510
 unlike yoga, this practice is done 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.160
 in the territory of ancient Russia was 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.140
 recovered in belarus total in 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.700
 In a complex of twenty seven exercises on 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.560
 group classes are done like this 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.360
 called comply with me which 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.800
 consists of 7 exercises most 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.959
 favorable to fulfill in 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.190
 specific day of occupation complex for 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.230
 calculated by special 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.599
 Slavic calendar given the place 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.550
 time day classes also 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.920
 calculated and individual complex 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.280
 it's a solar calendar 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.260
 also I find out the lunar day specifically 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.049
 your date of birth on your 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.479
 location time zone 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.160
 when performing such exercises are not worth it 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.750
 focus only on technical 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.829
 performance must be found 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.750
 internal balance 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.970
 and everything should be done solely on 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.710
 video instructions some positions are very 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.630
 insidious and may even lead to 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.550
 on my own experience I will say 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.740
 it is advisable to check yourself before 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.330
 instructor some nuances are forgotten 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.540
 exercise acquires a completely different 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.740
 meaning is a wonderful exercise at all 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.590
 new affairs before starting a new business 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.330

 secretly to a home environment and and 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.660
 best done with a minimum of clothes 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.520

 absolutely at any age 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:10.120
 for me personally gymnastics has become one of 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.129
 ways of knowing yourself and I continue to her 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.990
