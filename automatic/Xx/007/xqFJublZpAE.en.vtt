recoil spring you can pretty much leave

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.850 
recoil spring you can pretty much leave
it<00:02:50.060> at<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.210> point<00:02:50.600> you<00:02:50.840> have<00:02:50.990> two<00:02:51.260> screws<00:02:51.620> in

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
it at that point you have two screws in

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.910 
it at that point you have two screws in
here<00:02:52.070> both<00:02:52.370> flathead<00:02:53.320> one<00:02:54.320> in<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.500> receiver

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920

end of the receiver and then one on the
rear<00:02:56.510> of<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.690> tang<00:02:56.930> here<00:02:57.230> we're<00:02:57.680> going<00:02:57.860> to

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
rear of the tang here we're going to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:13.530 
rear of the tang here we're going to
remove<00:02:58.130> both<00:02:58.400> those<00:02:58.640> screws

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.850 

there<00:03:14.540> we<00:03:14.630> go<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:14.930> then<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.230> stock<00:03:15.560> should

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
there we go and then the stock should

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.530 
there we go and then the stock should
just<00:03:16.040> slide<00:03:16.220> right<00:03:16.250> out<00:03:16.490> so<00:03:16.940> not<00:03:17.510> very

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
just slide right out so not very

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.830 
just slide right out so not very
difficult<00:03:17.960> it's<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.680> pretty<00:03:18.920> easy<00:03:19.070> to<00:03:19.250> get<00:03:19.370> off

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
difficult it's a pretty easy to get off

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.940 
difficult it's a pretty easy to get off
next<00:03:20.840> what<00:03:20.990> we'll<00:03:21.110> do<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.380> we'll<00:03:21.500> go<00:03:21.560> ahead<00:03:21.680> and

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
next what we'll do is we'll go ahead and

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.130 
next what we'll do is we'll go ahead and
look<00:03:22.790> at<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.090> hardware<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:23.540> we<00:03:23.660> received

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
look at the hardware that we received

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.140 
look at the hardware that we received
with<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.650> Bowlin<00:03:25.010> steel<00:03:25.190> arms<00:03:25.460> folding<00:03:25.880> stock

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
with the Bowlin steel arms folding stock

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.570 
with the Bowlin steel arms folding stock
and<00:03:26.450> we<00:03:26.510> have<00:03:26.690> two<00:03:27.410> screws<00:03:27.650> again<00:03:28.100> flat<00:03:28.340> head

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
and we have two screws again flat head

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.300 
and we have two screws again flat head
with<00:03:28.870> one<00:03:30.550> knot<00:03:31.550> here<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.080> one<00:03:33.080> of<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:34.070> snot

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
with one knot here and one of the snot

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.190 
with one knot here and one of the snot
here<00:03:34.520> what<00:03:34.670> does<00:03:34.760> actually<00:03:34.910> goes<00:03:35.330> is<00:03:35.660> into<00:03:36.020> the

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
here what does actually goes is into the

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.700 
here what does actually goes is into the
back<00:03:36.890> of<00:03:36.920> this<00:03:37.220> receiver<00:03:37.640> block<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:39.590> can

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
back of this receiver block and you can

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.620 
back of this receiver block and you can
see<00:03:39.920> kind<00:03:40.190> of<00:03:40.220> slides<00:03:40.640> back<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:40.940> forth<00:03:41.180> in

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
see kind of slides back and forth in

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.850 
see kind of slides back and forth in
there<00:03:41.810> we're<00:03:41.990> going<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.350> make<00:03:42.500> sure<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.710> lines

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
there we're going to make sure it lines

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.070 
there we're going to make sure it lines
up<00:03:43.130> with<00:03:43.190> this<00:03:43.490> screw<00:03:43.790> here<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:44.240> it<00:03:44.390> kind<00:03:45.020> of

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
up with this screw here so it kind of

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.470 
up with this screw here so it kind of
forms<00:03:45.470> too<00:03:45.830> you<00:03:46.100> know<00:03:46.220> if<00:03:46.340> your<00:03:46.520> tolerances<00:03:47.450> or

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
forms too you know if your tolerances or

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.810 
forms too you know if your tolerances or
specs<00:03:48.440> are<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.650> little<00:03:48.890> out<00:03:49.040> on<00:03:49.460> your

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
specs are a little out on your

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.520 
specs are a little out on your
particular<00:03:50.360> rifle<00:03:50.870> this<00:03:50.990> will<00:03:51.200> allow<00:03:51.350> you<00:03:51.500> to

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
particular rifle this will allow you to

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.530 
particular rifle this will allow you to
make<00:03:52.130> sure<00:03:52.310> it<00:03:52.430> fits<00:03:52.700> accordingly<00:03:53.180> it's<00:03:53.390> not

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
make sure it fits accordingly it's not

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.390 
make sure it fits accordingly it's not
going<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:54.260> holes<00:03:54.500> are<00:03:54.740> not<00:03:54.770> going<00:03:55.220> to

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
going to the holes are not going to

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.670 
going to the holes are not going to
screw<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.180> up<00:03:56.210> at<00:03:56.390> all<00:03:56.510> so<00:03:56.840> what<00:03:57.470> I'm<00:03:57.530> going<00:03:57.620> to

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
screw you up at all so what I'm going to

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.230 
screw you up at all so what I'm going to
do<00:03:57.800> is<00:03:57.920> just<00:03:58.040> kind<00:03:58.220> of<00:03:58.250> push<00:03:58.490> this<00:03:58.700> into<00:03:59.000> place

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
do is just kind of push this into place

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.870 
do is just kind of push this into place
here<00:03:59.570> and<00:04:01.660> try<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.720> keep<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:03.170> as<00:04:03.580> I'm<00:04:04.580> doing

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
here and try to keep that as I'm doing

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.250 
here and try to keep that as I'm doing
that<00:04:04.970> I'm<00:04:05.060> gonna<00:04:05.180> try<00:04:05.300> to<00:04:05.360> keep<00:04:05.570> that<00:04:05.750> nut<00:04:06.110> in

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
that I'm gonna try to keep that nut in

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.310 
that I'm gonna try to keep that nut in
there<00:04:06.440> from<00:04:07.130> going<00:04:07.700> too<00:04:07.880> far<00:04:08.120> forward<00:04:08.450> okay<00:04:09.260> so

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
there from going too far forward okay so

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.180 
there from going too far forward okay so
we<00:04:09.470> want<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.680> make<00:04:09.800> sure<00:04:09.890> we're<00:04:10.040> nice<00:04:10.130> and

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
we want to make sure we're nice and

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.480 
we want to make sure we're nice and
lined<00:04:10.550> up<00:04:10.760> which<00:04:10.990> think<00:04:11.990> I<00:04:12.110> got<00:04:12.290> it<00:04:12.440> there<00:04:12.710> and

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
lined up which think I got it there and

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.680 
lined up which think I got it there and
then<00:04:13.730> we'll<00:04:13.820> just<00:04:14.000> do<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.300> take<00:04:14.420> one<00:04:14.600> of

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
then we'll just do it and take one of

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.599 
then we'll just do it and take one of
these<00:04:14.780> screws<00:04:16.359> drop<00:04:17.359> it<00:04:17.510> down<00:04:17.660> in<00:04:17.870> there<00:04:18.109> and

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
these screws drop it down in there and

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.349 
these screws drop it down in there and
see<00:04:19.609> if<00:04:19.669> we<00:04:19.730> can<00:04:19.880> tighten<00:04:20.120> this<00:04:20.299> down

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
see if we can tighten this down

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.159 
see if we can tighten this down
hopefully<00:04:21.230> again<00:04:21.739> we<00:04:21.919> got<00:04:22.100> it<00:04:22.690> over<00:04:23.690> that<00:04:23.870> knot

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
hopefully again we got it over that knot

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.830 
hopefully again we got it over that knot
I<00:04:24.790> think<00:04:25.790> we<00:04:25.880> do<00:04:26.000> because<00:04:26.180> it's<00:04:26.330> tightening<00:04:26.750> it

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
I think we do because it's tightening it

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.330 
I think we do because it's tightening it
up<00:04:26.930> nice<00:04:29.260> there<00:04:30.260> we<00:04:30.320> go<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:30.740> then<00:04:31.040> we'll<00:04:31.190> take

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
up nice there we go and then we'll take

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.680 
up nice there we go and then we'll take
our<00:04:31.400> second<00:04:31.940> screw<00:04:32.290> and<00:04:34.930> replace<00:04:35.930> that<00:04:36.160> as<00:04:37.690> you

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
our second screw and replace that as you

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.050 
our second screw and replace that as you
can<00:04:38.840> see<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.740> screw<00:04:40.340> types<00:04:40.610> are<00:04:40.820> different

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
can see the screw types are different

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.030 
can see the screw types are different
the<00:04:41.510> original<00:04:42.020> ones<00:04:42.169> are<00:04:42.320> more<00:04:42.680> of<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.830> wood

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
the original ones are more of a wood

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.150 
the original ones are more of a wood
screw<00:04:43.340> this<00:04:43.520> one<00:04:43.700> is<00:04:43.790> a<00:04:43.850> machine<00:04:44.210> screw<00:04:45.160> see

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
screw this one is a machine screw see

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.710 
screw this one is a machine screw see
you<00:04:46.310> can<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:46.669> have<00:04:46.850> to<00:04:46.970> make<00:04:47.120> sure<00:04:47.240> you<00:04:47.330> have<00:04:47.540> the

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
you can I have to make sure you have the

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.450 
you can I have to make sure you have the
appropriate<00:04:47.930> hardware<00:04:48.350> that<00:04:49.010> comes<00:04:49.220> along

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
appropriate hardware that comes along

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.140 
appropriate hardware that comes along
with<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.910> stock<00:04:51.490> tighten<00:04:52.490> that<00:04:52.580> down<00:04:52.640> and

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
with the stock tighten that down and

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.480 
with the stock tighten that down and
that's<00:04:53.690> it<00:04:53.930> what<00:04:54.320> we<00:04:54.410> can<00:04:54.560> do<00:04:54.680> is<00:04:54.800> replace<00:04:55.040> our

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
that's it what we can do is replace our

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:03.310 
that's it what we can do is replace our
recoil<00:04:56.300> spring<00:04:58.870> our<00:04:59.870> dust<00:05:00.110> cover<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:02.320> we're

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
recoil spring our dust cover and we're

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.530 
recoil spring our dust cover and we're
all<00:05:03.500> better<00:05:03.770> Allah<00:05:04.310> we're<00:05:04.790> all<00:05:04.880> installed<00:05:05.300> not

along with the rest of the tactical look

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.530 
along with the rest of the tactical look
to<00:05:18.050> this<00:05:18.200> rifle<00:05:18.410> a<00:05:18.800> lot<00:05:19.790> of<00:05:19.880> traditionalists

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
to this rifle a lot of traditionalists

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.140 
to this rifle a lot of traditionalists
hate<00:05:20.660> that<00:05:21.310> but<00:05:22.310> what<00:05:22.430> can<00:05:22.550> you<00:05:22.580> do<00:05:22.729> you<00:05:23.030> know

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
hate that but what can you do you know

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.520 
hate that but what can you do you know
if<00:05:23.240> you're<00:05:23.390> making<00:05:23.479> a<00:05:23.720> rifle<00:05:24.140> that<00:05:24.169> you<00:05:24.350> want

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
if you're making a rifle that you want

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.530 
if you're making a rifle that you want
to<00:05:24.650> make<00:05:25.039> for<00:05:25.280> a<00:05:25.310> specific<00:05:25.550> purpose

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
to make for a specific purpose

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.120 
to make for a specific purpose
you<00:05:26.930> know<00:05:26.990> don't<00:05:27.170> feel<00:05:27.260> bad<00:05:27.500> about<00:05:27.530> that<00:05:27.890> stuff

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
you know don't feel bad about that stuff

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.470 
you know don't feel bad about that stuff
it's<00:05:28.310> your<00:05:28.430> rifle<00:05:28.760> you<00:05:28.850> can<00:05:29.000> do<00:05:29.090> what<00:05:29.210> you<00:05:29.330> want

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
it's your rifle you can do what you want

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.100 
it's your rifle you can do what you want
with<00:05:29.630> it<00:05:29.890> and<00:05:30.890> that's<00:05:31.010> what<00:05:31.220> I'm<00:05:31.370> doing<00:05:32.110> so

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
with it and that's what I'm doing so

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.920 
with it and that's what I'm doing so
this<00:05:33.290> is<00:05:33.470> a<00:05:33.850> like<00:05:34.850> I<00:05:34.940> said<00:05:34.970> Warsaw<00:05:35.510> length<00:05:35.780> so

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
this is a like I said Warsaw length so

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.240 
this is a like I said Warsaw length so
it's<00:05:36.050> a<00:05:36.080> little<00:05:36.290> bit<00:05:36.410> shorter<00:05:36.800> of<00:05:36.830> a<00:05:36.980> stock

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
it's a little bit shorter of a stock

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.580 
it's a little bit shorter of a stock
compared<00:05:37.760> to<00:05:37.850> a<00:05:37.880> NATO<00:05:38.120> length<00:05:38.450> but<00:05:39.290> it<00:05:39.380> still

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
compared to a NATO length but it still

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.890 
compared to a NATO length but it still
gives<00:05:39.740> you<00:05:39.920> a<00:05:39.950> nice<00:05:40.070> pull<00:05:40.460> to<00:05:40.700> it<00:05:40.850> length<00:05:41.750> of

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
gives you a nice pull to it length of

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.500 
gives you a nice pull to it length of
pull<00:05:42.080> I<00:05:42.350> can<00:05:43.070> add<00:05:43.220> a<00:05:43.250> maybe<00:05:43.820> a<00:05:43.910> rubber<00:05:44.090> bump<00:05:44.330> pad

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
pull I can add a maybe a rubber bump pad

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.850 
pull I can add a maybe a rubber bump pad
on<00:05:44.690> there<00:05:44.870> to<00:05:44.990> push<00:05:45.200> it<00:05:45.350> out<00:05:45.440> a<00:05:45.470> little<00:05:45.680> bit

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
on there to push it out a little bit

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.710 
on there to push it out a little bit
further<00:05:46.060> but<00:05:47.060> I<00:05:47.120> really<00:05:47.330> wanted<00:05:47.540> something

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
further but I really wanted something

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.050 
further but I really wanted something
that<00:05:47.870> was<00:05:47.960> more<00:05:48.110> lightweight<00:05:48.380> and<00:05:48.970> keeping<00:05:49.970> it

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
that was more lightweight and keeping it

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.180 
that was more lightweight and keeping it
shorter<00:05:50.390> certainly<00:05:50.780> adds<00:05:50.960> to<00:05:51.170> the<00:05:51.320> you<00:05:52.160> know

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
shorter certainly adds to the you know

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.820 
shorter certainly adds to the you know
the<00:05:52.370> reduced<00:05:52.670> weight<00:05:52.940> to<00:05:53.150> it<00:05:53.300> so<00:05:53.350> it<00:05:54.350> does<00:05:54.560> fold

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
the reduced weight to it so it does fold

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.810 
the reduced weight to it so it does fold
over<00:05:55.520> to<00:05:55.910> the<00:05:56.000> right<00:05:56.180> as<00:05:56.960> you<00:05:57.170> can<00:05:57.290> see<00:05:57.470> and<00:05:57.820> it

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
over to the right as you can see and it

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.760 
over to the right as you can see and it
doesn't<00:05:59.260> totally<00:06:00.260> interfere<00:06:00.860> with<00:06:01.040> my

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
doesn't totally interfere with my

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.570 
doesn't totally interfere with my
function<00:06:03.770> of<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:03.920> trigger<00:06:04.130> I<00:06:04.250> can<00:06:04.370> still

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
function of the trigger I can still

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.880 
function of the trigger I can still
shoot<00:06:04.730> the<00:06:04.850> gun<00:06:05.030> I<00:06:05.240> get<00:06:05.870> my<00:06:06.020> finger<00:06:06.500> kind<00:06:06.680> of<00:06:06.800> in

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
shoot the gun I get my finger kind of in

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.160 
shoot the gun I get my finger kind of in
between<00:06:07.010> the<00:06:07.340> stock<00:06:07.580> and<00:06:07.880> the<00:06:08.020> trigger<00:06:09.020> guard

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
between the stock and the trigger guard

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.410 
between the stock and the trigger guard
there<00:06:09.440> and<00:06:09.560> get<00:06:09.650> my<00:06:09.740> finger<00:06:10.040> in<00:06:10.190> the<00:06:11.000> safety<00:06:11.360> is

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
there and get my finger in the safety is

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.730 
there and get my finger in the safety is
kind<00:06:11.570> of<00:06:11.600> a<00:06:11.690> different<00:06:11.960> story<00:06:12.050> it's<00:06:12.350> difficult

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
kind of a different story it's difficult

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.460 
kind of a different story it's difficult
to<00:06:12.890> get<00:06:13.580> my<00:06:13.700> finger<00:06:14.030> there<00:06:14.300> I<00:06:14.720> can<00:06:15.110> kind<00:06:15.290> of<00:06:15.350> get

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
to get my finger there I can kind of get

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.800 
to get my finger there I can kind of get
it<00:06:15.560> up<00:06:15.680> over<00:06:15.890> the<00:06:16.130> top<00:06:16.310> and<00:06:16.700> manipulate<00:06:17.690> it

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
it up over the top and manipulate it

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
it up over the top and manipulate it
through<00:06:18.020> there<00:06:18.140> but<00:06:18.320> that's<00:06:18.440> a<00:06:18.560> little<00:06:18.650> bit

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
through there but that's a little bit

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.640 
through there but that's a little bit
more<00:06:18.980> difficult<00:06:19.690> charging<00:06:20.690> handle<00:06:21.050> you<00:06:21.440> could

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
more difficult charging handle you could

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.290 
more difficult charging handle you could
still<00:06:21.920> technically<00:06:22.520> use<00:06:22.790> it's<00:06:23.030> a<00:06:23.060> little<00:06:23.210> bit

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
still technically use it's a little bit

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.150 
still technically use it's a little bit
more<00:06:23.420> difficult<00:06:23.780> again<00:06:24.020> kind<00:06:24.860> of<00:06:24.950> hits<00:06:25.070> the

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
more difficult again kind of hits the

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.850 
more difficult again kind of hits the
back<00:06:26.150> of<00:06:26.330> the<00:06:26.420> pad<00:06:26.630> here<00:06:26.930> the<00:06:27.230> end<00:06:27.620> of<00:06:27.800> the

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
back of the pad here the end of the

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.010 
back of the pad here the end of the
stock<00:06:28.130> but<00:06:28.550> not<00:06:29.210> too<00:06:29.390> difficult<00:06:29.570> when<00:06:29.930> you

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
stock but not too difficult when you

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.050 
stock but not too difficult when you
have<00:06:30.170> the<00:06:30.380> DTS<00:06:30.860> Lynch<00:06:31.310> cover<00:06:31.580> on<00:06:31.760> the<00:06:31.880> left

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
have the DTS Lynch cover on the left

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.660 
have the DTS Lynch cover on the left
hand<00:06:32.240> side<00:06:32.540> that<00:06:32.980> certainly<00:06:33.980> adds<00:06:34.130> to<00:06:34.340> it<00:06:34.490> but

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670 
hand side that certainly adds to it but

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.220 
hand side that certainly adds to it but
really<00:06:35.270> you're<00:06:35.480> not<00:06:35.540> going<00:06:35.750> to<00:06:35.810> fire<00:06:35.990> it<00:06:36.020> in

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
really you're not going to fire it in

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.480 
really you're not going to fire it in
this<00:06:36.350> type<00:06:36.530> of<00:06:36.560> position<00:06:36.770> that's<00:06:37.220> more<00:06:37.400> of

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
this type of position that's more of

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.100 
this type of position that's more of
just<00:06:37.640> kind<00:06:37.730> of<00:06:38.150> concealing<00:06:38.690> it<00:06:38.810> making<00:06:39.080> sure

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
just kind of concealing it making sure

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.080 
just kind of concealing it making sure
it's<00:06:39.440> you<00:06:40.010> know<00:06:40.100> able<00:06:40.310> to<00:06:40.430> be<00:06:40.610> hidden<00:06:40.820> and

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
it's you know able to be hidden and

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.020 
it's you know able to be hidden and
storage<00:06:42.050> wise<00:06:42.260> just<00:06:42.620> make<00:06:42.770> it<00:06:42.890> smaller<00:06:43.030> really

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
storage wise just make it smaller really

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.060 
storage wise just make it smaller really
you're<00:06:44.120> going<00:06:44.210> to<00:06:44.300> fire<00:06:44.480> it<00:06:44.510> enough<00:06:45.070> position

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
you're going to fire it enough position

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.410 
you're going to fire it enough position
where<00:06:46.190> it's<00:06:46.340> nice<00:06:46.490> and<00:06:46.700> locked<00:06:46.850> up<00:06:47.150> there

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
where it's nice and locked up there

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.080 
where it's nice and locked up there
gives<00:06:48.110> you<00:06:48.230> a<00:06:48.260> nice<00:06:48.440> stable<00:06:49.370> platform<00:06:49.550> for

gives you a nice stable platform for
