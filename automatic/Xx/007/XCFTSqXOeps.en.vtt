00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:12.580
 now more than a part more we pass to 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.640
 end the water tower and now 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.619
 inexplicably on a transit map 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.830
 borno kano seems like it was going to be all like this 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.480
 it seems that there is no jungle of 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.360
 medium and the truth is that I was surprised 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.100
 quite and even more the disgusting that 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.140
 it can become the map that does 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.720
 that still surprised me a lot more but 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:37.270
 good thanks to the fire and our great 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:39.250
 ability we can avoid the enemies 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.370
 without any problem to have this if you 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.380
 for more or less there is more that goes to 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.610
 use it from platform to get it is 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.610
 pretty important guys 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.420
 on top of the pipeline and question 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.280
 as it does not give them to go out 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.649
 fuckers but it seems it is not so 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.750
 and there we are perfect fire now 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.510
 recover is not totally 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.330
 important is essential to have the 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.750
 fire but it helps a lot because 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.729
 that to take off a couple of blowfishes 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.899
 over and nothing we're going to get into this 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.509
 pipe that is to catch the second 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.640
 little star and the third one that is the most 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.170
 complicated map 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.909
 good complicated in quotes because 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.430
 after all, that is achieved in 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.380
 a moment already of going to see to come to 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.030
 wood in the pipe down here not 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.490
 to be fixed, that is, it always comes out 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.770
 the plants the pipes that continued 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.979
 you have to be a little careful yes 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.990
 and this in the cranberry juice that 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.210
 I say the mother who gave birth to them 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.860
 I 'm not what the fuck has got to you 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.420
 that is you caixa and interesting 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.729
 directly so that you with a 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.100
 very careful of three pairs of noses 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.920
 take here now in the east block of 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.259
 spikes there we give you a tap and 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.750
 now we jump like that there is to catch the 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.550
 star and this let's say it's the most 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.350
 complicated because it may cost you a 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.390
 little bit but we're not going to either 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.390
 throw rockets and now let's kill him 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.870
 more than anything because it is like a life 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.210
 Well let's get this benefit from that 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.250
 yes if you start jumping around here or from 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.730
 fuck what you follow shoot or try 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.360
 kill him because throwing you is the most 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.730
 sure but careful look to see here 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.200
 it was for him 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.840
 no no no no we're almost in the end 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.940
 but it was not to assault the flag 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.220
 now it's to jump to the flag that does not 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.780
 I'll do or say very bad joke 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.910
 experiences of trying to jump to the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.340
 flag and also put 55 so there 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.570
 what to take advantage of but we are going to listen 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.570
 is epic super music 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.280
 and I remember nothing more masters the next 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.499
 mamita and that yes everything that comes to 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.930
 then it's solid rock but let's go 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:56.450
 I was surprised that christie tells you 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.310
 he was surprised quite turned it 's a jungle 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.959
 although good is seen in the square that 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.849
 it's something like that green do not say good 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.200
 Well, maybe it's a post that cited a 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:08.180
 thing but although well I almost prefer a thousand 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.489
 times the map of the jungle before 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.230
 this fucking shit map immediately 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.269
 You will see why I say damn shit 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.939
 map more than anything because it's full 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.010
 fuck what way is that what way to 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:21.530
 Complicate media only kid already 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.209
 you will see the whole map is like this with balls of 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.459
 fire balls of fire balls of fire and 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.069
 more then the fireballs because 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:33.739
 because the mario point god has 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:36.260
 wanted well to see what can get to 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.659
 catch some things okay go over there 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.270
 and if you notice this, it's going to be a 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.100
 messing up because more than some 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.110
 salt fireball I'm going to 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.930
 gobbled finish because I'm that 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.790
 special to see here I will do my 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.140
 trick more than anything to skip 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.120
 no pain but why does not the wall bounce 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.030
 if you could see this game the skid 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.550
 that weird crappy thing that has 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:06.950
 it's a crap boy but because it has 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.600
 that they spill, or seriously 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.550
 it has its logic not if you have a lot 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.819
 propulsion then terrapass a little bit 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.980
 to fuck male one thing skid and 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.419
 another and to fly is what is happening in 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.419
 this game there we are 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:27.220
 and we are running for the best 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:37.259
 yes yes yes yes I did not remember this 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.180
 valued evans fail and do that if the 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.340
 little stars are pretty hidden 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.300
 but otherwise it's usually a very map 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.009
 but that very simple or almost almost me 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.340
 I give them again with the fucking skid of 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.340
 the noses 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.730
 there we are a perfect bounce 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.000
 joderos joderos and timbers to see and now 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.850
 over here was the sensual star there 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.710
 we are is I think it was the second 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.760
 but for the love of god we do not put 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.560
 in the pipe 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.110
 to see carefully because we are 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.630
 directing us to the third star 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.030
 but you have to take care of three 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.570
 couple of noses more than anything because 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.670
 you will see it is necessary to jump from here 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:26.710
 wall hollow flower wall encounter 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:29.570
 the difficult thing comes to dodge the damn 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.670
 fireballs those that spin that yes that 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.170
 it's bad but we're going to go for the 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.080
 top part because it's to go to 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.450
 catch and the third will see 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.040
 jump seriously this is very very very very 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.040
 very happy but what do you want that criticism 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:45.069
 already 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:52.250
 group a 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.350
 is a mini mario the terror of the girls 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:04.640
 come on let's go there to see this was so 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.640
 simple like bending over 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.170
 to take for good sack we have already 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.450
 got the third star so 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.030
 As you can see, there are two maps 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.450
 fuck has entered me as you see are two 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.810
 very very very simple maps to 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.810
 zero complication 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:26.780
 I would have liked to take 33 if I do not know 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.570
 can take everything out in this life or what 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:33.470
 that entered the eye did good gordon ay 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:35.750
 my god not the cup hammer not like 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.230
 the stage calls the brothers the brothers 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.120
 hammer 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.780
 although brothers have rather little 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.690
 because there is only one but 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.670
 if you call it that because of something it will be like that 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:49.300
 now let's unlock the road there 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:51.550
 we are and yes yes it seems weird 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.950
 the next dad is the second tower 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.470
 of the map that yes you will see it is a 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.720
 Extreme complication that makes you want to 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.130
 to strangle someone but well that 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.480
 we leave for the next part because 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.090
 is at the end you finish me enough 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.830
 simple and very funny that 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.120
 so nothing really appreciate people 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.590
 short here I hope you liked it and 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.210
 If so , you already know 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.570
 subscribe and those things the most 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.930
 important thank you for following me goodbye 15 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.930
 happy
