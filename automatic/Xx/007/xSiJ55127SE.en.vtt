00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
signs for mob spawners first I'll be

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.950 
signs for mob spawners first I'll be
covering<00:00:10.800> different<00:00:11.370> mob<00:00:11.730> spawners<00:00:12.030> IDs<00:00:12.630> and

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
covering different mob spawners IDs and

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.780 
covering different mob spawners IDs and
then<00:00:13.530> I'm<00:00:13.799> going<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:13.980> move<00:00:14.070> into<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.490> more

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
then I'm going to move into a more

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.740 
then I'm going to move into a more
complex<00:00:15.480> topic<00:00:16.760> when<00:00:17.760> regular<00:00:18.119> members<00:00:18.570> try

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
complex topic when regular members try

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.929 
complex topic when regular members try
to<00:00:18.810> buy<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> mob<00:00:19.470> spawner<00:00:19.770> by<00:00:20.010> default<00:00:20.460> they'll

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
to buy a mob spawner by default they'll

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.730 
to buy a mob spawner by default they'll
only<00:00:21.330> receive<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> pig<00:00:21.990> spawner<00:00:22.260> even<00:00:22.590> if<00:00:22.680> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
only receive a pig spawner even if the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.439 
only receive a pig spawner even if the
idea<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.039> right<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.300> install

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
idea is right so you have to install

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.200 
idea is right so you have to install
plug-in<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> work<00:00:25.109> your<00:00:25.260> way<00:00:25.380> around<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:26.210> our

plug-in to work your way around that our

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.910 
plug-in to work your way around that our
first<00:00:27.480> step<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.930> identify<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.380> ideas<00:00:28.769> for

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
first step is to identify the ideas for

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.450 
first step is to identify the ideas for
the<00:00:29.010> spawners

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the spawners

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.700 
the spawners
other<00:00:29.640> than<00:00:29.939> pigs<00:00:30.150> if<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.230> go<00:00:31.320> ahead<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.619> look

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
other than pigs if you go ahead and look

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
other than pigs if you go ahead and look
at<00:00:31.769> my<00:00:31.890> screen<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.969> use<00:00:33.239> /i<00:00:33.660> 52<00:00:34.440> 52<00:00:35.430> is

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
at my screen here and I use /i 52 52 is

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.430 
at my screen here and I use /i 52 52 is
the<00:00:35.820> ID<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.450> regular<00:00:36.750> pig<00:00:36.930> spawner<00:00:37.230> and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the ID to the regular pig spawner and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.229 
the ID to the regular pig spawner and
when<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> place<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.040> down<00:00:38.219> you'll<00:00:38.520> see<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.059> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
when I place it down you'll see it is a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.470 
when I place it down you'll see it is a
pig<00:00:39.739> but<00:00:40.739> when<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.309> spawn<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.940> spawner<00:00:42.239> other

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
pig but when I spawn in a spawner other

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.279 
pig but when I spawn in a spawner other
than<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> pig<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.590> 52<00:00:44.399> :<00:00:44.910> 51<00:00:45.300> I'll<00:00:46.170> get<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
than a pig so I 52 : 51 I'll get a

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.810 
than a pig so I 52 : 51 I'll get a
different<00:00:46.469> type<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.829> spawner<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.789> a
