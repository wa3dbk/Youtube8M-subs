health and the original necro street
cabin<00:00:51.670> fever<00:00:51.700> style<00:00:52.240> maps<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.660> health<00:00:52.870> was

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
cabin fever style maps the health was

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.470 
cabin fever style maps the health was
one<00:00:53.230> hit<00:00:53.440> in<00:00:53.620> your<00:00:53.770> out<00:00:53.890> sort<00:00:54.310> of<00:00:54.400> deal<00:00:54.579> I've

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
one hit in your out sort of deal I've

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.300 
one hit in your out sort of deal I've
adjusted<00:00:55.660> it<00:00:56.140> so<00:00:56.350> it's<00:00:56.590> two<00:00:56.770> hits<00:00:56.980> and<00:00:57.190> you're

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
adjusted it so it's two hits and you're

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.890 
adjusted it so it's two hits and you're
out<00:00:57.460> so<00:00:57.820> if<00:00:57.910> you<00:00:58.000> get<00:00:58.090> hit<00:00:58.210> twice<00:00:58.420> you're<00:00:58.630> dead

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
out so if you get hit twice you're dead

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.510 
out so if you get hit twice you're dead
and<00:00:59.650> the<00:00:59.739> way<00:00:59.829> the<00:00:59.950> health<00:01:00.130> works<00:01:00.310> is<00:01:00.489> that

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
and the way the health works is that

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.340 
and the way the health works is that
there's<00:01:00.850> zero<00:01:01.090> recharge<00:01:01.630> so<00:01:01.840> when<00:01:01.930> you<00:01:02.020> do<00:01:02.200> get

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
there's zero recharge so when you do get

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.810 
there's zero recharge so when you do get
hitched<00:01:02.560> that's<00:01:02.829> your<00:01:03.010> one<00:01:03.100> hit<00:01:03.340> your<00:01:03.489> safety

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
hitched that's your one hit your safety

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.910 
hitched that's your one hit your safety
nets<00:01:04.000> gone<00:01:04.239> for<00:01:05.079> the<00:01:05.170> rest<00:01:05.319> of<00:01:05.439> the<00:01:05.530> round<00:01:05.679> so

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
nets gone for the rest of the round so

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.200 
nets gone for the rest of the round so
if<00:01:05.979> you<00:01:06.039> get<00:01:06.130> hit<00:01:06.280> again<00:01:06.369> you're<00:01:06.700> dead<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.149> i

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
if you get hit again you're dead and i

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.309 
if you get hit again you're dead and i
think<00:01:07.390> that<00:01:07.479> works<00:01:07.659> well<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:08.020> makes<00:01:08.140> the

00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:08.319 
think that works well it makes the

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:11.039 
think that works well it makes the
pacing<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.219> lot<00:01:09.369> slower<00:01:09.810> which<00:01:10.810> is<00:01:10.929> not

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
pacing a lot slower which is not

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:12.840 
pacing a lot slower which is not
something<00:01:11.170> everybody's<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.950> fan<00:01:12.100> of<00:01:12.159> I<00:01:12.429> love<00:01:12.729> it

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:37.230 
it gave the humans a brief glimmer of
hope<00:01:35.920> thinking<00:01:36.369> they<00:01:36.459> were<00:01:36.639> gonna<00:01:36.850> make<00:01:37.030> it

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
hope thinking they were gonna make it

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.109 
hope thinking they were gonna make it
but<00:01:38.049> around<00:01:38.289> the<00:01:38.409> 30<00:01:38.590> 40<00:01:38.979> second<00:01:39.280> mark<00:01:39.490> flood

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
but around the 30 40 second mark flood

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.149 
but around the 30 40 second mark flood
is<00:01:40.270> bust<00:01:40.539> in<00:01:40.719> and<00:01:40.899> just<00:01:41.079> kill<00:01:41.319> everybody<00:01:41.740> and

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
is bust in and just kill everybody and

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.739 
is bust in and just kill everybody and
it's<00:01:42.310> pretty<00:01:42.549> hilarious<00:01:42.670> so<00:01:43.209> we<00:01:43.389> had<00:01:43.509> a<00:01:43.539> lot<00:01:43.719> of

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:43.749 
it's pretty hilarious so we had a lot of

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.830 
it's pretty hilarious so we had a lot of
fun<00:01:43.959> playing<00:01:43.990> on<00:01:44.319> this<00:01:44.439> one<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.700> overall<00:01:46.689> the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
fun playing on this one and overall the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.389 
fun playing on this one and overall the
I<00:01:46.929> got<00:01:47.109> I<00:01:47.139> said<00:01:47.380> it's<00:01:47.499> been<00:01:47.619> very<00:01:47.829> promising

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
I got I said it's been very promising

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.879 
I got I said it's been very promising
I've<00:01:48.880> been<00:01:49.090> trying<00:01:49.329> to<00:01:49.509> recreate<00:01:50.439> that<00:01:50.649> feel

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:50.889 
I've been trying to recreate that feel

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:53.969 
I've been trying to recreate that feel
and<00:01:51.100> I<00:01:51.130> think<00:01:51.310> I've<00:01:51.459> nailed<00:01:51.639> it<00:01:51.909> hopefully<00:01:52.979> but

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
and I think I've nailed it hopefully but

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.289 
and I think I've nailed it hopefully but
