gonna<00:02:14.959> sprout<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:15.980> do<00:02:16.819> an<00:02:16.940> update<00:02:17.239> in<00:02:17.420> about<00:02:17.630> a

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
gonna sprout I do an update in about a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.850 
gonna sprout I do an update in about a
month<00:02:18.260> just<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:19.010> see<00:02:19.250> how<00:02:19.310> things<00:02:19.519> are<00:02:19.790> going

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
month just to see how things are going

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.780 
month just to see how things are going
but<00:02:21.860> again<00:02:21.970> very<00:02:22.970> simple<00:02:24.370> aquaponic<00:02:25.370> system

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
but again very simple aquaponic system

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.870 
but again very simple aquaponic system
doesn't<00:02:26.750> have<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:27.019> be<00:02:28.180> as<00:02:29.500> crazy<00:02:30.500> as<00:02:30.799> I've<00:02:31.549> seen

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
doesn't have to be as crazy as I've seen

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.720 
doesn't have to be as crazy as I've seen
some<00:02:32.150> aquaponic<00:02:32.989> system<00:02:33.319> very<00:02:33.860> very<00:02:34.069> simple<00:02:34.370> i

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
some aquaponic system very very simple i

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.970 
some aquaponic system very very simple i
think<00:02:35.569> when<00:02:35.720> i<00:02:35.750> get<00:02:35.930> back<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.410> states<00:02:36.650> i

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
think when i get back to the states i

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.890 
think when i get back to the states i
will<00:02:38.530> make<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.560> bigger<00:02:39.920> one<00:02:40.190> now<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:41.780> i've

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
will make a bigger one now that i've

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.690 
will make a bigger one now that i've
learned<00:02:41.930> quite<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.500> bit<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:43.069> those<00:02:43.430> sizes

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
learned quite a bit and those sizes

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
learned quite a bit and those sizes
kicked<00:02:44.180> in<00:02:44.390> i<00:02:51.850> think<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.060> hardest<00:02:53.329> part<00:02:53.480> about

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
kicked in i think the hardest part about

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.780 
kicked in i think the hardest part about
my<00:02:54.109> aquaponics<00:02:54.470> system<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.160> there's<00:02:55.340> no<00:02:55.549> home

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
my aquaponics system is there's no home

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.910 
my aquaponics system is there's no home
depot<00:02:56.180> or<00:02:56.209> ace<00:02:56.510> hardware<00:02:56.989> over<00:02:57.200> here<00:02:57.410> so

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
depot or ace hardware over here so

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.370 
depot or ace hardware over here so
everything<00:02:58.519> is<00:02:58.670> done<00:02:58.910> either<00:02:59.840> added<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.260> get

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
everything is done either added to get

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.069 
everything is done either added to get
on<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.560> subway<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:00.980> find<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.549> or<00:03:01.760> get<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.480> taxi

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
on the subway to find it or get a taxi

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.710 
on the subway to find it or get a taxi
to<00:03:03.109> go<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.620> some<00:03:04.090> market<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.269> find<00:03:05.299> what<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.660> need

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.629 
to go to some market to find what I need
I<00:03:06.200> think<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.950> only<00:03:06.980> thing<00:03:07.190> i'm<00:03:07.370> going<00:03:07.489> to<00:03:07.579> add

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
I think the only thing i'm going to add

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.660 
I think the only thing i'm going to add
now<00:03:07.850> just<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.389> be<00:03:08.510> incredibly<00:03:08.930> lazy<00:03:09.109> is<00:03:09.590> a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
now just to be incredibly lazy is a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.309 
now just to be incredibly lazy is a
automatic<00:03:10.670> fish<00:03:11.000> feeder<00:03:11.030> which<00:03:11.989> is<00:03:12.109> then<00:03:12.260> I

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
automatic fish feeder which is then I

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.440 
automatic fish feeder which is then I
don't<00:03:12.500> have<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.829> water<00:03:13.010> my<00:03:13.220> plants<00:03:13.609> or<00:03:13.970> feed<00:03:14.299> my

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
don't have to water my plants or feed my

don't have to water my plants or feed my
fish<00:03:15.069> okay<00:03:16.069> said<00:03:16.250> I'll<00:03:16.340> give<00:03:16.430> another<00:03:16.459> update

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
fish okay said I'll give another update

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.690 
fish okay said I'll give another update
