story the other story I want to tell you
and<00:01:43.160> this<00:01:43.280> is<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.460> way<00:01:43.550> quicker<00:01:43.970> one<00:01:44.240> and

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
and this is a way quicker one and

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.330 
and this is a way quicker one and
probably<00:01:44.600> i<00:01:44.900> think<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.680> better<00:01:45.860> one<00:01:46.100> although

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
probably i think a better one although

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.030 
probably i think a better one although
neither<00:01:46.610> one<00:01:46.850> of<00:01:46.880> them<00:01:47.030> are<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.270> great<00:01:48.040> and

neither one of them are that great and

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.850 
neither one of them are that great and
that's<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:49.760> story<00:01:50.540> of<00:01:50.750> how<00:01:50.930> this<00:01:51.230> movie<00:01:51.650> came
