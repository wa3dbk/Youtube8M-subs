00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
that's pretty much it so um do I

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.540 
that's pretty much it so um do I
recommend<00:05:40.120> this<00:05:40.330> one<00:05:40.510> definitely<00:05:40.930> I

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
recommend this one definitely I

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.430 
recommend this one definitely I
definitely<00:05:42.550> say<00:05:42.790> try<00:05:43.150> it<00:05:43.210> some<00:05:43.990> people<00:05:44.260> will

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440

not<00:05:44.650> like<00:05:44.710> this<00:05:45.190> one<00:05:45.430> but<00:05:45.640> I<00:05:45.670> think<00:05:45.940> that<00:05:46.120> for

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
not like this one but I think that for

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.150 
not like this one but I think that for
the<00:05:46.480> most<00:05:46.510> part<00:05:47.020> because<00:05:47.290> it's<00:05:47.590> a<00:05:47.680> designer

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
the most part because it's a designer

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.920 
the most part because it's a designer
and<00:05:48.430> designers<00:05:48.910> tend<00:05:49.120> to<00:05:49.210> cater<00:05:49.390> to<00:05:49.660> the<00:05:49.780> gut

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
and designers tend to cater to the gut

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.920 
and designers tend to cater to the gut
to<00:05:50.890> the<00:05:51.190> masses<00:05:51.670> for<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:52.300> most<00:05:52.450> part<00:05:52.660> people

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
to the masses for the most part people

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.710 
to the masses for the most part people
