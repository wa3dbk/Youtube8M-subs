00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.220
 We are now parents who please and take their children to play another 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.860
 room because we're going to deal with topics that are a little bit of adults to 101 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.219
 years ago we are doing with your homework 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.700
 free with the fernandez psychoanalyst or ready to answer the questions that 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:21.300
 is disarmed nana doctor they name me their vigorous I have teenage children a 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.890
 simple 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.960
 this is compared to year-on-year and also good environment 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.720
 not the best for powers this way we stole a video game 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.600
 sculptor oy helmut the world of videogames also opens a world of what 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.280
 social and current 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.470
 there is a virtual friendship that is related to video games and take the child out of 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.260
 that context is equivalent to when we were children that someone does not 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.620
 forbid to watch television 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.150
 is to produce that solar of the real world although all the children of age 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.190
 exactly children have incorporated a virtual world 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.969
 which probably we are a little foreign 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.650
 but you can not get the children out of there without producing 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.710
 true but you have to choose because I have also from videogames to videogames 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.500
 has been very aggressive years with a double message now what the consoles 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.860
 videogames is that 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.980
 the forum on the prices that are so involved that they are not so social 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.290
 they go out so much playing the street they do not have so many 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.990
 that time he tries to dynamite the ability to relate socially 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.040
 as I would when I was a girl for example if we say that there is 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.790
 of ice 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.060
 certain social issues that are happening in society is being 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.810
 dying in this direction and the boys respond in this direction 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.200
 I asked yes if you do not also think that your social life has been 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.980
 reduced compared to what they were years ago let's see in general the trend of 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.479
 the society that virtualize c there is a generalized discourse to virtualize be 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.850
 much more but this we see much more is reflected children with adults 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.650
 the weapons cars easily keep that other social bond direct you 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.479
 have to exercise as the Americans say then one has to 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.020
 havoc to go with the flow of what comes life hours another afternoon 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.089
 inculcate the child 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:12.989
 social christian 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.910
 p 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.059
 it is impossible to stop 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:21.079
 what happens mind is happening but there is a concrete data that it offers that is 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.079
 an attempt also to answer him there is the question he was asking 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.059
 what is the limit of the good game the limit is very clear I do not know if it 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.730
 can calculate in hours but you can calculate what is happening 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.260
 in the boy's life if the boy academically is wrong if the boy 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.629
 begins to lose social life if the boy begins not to do sports if the 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.129
 boy then we will do and the bench suddenly already in itself and not the first 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.470
 conversation not even 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.890
 this work in familiar scene as before it carried there one could ask 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.090
 If this limit has not been exceeded, the limit and the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.199
 fire that occupying a place too 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.439
 I would like then a brand new mini area maybe because it's the limit 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.270
 to use the video game absolutely clear 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.179
 Maybe it's time to limit it 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:09.290
 good many thanks and feelings 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.330
 I know how it feels we have learned a lot says he does cordially 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.080
 invited to the program so that it does not continue to remove doubts
