trying to be learned the reasons for

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.580 
trying to be learned the reasons for
this<00:00:29.580> upon<00:00:30.420> study<00:00:30.750> are<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.140> know<00:00:31.230> not<00:00:31.439> too

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
this upon study are you know not too

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.160 
this upon study are you know not too
difficult<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.099> appreciate<00:00:33.110> obviously<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
difficult to appreciate obviously the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.810 
difficult to appreciate obviously the
programmers<00:00:34.680> they<00:00:34.860> wanted<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.219> force<00:00:35.489> players

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
programmers they wanted to force players

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.360 
programmers they wanted to force players
to<00:00:36.030> pick<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.960> choose<00:00:37.070> such<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
to pick and choose such that the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.459 
to pick and choose such that the
creatures<00:00:38.760> occupied<00:00:39.510> certain<00:00:39.899> niches<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
creatures occupied certain niches in a

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.729 
creatures occupied certain niches in a
team<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.480> we're<00:00:42.480> not<00:00:42.600> let's<00:00:42.870> say<00:00:43.079> overly

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
team and we're not let's say overly

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.729 
team and we're not let's say overly
powerful<00:00:45.140> obviously<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.410> would<00:00:46.530> pose<00:00:46.710> a

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
powerful obviously it would pose a

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.790 
powerful obviously it would pose a
problem<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.280> example<00:00:47.969> if<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.870> battle<00:00:49.379> someone

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
problem for example if in battle someone

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.970 
problem for example if in battle someone
had<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> mewtwo<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:51.090> new<00:00:51.480> blizzard<00:00:52.170> Thunder

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
had a mewtwo that new blizzard Thunder

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.099 
had a mewtwo that new blizzard Thunder
Fire<00:00:53.730> Blast<00:00:54.620> Thunderbolt<00:00:55.620> psychic<00:00:56.780> mu<00:00:57.780> since

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
Fire Blast Thunderbolt psychic mu since

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.510 
Fire Blast Thunderbolt psychic mu since
it<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.469> any<00:00:58.620> move<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> game<00:00:59.250> that

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
it can know any move in the game that

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.799 
it can know any move in the game that
would<00:00:59.579> hiss<00:00:59.789> serious<00:01:00.239> problem<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.750> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
would hiss serious problem have a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.020 
would hiss serious problem have a
Pokemon<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.379> knows<00:01:01.559> every<00:01:02.039> single<00:01:02.430> move<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
Pokemon that knows every single move and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.780 
Pokemon that knows every single move and
then<00:01:03.989> enters<00:01:04.409> into<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> battle<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
then enters into the battle so the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.460 
then enters into the battle so the
programmers<00:01:06.270> way<00:01:06.420> around<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.900> was<00:01:07.140> well<00:01:07.350> hey

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
programmers way around this was well hey

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.140 
programmers way around this was well hey
let's<00:01:07.799> limit<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> creatures<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.640> four<00:01:08.850> moves

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
let's limit the creatures to four moves

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.140 
let's limit the creatures to four moves
okay<00:01:10.400> but<00:01:11.400> here's<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> problem<00:01:12.409> why<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.590> earth

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
okay but here's the problem why on earth

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.149 
okay but here's the problem why on earth
didn't<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.210> guys<00:01:15.479> create<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.350> segregation

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
didn't you guys create a segregation

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.090 
didn't you guys create a segregation
between<00:01:17.310> battle<00:01:18.299> moves<00:01:18.509> ie<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.770> list<00:01:19.950> of

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
between battle moves ie the list of

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.920 
between battle moves ie the list of
moves<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.520> are<00:01:20.670> able<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.479> used<00:01:21.600> by<00:01:21.750> that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
moves that are able to be used by that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.580 
moves that are able to be used by that
creature<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.530> battle<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.250> moves<00:01:24.240> known<00:01:24.659> where

creature in battle and moves known where
moves<00:01:25.860> known<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.280> basically<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> total<00:01:27.270> move

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
moves known is basically the total move

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.859 
moves known is basically the total move
pool<00:01:28.100> from<00:01:29.100> which<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:30.000> list<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.329> battle<00:01:30.659> moves

pool from which the list of battle moves
can<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.200> chosen<00:01:31.530> at<00:01:31.950> will<00:01:32.990> outside<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.259> given

can be chosen at will outside of a given

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.190 
can be chosen at will outside of a given
battle<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.880> example<00:01:36.270> let's<00:01:36.479> say<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.079> had<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
battle for example let's say we had a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.410 
battle for example let's say we had a
Pikachu<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.950> suppose<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.759> Pikachu<00:01:39.240> new

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
Pikachu and suppose this Pikachu new

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.969 
Pikachu and suppose this Pikachu new
we're<00:01:39.900> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> go<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.380> give<00:01:40.470> him<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.860> sake

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
we're going to go and give him for sake

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.219 
we're going to go and give him for sake
of<00:01:41.040> argument<00:01:41.159> six<00:01:41.729> moves<00:01:41.970> thunder<00:01:42.930> thunder

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
were limited to four moves only ever and

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.819 
were limited to four moves only ever and
that<00:03:44.909> if<00:03:45.479> he<00:03:45.509> regretted<00:03:45.720> deleting<00:03:46.439> a<00:03:46.500> certain

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
that if he regretted deleting a certain

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.979 
that if he regretted deleting a certain
move<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.280> was<00:03:47.400> gone<00:03:47.609> forever<00:03:47.840> sure<00:03:48.840> in

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
move it was gone forever sure in

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.360 
move it was gone forever sure in
generation<00:03:49.439> through<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:49.919> was<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.189> move

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
generation through the it was the move

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.039 
generation through the it was the move
tutor<00:03:50.989> but<00:03:51.989> that's<00:03:52.169> just<00:03:52.319> so<00:03:52.650> inefficient<00:03:53.609> and

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
tutor but that's just so inefficient and

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.099 
tutor but that's just so inefficient and
besides<00:03:55.049> it<00:03:55.709> doesn't<00:03:55.769> really<00:03:56.449> help<00:03:57.449> you<00:03:57.629> get

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
besides it doesn't really help you get

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.069 
besides it doesn't really help you get
back<00:03:58.290> moves<00:03:58.729> that<00:03:59.729> can't<00:04:00.090> be<00:04:00.269> tutored<00:04:00.629> back<00:04:00.840> on

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
back moves that can't be tutored back on

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.289 
back moves that can't be tutored back on
for<00:04:01.739> example<00:04:01.829> if<00:04:02.310> you've<00:04:02.489> bred<00:04:02.819> a<00:04:02.849> cert<00:04:03.150> and

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
for example if you've bred a cert and

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.149 
for example if you've bred a cert and
move<00:04:03.449> on<00:04:03.629> to<00:04:03.659> the<00:04:03.780> baby<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.530> then<00:04:04.829> you<00:04:04.949> choose

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
move on to the baby and then you choose

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.559 
move on to the baby and then you choose
to<00:04:05.310> delete<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.729> and<00:04:05.909> you<00:04:06.000> regret<00:04:06.329> that<00:04:06.359> you

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
to delete it and you regret that you

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.929 
to delete it and you regret that you
deleted<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:07.049> bread<00:04:07.379> on<00:04:07.530> move<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:08.759> move

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
deleted that bread on move the move

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.249 
deleted that bread on move the move
tutor<00:04:09.150> currently<00:04:09.599> doesn't<00:04:09.750> help<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:10.109> with

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:10.259 
tutor currently doesn't help you with

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:12.319 
tutor currently doesn't help you with
that<00:04:10.289> he's<00:04:11.219> programmed<00:04:11.729> to<00:04:11.819> just<00:04:12.000> give<00:04:12.299> you

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
that he's programmed to just give you

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.050 
that he's programmed to just give you
moves<00:04:12.689> that<00:04:12.959> can<00:04:13.079> be<00:04:13.199> tutored<00:04:13.620> on<00:04:13.799> which<00:04:14.699> is

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
moves that can be tutored on which is

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.689 
moves that can be tutored on which is
pretty<00:04:15.449> limiting<00:04:15.900> so<00:04:16.769> that's<00:04:17.219> it<00:04:17.370> for<00:04:17.400> today's

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
pretty limiting so that's it for today's

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.000 
pretty limiting so that's it for today's
