 it's a shame 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.150
 in another time it was in the ass 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:40.810

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:51.430

 no one is watching I'm not playing 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:03.820

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.400
 players but not worth the money I 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.660

 small futures probably do not know 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.849
