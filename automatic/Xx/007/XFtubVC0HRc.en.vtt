00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.320
People love giving me sweets

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.520
and have done so for years.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.760
I think the thing with time travel is it matters

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.880
if you're invisible when you get there or not.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.600
Garbáty Square is called Garbáty

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.520
because... No-one knows.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.400
It's sick. They put a house that fills the square

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.480
on it but still call it square.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.040
You're an East-West band.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.080
That's correct.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.240
I get paid for making music with those two.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.000
By the state. But it's still the FRG.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.240
I see.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.200
By the good old FRG. But they pay him

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.800
in Deutsch Marks, that's a bummer for him.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.840
We always feel like we're getting

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.360
welcoming money, all day long.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.960
It's great. We go round Tom's

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.920
and he has Mamba, Haribo,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.600
bananas, you name it.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.120
He often has Mamba.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.280
Kissing Eck is closing, look.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.440
That's sad.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.520
No way.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.360
Heiner Müller was a regular.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.360
This used to be the Lebanese embassy

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.400
and right next to it the NPD party headquarters.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.120
That's why they built Garbáty Square.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.680
They thought, well...

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.480
The Montessori Children's House is there?

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.600
I mean...

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.520
But you can't park there, either.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.640
They don't have any starters.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.320
It's been westernised.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.360
They used to have small soups, a terrine

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.160
with a beaten egg and some vegetables.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.040
And the wait for the food...

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.440
Although they're very fast here...

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.240
Although they're probably slaughtering

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.200
the animal in the back now...

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.280
They are fast.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.800
But they caught it.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.880
They caught it out back in the goat compound.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.640
Well, Nora...

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.920
What... What do you like about Nora?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.560
Wicked. Just pass it on.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.080
Her speed.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.720
Yeah, it's sick. True.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.560
Nora is incredibly fast. Fast in her head.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.240
And thus in her actions.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.840
Let me tell you one thing.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.440
If you're home late again I'll punch you so hard

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.520
the next census is without you.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.400
I'm sitting in the kitchen, eating a "Klops".

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.280
Suddenly, it knocks.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.840
I sit there, look around, am surprised.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.280
No, suddenly, the door opens, you smart aleck.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.000
Suddenly the door opens.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.320
Oops, I think, I think, oops.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.000
Now it's open, before it was closed.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.360
I go outside and look.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.920
Who's out there? Me.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.640
It's Berlin in a nutshell.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.920
It's great.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.400
Suddenly, it knocks.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.600
Oh, that's nice.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.240
And we used to have...

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.080
We had nothing, but plenty of that.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.880
I'd like rum truffles. But not in my bar.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.480
That's good, I didn't know that one.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.320
You didn't know that one?

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.360
It's as old as time.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.040
I want a lot of food.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.080
I want meat, too.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.000
I'd like two legs of goose on top.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.600
And a mutton. Exactly.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.880
Someone is tidying up. I want to eat.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.800
No recipe, just eat.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.280
Yes, please.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.120
Mhm, that's really good.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.800
Oh, great, thanks.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.320
Fabulous.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.240
I'd like to try some of your fish.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.280
Is it plaited?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.680
Yes, it was a traumatic childhood.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.800
Yes, that's true.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.720
I need the loo. Will you pay? I have no money.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.200
Subtitles: Stephanie Geiges

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.840
More and more, I look for situations

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.680
where I can form something.
