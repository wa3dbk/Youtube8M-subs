quite aware of this I should imagine as

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.520

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
this is a game for the PS Vita and I'm

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.880 
this is a game for the PS Vita and I'm
pretty<00:00:35.070> sure<00:00:35.780> not<00:00:36.780> 100%<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:37.530> I'm<00:00:37.620> pretty<00:00:37.770> sure

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
pretty sure not 100% but I'm pretty sure

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.350 
pretty sure not 100% but I'm pretty sure
that<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.399> come<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> ps4<00:00:39.570> as<00:00:40.290> well<00:00:40.559> I

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
that it's come out on the ps4 as well I

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.880 
that it's come out on the ps4 as well I
can't<00:00:42.360> say<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:42.780> certain<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.350> haven't

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
can't say that for certain as I haven't

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.860 
can't say that for certain as I haven't
got<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> ps4<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:44.879> pretty<00:00:45.120> sure<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.329> read<00:00:45.690> it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
got a ps4 but I'm pretty sure I read it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.510 
got a ps4 but I'm pretty sure I read it
somewhere<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.410> I'm<00:00:46.680> actually<00:00:46.920> playing<00:00:47.309> this

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
somewhere but I'm actually playing this

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.100 
somewhere but I'm actually playing this
on<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.820> iPhone<00:00:50.059> and<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.360> game<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.600> one<00:00:51.930> that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
on the iPhone and this game is one that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.439 
on the iPhone and this game is one that
I<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.410> literally<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:52.949> recently<00:00:53.730> bought<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
I have literally just recently bought to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.540 
I have literally just recently bought to
try<00:00:54.660> out<00:00:54.840> because<00:00:55.140> I've<00:00:55.320> seen<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
try out because I've seen it in the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.729 
try out because I've seen it in the
think<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.390> was<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> top<00:00:57.840> 50<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.440> charts

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
think it was in the top 50 of the charts

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.520 
think it was in the top 50 of the charts
I<00:00:58.829> was<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.100> mooching<00:00:59.609> through<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.300> do

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
I was just mooching through as you do

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.959 
I was just mooching through as you do
I've<00:01:01.530> seen<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.520> look<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.730> it

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
I've seen this I like the look of it

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.870 
I've seen this I like the look of it
from<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> images<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.049> thought<00:01:04.850> why<00:01:05.850> not

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
from the images and I thought why not

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.609 
from the images and I thought why not
give<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> go<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.570> think<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.990> was<00:01:07.110> only<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
give it a go I think it was only to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.960 
give it a go I think it was only to
power<00:01:07.860> my<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.189> know<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> know<00:01:08.549> something<00:01:08.790> like

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
power my you know I know something like

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.320 
power my you know I know something like
that

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.160 
that
so<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> thought<00:01:11.479> might<00:01:12.479> as<00:01:12.540> well<00:01:12.659> give<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> go

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
so I thought might as well give it a go

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.800 
so I thought might as well give it a go
it<00:01:13.290> sort<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.560> had<00:01:14.030> around<00:01:15.030> three<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.630> half

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
it sort of had around three and a half

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.870 
it sort of had around three and a half
four<00:01:16.290> stars<00:01:16.770> reviews<00:01:17.340> out<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.700> five<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.640> it

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
four stars reviews out of five so it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.700 
four stars reviews out of five so it
sort<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.210> got<00:01:21.390> me<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.570> little<00:01:21.780> intrigued<00:01:22.530> so

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
sort of got me a little intrigued so

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.179 
sort of got me a little intrigued so
what<00:01:22.860> downloads<00:01:23.340> there<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.820> I've<00:01:23.939> been

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
what downloads there and I've been

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.660 
what downloads there and I've been
playing<00:01:26.189> them<00:01:27.829> quite<00:01:28.829> quite<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> bit<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.520> it

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
playing them quite quite a bit of it

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.109 
playing them quite quite a bit of it
actually

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
actually

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.810 
actually
and<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.740> mission<00:01:31.950> I've<00:01:32.189> recorded<00:01:32.520> now

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and but this mission I've recorded now

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.730 
and but this mission I've recorded now
is<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.180> very<00:01:33.240> far<00:01:33.780> into<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.320> game<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.560> think

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
is not very far into the game I think

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.530 
is not very far into the game I think
it's<00:01:35.009> only<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.369> mission<00:01:35.729> four<00:01:36.150> or<00:01:36.390> something

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
it's only that mission four or something

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.710 
it's only that mission four or something
like<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.850> but<00:01:38.850> I'm<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.030> doing<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.509> one

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
like that but I'm not doing this one

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.690 
like that but I'm not doing this one
live<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.110> recorded<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> gameplay<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.490> I'm

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
live I recorded the gameplay and now I'm

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.910 
live I recorded the gameplay and now I'm
just<00:01:41.939> commentating<00:01:42.600> over<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.020> my

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
just commentating over it just my

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.999 
just commentating over it just my
thoughts<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.579> game<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.210> far<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.799> those<00:01:46.979> of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
thoughts on the game so far so those of

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.800 
thoughts on the game so far so those of
you<00:01:47.250> haven't<00:01:47.549> played<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.149> you've

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you haven't played it and you've

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.149 
you haven't played it and you've
probably<00:01:49.049> pretty<00:01:49.439> much<00:01:49.560> guessed<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.009> you're

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
probably pretty much guessed that you're

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.749 
probably pretty much guessed that you're
a<00:01:50.399> spy<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.320> you've<00:01:52.320> basically<00:01:52.560> got<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.100> collect

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
a spy and you've basically got a collect

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.810 
a spy and you've basically got a collect
launch<00:01:54.180> codes<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:55.020> stop<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.770> launch<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.399> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
missile the first thing that grabbed me

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.450 
missile the first thing that grabbed me
when<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.079> played<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.530> game<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> look<00:02:02.310> of

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
when I played this game is the look of

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.609 
when I played this game is the look of
it<00:02:02.579> looks<00:02:03.079> fantastic<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.110> by<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.530> don't

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
it looks fantastic and by that I don't

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.709 
it looks fantastic and by that I don't
mean<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.100> looks<00:02:05.729> realistic<00:02:06.180> or<00:02:06.509> anything

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
mean it's looks realistic or anything

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.889 
mean it's looks realistic or anything
it's<00:02:06.960> purposely<00:02:07.500> made<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.550> look<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.599> way<00:02:09.629> it

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
it's purposely made to look the way it

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.920 
it's purposely made to look the way it
looks<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:11.030> love<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.150> when<00:02:12.239> games<00:02:12.450> do<00:02:12.750> that

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
looks and I I love it when games do that

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.580 
looks and I I love it when games do that
when<00:02:13.110> they

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
when they

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.410 
when they
try<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.010> make<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.580> bit<00:02:14.730> edgier<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:15.209> bit

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
try to make it a bit edgier a bit

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.330 
try to make it a bit edgier a bit
different<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:16.380> game<00:02:16.590> certainly<00:02:16.920> does<00:02:17.310> that

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
different this game certainly does that

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.480 
different this game certainly does that
very<00:02:17.880> well<00:02:18.120> indeed<00:02:18.500> looks<00:02:19.500> very<00:02:19.860> very<00:02:20.130> cool

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
very well indeed looks very very cool

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.640 
very well indeed looks very very cool
very<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.540> bright<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.580> very<00:02:23.580> sharp<00:02:24.000> as<00:02:24.330> well<00:02:24.650> so

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
very so bright and very sharp as well so

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.230 
very so bright and very sharp as well so
I<00:02:25.680> think<00:02:25.800> pretty<00:02:26.220> much<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.490> idea<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.120> do

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
I think pretty much the idea is to do

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.090 
I think pretty much the idea is to do
nearly<00:02:27.540> every<00:02:27.990> level<00:02:28.200> as<00:02:28.530> stealthy<00:02:29.069> as

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
nearly every level as stealthy as

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.720 
nearly every level as stealthy as
possible<00:02:29.700> obviously<00:02:30.350> I've<00:02:31.350> not<00:02:32.069> been<00:02:32.250> able<00:02:32.550> to

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
possible obviously I've not been able to

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.150 
possible obviously I've not been able to
do<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.270> because<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.989> does<00:02:34.739> get<00:02:34.980> quite

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
do that because it does get quite

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.000 
do that because it does get quite
difficult<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.300> even<00:02:37.020> this<00:02:37.380> level<00:02:37.709> it's<00:02:37.860> only

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
difficult and even this level it's only

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.340 
difficult and even this level it's only
level<00:02:38.310> 4<00:02:38.430> what<00:02:38.940> I'm<00:02:39.090> showing<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.450> now<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:40.080> I

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
level 4 what I'm showing you now and I

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.820 
level 4 what I'm showing you now and I
do<00:02:40.650> actually<00:02:40.860> die<00:02:41.250> quite<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.790> few<00:02:42.060> times<00:02:42.360> on<00:02:42.569> it

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
do actually die quite a few times on it

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.320 
do actually die quite a few times on it
and<00:02:43.830> as<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.069> can<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:44.459> in<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.819> middle<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
and as you can see in the middle of the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.720 
and as you can see in the middle of the
top<00:02:45.540> screen<00:02:45.870> there's<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.440> number<00:02:46.709> one<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.610> is

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
top screen there's a number one that is

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.120 
top screen there's a number one that is
like<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.120> DEFCON<00:02:48.630> level<00:02:51.170> basically<00:02:52.170> when

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
like the DEFCON level basically when

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.150 
like the DEFCON level basically when
that<00:02:53.310> gets<00:02:53.580> down<00:02:54.090> past<00:02:54.570> one<00:02:54.840> you've<00:02:55.470> got<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.769> run

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
that gets down past one you've got a run

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.860 
that gets down past one you've got a run
to<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.519> launch<00:02:56.730> site<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.150> stop<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.660> launch

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
to the launch site and stop the launch

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.090 
to the launch site and stop the launch
of<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.140> missile<00:02:58.260> because<00:02:58.650> that's<00:02:58.950> what

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
of the missile because that's what

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.259 
of the missile because that's what
they're<00:02:59.220> gonna<00:02:59.280> do<00:02:59.580> they<00:02:59.760> know<00:02:59.910> you're<00:03:00.090> there

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
they're gonna do they know you're there

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.590 
they're gonna do they know you're there
and<00:03:00.540> they're<00:03:01.200> going<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.680> basically<00:03:02.600> launch

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
and they're going to basically launch

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.570 
and they're going to basically launch
the<00:03:03.870> missile<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.739> that's<00:03:05.040> what<00:03:05.220> you're<00:03:05.370> there

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
the missile and that's what you're there

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.259 
the missile and that's what you're there
to<00:03:05.790> stop<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:07.550> basically<00:03:08.550> yeah<00:03:08.880> if<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.120> gets

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
to stop so basically yeah if it gets

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.670 
to stop so basically yeah if it gets
past<00:03:09.420> one<00:03:09.660> that's<00:03:09.959> what<00:03:10.140> you've<00:03:10.260> got<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.530> do

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
past one that's what you've got to do

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.160 
past one that's what you've got to do
but<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.430> idea<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:11.850> not<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.209> get<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.870> far

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
but the idea is not to get it that far

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.949 
but the idea is not to get it that far
you<00:03:13.459> can<00:03:14.459> also<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:15.420> can<00:03:15.450> lower<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.380> by<00:03:17.250> um<00:03:17.959> say

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
you can also you can lower it by um say

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.550 
you can also you can lower it by um say
if<00:03:19.140> you've<00:03:19.320> got<00:03:19.590> one<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.250> guards<00:03:20.670> like<00:03:21.090> the

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
if you've got one of the guards like the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.530 
if you've got one of the guards like the
officers<00:03:22.560> in<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:23.070> white<00:03:23.280> if<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:24.030> hold<00:03:24.360> them

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
officers in the white if you hold them

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.710 
officers in the white if you hold them
at<00:03:24.660> gunpoint<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:25.709> will<00:03:25.860> slowly<00:03:26.160> drop<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.180> DEF

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
at gunpoint it will slowly drop the DEF

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.319 
at gunpoint it will slowly drop the DEF
CON<00:03:27.959> right<00:03:28.610> it<00:03:29.610> gives<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:29.970> bit<00:03:30.120> more<00:03:30.150> time

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
CON right it gives you a bit more time

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.210 
CON right it gives you a bit more time
and<00:03:30.810> stuff<00:03:31.019> like<00:03:31.110> that<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.500> collect<00:03:31.769> all<00:03:31.980> the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
and stuff like that to collect all the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.420 
and stuff like that to collect all the
the<00:03:33.209> plans<00:03:33.480> for<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.930> launch<00:03:34.680> codes<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.280> stuff

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
the plans for the launch codes and stuff

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.699 
the plans for the launch codes and stuff
like<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:36.630> although<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:37.170> does<00:03:37.380> look

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
like that so although it does look

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.789 
like that so although it does look
pretty<00:03:38.090> basic<00:03:39.090> side-scrolling<00:03:40.049> game<00:03:40.410> there

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
pretty basic side-scrolling game there

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.750 
pretty basic side-scrolling game there
is<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:40.980> lot<00:03:41.519> it's<00:03:42.380> quite<00:03:43.380> complicated<00:03:43.859> it's<00:03:44.430> not

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
is a lot it's quite complicated it's not

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.819 
is a lot it's quite complicated it's not
over<00:03:45.510> complicated<00:03:46.200> for<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.440> little<00:03:46.650> mobile

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
over complicated for a little mobile

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.060 
over complicated for a little mobile
game<00:03:47.310> but<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.260> complicated<00:03:49.260> enough<00:03:49.620> to

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
game but it is complicated enough to

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.060 
game but it is complicated enough to
keep<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.459> gripped<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.900> game<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.410> think

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
keep you gripped to the game and I think

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.750 
keep you gripped to the game and I think
this<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.400> really<00:03:54.329> really<00:03:54.600> good<00:03:54.930> game

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
this is a really really good game

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.240 
this is a really really good game
certainly<00:03:56.760> got<00:03:56.910> me<00:03:58.010> twiddling<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.130> old

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
certainly got me twiddling the old

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.560 
certainly got me twiddling the old
phones<00:03:59.519> every<00:03:59.850> now<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.090> again<00:04:00.120> anyway

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
phones every now and again anyway

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.849 
phones every now and again anyway
getting<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.590> uh<00:04:02.299> personally<00:04:03.299> I<00:04:03.329> think<00:04:03.859> it's

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
getting and uh personally I think it's

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.130 
getting and uh personally I think it's
definitely<00:04:05.549> worth<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:05.940> $2.99<00:04:06.690> that<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.900> paid

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
definitely worth the $2.99 that I paid

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.280 
definitely worth the $2.99 that I paid
for<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.410> I'm<00:04:07.530> not<00:04:07.709> sure<00:04:07.769> how<00:04:08.190> much<00:04:08.400> is<00:04:08.670> on

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
for it I'm not sure how much is on

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.420 
for it I'm not sure how much is on
PlayStation<00:04:10.290> Store<00:04:10.410> if<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:10.890> can<00:04:11.010> buy<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.250> on

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
PlayStation Store if you can buy it on

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.060 
PlayStation Store if you can buy it on
that<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:11.880> haven't<00:04:12.390> even<00:04:12.480> got<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.690> clue<00:04:12.989> but<00:04:13.200> for

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
that and haven't even got a clue but for

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.660 
that and haven't even got a clue but for
$2.99

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
$2.99

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.900 
$2.99
so<00:04:15.450> far<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:16.019> don't<00:04:16.799> think<00:04:17.039> that<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.310> can<00:04:17.459> go<00:04:17.669> far

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
so far I don't think that you can go far

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.529 
so far I don't think that you can go far

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
opinion if they are worth the money that

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.429 
opinion if they are worth the money that
they're<00:04:33.060> they're<00:04:34.060> charging<00:04:34.539> for<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.810> or<00:04:35.110> if

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:35.439 
they're they're charging for it or if

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.429 
they're they're charging for it or if
it's<00:04:36.129> worth<00:04:36.310> waiting<00:04:36.610> because<00:04:36.969> usually<00:04:37.439> you

00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:38.439 
it's worth waiting because usually you

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:40.649 
it's worth waiting because usually you
wait<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.889> few<00:04:39.159> weeks<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:39.729> they<00:04:40.029> will<00:04:40.240> drop<00:04:40.479> in

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
wait a few weeks and they will drop in

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.559 
wait a few weeks and they will drop in
price<00:04:40.900> so<00:04:41.740> I'll<00:04:42.639> sort<00:04:42.969> of<00:04:42.999> be<00:04:43.090> doing<00:04:43.330> that<00:04:43.449> as
