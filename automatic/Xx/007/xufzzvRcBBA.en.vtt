00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.450
 hello video about what question 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.210
 moped sanin battery when pressed 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.600
 buttons on the starter ie floor lamp 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.180
 a little bit trying to twist and 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:28.189
 battery goes to zero and ships moment 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:32.250
 maybe created moment tied in half 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.759
 since the starter is already crumpled show 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.759
 poser 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:48.680
 poser to describe in this way 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:51.590
 that is, but instead of running a brush 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.770
 absolutely give birth and 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:59.699
 court temsa 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:04.860
 hairstyles work in raf solution 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.299
 Cost is not visible as it is at all 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.619
 you can all in grease 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.909
 and she and here and scored on this 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:19.080
 moment with will we wash the whole thing and 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:21.180
 and we can check it later 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.110
 ringing but i think that there is a problem 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:34.970
 only in this holiness 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:46.880
 these pre-contact it after washing 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:50.549
 It turns so that's a little bit after washing as well 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.360
 Between now I can advise 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.960
 it is not necessary for someone but between these 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.360
 contacts can be from the bottle with the usual 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.110
 two-liter there ulta you cut this 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.960
 striped she is what is the thickness of which 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.390
 there quietly appeared and pulls out 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.330
 from there the garbage in this 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.560
 in this case, the lubricant is taught a little bit 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:23.720
 I will show you how it will be 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:27.110
 look further there is a niche rotor base 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.110
 looks after processing 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.470
 two and a half grit sandpaper 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.480
 Thousands I mean, let's try it now. 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:45.780
 bring to perfect shine but everyone is like 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:50.060
 does this thing look after him and 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:55.430
 purely that and fat glasses as they say in 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.430
 principle is it possible not need to call 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:10.260
 Now we will listen to her all we blow and 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:16.370
 I will try to try the nickname 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:19.370
 we rang out we called contacts 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.370
 fine 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:30.640
 the game is if someone arises 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.650
 difficulty installing routers 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.330
 to its seat that is not 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.480
 it will be seen but that's where the brushes go them 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.990
 set install on and its place 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.610
 insert pieces 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:48.740
 rocker on the seat and these are 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:54.110
 stripes can vary bottles from 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:58.030
 Angie put them between the brushes and the oval 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:03.410
 router and quietly 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:08.840
 push the pins onto your boarding 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:12.520
 place to sleep brushes and principle but in 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.520
 for a minute this can be done easily 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.720
 but strata
