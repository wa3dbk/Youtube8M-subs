00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 st love at the club 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:12.440
 hello to all and serge cariou 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.599
 found for a quite different web 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.810
 usually already six months originating in 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.100
 plus a fashion sniper my first death 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.190
 in this case there are quite a few people who 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.270
 asked their hymn to flavors 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.470
 so here's brown calls for garlic 50 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.940
 by the way if I frankly this weapon 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.620
 on pc in any case I do not know so sure 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.809
 when it's good but I like it 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.190
 I played a lot with what husband 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.390
 that the quicks at worst well in 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.780
 well there you will not see too much because 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.879
 that it's a pure web safe when at 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.559
 speak a little bit of soup but there is 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.719
 a guy who had given this challenge it's a 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.629
 coop juvisy pure camp mode ie 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.579
 he scared me when from 10 meters 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.260
 squares on 10 mk maro and you go 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.699
 see on this site she had to camp in 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.199
 the house which lives inrocks 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.850
 you will see essien is really a fashion 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.989
 pure body tangled general I you 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.460
 advise to camp to make months 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.229
 already it's hard enough to do this fashion 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.719
 hot it's only because I 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:05.089
 galley sniper and not happy with you 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.340
 will tell me that's the end of the gameplay 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.689
 but spent should have told him it's me 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.350
 it's not a bad mood but me 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.060
 my mp 9 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.750
 because yes indeed I have twelve 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.579
 that he was going to carry 9 and 12 kilos 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.259
 so I 'm going to consider it anyway 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.090
 like a goose bosnia scared because 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.869
 it's the kindergarten class touax is there 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.979
 since the person the people but 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.719
 it's a fashion it's not because 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.189
 this is the fear battle class I 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.329
 not picked up a weapon on the ground or something 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.430
 like that good I had some kills 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.700
 sweet that half of the keys with the mt 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.020
 9 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.100
 okay but it's better than I can 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.570
 to do frankly is to fear will follow 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.850
 between no one so propose a gameplay 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.400
 age sniper is trying to kill hens 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.020
 besides, but here you are going to see 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.210
 I count in this house a maximum 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.310
 you take out your portable radars and very 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.200
 useful of air because he will save me I 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.700
 am going to kill kind I believe three or four 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.630
 different people in the not part 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.790
 I would have killed both of them 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.930
 my opponents at because I do not know 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.040
 it's the same who came back to him he is 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.240
 income but I 'm not that once 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.370
 it was he who made me less cold 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.990
 finally it was a challenge in the area 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.360
 Subscribers a pure fashion like this is small 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.700
 pure mode as for snipers 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.930
 I'm a little harder is getting a name 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.700
 hitchhiker and I will never get to 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.840
 to do with me or that's why I think 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.459
 that there and only if I have to make a 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.209
 mob the sun inspector 50 of what he 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.650
 is really not bad 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.790
 but anyway it's not the one I 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.470
 I wanted to talk to you about something 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.780
 who is it's living alone 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.290
 that moment we are currently living 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.760
 this is where I come to the jo where 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.550
 all the dishes and in my sink 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.940
 not done and that's the moment I have to 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.680
 do the dishes so a fucking 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.270
 by the way, but here are those moments I 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.830
 have to do the dishes and I kind 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.280
 place and a pan and all that to 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.780
 the avc really relook so when I 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.070
 started when I wanted to sleep alone and 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.620
 where I had a great desire to live 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.470
 alone and I knew that I was going to have 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.050
 have to do the dishes of the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.870

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:44.390

 say like I meant the previous 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.229
 video I wanted to start a niche 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.090
 with a pod and with a new concept 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.220

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.180
 want to do an intro not a 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:19.460
 Temple is a real too 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:24.150
 customized and you are interested 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.660

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.720
 skype 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.770

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.400
 for both of us I do not know when 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.720
 how are we going to do it? 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.130
 still plays the chain does not have too much 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.200
 decided but we started doing some 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.729
 videos and everything and it can be pretty good 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.390
 we have a new concept of video not 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.710
 too much where I have that I stick here since not 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.630
 bad time I'm going to do on my 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.830
 chain besides the toys does one ne 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:00.120
 do not know who it looks like 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.540
 what's the name on the subject 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.450
 has since 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:08.020
 I do not know what I wanted to do 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:10.780
 do that kind of thing for a very, very, very 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.460
 very very very long time but I 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.450
 never motivation because it takes 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.440
 time to make videos like this and them 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.200
 that's why we thought we'd do 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.120
 bah saw it with Antoine will be more 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.630
 time we are two we can more 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.820
 do it down we will have we will make videos 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.370
 of a kind on battlefield 3 anyway 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.810
 for now after we'll see we'll see 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.610
 if we will do other games too but 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.170
 here we will make other games on the 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.090
 chain in laye and all that too 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.840
 maybe of the species I do not know if he has 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.790
 want to go east 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.560
 I do not like that but he 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.650
 maybe he does it and so here 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.210
 I hope that you will go see 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.520
 our warp on battlefield or whatever 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.380

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.490
 I can find how to do something 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.500
