 hours and the forecast for Monday and Tuesday 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.550

 rainfall is very small throughout the state 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.280
 of the holy spirit 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.230
 dry air makes it difficult to form 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.149
 instability guaranteed days 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.250
 sunny there is no rain forecast in 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.980

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.229
 degrees 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.720
 Let's talk about some other things now. 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.880
 capital where he revealed is also famous 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.650
 Let's start with savior where in 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.560
 Monday there is even the possibility 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.880
 rain but it's a rain a lot 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.130
 isolated and fleeting 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.250
 time remains muffled in most of the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.009
 day 31 with a maximum of 32 degrees during 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.780
 afternoon and then on Tuesday the sun is coming back 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.820
 to predominate more strongly the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.460
 thermometers even go up a bit 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.799
 maximum of 33 degrees 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.000
 already in florianópolis there is the presence of 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.009
 a cold front 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.960
 is forecast to rain on Monday 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.479
 with some improvement periods and in the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.009
 third time a little more unstable both 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.720
 is that thermometers do not go up very high 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.180
 mainly compare with the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.460
 last days in both the second and the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.430
 third time drowned yet the maximum 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.159
 should not exceed 28 degrees 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.380
 already in rio de janeiro great revealed there 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.110
 the beaches at midnight there is a chance 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.610
 pure rain while it is small but it does not 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.829
 to rule out the possibility of 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.530
 mainly during the 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.020
 late on Monday the heat of 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.209
 32 degrees but thermometers drop one 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.790
 little that in recent days we have spent 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.200
 40 then the thermometers are still 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.209
 30 but he climbed 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.489
 it really should give a 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.530
 truce because a cold front will stay 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.879
 practically parked on the state 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.910
