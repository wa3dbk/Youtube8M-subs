00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.390
 dear youtube community what should i do 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.880
 say madness madness madness 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.610
 that was a sevenfold train today 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.250
 because 17 brazil germany im 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.350
 semi-final of a world championship 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.970
 I actually miss the words but there 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.080
 we do not run out of words 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.269
 great play time has been guided 15 0 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.430
 play at the half-time of my viewing 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.380
 decided the Brazilians were fixed 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.449
 and we have a great game 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.960
 delivered one to a person 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.820
 moderate that has disappointed again today 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.520
 again did not make a good game of 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.040
 son follower he is not noticeable in the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.399
 play and yes I'm curious if jogi 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.340
 won so eventually called again 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.860
 I just do not react on sunday what 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.230
 Because he probably will 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.300
 go through with me but if we are 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.730
 jogi has become world champion 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.440
 I think that's right 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.930
 we do not need a player at all 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.940
 to highlight because I believe ten man 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.920
 have delivered a great game today 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.340
 manuel new again, of course 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.049
 sensational parades made almost everything 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.130
 held up that 70 to 71 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.380
 What should I say we are waiting for the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.229
 opponent we can get up nicely tomorrow 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.210
 lay the couch look at us argentina 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.070
 against Holland and I wish 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.630
 that we are against Holland in the final 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.830
 then we would come back 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.659
 terrific endgame 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.970
 I think Holland would be one 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.009
 are a little better like that 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.630
 argentinier but we just let us 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.299
 Let's see what tomorrow 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.650
 happens and then hear us and wait 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.150
 then of course on the special and hear 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.430
 us and see us no later than sunday 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.750
 again in the final game against Germany 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.610
 Question mark 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:54.180
 until then so dear youtube community that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.530
 tingling begins a day then still have 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.180
 we are against the semifinal germany 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.119
 Of course we are all looking forward to seeing Brazil 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.619
 on it and actually it can already today 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.280
 Let's go but unfortunately we still have to 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.540
 wait tomorrow 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.420
 Of course, there are a few words as well 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.770
 it's very difficult to lose 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.770
 hurt in the quarterfinals
