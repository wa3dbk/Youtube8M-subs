00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.160
 hello dear friends with you uranium 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.679
 83 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.059
 and today we will bake with you 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.180
 chicken in the sleeve 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.900
 and as a side dish with her young 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.930
 potatoes 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.980
 so let's get started for us 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.779
 need to wash and peel potatoes 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.330
 Iâ€™ll probably miss this process 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.399
 it is not difficult to 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.550
 potatoes better and faster failed 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.710
 it is necessary to cut the potato into 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.410
 several pieces I make about 6-8 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.559
 parts depending on size 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:53.039
 potatoes and so the potatoes are peeled 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.340
 will wash cut now we fill it 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.340
 by water 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:05.580
 to the extent that the water is closed 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:09.030
 potatoes and add a little salt well 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.080
 quite a bit now potatoes can 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.080
 stew 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:23.230
 and we will deal with chicken before 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.390
 how to send chicken to the oven and and 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.670
 is necessary 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:34.500
 we get about the package 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:42.640
 including warm water and carefully 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:45.520
 wash the cold and it's chicken 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:51.990
 from this and so after the chicken 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.990
 washed we prepare hands or 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.250
 more convenient in my opinion his option 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.250
 baking bag 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.979
 open the package our chicken 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:33.019
 and add a little bit yes yes you are right 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:35.079
 guessed a little brush and now 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:39.490
 just rub it 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:42.820
 pool accessible surface box 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.630
 after that pour chicken in principle not 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.050
 necessarily 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.950
 in the meantime, we are almost 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.310
 boiled water in potatoes and we are a little bit 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.590
 turn down the power 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.210
 after boiling potatoes can be cooked 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:08.490
 about 10 minutes but to her we still 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:14.430
 back and now we take about the caps, 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:17.980
 specially flagella close it and 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.280
 we get here such a present which 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:27.180
 we'll send in the oven and so 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:31.770
 the chicken is cooked on the usual way on 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:36.550
 180 degrees for an hour and a half 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:39.340
 depends on the size of the chicken exhibit 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.150
 right time and temperature on the timer 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.690
 and send the chicken to the oven 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:53.040
 after boiling remove some power 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.040
 and set the time about 15-20 minutes 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.600
 after this time the potatoes should be already 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.360
 ready check readiness can 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.850
 poking not and with a fork or here i am 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.880
 I use just such a stick for 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.270
 homemade kebabs 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.060
 Well, wait, and so it took 15 minutes 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.850
 and the potatoes are ready how not and we check 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.160
 poke sticks or fork any 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.950
 potatoes to if she doesn't crunch and 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.160
 wand passes easily means potato 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.500
 ready but I got a little burdock 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.570
 I've got the potato ready before 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.700
 cooking rings left for me how 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.440
 at least forty minutes therefore 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.300
 calculate the cooking time 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.360
 main course and side dishes 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.240
 so as not to eat cold potatoes 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.670
 how will i do after 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.130
 the potato was prepared it is necessary 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.620
 drain and cover with a lid so that it 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.200
 stayed warm a little longer 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.900
 and we will stop and come back when 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.990
 Chicken will be ready well, that our 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.290
 the chicken has become much more appetizing 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.330

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.580

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.180
 the only thing that do not climb there naked 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.160
