 ico with the acrylics are professionals of average viscosity of the company eureka 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.279
 like those who always accompany me with what I'm going to paint them too 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.739
 this face 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.769
 with a well-known technique to 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.409
 percent pretty much explained by mike slade pilsen dry 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.830
 then for a hundred note that yondelis a bazze 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.830
 d kept it with a few droplets 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.360
 apple never osses with that base color 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.640
 celestial informing that on the palette 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.520
 he added 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.170
 a little 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.610
 of the color shade skin unloaded in the arena in the service will be in 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.070
 clinton can start 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.490
 doing 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.910
 the shadows 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.760
 which correspond stayed 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.200
 to the judgment all this that you in which it ceases 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.900
 I started doing 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.370
 yes 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.690
 can add a little bit of this tone so well that they have been helped 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.740
 to give a more accent 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.690
 deep in the shade of year 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.920
 discarded always generates 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.710
 extra service 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.360
 and this what you see that is said of in all areas of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 shadow of this face if for 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.310
 I always tell him that what he draws in the shade 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.430
 what will mark me 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.330
 the whole new day to give lights I'm going to take 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.060
 this same color with more 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.119
 the amount simply clarified with old white 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.880
 facing the aliens lsp act 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.210
 and I'm going to start giving 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.240
 they see that a lot of paint is placed what I did I have to stop arms 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.170
 and just stretch 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.830
 this is a very quick little frame they did as analysis they should send 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.959
 this 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.329
 I go to the human person 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.310
 and color shadow skin this is if it cost me but it would have cost us 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.209
 and good already started 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.719
 they surpass the thousand efe 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.719
 I will again thank all those who attended 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.419
 is a very special person to the valenzuela de chile 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.109
 to juana 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.849
 higuaÃ­n 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.540
 to all the people of Latin America from the interior of the country 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.119
 of commodore 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:46.899
 a lot of side of students approaching to take this kind of facts 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:48.229
 I made them 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:52.229
 but who do want to hinder the placement of shadows that give you 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.329
 which is very easy 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.009
 what I'm going to show you what is 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:03.969
 the subject close up take your eyes off I'll take the poisoned with a little bit of 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:05.579
 shades 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.609
 and colors a previous spot 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.109
 to generate a sensation 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.109
 arrested then yes 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:17.910
 the eye as it is simply closed high 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.399
 delimited 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.659
 percent 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.680
 and what each eye lashes I will do well watered the same tone 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:32.459
 but well aguadito 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.989
 and see it 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.729
 do very well 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.729
 very soft 100 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.609
 after 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.609
 also with the same tone I will not do it in both eyes 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.499
 I am going to mark 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:54.159
 one could not breathe so I do not know what that aspect is 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.159
 although we do have too artificial 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:01.069
 but it is there we are generating all these shadows and the lights 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.389
 and another thing that I wanted to show you was the hair 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.579
 reed 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.689
 I did it with skin shadow 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.019
 and seeing it 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.779
 I a little bit of shadow toasted in this way 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:20.299
 at first appear sell as always has supported and throw 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.939
 Rehn looks like she was a little redhead 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:27.039
 with respect to the finished model 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.719
 prepares that I do not know aleris in 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:32.110
 when I spoke the crossing lights 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.279
 to do in each edition 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:36.840
 I did not stop so much narrated stroh because 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.840
 is something that is being done in other programs that have become 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.289
 insisting for the psc cupbearer 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.069
 I want to go back to this technique 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.069
 d hair aser 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.590
 min 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.569
 you do not need an animal brush simply overlay colors 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.210
 what gives me the feeling of volume 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:06.009
 of the hair baena and always connecting with the help of a damp paddle 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.009
 for him he wanted without those acrylics 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.589
 they are professionals 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:14.589
 and they give me the necessary time to work 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.800
 how many lies was used is good 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.919
 have this damp palette that help me stay that way and if we do not use tails 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.360
 of dust then 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.669
 directly from me 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.150
 shades 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.309
 now placed 

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:32.960
 shadow areas 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.629
 clean and brush 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:36.479
 as last years 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.659
 I'll take 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.159
 the skin color 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.789
 clear of the subway interspersed with a little shade skin 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.889
 and I'm going to give them the look as if they were the 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.529
 the claritos 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:49.110
 that has a roof 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.740
 Miguel Mena Cali Cali has already opened 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.969
 then it allows me to do everything 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:55.379
 this work 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:57.330
 and in what little time 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.149
 we are getting
