00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.719 
was released I think in wave 3 this
figure<00:01:09.060> also<00:01:09.240> got<00:01:09.540> reused<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.040> Joker

that<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.060> did<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> review<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.840> earlier<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.710> I

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
that I did a review on earlier and I

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.450 
that I did a review on earlier and I
called<00:01:14.190> him<00:01:14.520> crazy<00:01:15.360> sleeves<00:01:15.869> Joker<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:16.619> I

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
called him crazy sleeves Joker and I

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.859 
called him crazy sleeves Joker and I
thought<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> was<00:01:17.940> being<00:01:18.090> witty<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.540> everything

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
thought I was being witty and everything

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.660

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
cartoon so it's a great representation

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.160

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.770 
episode because he was moving in he was
bouncing<00:02:08.940> around<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.539> an<00:02:09.659> acrobat<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.470> and

bouncing around like an acrobat and and

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.059 
bouncing around like an acrobat and and
it<00:02:12.780> was<00:02:12.989> weird<00:02:13.230> as<00:02:13.409> well<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.769> see<00:02:13.950> and

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
it was weird as well to see and

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.559

barefooted<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.890> was<00:02:17.040> interesting

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
barefooted but it was interesting

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.670 
barefooted but it was interesting
interpretation<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.900> Joker<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.349> wouldn't

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
interpretation of the Joker I wouldn't

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.350 
interpretation of the Joker I wouldn't
say<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:19.920> was<00:02:20.099> a<00:02:20.129> bad<00:02:20.400> joke<00:02:20.730> er<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:21.000> was<00:02:21.120> just

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
say it was a bad joke er it was just

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.559 
say it was a bad joke er it was just
something<00:02:21.780> different<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:24.360> know<00:02:24.510> you

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
something different and you know you

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.539 
something different and you know you
can't<00:02:25.019> always<00:02:25.230> have<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:26.159> exact<00:02:26.519> same

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
can't always have the exact same

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.910 
can't always have the exact same
character<00:02:27.269> look<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.750> exact<00:02:28.170> same<00:02:28.409> way<00:02:28.650> all

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
character look the exact same way all

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.380 
character look the exact same way all
the<00:02:29.069> time<00:02:29.099> because<00:02:29.610> then<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.909> character<00:02:30.239> gets

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
the time because then the character gets

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.830 
the time because then the character gets
boring<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:32.280> good<00:02:33.000> example<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.569> that<00:02:33.629> is

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
boring and a good example of that is

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.960 
boring and a good example of that is
Heath<00:02:34.379> Ledger's<00:02:34.860> Joker<00:02:34.890> in<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.549> Dark<00:02:35.730> Knight

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
which was brilliantly done I mean that

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.940 
which was brilliantly done I mean that
Joker<00:02:38.569> stood<00:02:39.569> out<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.560> was<00:02:40.680> different

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
Joker stood out and it was different

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.830 
Joker stood out and it was different
from<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.400> other<00:02:41.550> Joker's<00:02:42.000> we've<00:02:42.180> seen<00:02:42.540> and

I have<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.260> applaud<00:02:44.530> them<00:02:44.769> and<00:02:45.069> I<00:02:45.340> for<00:02:46.150> the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
I have to applaud them and I for the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.630 
I have to applaud them and I for the
same<00:02:46.480> reason<00:02:47.080> why<00:02:47.319> I<00:02:47.349> wasn't<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.129> big<00:02:48.340> fan<00:02:48.610> of

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
same reason why I wasn't a big fan of

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.610 
same reason why I wasn't a big fan of
this<00:02:48.879> Joker<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:49.360> also<00:02:49.750> have<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.959> plot<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.440> for

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
this Joker I also have to plot it for

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.140 
this Joker I also have to plot it for
the<00:02:50.680> fact<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.159> was<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.430> different<00:02:51.909> Joker

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
the fact that it was a different Joker

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.220 
the fact that it was a different Joker
than<00:02:52.420> what<00:02:52.540> we<00:02:52.690> normally<00:02:52.840> see<00:02:53.519> so<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:56.110> know<00:02:56.200> I

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
than what we normally see so you know I

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.979 
than what we normally see so you know I
have<00:02:56.739> to<00:02:56.890> give<00:02:57.010> credit<00:02:57.340> for<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.750> figure

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
have to give credit for that the figure

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.390 
have to give credit for that the figure
itself<00:02:59.230> is<00:02:59.440> really<00:02:59.560> nice<00:02:59.769> too<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.069> mean<00:03:00.220> there's

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
itself is really nice too I mean there's

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.789 
itself is really nice too I mean there's
articulation<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.360> head

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
articulation in the head

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.500 
articulation in the head
there's<00:03:03.159> articulation<00:03:03.819> in<00:03:03.879> the<00:03:03.970> shoulder<00:03:04.390> as

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
there's articulation in the shoulder as

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.170 
there's articulation in the shoulder as
well<00:03:04.690> as<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.989> arm<00:03:05.280> what<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.310> thought<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.940> hand

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
well as the arm what I thought the hand

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.300 
well as the arm what I thought the hand
could<00:03:07.480> move<00:03:07.750> but<00:03:08.049> it<00:03:08.140> turns<00:03:08.409> out<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.709> can't

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
could move but it turns out it can't

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.399 
could move but it turns out it can't
there's<00:03:09.849> articulation<00:03:10.659> in<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.840> waist<00:03:11.079> as

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
there's articulation in the waist as

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.430 
there's articulation in the waist as
well<00:03:11.680> as<00:03:11.829> in<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.129> legs<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.970> knees<00:03:13.440> the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
well as in the legs and the knees the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.289 
well as in the legs and the knees the
one<00:03:14.650> drawback<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.459> figure<00:03:15.730> itself<00:03:15.849> is<00:03:16.180> the

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
one drawback to the figure itself is the

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.410 
one drawback to the figure itself is the
way<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.690> figure<00:03:16.930> is<00:03:17.049> posed<00:03:17.910> one<00:03:18.910> leg<00:03:19.180> is

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
way that the figure is posed one leg is

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.059 
way that the figure is posed one leg is
further<00:03:19.840> out<00:03:20.109> than<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.440> other<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.890> there's

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
further out than the other and there's

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.400 
further out than the other and there's
really<00:03:21.220> no<00:03:21.459> way<00:03:21.609> to<00:03:21.640> fix<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.299> as<00:03:23.170> a<00:03:23.200> result

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
really no way to fix that as a result

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.949 
really no way to fix that as a result
the<00:03:23.620> figure<00:03:23.920> itself<00:03:24.040> doesn't<00:03:24.700> stand<00:03:25.060> well<00:03:25.450> at

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
the figure itself doesn't stand well at

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.449 
the figure itself doesn't stand well at
times<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:26.650> kind<00:03:26.829> of<00:03:26.859> have<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.099> play<00:03:27.220> around

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
times you kind of have to play around

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.559 
times you kind of have to play around
with<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:27.700> legs<00:03:27.910> to<00:03:28.090> get<00:03:28.239> in<00:03:28.359> the<00:03:28.480> stand<00:03:28.750> right

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
with the legs to get in the stand right

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.970 
with the legs to get in the stand right
the<00:03:31.569> reason<00:03:31.870> why<00:03:32.079> they<00:03:32.319> call<00:03:32.560> them<00:03:32.709> hammer

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
the reason why they call them hammer

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.369 
the reason why they call them hammer
strike<00:03:33.430> Joker<00:03:33.790> was<00:03:34.569> he<00:03:34.870> came<00:03:35.109> with<00:03:35.260> this

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
strike Joker was he came with this

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.020 
strike Joker was he came with this
rather<00:03:35.590> colorful<00:03:36.930> striking<00:03:37.930> hammer<00:03:38.849> there<00:03:39.849> is

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
rather colorful striking hammer there is

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.750 
rather colorful striking hammer there is
a<00:03:40.060> hole<00:03:40.359> in<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.659> front<00:03:40.930> you'll<00:03:41.079> notice<00:03:41.140> and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
a hole in the front you'll notice and

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.130 
a hole in the front you'll notice and
the<00:03:42.760> idea<00:03:43.090> with<00:03:43.359> it<00:03:43.569> I'll<00:03:43.690> just<00:03:43.900> laying<00:03:44.079> down

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
the idea with it I'll just laying down

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.960 
the idea with it I'll just laying down
for<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.470> second<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.859> reason<00:03:45.220> for<00:03:45.459> it<00:03:45.609> is<00:03:45.760> there

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
for a second the reason for it is there

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.569 
for a second the reason for it is there
was<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.090> missile<00:03:46.569> that<00:03:47.170> matched<00:03:47.530> these<00:03:48.040> spikes

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
was a missile that matched these spikes

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.699 
was a missile that matched these spikes
and<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.419> missile<00:03:49.840> stuck<00:03:50.109> out<00:03:50.230> at<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.500> end

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
and that missile stuck out at the end

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.229 
and that missile stuck out at the end
and<00:03:51.359> to<00:03:52.359> fire<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:52.959> missile<00:03:53.669> you<00:03:54.669> look<00:03:54.940> you'll

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
and to fire that missile you look you'll

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.120 
and to fire that missile you look you'll
see<00:03:55.269> that<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:56.019> hammer<00:03:56.349> sides<00:03:56.829> actually

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
see that the the hammer sides actually

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.909 
see that the the hammer sides actually
can<00:03:57.519> go<00:03:57.700> in<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.630> idea<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.049> if<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.349> if<00:03:59.799> you

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
can go in and the idea is if you if you

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.800 
can go in and the idea is if you if you
hit<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.310> hammer<00:04:00.519> against<00:04:01.090> something<00:04:01.629> it

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
hit the hammer against something it

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.720 
hit the hammer against something it
would<00:04:01.930> trigger<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.769> fire<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.190> missile<00:04:03.400> off

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
would trigger and fire that missile off

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.819 
would trigger and fire that missile off
and<00:04:04.090> you<00:04:04.599> want<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.870> guess<00:04:05.049> what<00:04:05.349> happened<00:04:05.769> to

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
and you want to guess what happened to

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.830 
and you want to guess what happened to
this<00:04:05.980> missile<00:04:06.400> oh<00:04:06.549> yeah

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
this missile oh yeah

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.409 
this missile oh yeah
the<00:04:08.230> hammer<00:04:08.470> got<00:04:08.709> thrown<00:04:09.400> down<00:04:09.609> at<00:04:09.849> some<00:04:10.090> point

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
the hammer got thrown down at some point

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.619 
the hammer got thrown down at some point
and<00:04:10.629> that<00:04:10.690> missile<00:04:11.260> got<00:04:11.410> shot<00:04:11.829> off<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:12.629> I

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
and that missile got shot off and I

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.780 
and that missile got shot off and I
don't<00:04:14.379> know<00:04:14.590> where<00:04:14.829> it<00:04:14.919> is<00:04:15.069> it's<00:04:15.370> somewhere

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
don't know where it is it's somewhere

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.939 
don't know where it is it's somewhere
around<00:04:15.910> here<00:04:16.320> maybe<00:04:17.320> it's<00:04:17.530> in<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.709> box

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
around here maybe it's in a box

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.550 
around here maybe it's in a box
somewhere<00:04:18.190> but<00:04:18.639> the<00:04:19.539> hammer<00:04:19.720> fits<00:04:20.079> pretty

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
somewhere but the hammer fits pretty

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.620 
somewhere but the hammer fits pretty
snugly<00:04:21.160> into<00:04:21.310> his<00:04:21.519> hand<00:04:22.650> like<00:04:23.650> that<00:04:23.680> and<00:04:24.630> I

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
snugly into his hand like that and I

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.659 
snugly into his hand like that and I
would<00:04:25.870> say<00:04:26.110> even<00:04:26.139> though<00:04:26.710> you<00:04:27.280> kind<00:04:27.490> of<00:04:27.550> have

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
would say even though you kind of have

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.850 
would say even though you kind of have
to<00:04:27.789> adjust<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.389> hammer<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.110> bit<00:04:29.289> to<00:04:29.410> get<00:04:29.530> Joker

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
to adjust the hammer a bit to get Joker

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.680 
to adjust the hammer a bit to get Joker
to<00:04:29.949> stand<00:04:30.280> right<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:31.030> definitely<00:04:31.240> want<00:04:31.630> to

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
to stand right you definitely want to
