there's<00:01:50.080> no<00:01:50.319> doubt<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:50.890> wordpress<00:01:51.580> ranks

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940

well<00:01:52.149> out<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.720> box<00:01:52.990> but<00:01:53.259> that's<00:01:53.590> just

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
well out of the box but that's just

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.620 
well out of the box but that's just
because<00:01:54.009> many<00:01:54.789> of<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.030> plugins<00:01:55.479> are

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
because many of the plugins are

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.590 
because many of the plugins are
optimized<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:57.250> can<00:01:57.430> do<00:01:57.549> it<00:01:57.670> equally<00:01:58.119> well<00:01:58.329> and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
optimized you can do it equally well and

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.709 
optimized you can do it equally well and
probably<00:01:58.930> better<00:01:59.469> with<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> HTML<00:02:00.520> site<00:02:01.149> as<00:02:01.420> you

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
probably better with a HTML site as you

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.300 
probably better with a HTML site as you
have<00:02:01.869> more<00:02:02.079> control<00:02:02.259> but<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.009> will<00:02:03.100> take<00:02:03.130> a
