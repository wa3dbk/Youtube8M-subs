hard to find sometimes and the reason

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.050 
hard to find sometimes and the reason
why<00:01:33.510> is<00:01:33.570> because<00:01:33.900> years<00:01:34.650> ago<00:01:34.920> women<00:01:35.550> used<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
why is because years ago women used to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.180 
why is because years ago women used to
use<00:01:36.330> this<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.840> feed<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.260> their<00:01:37.380> infants<00:01:37.920> but

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
use this to feed to their infants but

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.750 
use this to feed to their infants but
it's<00:01:38.460> not<00:01:38.820> real<00:01:39.180> milk<00:01:39.510> it<00:01:39.720> has<00:01:39.930> oil<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.830> it<00:01:41.070> so

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
it's not real milk it has oil in it so

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.300 
it's not real milk it has oil in it so
it<00:01:42.240> was<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.690> healthy<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:44.100> type<00:01:44.280> of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
it was not healthy and not the type of

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.130 
it was not healthy and not the type of
milk<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.730> would<00:01:44.970> want<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.210> feed<00:01:45.420> your<00:01:45.600> infants

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
milk you would want to feed your infants

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.800 
milk you would want to feed your infants

40 minutes at 350 now sometimes your
edges<00:03:43.799> can<00:03:44.070> get<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.310> little<00:03:44.640> brown<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.630> what<00:03:45.870> you

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
edges can get a little brown so what you

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.930 
edges can get a little brown so what you
can<00:03:46.200> do<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.590> put<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.100> little<00:03:47.220> piece<00:03:47.519> of<00:03:47.730> foil

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
can do is put a little piece of foil

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.750 
can do is put a little piece of foil
over<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:49.350> keep<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.829> from<00:03:49.860> getting<00:03:50.459> any

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
over it to keep it from getting any

browner<00:03:51.209> around<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.900> edges<00:03:52.410> or<00:03:52.680> what<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.310> do<00:03:53.459> is

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
browner around the edges or what I do is

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.670 
browner around the edges or what I do is
have<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.060> rack<00:03:54.269> above<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:54.989> just<00:03:55.170> put<00:03:55.440> foil

have the rack above it and just put foil
on<00:03:55.950> top

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
on top

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.940 
on top
that<00:03:56.760> rat<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.510> serves<00:03:58.410> as<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.710> same

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
that rat and that serves as the same

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.520 
that rat and that serves as the same
person<00:03:58.980> same<00:03:59.790> purpose<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.510> keep<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:01.320> from

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
person same purpose to keep it from

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.440 
person same purpose to keep it from
getting<00:04:01.710> browner<00:04:02.220> around<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.850> crust<00:04:03.150> around

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
getting browner around the crust around

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.920 
getting browner around the crust around
the<00:04:03.750> edges<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:04.830> this<00:04:05.070> will<00:04:05.220> bake<00:04:05.510> like<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.570> said

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
the edges so this will bake like I said

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.990 
the edges so this will bake like I said
