 and we are back to our kitchen 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.140
 vegetarian cuisine for the soul is 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.430
 super simple I'm sure that it 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.220
 they were very surprised when 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.020
 they heard jamaica pinga when 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.000
 many times the flower of the jamaica the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.130
 we use while we go to prepare water 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.470
 and we discard the good sheet so here 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.360
 is a great utility that can give you 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.180
 The first thing I'm going to do is put a 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.659
 little oil already know my oils 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.729
 favorite peanut sesame avocado 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.009
 Exactly your favorite oils 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.740
 then we are going to add the onion 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.740
 so that it goes like this, thundering a little 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.600
 let's place the onion that goes like this 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.729
 thundering a little bit here we are going to 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.910
 can put a little salt to taste 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.940
 if we want and while this goes 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:58.690
 well thundering over medium heat what we're going 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.000
 to do is grind the preparation that 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.520
 we have here 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.520
 tomato onion and garlic with salt 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.440
 okay 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.890
 very well we are moving our 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.650
 onion to be citron is and good 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.940
 what do you think of this wonderful recipe 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.910
 here I also have some little 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.320
 remember that corn is a wonderful 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.250
 food that our 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.140
 ancestors to have a lot of energy 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.600
 suddenly people give us a lot 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.750
 afraid to eat an omelet eat us a 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.120
 sofrito but really if we eat from 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.220
 suddenly this type of food we are going to 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.560
 increase our energy even now 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.230
 we have talked about it, we can eat two 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.970
 tortillas at noon quietly that 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.180
 I'm doing right now I'm 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.400
 placing my little sockets in the oil in 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.520
 a little bit of oil we are not going to saturate 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.370
 Oil is your appetite and come 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.590
 facts already sell them successes we're going to 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.360
 place in another pan to go 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.840
 is playing a little bit in the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.870
 oil because our onion 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.930
 He took out his juice so we're going to 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.560
 add the tomato that we have here already 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.900
 previously chopped and this mixture the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:23.629
 we will keep moving very well now 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.790
 let's mix all this and 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.000
 later what we have here already 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.959
 let loose a little bit of our juice 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.500
 tomato is the chipotle the chipotle 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:40.760
 we can already get in salsita then 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.650
 we are going to put it to your liking ok 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.799
 we can put before the flower of 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.360
 jamaica or after the flower of jamaica 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.549
 the flower of jamaica will see if it smells 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.030
 The flower of Jamaica and the 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:56.180
 we have boiled and we have it with certain 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.209
 consistency remember that we should not 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.680
 overcook our our 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.129
 vegetables because they lose their properties 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.440
 it's a bit crunchy then that's how it is 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:10.290
 how it has to be and well this already 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.840
 it smells delicious we had added it 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.329
 the truth is that it is integrating 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.139
 delicious this we keep moving 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.220
 our very simple socks 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.680
 this is really going to be delicious 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.280
 what works for us this works 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.320
 for example for a way so 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.190
 wonderful ok 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.380
 Well, it's already releasing the smells. 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.970
 it smells delicious there are people who say 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.630
 well it was a little bit sour 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:43.080
 it really is not delicious going on giving 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.710
 account how color has also taken 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:50.460
 onion as well as that also thinned 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:54.570
 a little bit we're going to let go and now what 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:59.389
 it's been our juice 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:02.789
 Caldito ok so that he is also taking 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:05.070
 like more more good consistency here 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.800
 for my taste I would add a little 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.930
 more than chipotle 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.879
 then let's add a little 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.099
 more than chipotle to tie a 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:16.400
 little bit more then you will not want it 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.400
 eat 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:21.659
 well after a while we shot it among all the 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:24.989
 guys here from the studio and good 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:28.499
 our little stones like that are leaving me 

00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:30.569
 I recommend not putting too much fat 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:33.359
 ok little bit with little is more than 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.699
 enough and we are preparing our 

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:38.549
 mounting plate we are putting 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:42.479
 our little things because this is so 

00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:45.299

 to teach to clean only with water and 

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:57.509
 Many people do not know how to clean their 

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:58.829
 quartzes now yes that talking about cooking 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.739

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:08.729
 energy you have to treat them with a lot 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:11.369
