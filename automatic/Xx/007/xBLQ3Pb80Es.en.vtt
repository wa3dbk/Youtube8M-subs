00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.290 

okay<00:07:10.130> 47.7<00:07:11.130> and<00:07:11.370> actually<00:07:11.759> is<00:07:11.880> a<00:07:11.910> little<00:07:12.150> bit

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:18.710 
okay 47.7 and actually is a little bit
less<00:07:12.570> than<00:07:12.780> that<00:07:12.860> because<00:07:13.860> we<00:07:14.100> had<00:07:14.310> to<00:07:17.720> click

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 
less than that because we had to click

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.580 
less than that because we had to click
reset<00:07:19.199> or<00:07:19.560> restart<00:07:19.740> on<00:07:20.250> the<00:07:20.400> computer<00:07:21.440> i'm<00:07:22.440> do

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:22.590 
reset or restart on the computer i'm do

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.100 
reset or restart on the computer i'm do
a<00:07:22.620> quick<00:07:22.860> overrun<00:07:23.850> on<00:07:24.000> the<00:07:24.210> ports<00:07:25.050> and

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.110 
a quick overrun on the ports and

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.689 
a quick overrun on the ports and
everything<00:07:25.380> on<00:07:25.470> here<00:07:25.710> so<00:07:26.280> this<00:07:26.400> is<00:07:26.550> the

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:26.699 
everything on here so this is the

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:29.510 
everything on here so this is the
MagSafe<00:07:26.910> power<00:07:27.210> adapter<00:07:27.800> it<00:07:28.800> was<00:07:28.919> a<00:07:28.949> magnet<00:07:29.400> in

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 
MagSafe power adapter it was a magnet in

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.980 
MagSafe power adapter it was a magnet in
there<00:07:29.669> and<00:07:29.910> the<00:07:30.000> magnet<00:07:30.389> in<00:07:30.449> the<00:07:30.630> power

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990 
there and the magnet in the power

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.680 
there and the magnet in the power
adapter<00:07:31.110> so<00:07:31.889> someone<00:07:32.729> walks<00:07:32.880> by<00:07:33.120> and<00:07:33.330> trips<00:07:33.570> it

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.690 
adapter so someone walks by and trips it

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.499 
adapter so someone walks by and trips it
out<00:07:33.810> it<00:07:34.289> doesn't<00:07:34.560> mess<00:07:35.100> this<00:07:35.130> up<00:07:35.370> this<00:07:36.240> is<00:07:36.300> the
