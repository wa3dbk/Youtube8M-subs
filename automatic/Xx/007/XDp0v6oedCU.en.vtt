 which are not used by the system allowing windows 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.880
 with the fastest efficient and freeing up 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.320
 but disk space 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.840
 he also tries to bring online activities such as internet history 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.530

 this tip for you so precarious that you download the program 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.400
 since they spoke so much problem

 it will look like a vehicle with an ace 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.350
 lr will you 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.710

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.560
 how it works

 here transcript performs cleaning is quite simple problem 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:16.069
 here is written clean up of that period - the case 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.449
 that the clubs have for internet and 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:22.449
 I wanted to make choices and leisure options by definition like tequila o 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:25.449
 mayor of bad goal 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.089

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:31.109
 the author of windows 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.979
 The fragmentation of something tells me that dispatch was 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:37.609
 temporary files 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.179
 alberto soares is a dump 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.749
 Earth 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:46.309
 here for example is this very important are often is to open a 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.769
 so that these different articles and that goes to the new system 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.369
 say they gave 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:54.949
 There are little ones there 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:56.739
 he is ending 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.059
 here is what i am program programs 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:01.189

 black is doing photoshopado cleanups thrashed in all the programs of the office 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:06.449

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:11.219
 of the internet and even years before so we hope it also shared 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:11.880
 among others 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.279

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.799
 perform cleaning 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.350
 What you need is in it these liminal themes 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.589
 the files 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:34.329
 of the system for internet on site was repeated in the air 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.759
 they are the case files 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:37.889
 that you do not want 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.189
 that was a punch has no way to give our strategy 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.529
 so it was an unprecedented thing to launch the program 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:46.929
 but ours that 

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:49.929
 and still start cleaning 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.789
 I did not play the whole time. 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:58.789

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.440
 one of them inclusive and empties 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.400
 however, the legal practitioner was leaving everything right to the 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.609
 mill that generates billions 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.609

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.059
 sedur system success 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:04.749
 37 7 million - and beginner to the contrary customers 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:10.520

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.009
 you can hire 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.370
 among them are being seen with software program 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.279
 certainly here 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:57.799
 there are pressures here of this decisive action also shrunk together 

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:00.230
 I'm passing through here too. 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.300
 the 26 ° c system

 Many people use doctor suresh program very easy 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:10.889
 of harassing with them may be few and there are people that the Olympiad 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:13.889
 but for that there is more pleasure that 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:15.889
 while you could 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.139
 they are the problem 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.599
 but it is very simple sulpice toothpicks to ocde 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.279
