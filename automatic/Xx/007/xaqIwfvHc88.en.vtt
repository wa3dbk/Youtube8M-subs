00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:06.829
 summoners invoked trice welcome into 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.230
 episode 2 of the guide to start well at 

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:10.759
 League of Legends 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.799
 in this issue we will talk about 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.259
 different types of role champion 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.600
 and finally equipped compositions 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.670
 when you start a game you 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.500
 must choose who will be your champion 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.340
 each champions have one or 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.470
 multiple roles 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.480
 the easiest way to have a team 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.080
 balanced is to remember this 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.500
 little sentence 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.850
 to each his role try to choose a 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.070
 character who will have a function 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.880
 different from the other chosen champions 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.490
 by your team 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.250
 for that you need to know a little about 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.590
 different types of champion there are two 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.560
 big champion families zapping them 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.260
 or empowers epower who will do damage 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.390
 magic and abilities of the 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.579
 magicians who are essentially 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.540
 physical damage 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.100
 how to know which family 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.649
 belongs to your favorite champion 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.530
 well it's simple every champion 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.009
 has five skills one skill 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.659
 passive beyond your control 

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:09.109
 three basic skills activable 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.719
 thanks to the keys to z and them we on 

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:13.969
 English keyboards is a skill 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:15.759
 ultimate often more powerful but there 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.259
 as cool demand superior to others 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.859
 looking at the description of his 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.810
 skills 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.270
 you will see a number between 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.639
 parentheses and in color this number 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.959
 will be orange and the skill at a ratio 

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:33.529
 to d and green if his ratio is snapped up a 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:35.600
 ratio 3 what is the ratio is 

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:37.719
 the proportion of the damage of the spell by 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.369
 to your appetite your ad 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:43.459
 let's admit that my champion and 100 in 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.219
 power if the spell indicates a number 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.840
 towards 100 that indicates that my 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.420
 ratio for this spell is 1 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.679
 in summary for a power point 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.719
 winning my spell gains a point of damage 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.090
 if a champion at a majority of ratios 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.679
 based on the power it is that he 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.439
 ranks in the family of champions 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.939
 ap in these two families you will 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.909
 find different categories of 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.259
 champion the caries that are often the 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.780
 more fragile but can reverse 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.580
 the course of a party 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.440
 the supports that are present for 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.510
 help their team they often possess 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.700
 healing care spells or 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.950
 control the control being the fact of 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.800
 ability to slow down or immobilize one or 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.630
 several targets the tanks that can 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.580
 suffer a significant amount of damage 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.290
 without dying they are however less 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.380
 effective when dealing with inflicted 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.470
 and less resistant tanks than the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.459
 tanks but a customer more damage 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.610
 among all these categories 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.560
 you will find two types of champions 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.959
 champions to mana and champions 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.600
 without mana most champions 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.340
 use mana to cast spells on 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.160
 mana goes back slowly but allows 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.060
 cast a number of spells 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.430
 some champions do not need it 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.050
 use something else 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.120
 this is particularly the case for ninjas like 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.700
 at cali or chain that use of 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.590
 energy energy goes up fast enough 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.510
 but limit the use of spells 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.580
 in a short time 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.850
 others like renÃ© kt moreover in amr 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.800
 use the fury he starts with a 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.810
 empty gauge that fills up as you go 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.140
 as the champion hits him 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.910
 granting various effects certain 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.340
 others still use nothing at all 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.930
 this is the case of katharina or even 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.280
 warren 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.910
 let's come to the point now 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.880
 important the composition of your team 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.380
 remind everyone of his role 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.340
 if one of your allies takes to carry ad 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.530
 like h 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.140
 avoid taking a champion of the same 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.000
 type such as Sylvie Rouquette line 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.530
 you will ask me why and I will 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.810
 will simply answer that carry ad 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.790
 have to arm themselves a lot to hope 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.250
 make the difference 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.320
 if there are two carry ad the farm will have to 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.170
 to be shared and it will take you more 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.060
 of time to be effective for 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.079
 beginners take example on the teams 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.980
 of two players boots to the top 1 omid and 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.519
 two to the boots 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.010
 the eight being very often a curry ap and 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.980
 the botlane composed of the carry ad and its 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.799
 support the top as for him is often 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.870
 composed of tanks or of tanks or 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.609
 characters having theft of life such as 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.900
 warwick 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.400
 when you have made several matches 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.299
 you will realize the importance 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.949
 of a jungler 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.069
 but we'll see that in the next 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:27.940
 episode a team would compose so 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:31.509
 a solo top of a gendler of an ap mid 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.919
 of a carry ad and a support is not 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.680
 the only team diagram but that's the 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.919
 more profitable according to the community the 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.539
 other schemes are called meta when 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.360
 you finish the different elements of the 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:46.930
 tutorial you have a sum of countries where 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.190
 point of influence around 450 this 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.919
 which will allow you to buy your 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.690
 first champion so I'm going to you 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.430
 give a typical team only 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.099
 composed of four hundred champions 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.110
 fifty countries 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:02.409
 let's start with the center line 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.780
 among the champions at 450.1 ni or rail 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.759
 will perfectly do it these are 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.099
 two carry ap each possessing the 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:12.159
 control and can inflicted a lot 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:15.460
 damage in the bottom line in the role of 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:17.229
 carry ad h or if they saw the 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.960
 both have great potential in terms of 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.599
 physical damage to accompany the 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.090
 carry ad you will need a very strong support 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.130
 important the support does not farm they 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.039
 leave everything and I mean all the 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.050
 farm at his quarter there are he wins from 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:35.169
 gold only thanks to gold items 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.449
 and to the soraka audience and a 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.060
 support par excellence it can heal 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.560
 make dumas did not use a spell of 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.020
 silence to prevent enemies from 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.029
 cast spells and has an ultimate 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.129
 able to heal all the allies 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:50.050
 no matter where they are on the 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:53.259
 card thus giving you some audience 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:56.050
 to approach the naked enemies and they 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:58.240
 can also play this role no one 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.129
 not care for his allies but little accelerated 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.680
 their movement and speed of attachment 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:05.560
 it can also slow down enemies for 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.139
 offer as soon as he has his curry case she 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.419
 can slow down his enemies heal a 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:12.340
 ally and make it invulnerable during 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:16.719
 few seconds what can prove 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.940
 very useful for the top line is 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:20.740
 a very good character he owns 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.169
 a lot of life does a lot of damage 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.550
 and his liabilities allows him to regenerate 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.180
 health what makes him a 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:30.460
 appreciated character even at high level 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.440
 poppy can she also play this role she 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.080
 a lot of life 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.610
 control and an ultimate that allows for 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.490
 receive only one damage 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:42.600
 enemy my typical team for beginners get 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:45.690
 would dial so dany omid dash and will know 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.390
 than at the boots and warren and popi at 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.580
 top for those who know the 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.590
 subtleties related to the jungle I 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.640
 will remove hip hop pop to place a 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.030
 metroid or topless zhang time 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.670
 it was nev 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.230
 this number is now over and I 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.920
 so give you an appointment at the next 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.030
 episode 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.030
 ciao everyone
