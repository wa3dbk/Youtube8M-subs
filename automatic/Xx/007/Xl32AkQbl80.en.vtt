 Wednesday the day of the apps with this 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.170
 week in the program the last nugget 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.820
 from microsoft an app to get 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.410
 scare another to make funny 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.060
 encounters and then of course the game of the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.460
 week that we owe today to 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.900
 titouan go I do not tell you more 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.550
 between are immediately in the heart of 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.550
 about the generic podium lorient 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.450
 share your photos not your smart 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.860
 phone 7 to microsoft that we owe this 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.110
 nice slogan that is one of his new 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.329
 application exim a free app for 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.920
 windows phone android and iphone which 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.540
 as its name suggests you 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.270
 so lets share the photos of 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.340
 your smartphone with whom with your friends 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.649
 of course still a sharing API of 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.180
 photos well yes except that with sim you 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.190
 will be able to share real 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.320
 slideshow or photo streams as would say 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.820
 apple by picking your shots in your 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.160
 mobile or in your space of 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.109
 storage online or in drive or 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.329
 your dropbox space your account 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.830
 facebook or instagram is the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.510
 particularity of these slideshows is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.070
 that they are not frozen at any time 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.900
 you will be able to enrich them with 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.270
 new photos and invite new ones 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.920
 friends also enjoy each 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.210
 of them then could go from 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.280
 his little comment 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.869
 another benefit of xing compared to 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.000
 other apps is that when you 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.080
 share photos with your friends only 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.540
 are not required to have them installed 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.100
 also grimm on their smartphone 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.900
 Moreover, the consultation of 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.340
 slideshows not done in the app 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.930
 but in the browser the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.909
 recipients of photos receiving by 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.140
 mail or by SMS the link allowing them 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.820
 to access it 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.829
 this is simple it was necessary 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.840
 think and plus it's free and that 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.790
 walk on all smartphones thank you 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.960
 microsoft I can only commit you to 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.960
 try it on your turn 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.610
 she's been here she'll iron 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.380
 by that but who is it 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.270
 I'll do it again she made herself 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.800
 to eject dupes the google store the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.720
 here on the apple app store 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.600
 no you do not see well I want 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.650
 talk about 10 connect but what is it 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.119
 simply disconnect an app that 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.800
 will allow you to see how much 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.420
 you are spying on apps 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.300
 and the sites that you use on your 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.729
 smartphone launched the app choose 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.590
 one of your usual apps or sites 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.430
 and so look at the number of tracker 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.020
 they contain 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.720
 knowing that these are there for 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.220
 retrieve information about you so 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.170
 among other things you better targeted with 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.150
 pubs but also observe the number 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.980
 unsecured connection established by 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.840
 these apps and site which therefore risks to 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.430
 any time to be exploited by 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.870
 hackers who them if they recover from 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.610
 info on you will not use it 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.000
 to send you advertising I make you 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.130
 a drawing 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.810
 good it's not about becoming 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.430
 paranoid but still 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.660
 discotheques is not just for 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.420
 to be wrong since this application 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.940
 also offers you for 5 dollars 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.989
 per month or $ 50 a year from you 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.060
 provide a vpn 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.160
 in other words to hide the ip address of 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.019
 your smartphone to anonymize all 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.790
 your connections and your searches with 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.130
 google you can even then 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.930
 use it on your pc or mac 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.340
 and since google wants more on his 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.829
 store know that you can everything from 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.140
 even download it directly to the 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.730
 ctt disk site to try so 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.739
 to give yourself some sweat 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.630
 cold as much as it costs nothing 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.450
 to be scared since disconnect is 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.450
 so free on android and iphone 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.220
 good I will not do it on purpose when 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.659
 I prepared this fantasy and the third 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.040
 at small of the week how exactly 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.379
 by 1 3 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.569
 no really not done on purpose actually this 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.030
 which especially caught my attention 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.579
 the concept for the least original if I 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.769
 then say of this winder map app 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.870
 forgive my pronunciation is neither more 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.709
 no less than a cinder the famous app 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.870
 to meet people 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.209
 quickly except that this is about 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.500
 meet at 3 but yes you 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.329
 have understood me well when 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.829
 you sign up on greenzer you 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.790
 must first indicate if you are alone 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.040
 or as a couple 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.629
 then indicate your gender your age 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.670
 same thing for your eventual 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.620
 partner choose a photo of you that 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.900
 everyone can naturally see 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.010
 choose it well and then well as 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.930
 on hour teen you're going to do 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.790
 scroll through the photos of others registered to 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.739
 proximity to indicate each time this 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.030
 you like it or not and you 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.590
 will only have to hope that others 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.450
 hour swing members cracks for 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.790
 your profile in a mutual interest 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.260
 otherwise it does not work you can 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.209
 then start the conversation you set 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.220
 an appointment and the rest is watching you 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.389
 a final detail still it 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.280
 winter which is a free application 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.470
 is currently available only on 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.210
 iphone but she should not be long in 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.919
 arrive on android and besides if 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.660
 you do not want to miss it you can 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.250
 go to the site of the apli and 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.919
 leave your email to be notified of 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.449
 its availability in this playsport 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.550
 for this winder the curiosity of the 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.150
 week to download without further ado 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.150
 or not 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.530
 at the time undermined the little game of the 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.280
 week that we have to this week to 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.220
 titouan ratibi bodin on twitter thank you 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.539
 titouan his name age geometry without 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.830
 principles at first glance that's all 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.600
 simple you just have to control the 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.070
 jumps of a small cube launched at any 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.150
 speed right in front of him in order to avoid 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.460
 the obstacles to which he is in 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.229
 go for it and for that it you 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.850
 just tap on your screen 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.289
 smartphone but knowing that as soon as you 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.419
 hold your finger on your cube 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.960
 then skip the jumps one after 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.419
 others 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.860
 a cl no and well in fact not at all and 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.479
 yet on the seven levels that 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.270
 proposes the game the first is supposed to be 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.199
 just very easy but not you 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.610
 you have to go back to 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.650
 many times to come to avoid a 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.780
 maximum of obstacles and to stall as well 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.070
 the highest score possible because no 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.630
 only age geometry will do 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.410
 work your reflexes but also your 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.000
 memory 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.440
 it's by dint of starting over several 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.849
 same level times that you will arrive 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.130
 anticipate the obstacles that will 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:31.229
 present to you and chain the good 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.599
 choreography of jump if I can say 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.099
 you doubt it so try geometry 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.870
 of age which in its lite version is so 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:40.050
 stuffed pub is free and available 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.330
 on windows phone android and iphone to 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.260
 know the version without pub route she a 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.060
 just under 2 euros 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.770
 that's it for this week and 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.419
 I will find you naturally with 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.560
