00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.279
 with the mini freezer save working time 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.529
 keep a clean environment 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.599
 while producing cold at will 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.599
 throughout the session 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.170
 the experiment of the tp of freezing is possible in pairs 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.589
 First lindsay students fill up with refrigerant lantin with water 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.589
 demineralized 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.810
 the other master student at the power supply turned on 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.260
 the student who will indicate the time with the stopwatch will activate the agitator 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.730
 the other student our 'purchase' raised the corresponding temperature 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.450
 the temperature of the refrigerated enclosure has decreased rapidly 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.200
 the mini freezer allow students to pick up and note more 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.200
 frequently many temperature points 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.760
 after a minute and a half the temperature stabilizes too 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.760
 around 0 degrees 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.100
 at the time of the zero-degree stage students can only observe the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.100
 solidification of water 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.980
 the class formed bloch the movement of the agitator 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.980
 it must be removed 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.880
 at the end of three minutes antic the bearing to zero degrees 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.880
 the temperature following again 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.630
 students continue to pick up points of temptation 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 the ice formed is then perfectly visible 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.669
 the mini freezer allows to reach the minimum temperatures of about 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.669
 -17 degrees 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:23.669
 to extract the ice cube 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:27.489
 turn off the power and wait a few seconds as the speaker 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.489
 come back to room temperature 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.930
 once the tp has finished the students trace the temperature cut to 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.260
 from the points of time and temperatures recorded during the 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:44.259
 handling 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:49.559
 so do not hesitate 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:52.059
 to detect simplified freezing 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.269
 contact us 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.199
