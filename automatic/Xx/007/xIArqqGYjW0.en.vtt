that's where we keep the beat styles
using<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:02.860> nut<00:01:03.040> driver<00:01:03.370> I'll<00:01:03.700> remove<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.180> two

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
using the nut driver I'll remove the two

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:12.390 
using the nut driver I'll remove the two
panel<00:01:04.659> screws<00:01:10.230> to<00:01:11.230> show<00:01:11.500> how<00:01:11.680> I<00:01:11.710> tested<00:01:12.280> the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
panel screws to show how I tested the

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.430 
panel screws to show how I tested the
heater<00:01:12.580> element<00:01:13.120> I<00:01:13.240> will<00:01:13.600> remove<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.230> heater

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
heater element I will remove the heater

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.350 
heater element I will remove the heater
housing<00:01:14.620> from<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.310> dryer<00:01:17.790> when<00:01:18.790> a<00:01:18.850> circuit<00:01:19.270> is

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
housing from the dryer when a circuit is

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.050 
housing from the dryer when a circuit is
being<00:01:19.630> tested<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.260> the<00:01:20.470> meter<00:01:20.650> displays<00:01:21.220> OAL

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
being tested and the meter displays OAL

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.480 
being tested and the meter displays OAL
indicating<00:01:22.810> over-limit<00:01:23.350> or<00:01:23.650> input<00:01:24.310> out<00:01:24.460> a

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
indicating over-limit or input out a

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.940 
indicating over-limit or input out a
range<00:01:24.820> this<00:01:25.720> means<00:01:25.990> that<00:01:26.229> a<00:01:26.290> circuit<00:01:26.770> being

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
range this means that a circuit being

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.930 
range this means that a circuit being
tested<00:01:27.400> is<00:01:27.610> open<00:01:27.970> a<00:01:29.070> good<00:01:30.070> heating<00:01:30.460> element

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
tested is open a good heating element

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.280 
tested is open a good heating element
will<00:01:31.120> measure<00:01:31.299> about<00:01:31.750> 10<00:01:32.080> ohms<00:01:32.290> resistance

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
will measure about 10 ohms resistance

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.570 
will measure about 10 ohms resistance
here<00:01:35.290> I<00:01:35.320> measure<00:01:35.650> across<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.250> heating

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
here I measure across the heating

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.660 
here I measure across the heating
element<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.150> it<00:01:37.450> reads<00:01:37.690> a<00:01:37.960> well<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:39.400> means

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
element and it reads a well that means

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.820 
element and it reads a well that means
it<00:01:39.940> is<00:01:39.970> bad<00:01:40.330> or<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:40.750> could<00:01:40.900> say<00:01:41.110> out<00:01:41.320> of<00:01:41.650> luck

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
it is bad or you could say out of luck

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.219 
it is bad or you could say out of luck
in<00:01:42.010> this<00:01:42.130> case<00:01:42.400> I<00:01:42.760> will<00:01:43.240> measure<00:01:43.570> across<00:01:43.930> the

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
in this case I will measure across the

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.490 
in this case I will measure across the
high-limit<00:01:44.619> thermostat<00:01:44.799> and<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:46.000> is<00:01:46.150> good<00:01:46.500> now

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
high-limit thermostat and it is good now

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.200 
high-limit thermostat and it is good now
I<00:01:47.530> will<00:01:47.920> measure<00:01:48.100> across<00:01:48.430> the<00:01:48.820> high-limit

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
I will measure across the high-limit

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.649 
I will measure across the high-limit
thermal<00:01:49.750> fuse<00:01:50.049> and<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:50.860> is<00:01:51.040> good<00:01:51.390> ok<00:01:52.390> the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
thermal fuse and it is good ok the

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.750 
thermal fuse and it is good ok the
heating<00:01:52.990> element<00:01:53.440> is<00:01:53.560> defective<00:01:54.190> so<00:01:54.580> let's

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
heating element is defective so let's

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.630 
heating element is defective so let's
remove<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.530> before<00:01:56.530> disconnecting<00:01:57.010> any<00:01:57.369> wires

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
remove it before disconnecting any wires

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.219 
remove it before disconnecting any wires
I<00:01:57.970> will<00:01:58.180> snap<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.450> picture<00:01:58.810> with<00:01:59.080> them<00:01:59.170> a

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
I will snap a picture with them a

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.500 
I will snap a picture with them a
smartphone<00:01:59.650> because<00:02:00.250> a<00:02:00.280> picture<00:02:00.970> is<00:02:01.150> better

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
smartphone because a picture is better

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.310 
smartphone because a picture is better
than<00:02:01.780> my<00:02:01.960> memory

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
than my memory

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.500 
than my memory
you<00:02:03.890> can<00:02:04.040> replace<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.610> heating<00:02:04.820> element<00:02:05.300> from

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
you can replace the heating element from

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.390 
you can replace the heating element from
here<00:02:05.840> but<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:06.140> will<00:02:06.350> take<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.740> out<00:02:06.830> again<00:02:07.010> just

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
here but I will take it out again just

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.969 
here but I will take it out again just
to<00:02:07.580> show<00:02:07.610> you<00:02:07.850> how<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.060> test<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.570> circuit<00:02:08.960> if<00:02:09.200> the

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
to show you how to test a circuit if the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.420 
to show you how to test a circuit if the
meter<00:02:10.160> reads<00:02:10.460> oal<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.330> circuit<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:11.900> open<00:02:12.430> here

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
meter reads oal the circuit is open here

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.040 
meter reads oal the circuit is open here
I<00:02:13.459> measure<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.030> heating<00:02:14.330> element<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:14.959> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
I measure the heating element and the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
I measure the heating element and the
element<00:02:15.770> is<00:02:16.190> bad<00:02:17.200> here<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.230> measure<00:02:18.530> across<00:02:18.800> the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
element is bad here I measure across the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.590 
element is bad here I measure across the
high<00:02:19.250> limit<00:02:19.490> thermostat<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.690> checks<00:02:21.020> good

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
high limit thermostat and it checks good

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.940 
high limit thermostat and it checks good
now<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.630> measure<00:02:23.959> across<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.530> high<00:02:24.709> limit

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
now a measure across the high limit

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.070 
now a measure across the high limit
thermal<00:02:25.400> fuse<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.330> checks<00:02:26.600> good<00:02:29.080> one

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
thermal fuse and it checks good one

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.690 
thermal fuse and it checks good one
other<00:02:30.320> check<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.560> like<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.980> make<00:02:31.160> is<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.520> measure

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
other check I like to make is to measure

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.699 
other check I like to make is to measure

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
if the heating element is grounded and

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.970 
if the heating element is grounded and
it<00:02:33.980> checks<00:02:34.250> good<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:36.290> remove<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.709> heating

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
it checks good to remove the heating

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.190 
it checks good to remove the heating
