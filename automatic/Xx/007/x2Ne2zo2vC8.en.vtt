once you charge your batteries the card
let's<00:01:18.450> see<00:01:18.630> put<00:01:18.840> them<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.939> then<00:01:21.200> that

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
let's see put them in this and then that

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.719 
let's see put them in this and then that
way<00:01:22.320> you're<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:23.600> taking<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:25.310> any<00:01:26.310> power

way you're not taking a any power

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.590 
way you're not taking a any power
drepung<00:01:27.270> from<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> cordless<00:01:28.009> into<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
drepung from the cordless into the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.240 
drepung from the cordless into the
batteries<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.780> Nexus<00:01:31.320> 7<00:01:31.530> tablet<00:01:32.100> which

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
batteries of the Nexus 7 tablet which

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.030 
batteries of the Nexus 7 tablet which
would<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.780> somewhat<00:01:33.780> dangerous<00:01:33.960> because<00:01:34.470> you

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
would be somewhat dangerous because you

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.660 
would be somewhat dangerous because you
can<00:01:35.220> actually<00:01:36.320> over<00:01:37.320> voltage<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.250> batteries

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
can actually over voltage the batteries

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.300 
can actually over voltage the batteries
and<00:01:39.079> potentially<00:01:40.079> bring<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> electronics

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and potentially bring the electronics

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.120 
and potentially bring the electronics
and<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.729> Nexus<00:01:42.119> tablet<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.590> idea<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and the Nexus tablet so the idea is to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.190 
and the Nexus tablet so the idea is to
do<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> series<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.240> steps<00:01:45.600> batteries

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
do it in a series of steps batteries

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.060 
do it in a series of steps batteries
into<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:48.090> then<00:01:48.240> they're<00:01:48.420> there<00:01:49.070> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
into this and then they're there and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.590 
into this and then they're there and
then<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.810> plug<00:01:52.079> your<00:01:52.310> bed<00:01:53.310> extender<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
then you plug your bed extender and the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.580 
then you plug your bed extender and the
tablet<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.930> show<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.440> actually

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
tablet and the show that I actually

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.070 
tablet and the show that I actually
generate<00:01:59.190> power<00:01:59.490> with<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.909> thing<00:01:59.970> I<00:02:00.360> hooked

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
generate power with this thing I hooked

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.200 
generate power with this thing I hooked
up<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.440> small<00:02:01.650> DC<00:02:02.250> motor<00:02:02.520> through<00:02:02.970> cooked

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
leads to the naval battery club back

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:18.710 
leads to the naval battery club back
here<00:02:16.790> there<00:02:17.790> are<00:02:17.940> three<00:02:18.240> Phillips<00:02:18.660> screws

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
here there are three Phillips screws

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.690 
here there are three Phillips screws
holding<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.620> casing<00:02:20.070> together<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.610> then

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
holding this casing together and then

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.230 
holding this casing together and then
they<00:02:20.880> have<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> clip<00:02:22.200> on<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.760> gear<00:02:23.760> head<00:02:23.970> motor

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
they have a clip on the gear head motor

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.850 
they have a clip on the gear head motor
housing<00:02:24.740> go<00:02:25.740> ahead<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.010> remove<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:30.860> pull

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
housing go ahead and remove that pull

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:40.309 
housing go ahead and remove that pull
these<00:02:32.040> out

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.050 

the<00:02:41.319> better<00:02:41.500> idea<00:02:41.800> had<00:02:41.920> probably<00:02:42.220> be<00:02:42.849> to

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
the better idea had probably be to

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.150 
the better idea had probably be to
solder<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.660> 9-volt<00:02:44.560> battery<00:02:44.950> Club<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:46.300> motor

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
solder the 9-volt battery Club the motor

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.750 
solder the 9-volt battery Club the motor
leads<00:02:48.160> here<00:02:49.890> instead<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:50.950> what<00:02:51.190> I've<00:02:51.370> done

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
leads here instead of what I've done

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.330 
leads here instead of what I've done
which<00:02:52.030> was<00:02:52.209> right<00:02:52.599> to<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.900> battery<00:02:53.260> pack

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340

dump a charge from one battery pack to

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.610 
dump a charge from one battery pack to
another<00:03:04.840> without<00:03:05.680> any<00:03:05.880> resistant<00:03:06.880> below<00:03:07.060> and

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
another without any resistant below and

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.839 
another without any resistant below and
the<00:03:08.620> amount<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:08.950> current<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.340> flows<00:03:09.549> is

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
the amount of current that flows is

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:10.470 
the amount of current that flows is
pretty<00:03:10.120> heavy

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
pretty heavy

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.509 
pretty heavy
and<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:10.959> both<00:03:11.110> battery<00:03:11.500> packs<00:03:11.769> will<00:03:11.980> heat<00:03:12.430> up

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
and so both battery packs will heat up

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.670 
and so both battery packs will heat up
quite<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.819> bit<00:03:13.090> which<00:03:13.510> is<00:03:13.690> not<00:03:14.470> really<00:03:14.650> that

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
quite a bit which is not really that

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.699 
quite a bit which is not really that
safe<00:03:15.099> so<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.840> might<00:03:16.959> want<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.200> skip<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.650> and

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
safe so you might want to skip that and

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.960 
safe so you might want to skip that and
what<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.040> did<00:03:18.340> here<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:19.030> just<00:03:19.360> go<00:03:19.690> right<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.870> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
what I did here and just go right to the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.610 
what I did here and just go right to the
skip<00:03:21.970> this<00:03:22.209> onboard<00:03:22.930> battery<00:03:23.349> pack

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
skip this onboard battery pack

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.400 
skip this onboard battery pack
altogether<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.459> just<00:03:24.519> clip<00:03:25.269> your<00:03:25.569> 9-volt

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
altogether and just clip your 9-volt

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.020 
altogether and just clip your 9-volt
battery<00:03:26.769> leads<00:03:26.920> right<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.340> back<00:03:27.730> of<00:03:27.910> this

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
battery leads right to the back of this

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:37.679 
battery leads right to the back of this
motor

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.689 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.000 

so<00:03:38.689> go<00:03:38.840> ahead<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.080> put<00:03:39.349> the<00:03:39.439> two<00:03:39.590> halves<00:03:39.860> of

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
so go ahead and put the two halves of

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.160 
so go ahead and put the two halves of
the<00:03:40.069> cordless<00:03:40.879> screwdriver<00:03:41.450> housing<00:03:41.989> back

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
the cordless screwdriver housing back

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.110 
the cordless screwdriver housing back
together<00:03:42.409> and<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:43.129> battery<00:03:43.489> pack<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:44.000> the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
together and the battery pack and the

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.660 
together and the battery pack and the
switch<00:03:44.689> assembly<00:03:45.099> doesn't<00:03:46.099> really<00:03:46.250> need<00:03:46.459> it

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
switch assembly doesn't really need it

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.080 
switch assembly doesn't really need it
to<00:03:47.590> hold<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.739> assembly<00:03:49.310> together<00:03:49.489> so<00:03:49.970> I'll

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
to hold the assembly together so I'll

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.319 
to hold the assembly together so I'll
just<00:03:50.269> skip<00:03:50.420> putting<00:03:50.900> this<00:03:51.019> into<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:52.329> pulping

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
just skip putting this into the pulping

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.569 
just skip putting this into the pulping
altogether<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.769> I'll<00:03:54.890> just<00:03:55.099> feed<00:03:55.280> my<00:03:55.430> way

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
altogether and I'll just feed my way

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.710 
altogether and I'll just feed my way
right<00:03:55.849> out<00:03:55.879> to<00:03:56.090> where<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.629> switch<00:03:57.290> used<00:03:57.560> to<00:03:57.739> be

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
right out to where the switch used to be

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:06.059 
right out to where the switch used to be
and<00:03:59.890> go<00:04:00.890> ahead<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:01.159> attach<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:04.329> gear<00:04:05.329> housing

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
and go ahead and attach the gear housing

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.380 
and go ahead and attach the gear housing
so<00:04:07.069> I'll<00:04:07.129> go<00:04:07.220> ahead<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:07.519> turn<00:04:07.640> my<00:04:07.700> hand<00:04:07.879> crank

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
so I'll go ahead and turn my hand crank

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.970 
so I'll go ahead and turn my hand crank
here<00:04:08.569> and<00:04:08.720> see<00:04:08.870> how<00:04:08.930> much<00:04:09.109> multi<00:04:09.530> to<00:04:09.650> actually

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
here and see how much multi to actually

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.210 
here and see how much multi to actually
get<00:04:10.099> out<00:04:10.220> of<00:04:10.370> my<00:04:10.489> cordless<00:04:14.319> so<00:04:15.319> I'm<00:04:15.409> turning

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
get out of my cordless so I'm turning

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.920 
get out of my cordless so I'm turning
that<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.400> pretty<00:04:16.789> reasonable<00:04:16.970> our<00:04:17.329> Fiona<00:04:17.750> looks

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
that a pretty reasonable our Fiona looks

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.810 
that a pretty reasonable our Fiona looks
like<00:04:18.139> I<00:04:18.410> can<00:04:18.889> get<00:04:19.010> probably<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.400> little<00:04:19.519> over

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
like I can get probably a little over

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:28.119 
like I can get probably a little over
two<00:04:20.000> balls<00:04:20.239> pretty<00:04:20.660> easily

00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:28.129 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:30.140 

usually<00:04:29.129> while<00:04:29.310> you're<00:04:29.520> charging<00:04:30.000> voltage

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
usually while you're charging voltage

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.170 
usually while you're charging voltage
slightly<00:04:30.840> over<00:04:31.110> your<00:04:31.139> battery<00:04:31.650> voltage<00:04:32.180> so

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
slightly over your battery voltage so

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.850 
slightly over your battery voltage so
I'd<00:04:33.449> have<00:04:33.599> to<00:04:33.659> probably<00:04:34.169> turn<00:04:34.379> this<00:04:34.409> at<00:04:34.800> a

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
I'd have to probably turn this at a

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.189 
I'd have to probably turn this at a
pretty<00:04:35.129> good<00:04:35.220> rate<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.669> maintain<00:04:36.300> something<00:04:37.050> a

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
pretty good rate to maintain something a

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.499 
pretty good rate to maintain something a
little<00:04:37.409> over<00:04:37.590> two<00:04:37.830> point<00:04:38.009> four<00:04:38.340> volts<00:04:38.789> these

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
little over two point four volts these

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.689 
little over two point four volts these
nickel<00:04:39.930> metal<00:04:40.500> hydride<00:04:40.650> batteries<00:04:41.370> are<00:04:41.520> ready

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
nickel metal hydride batteries are ready

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.809 
nickel metal hydride batteries are ready
to<00:04:41.849> at<00:04:41.909> one<00:04:42.060> point<00:04:42.389> two<00:04:42.539> volts<00:04:42.569> each<00:04:43.460> or<00:04:44.460> I

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
to at one point two volts each or I

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.480 
to at one point two volts each or I
could<00:04:45.389> also<00:04:45.479> just<00:04:46.439> do<00:04:46.590> one<00:04:46.770> battery<00:04:47.129> at<00:04:47.219> a<00:04:47.310> time

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
could also just do one battery at a time

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.879 
could also just do one battery at a time
and<00:04:47.699> make<00:04:47.849> up<00:04:48.000> basically<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:48.990> blank<00:04:49.259> battery<00:04:49.740> to

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
and make up basically a blank battery to

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.159 
and make up basically a blank battery to
complete<00:04:50.879> the<00:04:51.030> circuit<00:04:51.449> here<00:04:51.569> basically<00:04:52.139> I

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
complete the circuit here basically I

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.050 
complete the circuit here basically I
just<00:04:52.349> cut<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.590> bolt<00:04:52.860> off<00:04:53.069> that<00:04:53.310> fits<00:04:53.729> in<00:04:53.939> the

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
just cut a bolt off that fits in the

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.779 
just cut a bolt off that fits in the
battery<00:04:54.990> pack<00:04:55.020> here<00:04:58.159> so<00:04:59.159> after<00:04:59.460> a<00:04:59.490> little

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
battery pack here so after a little

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.850 
battery pack here so after a little
experimentation<00:05:00.479> that<00:05:00.750> decided<00:05:01.379> to<00:05:01.469> use<00:05:01.620> my

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
experimentation that decided to use my

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.149 
experimentation that decided to use my
dummy<00:05:02.849> battery<00:05:03.330> here<00:05:03.599> it's<00:05:04.500> easier<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.979> turn

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
dummy battery here it's easier to turn

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.459 
dummy battery here it's easier to turn
this<00:05:05.370> hand<00:05:05.610> crank<00:05:05.909> it<00:05:06.060> gets<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.479> force<00:05:07.139> of<00:05:07.349> one

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
this hand crank it gets the force of one

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:09.170 
this hand crank it gets the force of one
battery<00:05:07.889> because<00:05:08.370> they<00:05:08.520> essentially<00:05:08.909> have<00:05:09.090> to

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
battery because they essentially have to

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.159 
battery because they essentially have to
go<00:05:09.330> in<00:05:10.039> opposite<00:05:11.039> direction<00:05:11.550> of<00:05:12.180> rotation<00:05:12.900> to

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
go in opposite direction of rotation to

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.299 
go in opposite direction of rotation to
charge

00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:17.309 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:19.399 

so<00:05:17.789> I<00:05:17.849> mean<00:05:18.029> you<00:05:18.149> charged<00:05:18.569> all<00:05:18.809> four<00:05:19.049> batteries

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
so I mean you charged all four batteries

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:20.869 
so I mean you charged all four batteries
you<00:05:19.589> can<00:05:19.709> go<00:05:19.859> ahead<00:05:19.949> and<00:05:20.039> transfer<00:05:20.489> them<00:05:20.819> into

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:20.879 
you can go ahead and transfer them into

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:23.749 
you can go ahead and transfer them into
your<00:05:21.409> auxiliary<00:05:22.409> battery<00:05:22.979> pack<00:05:23.399> for<00:05:23.669> your

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
your auxiliary battery pack for your

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:34.469 
your auxiliary battery pack for your
nexus<00:05:24.239> 7
