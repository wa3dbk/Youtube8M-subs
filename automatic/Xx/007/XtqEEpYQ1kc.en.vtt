00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and get a reflect off or two so I see he

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.459 
and get a reflect off or two so I see he
has<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.730> Garchomp<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.510> immediately<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.079> go<00:00:34.290> for

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
has a Garchomp so immediately I go for

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.170 
has a Garchomp so immediately I go for
the<00:00:34.530> reflect<00:00:34.860> because<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.399> don't<00:00:35.760> really<00:00:36.000> want

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the reflect because I don't really want

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.310 
the reflect because I don't really want
to<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.300> taken<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.570> much<00:00:36.750> damage<00:00:37.140> from<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
to be taken that much damage from a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.889 
to be taken that much damage from a
guard<00:00:37.530> shop<00:00:37.770> if<00:00:37.969> not<00:00:38.969> controlled<00:00:39.270> Garchomp

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
guard shop if not controlled Garchomp

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.299 
guard shop if not controlled Garchomp
can<00:00:40.020> sweep<00:00:40.290> my<00:00:40.440> whole<00:00:40.620> team<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.040> would<00:00:41.219> be

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
can sweep my whole team so that would be

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.170 
can sweep my whole team so that would be
a<00:00:41.340> big<00:00:41.579> problem

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
a big problem

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.229 
a big problem
so<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.840> carefully<00:00:43.170> reflect<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.820> set<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.120> my

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
so I carefully reflect and I set up my

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.299 
so I carefully reflect and I set up my
stealth<00:00:45.539> frogs<00:00:45.780> here<00:00:45.930> he<00:00:46.500> has<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.680> poison<00:00:46.950> jab

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
stealth frogs here he has the poison jab

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.650 
stealth frogs here he has the poison jab
which<00:00:47.489> does<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> lot<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.300> damage<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
which does a lot of damage and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.630 
which does a lot of damage and
unfortunately<00:00:49.590> he<00:00:49.710> does<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> poison<00:00:50.370> on

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
unfortunately he does get the poison on

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.459 
unfortunately he does get the poison on
me<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.449> doesn't<00:00:51.719> really<00:00:51.809> matter<00:00:52.079> because

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
me but it doesn't really matter because

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.990 
me but it doesn't really matter because
once<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:52.949> my<00:00:53.039> stealth<00:00:53.309> rocks<00:00:53.520> are<00:00:53.670> reflect

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
once I get my stealth rocks are reflect

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.600 
once I get my stealth rocks are reflect
up<00:00:54.210> Church<00:00:54.750> which<00:00:54.930> job<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.350> basically<00:00:55.829> done<00:00:56.070> so

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
up Church which job is basically done so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.099 
up Church which job is basically done so
here<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.090> go<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.329> leech<00:00:57.539> seed<00:00:57.780> because

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
here I just go for leech seed because

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.869 
here I just go for leech seed because
why<00:00:58.410> not<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.800> need<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.250> something<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.820> my

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
why not I need to do something and my

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.010 
why not I need to do something and my
Turtwig<00:01:00.149> doesn't<00:01:00.480> really<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.809> any

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
Turtwig doesn't really have any

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.020 
Turtwig doesn't really have any
attacking<00:01:01.440> moves<00:01:01.620> his<00:01:02.039> moveset<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.579> leech

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
attacking moves his moveset is leech

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.600 
attacking moves his moveset is leech
seed<00:01:03.300> synthesis<00:01:04.080> stealth<00:01:04.769> rock<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.189> reflect

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
seed synthesis stealth rock and reflect

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.700 
seed synthesis stealth rock and reflect
so<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.180> guess<00:01:06.689> leech<00:01:06.900> seed<00:01:07.110> was<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> best<00:01:07.530> play

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
so I guess leech seed was the best play

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.810 
so I guess leech seed was the best play
I<00:01:07.740> could<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:08.010> went<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.640> got

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
I could have went for here I got

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.100 
I could have went for here I got
everything<00:01:09.030> else<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.360> needed<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> was

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
everything else I needed up and I was

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.580 
everything else I needed up and I was
good<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.290> go<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:12.030> my<00:01:12.600> church<00:01:12.840> wig<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.200> bulky

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
good to go so my church wig is so bulky

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.469 
good to go so my church wig is so bulky
because<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.130> has<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> Evo<00:01:14.729> light<00:01:14.970> which<00:01:15.270> if

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
because it has the Evo light which if

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.149 
because it has the Evo light which if
your<00:01:15.689> Pokemon<00:01:16.049> isn't<00:01:16.380> fully<00:01:16.560> evolved<00:01:17.070> it

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
your Pokemon isn't fully evolved it

so<00:01:38.520> my<00:01:38.850> froakie<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> reason<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> outspent

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
so my froakie the reason it outspent

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.359 
so my froakie the reason it outspent
that<00:01:40.200> thing<00:01:40.409> because<00:01:40.619> normally<00:01:40.920> that's<00:01:41.070> never

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that thing because normally that's never

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.670 
that thing because normally that's never
gonna<00:01:41.549> happen<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:42.060> because<00:01:42.750> its<00:01:43.110> choice<00:01:43.350> scarf

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
gonna happen is because its choice scarf

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.020 
gonna happen is because its choice scarf
and<00:01:43.890> that's<00:01:44.070> why<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.250> had<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.399> switch<00:01:44.670> out<00:01:44.820> right

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
and that's why I had to switch out right

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.639 
and that's why I had to switch out right
here<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.600> I'd<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.990> locked<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.500> ice

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
here because I'd be locked in the ice

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.350 
here because I'd be locked in the ice
beam<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.009> ice<00:01:47.280> beam<00:01:47.490> certainly<00:01:48.119> would<00:01:48.240> not

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
beam and ice beam certainly would not

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.030 
beam and ice beam certainly would not
kill<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.780> thing<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.470> did<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.770> want<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
kill that thing and I did not want to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.760 
kill that thing and I did not want to
take<00:01:50.130> an<00:01:50.280> electric<00:01:50.579> move<00:01:50.820> from<00:01:51.090> electrode<00:01:52.079> so

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
take an electric move from electrode so

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410 
take an electric move from electrode so
he<00:01:52.979> goes<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> lecture<00:01:53.610> ball<00:01:53.970> which<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.240> an

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
he goes for a lecture ball which is an

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.480 
he goes for a lecture ball which is an
interesting<00:01:54.840> move<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.619> bigger<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.009> speed

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
interesting move the bigger the speed

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.590 
interesting move the bigger the speed
difference<00:01:56.820> between<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> other

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
difference between you and the other

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.359 
difference between you and the other
Pokemon<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.229> more<00:01:58.469> damage<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.890> does<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.340> I

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
Pokemon the more damage it does so I

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.370 
Pokemon the more damage it does so I
guess<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.820> an<00:01:59.909> interesting<00:02:00.210> move<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:01.200> use

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
guess it's an interesting move to to use

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.359 
guess it's an interesting move to to use
whoopsie

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
whoopsie

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.249 
whoopsie
okay<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.149> go<00:02:03.329> for<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.540> leaf<00:02:03.719> storm<00:02:03.960> there

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
okay so I go for the leaf storm there

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.889 
okay so I go for the leaf storm there
and<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:05.399> doesn't<00:02:05.850> kill<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.240> does<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.509> lot<00:02:06.689> more

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
and it doesn't kill but does a lot more

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.570 
and it doesn't kill but does a lot more
than<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.079> thought<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.409> would<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:08.069> he<00:02:08.250> goes<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
than I thought it would so he goes for a

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.669 
than I thought it would so he goes for a
light<00:02:08.759> screen<00:02:09.090> try<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.479> lower<00:02:09.989> my<00:02:10.229> special

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
light screen try to lower my special

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.470 
light screen try to lower my special
attacks<00:02:10.979> but<00:02:11.220> that

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
attacks but that

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.360 
attacks but that
doesn't<00:02:11.690> matter<00:02:11.840> because<00:02:12.080> with<00:02:12.890> plus<00:02:13.190> two

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
doesn't matter because with plus two

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.040 
doesn't matter because with plus two
already<00:02:13.610> under<00:02:13.909> my<00:02:13.940> belts<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.720> going<00:02:14.959> to

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
already under my belts that is going to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.660 
already under my belts that is going to
do<00:02:15.140> or<00:02:15.349> think<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.680> same<00:02:15.920> mouth<00:02:16.099> damage<00:02:16.430> as<00:02:16.549> it

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
do or think the same mouth damage as it

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.640 
do or think the same mouth damage as it
would<00:02:16.790> do<00:02:16.909> before<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:17.840> he<00:02:17.930> makes<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.230> beautifly

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650

Gyarados<00:02:51.019> is<00:02:51.230> big<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.620> scary<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:52.280> Chimchar

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
Gyarados is big and scary and Chimchar

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.539 
Gyarados is big and scary and Chimchar
more<00:02:54.049> type<00:02:54.349> not<00:02:54.650> gonna<00:02:54.799> do<00:02:54.920> too<00:02:55.099> well<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:55.459> I

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
more type not gonna do too well so I

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.009 
more type not gonna do too well so I
tried<00:02:55.760> going<00:02:55.940> for<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.180> burn<00:02:56.390> here<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.930> I

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
tried going for the burn here and I

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.420 
tried going for the burn here and I
guess<00:02:57.200> he<00:02:57.349> was<00:02:57.379> predicting<00:02:57.829> me<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.010> swish<00:02:58.220> out

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
guess he was predicting me to swish out

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.550 
guess he was predicting me to swish out
so<00:02:58.609> he<00:02:58.700> went<00:02:58.940> for<00:02:59.120> an<00:02:59.239> ice<00:02:59.420> beam<00:02:59.780> which

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
so he went for an ice beam which

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.610 
so he went for an ice beam which
typically<00:03:01.190> do<00:03:01.519> that<00:03:01.700> much<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:03.230> guess<00:03:03.379> I'll

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
typically do that much so I guess I'll

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.289 
typically do that much so I guess I'll
play<00:03:03.829> on<00:03:03.859> there<00:03:04.190> because<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.579> didn't<00:03:04.940> switch<00:03:05.150> I

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
play on there because I didn't switch I

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.199 
play on there because I didn't switch I
made<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.450> weird<00:03:05.690> play<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.670> here<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.760> finally<00:03:08.090> get

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
made a weird play so here I finally get

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.180 
made a weird play so here I finally get
my<00:03:08.269> burn<00:03:08.540> off<00:03:08.720> but<00:03:09.049> he<00:03:09.260> has<00:03:09.379> dark<00:03:09.680> poles<00:03:09.980> so<00:03:10.160> I

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
my burn off but he has dark poles so I

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.440 
my burn off but he has dark poles so I
guess<00:03:10.310> he's<00:03:10.430> trying<00:03:10.519> to<00:03:10.670> be<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.760> mix<00:03:11.030> Gyarados

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
guess he's trying to be a mix Gyarados

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.759 
guess he's trying to be a mix Gyarados
on<00:03:11.660> me<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:11.840> don't<00:03:11.930> know<00:03:12.079> what's<00:03:12.319> up<00:03:12.440> with<00:03:12.470> that

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
on me I don't know what's up with that

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.339 
on me I don't know what's up with that
but<00:03:13.579> I<00:03:13.790> got<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.390> burn<00:03:14.599> off<00:03:14.780> which<00:03:14.959> is<00:03:15.079> gonna<00:03:15.260> do

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
but I got the burn off which is gonna do

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:16.900 
but I got the burn off which is gonna do
some<00:03:15.530> nice<00:03:15.650> damage<00:03:15.919> and<00:03:16.220> here<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.400> don't<00:03:16.609> have

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
some nice damage and here I don't have

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.120 
some nice damage and here I don't have
any<00:03:17.060> other<00:03:17.239> attacking<00:03:17.750> moves<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:18.109> have<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.319> fire

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
any other attacking moves I have a fire

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.620 
any other attacking moves I have a fire
punch<00:03:19.459> I<00:03:19.609> get<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> crit<00:03:20.090> there<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:20.389> doesn't

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
punch I get a crit there it doesn't

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.809 
punch I get a crit there it doesn't
really<00:03:20.720> matter<00:03:20.989> though<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.440> he<00:03:22.400> goes<00:03:22.609> for

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
really matter though and he goes for

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.370 
really matter though and he goes for
earthquake<00:03:23.299> which<00:03:23.690> he<00:03:23.930> should<00:03:24.109> have<00:03:24.200> done

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
earthquake which he should have done

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.870 
earthquake which he should have done
from<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.590> beginning<00:03:24.739> that<00:03:25.549> would<00:03:25.609> have<00:03:25.730> done

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
from the beginning that would have done

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.370 
from the beginning that would have done
a<00:03:25.910> lot<00:03:26.090> more<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:26.540> think<00:03:26.750> my<00:03:26.840> channel<00:03:27.230> would

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
a lot more and I think my channel would

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.349 
a lot more and I think my channel would
have<00:03:27.470> died<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.739> lot<00:03:28.069> sooner<00:03:28.370> if<00:03:28.669> you<00:03:28.760> kept<00:03:29.150> going

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
have died a lot sooner if you kept going

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.270 
have died a lot sooner if you kept going
for<00:03:29.480> earthquake<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.500> here<00:03:30.739> I'm<00:03:30.889> slowly

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
for earthquake so here I'm slowly

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.680 
for earthquake so here I'm slowly
bringing<00:03:31.579> this<00:03:31.730> Gyarados<00:03:32.120> down<00:03:32.329> I<00:03:32.359> didn't

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
bringing this Gyarados down I didn't

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.120 
bringing this Gyarados down I didn't
think<00:03:32.750> my<00:03:32.900> Chimchar<00:03:33.200> would<00:03:33.440> be<00:03:33.530> able<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.739> do<00:03:33.950> it

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
think my Chimchar would be able to do it

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.740 
think my Chimchar would be able to do it
Chimchar<00:03:34.370> on<00:03:34.760> my<00:03:34.910> team<00:03:35.150> kind<00:03:35.480> of<00:03:35.569> really

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
Chimchar on my team kind of really

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.110 
Chimchar on my team kind of really
doesn't<00:03:36.169> do<00:03:36.440> much<00:03:36.470> if<00:03:37.040> stealth<00:03:37.730> rocks<00:03:37.970> are

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
doesn't do much if stealth rocks are

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.330 
doesn't do much if stealth rocks are
already<00:03:38.359> up<00:03:38.510> his<00:03:39.079> main<00:03:39.349> job<00:03:39.380> is<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.220> be<00:03:40.310> a

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
already up his main job is to be a

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.550 
already up his main job is to be a
backup<00:03:40.700> incase<00:03:41.150> Turtwig<00:03:41.780> doesn't<00:03:42.410> get

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
backup incase Turtwig doesn't get

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.530 
backup incase Turtwig doesn't get
stealth<00:03:42.799> rocks<00:03:43.040> up<00:03:43.220> but<00:03:43.639> since<00:03:43.790> Turtwig<00:03:44.090> did

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
stealth rocks up but since Turtwig did

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.270 
stealth rocks up but since Turtwig did

get stealth off stealth rocks up in the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.110 
get stealth off stealth rocks up in the
beginning<00:03:46.519> of<00:03:46.639> the<00:03:46.700> battle

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
beginning of the battle

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.610 
beginning of the battle
Chimchar<00:03:47.569> was<00:03:47.930> just<00:03:48.109> kind<00:03:48.290> of<00:03:48.349> like<00:03:48.470> the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
Chimchar was just kind of like the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.990 
Chimchar was just kind of like the
useless<00:03:48.950> pokemon<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.459> would<00:03:49.579> just<00:03:49.760> send<00:03:49.880> out

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
useless pokemon that would just send out

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.479 
useless pokemon that would just send out
his<00:03:50.120> death<00:03:50.359> father<00:03:50.630> but<00:03:51.290> somehow<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:52.099> kill<00:03:52.370> the

his death father but somehow I kill the
Gyarados<00:03:52.849> with<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:53.269> hey<00:03:53.359> I'm<00:03:53.510> not

Chimchar and it has earthquake and I

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.809

guess<00:04:00.440> earthquake<00:04:00.950> yeah<00:04:01.220> that<00:04:01.639> would

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
guess earthquake yeah that would

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.550 
guess earthquake yeah that would
definitely<00:04:02.000> knock<00:04:02.359> out<00:04:02.480> a<00:04:02.510> Chimchar<00:04:02.780> 23<00:04:03.410> HP

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560

definitely knock out a Chimchar 23 HP
what<00:04:03.799> am<00:04:03.859> I<00:04:03.950> thinking<00:04:04.030> but<00:04:05.030> I<00:04:05.209> did<00:04:05.389> have<00:04:05.510> the

what am I thinking but I did have the
Evo<00:04:05.959> lights<00:04:06.200> so<00:04:06.440> my<00:04:06.590> Chimchar<00:04:06.799> was<00:04:07.129> bulky

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
Evo lights so my Chimchar was bulky

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.699 
Evo lights so my Chimchar was bulky

Torchic so basically what I'm doing here
is<00:04:15.799> just<00:04:16.699> stalling<00:04:17.299> out<00:04:17.389> some<00:04:17.720> time<00:04:17.900> getting

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
is just stalling out some time getting

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:19.930 
is just stalling out some time getting
up<00:04:18.349> some<00:04:18.560> speed<00:04:18.799> boost<00:04:19.070> and<00:04:19.370> I'm<00:04:19.489> gonna<00:04:19.640> go<00:04:19.789> for

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
up some speed boost and I'm gonna go for

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.759 
up some speed boost and I'm gonna go for
some<00:04:20.090> sword<00:04:20.329> stances<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.989> raise<00:04:21.169> my<00:04:21.349> attack<00:04:21.590> up

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
some sword stances to raise my attack up

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:22.490 
some sword stances to raise my attack up
really<00:04:22.190> high

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
really high

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.950 
really high
and<00:04:22.770> then<00:04:23.070> baton<00:04:23.370> past<00:04:23.640> add<00:04:23.850> some<00:04:24.030> Tom<00:04:24.750> passed

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
and then baton past add some Tom passed

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.780 
and then baton past add some Tom passed
that<00:04:25.110> out<00:04:25.260> to<00:04:25.380> something<00:04:25.590> else<00:04:25.860> now<00:04:26.430> I<00:04:26.460> go<00:04:26.640> for

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
that out to something else now I go for

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.430 
that out to something else now I go for
the<00:04:26.850> will<00:04:27.030> wisp<00:04:27.270> on<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.660> sceptile<00:04:28.110> because<00:04:28.380> I

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
the will wisp on the sceptile because I

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.590 
the will wisp on the sceptile because I
know<00:04:28.500> he's<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.830> physical<00:04:29.430> sceptile<00:04:29.880> because<00:04:30.510> I

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
know he's a physical sceptile because I

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.990 
know he's a physical sceptile because I
saw<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.870> earthquake<00:04:31.260> before<00:04:31.410> and<00:04:31.860> I'll<00:04:32.760> be

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
saw that earthquake before and I'll be

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.580 
saw that earthquake before and I'll be
able<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.240> get<00:04:33.360> more<00:04:33.540> sword<00:04:33.840> stances<00:04:34.230> and<00:04:34.410> stuff

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
able to get more sword stances and stuff

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.380 
able to get more sword stances and stuff
up<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:34.950> more<00:04:35.250> speed<00:04:35.550> boost<00:04:35.760> if<00:04:35.940> I<00:04:36.030> just<00:04:36.210> burn

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
up and more speed boost if I just burn

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.270 
up and more speed boost if I just burn
this<00:04:36.600> thing<00:04:36.660> so<00:04:37.350> that's<00:04:37.470> what<00:04:37.650> I<00:04:37.710> did<00:04:37.890> I<00:04:37.920> burned

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
this thing so that's what I did I burned

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.560 
this thing so that's what I did I burned
it<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:38.610> I'll<00:04:38.700> be<00:04:38.880> taking<00:04:39.120> less<00:04:39.270> damage<00:04:39.540> from

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
it so I'll be taking less damage from

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.510 
it so I'll be taking less damage from
that<00:04:39.780> earthquake<00:04:39.990> and<00:04:40.530> I<00:04:40.560> started<00:04:41.220> going<00:04:41.400> for

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
that earthquake and I started going for

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.340 
that earthquake and I started going for
my<00:04:41.610> sword<00:04:41.880> stances<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.540> speed<00:04:42.960> boost<00:04:43.170> is

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
my sword stances and speed boost is

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.410 
my sword stances and speed boost is
really<00:04:43.710> raising<00:04:43.980> my<00:04:44.040> speed<00:04:44.310> up<00:04:44.340> by<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.150> lot

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
really raising my speed up by a lot

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.140 
really raising my speed up by a lot
which<00:04:45.630> is<00:04:45.780> very<00:04:46.170> nice<00:04:46.670> so<00:04:47.670> here<00:04:47.820> I<00:04:47.880> go<00:04:48.030> for

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
which is very nice so here I go for

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.540 
which is very nice so here I go for

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
another sword stance and he goes for an

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.640 
another sword stance and he goes for an
earthquake<00:04:50.820> and<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:51.360> brings<00:04:51.570> me<00:04:51.660> down<00:04:52.020> into

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
earthquake and that brings me down into

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.310 
earthquake and that brings me down into

don't know how much speed but plenty of
speed<00:05:41.580> is<00:05:41.729> gonna<00:05:41.940> help<00:05:42.090> speed<00:05:42.300> anything<00:05:42.600> he

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
speed is gonna help speed anything he

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.600 
speed is gonna help speed anything he
sends<00:05:42.960> out<00:05:43.080> so<00:05:43.590> he<00:05:43.770> sends<00:05:43.979> out<00:05:44.130> his<00:05:44.160> swellow
