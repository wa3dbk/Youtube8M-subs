00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
short and not too girly and I think it's

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.170 
short and not too girly and I think it's
kind<00:03:35.890> of<00:03:35.950> cool<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.550> this<00:03:36.700> is<00:03:36.790> another<00:03:36.970> one<00:03:37.120> I

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
kind of cool and this is another one I

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.730 
kind of cool and this is another one I

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
prefer as a middle name I think

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.360 
prefer as a middle name I think
but<00:03:39.670> what<00:03:40.360> Eden<00:03:40.900> usually<00:03:41.230> reminds<00:03:41.470> me<00:03:41.800> of<00:03:42.040> is

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
but what Eden usually reminds me of is
