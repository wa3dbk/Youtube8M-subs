00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello I hope you're doing well 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.810
 made a moment that I could not post 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.770
 videos on the internet 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.139
 thank you in any case that your comments 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.030
 and your encouragement 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:16.080
 so in fact today it took that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.230
 I dress quite dressed 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.380
 done for an administrative reason and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.029
 So here I played the game while 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.730
 saying that I did not want to 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.599
 necessarily to put a tie or 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.300
 putting on a costume I thought this 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.960
 how to dress here to look 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.960
 still 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.020
 finally not to come to jeans sneakers 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.050
 keeping myself 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.700
 so that's the result so in fact I 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.770
 wears a navy striped shirt and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.170
 white with white collar in fact I 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.340
 made to measure 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.579
 when I left quickly did it 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.989
 a few years ago 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.149
 so that's the element itself 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.539
 drawn selected different fabrics 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.930
 spread the buttons all that in fact 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.260
 it is scratched on the whole body 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.390
 with also the bottom of the white sleeve and 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.770
 the navy blue button 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.649
 I also actually bears 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:23.700
 I have magnum and pants actually that is 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:26.219
 brown pants is actually that I have 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.130
 also done made in vietnam in 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.890
 a material is a mixture of 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.399
 one of them is so it's pretty thick 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.189
 so for the winter it's really very 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.840
 hot then I go to the foot of the sneakers 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:46.079
 adidas that you know then actually 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.209
 yes you've seen it's still pretty 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.099
 mixed up it can crack when tonight 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.280
 even because I did not necessarily 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:55.770
 want to put loafers of 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.030
 varnished shoes at the same time 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.759
 it was happening with who are black and 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.329
 so white who are quite sober ya not 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.329
 flashy colors 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:12.660
 that's it for this look actually some 91 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:15.739
 360 asked me a question about his 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.660
 want to wear a scarf in tears 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.940
 my word has in any case a scarf to 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.560
 his purposes for early spring 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.519
 so here I say to myself it's also 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.500
 the opportunity to talk about that 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.959
 today I like to come closer then in 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.340
 I do not wear today 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.139
 what would it take to try a 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.459
 scarf but it's okay we go when 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:40.980
 even doing it then actually I had some 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.639
 scarves while length form 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.680
 of bands and then I told myself that 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.109
 maybe it was a square scarf 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.690
 that might be what you 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:56.970
 had because most of you 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.870
 had in his in his cupboards then 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.870
 first way 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.760
 I spent nine years I am grouping 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:12.330
 behind so still not too much 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:16.320
 tight so that's pretty loose sorry 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:23.190
 so then i can take sahel m to 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:27.830
 inside or again there what 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.420
 I wear it is not ideal with a sweater 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.550
 a light sweater for spring is done 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.380
 really much prettier there I go 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.570
 just today because I wanted 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.850
 to the same time but it does work 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.830
 not at all with a strong impact so 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.110
 you just put the sludge underneath 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.060
 so in fact it does not have to be 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.670
 too close to the shot otherwise it's not 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.020
 it's less pretty 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:04:00.510
 another variant is to take these two 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:04:02.660
 iron tips a man with i'm going 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.660
 arrive 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.660
 the approach a bit to look ahead 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:19.690
 the book control screen 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:26.250
 this is so do not put in the center 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:28.750
 because it's all m but it's done 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.190
 spikes it's good it does not smell too much 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.560
 too big between man it's not very 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.130
 pretty 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:42.970
 here and if not I propose you a 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:45.490
 third way that is to take 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.850
 your scarf to put the tip in 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.850
 done inside 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.690
 and then fold in order to arrive 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:06.210
 to this band there I will go through 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.560
 behind I 'm going to do a little there you 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:16.800
 have seen it tends to do like that 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:20.240
 you just have to make sure that his 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.240
 point down 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:35.120
 something like that then you 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:39.780
 leave you out where you input them 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:43.710
 for having me that little thing that 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.060
 stay good there in fact my collar it is done 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.280
 tailor-made which he is very close to 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.190
 so it does not work at all but 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:54.300
 good too bad it still leaves 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:57.450
 so that's listening and I hope it 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:03.810
 serve you to I hope that answered 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:06.240
 at your request from which 91 360 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.830
 in any case good viewing and do not hesitate 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.610
 not to give me your comments 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.500
 you always know that I take 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.720
 account I'm trying to answer you to
