well this is Joanna for the verge and
this<00:00:03.030> is<00:00:03.149> Susie's<00:00:03.750> eat<00:00:03.929> pad<00:00:04.259> transformer

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
this is Susie's eat pad transformer

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.710 
this is Susie's eat pad transformer
prime<00:00:05.460> which<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.759> one<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.150> most<00:00:06.299> exciting

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
prime which is one of the most exciting

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.900 
prime which is one of the most exciting
tablets<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.529> hit<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:07.859> holiday<00:00:08.280> season<00:00:08.309> and

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
tablets to hit this holiday season and

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.370 
tablets to hit this holiday season and
that's<00:00:09.330> because<00:00:09.510> it's<00:00:09.780> got<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.960> brand-new

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
that's because it's got a brand-new

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.440 
that's because it's got a brand-new
design<00:00:10.860> but<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.160> also<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.639> first<00:00:11.820> tablet<00:00:12.300> to

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
design but is also the first tablet to

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.650 
design but is also the first tablet to
have<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.599> quad-core<00:00:12.990> Tegra<00:00:13.980> 3<00:00:14.009> processor<00:00:14.660> so

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
have a quad-core Tegra 3 processor so

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.689 
have a quad-core Tegra 3 processor so
the<00:00:15.780> transformer<00:00:16.350> prime<00:00:16.619> actually<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> lot

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
the transformer prime actually is a lot

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.700 
the transformer prime actually is a lot
like<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.180> original<00:00:18.660> transformer<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.590> it

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
like the original transformer in that it

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.590 
like the original transformer in that it
has<00:00:19.740> an<00:00:20.039> external<00:00:20.609> keyboard<00:00:20.820> dock<00:00:21.300> which

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
has an external keyboard dock which

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.689 
has an external keyboard dock which
turns<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.080> into<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.350> laptop<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:23.010> sorts<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.460> sous

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
turns it into a laptop of sorts a sous

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.400 
turns it into a laptop of sorts a sous
has<00:00:23.850> done<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.000> really<00:00:24.210> nice<00:00:24.420> job<00:00:24.480> redesigning

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
has done a really nice job redesigning

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.019 
has done a really nice job redesigning
the<00:00:25.619> entire<00:00:26.010> tablet<00:00:26.609> they've<00:00:26.789> not<00:00:27.000> only

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the entire tablet they've not only

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.880 
the entire tablet they've not only
slimmed<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.869> down<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:28.260> they've<00:00:28.380> also<00:00:28.560> created

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
slimmed it down but they've also created

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.400 
slimmed it down but they've also created
sort<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> nicer<00:00:30.119> look<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.510> feel<00:00:30.810> here<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
sort of a nicer look and feel here the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.139 
sort of a nicer look and feel here the
back<00:00:31.560> now<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.949> made<00:00:32.130> out<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.309> aluminum<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.059> has

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
back now is made out of aluminum and has

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.360 
back now is made out of aluminum and has
a<00:00:33.180> concentric<00:00:33.840> circle<00:00:34.380> pattern<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.250> a

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
a concentric circle pattern just like a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.520 
a concentric circle pattern just like a
seuss's<00:00:35.820> ultrabook<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:36.630> top<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.320> they've

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
seuss's ultrabook on top of that they've

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.530 
seuss's ultrabook on top of that they've
actually<00:00:37.710> added<00:00:37.950> an<00:00:38.280> eight<00:00:38.520> megapixel<00:00:38.700> camera

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
actually added an eight megapixel camera

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.119 
actually added an eight megapixel camera
to<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.660> back<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.440> actually<00:00:40.649> takes<00:00:40.980> some<00:00:41.100> of

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
to the back it actually takes some of

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.010 
to the back it actually takes some of
the<00:00:41.219> best<00:00:41.460> shots<00:00:41.670> I've<00:00:41.850> seen<00:00:42.120> yet<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> tablet

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the best shots I've seen yet on a tablet

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.720 
the best shots I've seen yet on a tablet
and<00:00:43.170> that's<00:00:43.320> not<00:00:43.500> exactly<00:00:43.770> saying<00:00:44.280> much<00:00:44.489> but

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and that's not exactly saying much but

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.310 
and that's not exactly saying much but
the<00:00:44.850> pictures<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.450> do<00:00:45.719> come<00:00:45.899> out<00:00:46.079> quite

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the pictures really do come out quite

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.959 
the pictures really do come out quite
clear<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:47.010> my<00:00:47.129> favorite<00:00:47.489> new<00:00:47.579> thing<00:00:47.789> about

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
clear but my favorite new thing about

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.639 
clear but my favorite new thing about
the<00:00:48.120> design<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.629> tablet<00:00:49.110> itself<00:00:49.200> is

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the design of the tablet itself is

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.580 
the design of the tablet itself is
actually<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.190> 10.1<00:00:51.090> super<00:00:51.660> IPS<00:00:51.809> plus

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
actually it's 10.1 super IPS plus

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.770 
actually it's 10.1 super IPS plus
display<00:00:53.160> not<00:00:53.820> only<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.300> more<00:00:54.600> readable

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
display not only is it more readable

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.590 
display not only is it more readable
outdoors<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:56.100> inside<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.940> viewing<00:00:57.270> angles

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
outdoors but inside the viewing angles

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.389 
outdoors but inside the viewing angles
are<00:00:57.750> great<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:58.920> really<00:00:59.039> bright

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
are great and it is really really bright

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.310 
are great and it is really really bright
and<00:00:59.640> crisp<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.449> course<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.840> standout

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and crisp but of course the standout

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.260 
and crisp but of course the standout
speck<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.949> transformer<00:01:02.550> prime<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.059> its

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
speck of the transformer prime is its

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.899 
speck of the transformer prime is its
Tegra<00:01:03.600> 3<00:01:03.809> quad-core<00:01:04.460> processor<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
Tegra 3 quad-core processor this is the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.640 
Tegra 3 quad-core processor this is the
first<00:01:06.210> tablet<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.049> processor

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
first tablet to have this processor

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.740 
first tablet to have this processor
which<00:01:07.860> promises<00:01:08.369> three<00:01:08.729> times<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.330> graphics

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
which promises three times the graphics

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.750 
which promises three times the graphics
performance<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> Tegra<00:01:10.950> 2<00:01:10.979> processor

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
performance of the Tegra 2 processor

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.370 
performance of the Tegra 2 processor
overall<00:01:12.299> I've<00:01:12.420> found<00:01:12.600> performance<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.260> be

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
overall I've found performance to be

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.929 
overall I've found performance to be
pretty<00:01:13.710> snappy<00:01:14.040> you'll<00:01:14.369> see<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.670> menu

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
pretty snappy you'll see that menu

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.210 
pretty snappy you'll see that menu
transitions<00:01:15.720> are<00:01:15.900> really<00:01:16.229> fast<00:01:16.560> however

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
transitions are really fast however

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.560 
transitions are really fast however
other<00:01:17.400> things<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.909> browser<00:01:18.210> performance

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
other things like browser performance

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.630 
other things like browser performance
doesn't<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.500> seem<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.009> be<00:01:20.100> all<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.460> much

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
doesn't really seem to be all that much

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.460 
doesn't really seem to be all that much
better<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.450> with<00:01:21.630> gaming<00:01:22.049> though<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
better it's with gaming though that the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.469 
better it's with gaming though that the
performance<00:01:22.830> increase<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.610> really<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.150> seen

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
performance increase can really be seen

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.820 
performance increase can really be seen
there<00:01:24.750> are<00:01:24.840> some<00:01:25.049> new<00:01:25.200> games<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.740> been

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
there are some new games that have been

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.950 
there are some new games that have been
optimized<00:01:26.340> for<00:01:26.490> tegra<00:01:26.820> 3<00:01:27.330> including
