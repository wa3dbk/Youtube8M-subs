00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
into the race I know you're thinking

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.670 
into the race I know you're thinking
okay<00:02:17.610> here's<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.300> here's<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.720> marker<00:02:19.080> I've<00:02:19.530> gone

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
okay here's a here's a marker I've gone

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.290 
okay here's a here's a marker I've gone
over<00:02:19.740> this<00:02:20.100> course<00:02:20.340> before<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.730> know<00:02:20.850> exactly

where<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:21.750> gonna<00:02:21.870> finish<00:02:22.310> temptation<00:02:23.310> is

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
where it's gonna finish temptation is

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.970 
where it's gonna finish temptation is
just<00:02:23.459> just<00:02:23.820> two<00:02:23.970> sprints<00:02:24.540> all<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.930> way<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.320> hey

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
just just two sprints all the way in hey

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.520 
just just two sprints all the way in hey
you<00:02:26.670> can<00:02:26.820> do<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.209> do<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.600> but<00:02:27.870> if<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.140> start

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
you can do that do it but if you start

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.170 
you can do that do it but if you start
out<00:02:28.620> at<00:02:28.770> two<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.100> half<00:02:29.220> miles<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:29.940> lose

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
out at two and a half miles and you lose

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.380 
out at two and a half miles and you lose
all<00:02:30.420> your<00:02:30.450> speed<00:02:30.840> at<00:02:31.110> about<00:02:31.320> 2.8<00:02:32.280> or<00:02:32.520> 2.75

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
all your speed at about 2.8 or 2.75

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.240 
all your speed at about 2.8 or 2.75

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
last cell of their energy getting to the

last cell of their energy getting to the
end<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.430> three<00:03:02.640> miles<00:03:02.880> because<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:03.600> just

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
end of three miles because it's just

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
it kick it out I'd recommend at least

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.440 
it kick it out I'd recommend at least
getting<00:03:11.040> building<00:03:11.760> up<00:03:11.880> your<00:03:12.030> pace<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.299> little

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
getting building up your pace a little

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.900 
getting building up your pace a little
for<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.930> second<00:03:13.290> mile<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.430> think<00:03:14.640> okay

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
for the second mile and you think okay

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.670 
for the second mile and you think okay
I'm<00:03:14.940> gonna<00:03:15.060> use<00:03:15.390> all<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.870> Center<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.500> all

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
I'm gonna use all this Center and all

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.350 
I'm gonna use all this Center and all
the<00:03:16.830> energy<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.400> had<00:03:17.580> for<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.820> sprint<00:03:18.120> I'm

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
the energy that I had for the sprint I'm

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.850 
the energy that I had for the sprint I'm
just<00:03:18.510> gonna<00:03:18.600> put<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.989> into<00:03:19.170> my<00:03:19.290> second<00:03:19.709> line

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
just gonna put it into my second line

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.560 
just gonna put it into my second line
because<00:03:20.670> that's<00:03:20.850> when<00:03:20.970> you're<00:03:21.090> feeling<00:03:21.360> worn

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
because that's when you're feeling worn

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.559 
because that's when you're feeling worn
down<00:03:21.720> anyway<00:03:22.170> you've<00:03:22.320> just<00:03:22.500> gone<00:03:22.590> over<00:03:22.650> one

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
down anyway you've just gone over one
