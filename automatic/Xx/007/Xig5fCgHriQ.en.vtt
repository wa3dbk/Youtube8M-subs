for<00:02:28.770> everywhere<00:02:29.340> personally<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.480> probably

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
for everywhere personally I probably

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.949 
for everywhere personally I probably
would<00:02:31.470> have<00:02:31.530> taken<00:02:31.770> engine<00:02:32.400> at<00:02:33.090> Avon's<00:02:33.510> car

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
would have taken engine at Avon's car

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.540 
would have taken engine at Avon's car
and<00:02:34.230> put<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> JCP<00:02:35.010> sir<00:02:35.510> that's<00:02:36.510> just<00:02:36.660> me<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.900> mean

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
and put a JCP sir that's just me I mean

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.800 
and put a JCP sir that's just me I mean
cuz<00:02:38.550> JCP<00:02:39.150> doesn't<00:02:39.450> have<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.660> learn<00:02:39.750> a

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
cuz JCP doesn't have to learn a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.510 
cuz JCP doesn't have to learn a
different<00:02:39.989> car<00:02:40.320> he's<00:02:40.650> driving<00:02:40.680> tireless<00:02:41.310> car

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
different car he's driving tireless car

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.220 
different car he's driving tireless car
which<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.760> difficult<00:02:42.120> as<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.900> cars<00:02:43.110> are

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
which is difficult as it is the cars are

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.960 
which is difficult as it is the cars are
completely<00:02:43.620> different<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.730> they're<00:02:44.880> both

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
completely different and they're both

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.259 
completely different and they're both
very<00:02:45.150> talented<00:02:45.950> but<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.100> easy<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.580> pass<00:02:47.760> the

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
very talented but the easy to pass the

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.820 
very talented but the easy to pass the
path<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.720> least<00:02:48.870> resistance<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.560> think<00:02:49.769> would

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
path of least resistance I think would

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.979 
path of least resistance I think would
be<00:02:49.920> take<00:02:50.100> them<00:02:50.250> on<00:02:50.430> engine<00:02:50.970> out<00:02:51.060> stick<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.540> GTP

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
be take them on engine out stick a GTP

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.360 
be take them on engine out stick a GTP
star<00:02:52.230> yeah<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.590> understand<00:02:53.010> why<00:02:53.160> everyone

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
star yeah I understand why everyone

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.699 
star yeah I understand why everyone
thinks<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.820> big<00:02:54.060> deal<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.269> swap<00:02:54.810> between<00:02:55.019> JDP

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
thinks is a big deal to swap between JDP
