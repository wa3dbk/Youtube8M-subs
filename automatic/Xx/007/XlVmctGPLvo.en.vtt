 Hello Today I will share with you the way to make a decorative braid in the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.130
 crochet technique. 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:16.139
 The use of this braid is to decorate cushions, curtains the edge of a lamp, 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.000
 Cloth handkerchiefs tablecloths or any garment. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.630
 You have to take into account the texture and the weight of the fabric on which the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.650
 braid to choose the thread with which we will knit. 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.270
 In this case I'm going to apply it on a thick canvas so I chose a thick yarn 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.489
 the same color of the fabric. 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:48.640
 You have to draw the design on the fabric and with the braid we go over 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.059
 the desired effect. 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.760
 It is good to learn how to do this work because in the market color is not always achieved 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:23.220
 or the texture we seek and know how to elaborate allows us to give a personal touch to our 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.390
 draft. 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:02:05.650
 We are going to start making a ring with a sliding knot, it is easy to do, you only do 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:27.459
 a knot around the thread with the same rope and that's it. 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.330
 Now we start the fabric by passing the needle through the ring and make two chains. 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:44.189
 Step by step: it is with the help of the crochet thread 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.859
 through the ring (twice). 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:03:00.090
 We return with the needle to the first chain, we pass through it, we bring the thread 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.060
 and we get two rings on the needle. 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.069
 Now with the crochet we bring the yarn back through the two rings and we are 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.249
 with a. 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:14.000
 Repeat the previous step: return to the previous stitch (the double stitch) pass the needle through 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.989
 half of the left ring and we bring a ring (now we have two rings again 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.680
 over the needle), close them with a loop. 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:35.389
 Repeat this procedure as many times as necessary until obtaining the meters that 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:36.739
 We want to knit.
