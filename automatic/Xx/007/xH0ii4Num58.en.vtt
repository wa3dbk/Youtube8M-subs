be talking about what the difference is

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.710 
be talking about what the difference is
between<00:00:19.869> the<00:00:20.619> bar<00:00:20.890> format<00:00:21.580> and<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:22.090> JPEG

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
between the bar format and the JPEG

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.890 
between the bar format and the JPEG
format<00:00:23.289> in<00:00:23.529> the<00:00:23.740> photography<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:25.449> let's<00:00:25.689> begin

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
format in the photography so let's begin

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.640 
format in the photography so let's begin
a<00:00:26.910> photographer<00:00:27.910> can<00:00:28.060> choose<00:00:28.420> to<00:00:29.140> shoot<00:00:29.410> their

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
a photographer can choose to shoot their

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.519 
a photographer can choose to shoot their
photographs<00:00:30.160> on<00:00:30.430> either<00:00:30.939> the<00:00:31.449> VAR<00:00:31.689> format<00:00:32.320> of

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
photographs on either the VAR format of

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.790 
photographs on either the VAR format of
the<00:00:32.830> Che<00:00:33.100> page<00:00:33.430> format<00:00:34.030> but<00:00:34.720> what<00:00:34.930> exactly<00:00:35.140> is

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
the Che page format but what exactly is

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.979 
the Che page format but what exactly is
the<00:00:35.980> difference<00:00:36.190> between<00:00:37.090> shooting<00:00:37.329> on<00:00:37.630> Lavar

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
the difference between shooting on Lavar

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.569 
the difference between shooting on Lavar
format<00:00:38.649> compared<00:00:39.610> to<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.880> JPEG<00:00:40.420> format

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
format compared to the JPEG format

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.889 
format compared to the JPEG format
basically<00:00:42.579> the<00:00:42.879> difference<00:00:43.360> between<00:00:43.570> these

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
basically the difference between these

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.860 
basically the difference between these
two<00:00:44.260> types<00:00:44.530> of<00:00:44.829> files<00:00:45.219> is<00:00:45.610> that<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.600> VAR

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
two types of files is that the VAR

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.709 
two types of files is that the VAR
format<00:00:47.559> can<00:00:48.219> hold<00:00:48.520> a<00:00:48.700> lot<00:00:48.940> more<00:00:48.969> information

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
format can hold a lot more information

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.940 
format can hold a lot more information
on<00:00:50.350> it<00:00:50.620> than<00:00:51.100> what<00:00:51.309> a<00:00:51.340> JPEG<00:00:52.059> format<00:00:52.600> can<00:00:52.950> so

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
on it than what a JPEG format can so

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.729 
on it than what a JPEG format can so
this<00:00:54.250> means<00:00:54.670> that<00:00:55.059> when<00:00:56.020> you're<00:00:56.199> working<00:00:56.410> with

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
this means that when you're working with

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.700 
this means that when you're working with
the<00:00:57.010> raw<00:00:57.250> file<00:00:57.730> in<00:00:58.030> an<00:00:58.660> editing<00:00:59.440> software

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
the raw file in an editing software

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.420 
the raw file in an editing software
switch<00:01:00.250> with<00:01:00.460> Lightroom<00:01:01.030> Photoshop

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
switch with Lightroom Photoshop

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.790 
switch with Lightroom Photoshop
photomatix<00:01:03.430> etc<00:01:04.180> then<00:01:05.080> you<00:01:05.110> will<00:01:05.320> be<00:01:05.440> able<00:01:05.530> to

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
photomatix etc then you will be able to

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.609 
photomatix etc then you will be able to
do<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:05.950> lot<00:01:06.280> more<00:01:06.310> editing<00:01:07.300> with<00:01:07.810> regard<00:01:08.380> to

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
do a lot more editing with regard to

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.730 
do a lot more editing with regard to
evolve<00:01:09.340> on<00:01:09.640> that<00:01:09.909> as<00:01:10.180> opposed<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.200> what<00:01:11.590> you

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
evolve on that as opposed to what you

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.399 
evolve on that as opposed to what you
could<00:01:11.920> do<00:01:12.070> with<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.340> JPEG<00:01:12.820> format<00:01:13.409> for

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
could do with the JPEG format for

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.780 
could do with the JPEG format for
example<00:01:15.150> shadows/highlights<00:01:17.280> white<00:01:18.280> balance

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
example shadows/highlights white balance

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.380 
example shadows/highlights white balance
etc<00:01:19.060> are<00:01:19.930> a<00:01:19.990> lot<00:01:20.590> more<00:01:20.619> accurate<00:01:21.610> when<00:01:22.210> you

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
etc are a lot more accurate when you

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.440 
etc are a lot more accurate when you
work<00:01:22.630> with<00:01:22.930> a<00:01:22.960> VAR<00:01:23.259> format<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:25.090> is<00:01:25.210> another

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
work with a VAR format here is another

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.499 
work with a VAR format here is another
example<00:01:26.340> let's<00:01:27.340> say<00:01:27.610> that<00:01:27.640> you<00:01:28.090> shoot<00:01:28.360> a

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
example let's say that you shoot a

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.800 
example let's say that you shoot a
photograph<00:01:29.200> on<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.920> wall<00:01:30.070> format<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.180> the

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
photograph on the wall format and the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.420 
photograph on the wall format and the
photograph<00:01:32.320> did<00:01:32.530> not<00:01:32.710> turn<00:01:32.950> like<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.280> way<00:01:33.369> you

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
photograph did not turn like the way you

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.149 
photograph did not turn like the way you
want<00:01:33.759> it<00:01:33.970> let's<00:01:34.509> just<00:01:34.780> say<00:01:34.960> that<00:01:35.320> you<00:01:35.740> under

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
want it let's just say that you under

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.510 
want it let's just say that you under
exposed<00:01:36.579> it<00:01:36.850> for<00:01:37.060> example<00:01:37.560> now<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.950> good<00:01:39.159> news

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
exposed it for example now the good news

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.850 
exposed it for example now the good news
is<00:01:39.820> because<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.600> shot<00:01:40.840> that<00:01:40.869> photograph<00:01:41.590> in

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
is because you shot that photograph in

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.249 
is because you shot that photograph in
the<00:01:42.009> raw<00:01:42.220> format<00:01:42.880> then<00:01:43.630> you<00:01:43.750> can<00:01:43.990> now<00:01:44.200> you

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
the raw format then you can now you

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.249 
the raw format then you can now you
stand<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.920> better<00:01:44.979> chance<00:01:45.430> of<00:01:45.970> being<00:01:46.479> able<00:01:46.750> to

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
stand a better chance of being able to

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.569 
stand a better chance of being able to
restore<00:01:48.009> /<00:01:48.850> edit<00:01:49.540> your<00:01:50.259> photograph<00:01:50.799> back<00:01:51.250> to
