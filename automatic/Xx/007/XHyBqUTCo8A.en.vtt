00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
my way around this map I only office I

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.910 
my way around this map I only office I
should<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.140> gone<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.439> different<00:01:25.770> gene

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
should have gone the different gene

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.710 
should have gone the different gene
because<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.549> could<00:01:26.729> record<00:01:27.030> what<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.540> look

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
because you could record what we look

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.219 
because you could record what we look
like<00:01:31.490> i'm<00:01:32.490> not<00:01:32.670> good<00:01:32.729> at<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.090> at<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.750> think

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
like i'm not good at this at all I think

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.690 
like i'm not good at this at all I think
that's<00:01:34.409> why<00:01:34.560> can't<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.920> normally<00:01:35.340> used<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.579> go

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
that's why can't I normally used to go

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.039 
that's why can't I normally used to go
on<00:01:35.729> his<00:01:35.909> own<00:01:36.060> because<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.479> way<00:01:36.600> could<00:01:36.780> record

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
on his own because that way could record

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.870 
on his own because that way could record
