00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
mirror but what I found that you can do

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.230 
mirror but what I found that you can do
is<00:05:37.870> you<00:05:38.440> can<00:05:38.680> take<00:05:38.890> out<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:39.160> bottom<00:05:39.700> dividers

find its easiest to close up the trace

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.560 
find its easiest to close up the trace
first<00:05:49.810> like<00:05:50.140> this<00:05:50.380> and<00:05:50.850> then<00:05:51.850> just<00:05:52.150> simply

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570

first like this and then just simply
close<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:53.020> books<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:58.410> even<00:05:59.410> with<00:05:59.620> the<00:05:59.800> makeup

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
close the books and even with the makeup

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.100 
close the books and even with the makeup
the<00:06:01.120> case<00:06:01.600> is<00:06:01.900> not<00:06:02.260> that<00:06:02.740> heavy<00:06:03.100> and<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:04.870> case

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
the case is not that heavy and the case

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.250 
the case is not that heavy and the case
feels<00:06:05.590> very<00:06:05.980> sturdy<00:06:06.400> so<00:06:07.180> overall<00:06:07.630> I<00:06:07.660> like<00:06:08.110> this

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260
