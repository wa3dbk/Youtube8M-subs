00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.030
 dark light 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.240
 It must be balanced in the universe 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.599
 rule was adopted as the fiery 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.820
 Rates of an ancient institution of 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.010
 creator commissioned the fabric of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.029
 existence itself 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.720
 but the fabric was broken itself 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.900
 Now the idea for the demons for 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.270
 us 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.050
 the destroyer forms among his 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.210
 chose a new line 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.040
 the rider war is said to have the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.220
 apocalypse triggered 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.190
 he rode to earth and had the 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.829
 mankind damn but what about the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.120
 other riders fearlessly prevail 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.589
 the will of space 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.750
 what about conflict and death around these 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.910
 It only takes one name to know names 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.550
 annoying others 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.300
 a cursed alliance of angels ob 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.460
 of tomorrow have countless stands the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.420
 exposed and burned to ashes 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.030
 but 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.920
 they were tired of slaughtering and 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.009
 they were afraid that their conquest would 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.270
 Balance endangered and it became one 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.830
 pact closed 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.000
 the four would serve the wheel and for that 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.149
 unimaginable get received 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.690
 That's how the dreaded riders came to be 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.610
 and her first task was her own 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.700
 to wipe brothers from the creation 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.119
 annoying in the house to clear your soul 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.009
 to destroy 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.789
 Let us now turn our gaze to the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.289

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:45.869
 not to be killed under the four 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.970
 the council chained his innocence 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.259
 but the one of more than 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.350
 everything else 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:57.840
 he wants to save his brother he has many 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:00.170
 name brother murderer hangman we call him 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.170

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.300
 to negotiate freedom of war sport 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.590
 dead 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.590
 to save humanity 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.790
 he did not know how 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:42.730
 so go dead in only next to the keeper 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.730
 to find the secrets
