00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.600
 Gaming Historian 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.400
 After experiencing the failure of Sega Saturn 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.760
 There is a growing sense of distrust between fans and Sega. 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.460
 This is a big problem for Sega. 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.840
 Because they are ready to launch a new host: 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.780
 Dreamcast 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.860
 In order to avoid making another mistake of Sega Saturn 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.040
 Sega must launch Sonic games on Dreamcast 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.460
 The last episode of the history of the Sonic the Hedgehog series 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.620
 Let's take a look at the Sonic games on Dreamcast. 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.180
 Originally intended to be made into RPG 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.780
 Sonic Adventure is the first full 3D Sonic platform game 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.620
 What few fans know is 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.140
 In fact, the 3D world inside Sonic Jam is the prototype of Sonic Adventure. 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.620
 Have a new concept from Iizumi 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.180
 He worked on sonic 3 &amp; knuckles 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.100
 Then there is the new technology provided by Dreamcast. 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.940
 Zhongyu Division and Sonic Team regained interest in the Sonic series 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.880
 Sonic and partners have a new look 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.180
 There are also new characters in the game. 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.740
 Compared with the traditional platform, the mode is closed 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.960
 Sonic Adventure provides an open world where you can explore anywhere 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.960
 A bit similar to Mario 64 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.000
 The location of the game is on earth 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.340
 There are many places in the world of games based on the real world. 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.320
 Sonic Team even went to Central and South America to investigate ancient ruins 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.540
 Let them use in the game 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.400
 Sonic Adventure also takes this series to a new direction 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.900
 Provides cutscenes and sound performances 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.360
 This is also the first time many people have heard that the machine king is called "Dr. Egg Head". 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.920
 Egg head "Ha ha ha! Isn't this Sonic?" 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.980
 Sonic "Look! There is a big egg that can talk!" 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.260
 Egg head "Shut up! I am Dr. Machine King, 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.060
 The greatest scientific genius in the world. " 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.060
 Sonic "Whatever you say, egg head!" 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.420
 The egg head is "enough!!" 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.220
 Sonic Adventure's release date on Dreamcast 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.300
 Released together on September 9, 1999 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.200
 but 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.600
 You can also play this game two months earlier. 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.720
 In July 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.720
 Sega teamed up with Hollywood studios 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.120
 Launched a service that allows consumers to rent Dreamcast 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.720
 Includes a limited edition of Sonic Adventure 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.700
 This is basically the beta version of the US version. 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.060
 Missing projects such as internet connection 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.920
 This is also considered to be the most precious US version of the Dreamcast game. 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.500
 This is what all Sonic 3D game fans are looking forward to. 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.580
 Experienced an amazing opening level 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.360
 Fans know they got something quite special 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.460
 You can also operate different characters 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.600
 Each has its own goals and levels 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.000
 This game became the best-selling game on Dreamcast 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.320
 Sold 2.5 million games 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.320
 Because of the success of this game 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.080
 American Sega Studio 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.240
 Also known as the American Sonic Team 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.220
 Established in San Francisco 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.900
 Start to develop new games for Dreamcast 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.020
 Although the game is successful 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.460
 But Dreamcast is not as good as it is sold. 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.320
 A large number of players still can't believe Sega 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.060
 Because they messed up Sega Saturn and 32X 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.000
 Upcoming PlayStation2 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.780
 Also convinced a large number of consumers waiting 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.040
 anyway 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.020
 Sonic Adventure's sequel is still under development 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.040
 I have once again led this calculation. 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.720
 This team of engineers has written a brand new engine to correct the error. 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.740
 And the problems found in the first work 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.120
 Named Sonic Adventure 2 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.960
 The game is no longer an open world platform game 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.680
 Return to the traditional model 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.580
 And use cutscenes to advance the plot 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.720
 The story also provides two different story lines 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.880
 Hero line: Operates Sonic, Knuckles and Tails 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.600
 And dark lines: Operates Shadow, Eggman, and Rouge 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.200
 It is also the first Sonic game to operate Dr. Egghead. 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.820
 Level design is once again based on real world scenes 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.920
 Like the first level, I referenced San Francisco. 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.220
 The location of the US Sega studio 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.580
 Although the game is good and has been well evaluated 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.540
 Sonic Adventure 2 still has some camera problems 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.060
 And the roar of the dead in the Knuckles and Rouge levels. 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.360
 No matter how 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.940
 This is a success of Sega in the mall. 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Unfortunately at this time 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.280
 Sega has announced that it will stop pushing Dreamcast 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.060
 And decided to quit the game console market 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.280
 Sega is only committed to developing software 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.440
 This means you can play Sonic games on Nintendo's mainframe. 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.440
 Although Nintendo fans are happy to burst 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.500
 Sega fans are scared 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.900
 Sonic on the Nintendo host? ? ? 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.200
 This phenomenon may be subject to great sensory impact 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.320
 Because they are dead for a long time. 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.220
 Sales of many Nintendo and Sega consoles 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.500
 It is based on its own Mario and Sonic 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.240
 Although the host stopped developing is disappointing 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.520
 But the focus on developing software makes fans happy. 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.300
 Sonic games are still in production 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.300
 And this is the most important thing 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.700
 First released is Sonic Adventure 2 ported to Gamecube 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.300
 There is also a brand new Sonic Advance series available on the GBA platform. 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.180
 Sonic is still today 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.200
 Still one of the most popular video game series 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.920
 however 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.000
 This series has quite a lot of ups and downs. 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.080
 Recent Sonic games have not received good reviews. 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.220
 A lot of ideas didn't help Sega. 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.660
 Many fans still think that Sonic 3K is still the pinnacle of the series. 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.500
 And I have to admit that it is. 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.620
 Although Sonic Adventure is great 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.640
 But he is not as popular as those in the Genesis era. 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.640
 Recently, the series has also improved considerably. 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.200
 Sonic Colors is released on the Wii platform in 2010 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.200
 Get a good review 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.280
 Sonic 4 is also available for download 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.480
 On Xbox Live 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.720
 PSN 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.880
 And Wii ware 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.900
 The game is short 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.860
 But the game content is similar to those of the Genesis game. 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.220
 In short 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.400
 The story is over. 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.100
 Sonic is a great series 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.980
 He was very important to Sega in the early 1990s. 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.060
 therefore 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.960
 He is an indispensable part of the history of video games. 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.720
 I didn't talk about all the games of Sonic this time. 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.720
 Because it is too much 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.920
 There are quite a few models launched in Game Gear 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.780
 And 32X Knuckles Chaotix 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.880
 Dreamcast's Sonic Shuffle 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.140
 Considered to be Sega's answer to the Mario Party 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.440
 There are also videos that are not available for sale. 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.740
 however 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.120
 I hope that you can get a lot of information in this. 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.180
 Whether it's for Sega or that blue hedgehog
