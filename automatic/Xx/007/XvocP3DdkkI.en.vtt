00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello friends and youtube subscribers in 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.259
 this video we will learn to elaborate a 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.079
 origami fish like this well let's 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.809
 see how it is done for this figure 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:17.849
 we will need a square of the paper of the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.080
 color that you want first 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.080
 we will turn on the diagonal 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:32.140
 we will watch in this way we will take the 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.140
 tips from the sides to the tip of top 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.789
 well now we will take them to the part of 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.789
 down 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.880
 already being there we will take out the tips a 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.200
 little bit 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:05.040
 about half way like that and we'll do what 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.040
 same from the other side 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.390
 either by the top take 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.700
 just a tip and we'll double it 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.320
 up but leaving a space 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.590
 between this fold and the doubles that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.590
 will 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.260
 well and then we will double that 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:34.950
 small fold that we leave up 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.550
 in this way well we take the other end 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.750
 and we take it 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.600
 from the top and we will mark 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.590
 strongly 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:52.260
 we turn and take out the tip folding the 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.850
 about our fold and we mark 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.800
 strongly 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.140
 If necessary, we will repeat these steps 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.470
 several times to mark very well the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.470
 paper 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.200
 well already marked what we will do is 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.200
 break it 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.710
 on this side and on the bottom 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.680
 leaving only a small piece in 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.350
 Half well 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.670
 we will achieve and we will double it 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:45.090
 forming a triangle 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:48.010
 in this way then we will open 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.569
 this part 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.569
 almost doubling 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.840
 thus 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.150
 and we have 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.150
 our fish 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.590
