00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:32.370 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.569 

let's<00:00:33.370> go<00:00:33.550> along<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:35.230> I<00:00:35.350> just<00:00:35.559> woke<00:00:35.710> up<00:00:35.860> and<00:00:36.489> I

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.319 
don't sound like I did a year ago I
think<00:00:39.550> that's<00:00:39.760> what<00:00:39.970> it<00:00:40.090> was<00:00:40.239> I<00:00:41.880> did<00:00:42.880> the

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
think that's what it was I did the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
up when I did the video and it was a

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.120 
up when I did the video and it was a
really<00:00:51.340> bad<00:00:51.520> idea

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
really bad idea

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.920 
really bad idea
well<00:00:54.130> not<00:00:54.280> really<00:00:54.520> but<00:00:55.510> there<00:00:55.690> were<00:00:55.780> some

this<00:01:52.729> is<00:01:52.880> basically<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:53.740> symmetrical

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.580 

symmetrical<00:02:03.130> find<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.189> words<00:02:04.899> escaping<00:02:05.899> out

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
symmetrical find the words escaping out

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:14.680 
symmetrical find the words escaping out
of<00:02:06.710> my<00:02:06.829> brain<00:02:10.120> but<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:12.250> actually<00:02:13.250> couldn't<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:14.150> I

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
of my brain but I actually couldn't I I

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.390 
of my brain but I actually couldn't I I
didn't<00:02:15.080> grab<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.440> one<00:02:15.620> out<00:02:15.799> I'm<00:02:15.950> just

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
didn't grab this one out I'm just

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
didn't grab this one out I'm just
I<00:02:17.739> didn't<00:02:18.739> graph<00:02:18.920> this<00:02:19.160> picture<00:02:19.549> out<00:02:19.640> or<00:02:20.209> the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
I didn't graph this picture out or the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.620 
I didn't graph this picture out or the
explored<00:02:21.319> out<00:02:21.470> because<00:02:21.950> it's<00:02:22.310> it's<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:23.329> tiny

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
explored out because it's it's so tiny

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.110 
explored out because it's it's so tiny
and<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.079> didn't<00:02:24.349> feel<00:02:24.440> like<00:02:24.500> I<00:02:24.739> needed<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:25.250> but<00:02:26.060> I

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
and I didn't feel like I needed to but I

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.860 
and I didn't feel like I needed to but I
probably<00:02:26.989> should<00:02:27.769> have<00:02:27.799> done<00:02:28.099> it<00:02:28.250> anyway<00:02:31.870> but

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
probably should have done it anyway but

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.479 
probably should have done it anyway but
this<00:02:33.140> is<00:02:33.349> a<00:02:33.380> fairly<00:02:33.799> simple<00:02:35.890> pixel<00:02:36.890> art<00:02:37.190> statue

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
this is a fairly simple pixel art statue

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.000 
this is a fairly simple pixel art statue
and<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.510> loved<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.049> game<00:02:39.170> that's<00:02:39.410> why<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.590> did<00:02:39.829> it

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
and I loved the game that's why I did it

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.370 
and I loved the game that's why I did it
otherwise<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:40.579> wouldn't<00:02:41.180> give<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:41.959> at<00:02:42.170> all

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
otherwise I wouldn't give this at all

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.599 
otherwise I wouldn't give this at all
because<00:02:43.340> it's<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:43.849> simple<00:02:44.180> but<00:02:46.870> hilarious

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
because it's so simple but hilarious

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.250 
because it's so simple but hilarious
it's<00:02:49.609> how<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.819> love<00:02:50.120> mine<00:02:50.329> I<00:02:50.540> mean<00:02:50.989> that's
