okay<00:01:05.000> just<00:01:05.960> for<00:01:06.049> an<00:01:06.170> aside<00:01:06.409> here<00:01:06.439> this<00:01:07.429> is

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
okay just for an aside here this is

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.550 
okay just for an aside here this is
controlling<00:01:08.179> the<00:01:08.420> mentira<00:01:08.929> inside<00:01:09.409> the

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:12.709 
second stage in its minus position which

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:13.660 
second stage in its minus position which

pre-dive mode

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.870 
pre-dive mode
you<00:01:14.329> might<00:01:14.479> jump<00:01:14.749> in<00:01:14.899> the<00:01:14.959> water<00:01:15.139> with<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:15.469> or

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
you might jump in the water with this or

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.889 
you might jump in the water with this or
Causey<00:01:16.880> for<00:01:16.999> an<00:01:17.119> octopus<00:01:17.450> it's<00:01:17.630> a<00:01:17.689> great

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
Causey for an octopus it's a great

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.109 
Causey for an octopus it's a great
position<00:01:18.020> for<00:01:18.349> it<00:01:18.499> to<00:01:18.590> have<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:18.859> in<00:01:19.159> anyway<00:01:19.639> in

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
position for it to have it in anyway in

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.839 
position for it to have it in anyway in
this<00:01:20.659> position<00:01:21.139> it's<00:01:21.409> forcing<00:01:21.829> the<00:01:22.039> air<00:01:22.249> back

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:22.849 
this position it's forcing the air back

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.539 
this position it's forcing the air back
towards<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.329> diaphragm<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:24.529> in<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.009> situation

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
towards the diaphragm so in a situation

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.519 
towards the diaphragm so in a situation
it<00:01:25.729> might<00:01:25.880> free<00:01:26.149> flow<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:26.899> air<00:01:27.109> is<00:01:27.289> forced

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:27.529 
it might free flow that air is forced

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:29.679 
it might free flow that air is forced
back<00:01:28.189> towards<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.549> diaphragm<00:01:29.029> pushing<00:01:29.599> it

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
back towards the diaphragm pushing it

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.349 
back towards the diaphragm pushing it
out<00:01:29.899> and<00:01:30.200> closing<00:01:30.889> the<00:01:30.979> valve<00:01:31.189> itself<00:01:31.399> so<00:01:32.209> it's

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
out and closing the valve itself so it's

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.789 
out and closing the valve itself so it's
a<00:01:32.419> great<00:01:32.599> safety<00:01:32.899> feature<00:01:33.169> from<00:01:33.469> that<00:01:33.619> point

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
a great safety feature from that point

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.879 
a great safety feature from that point
of<00:01:33.889> view<00:01:34.299> obviously<00:01:35.299> when<00:01:35.630> it's<00:01:35.779> in<00:01:35.869> use<00:01:36.020> you

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:36.889 
of view obviously when it's in use you

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:38.800 
of view obviously when it's in use you
can<00:01:37.009> put<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.219> to<00:01:37.340> its<00:01:37.369> plus<00:01:37.700> mode<00:01:37.999> and<00:01:38.630> yeah

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
can put it to its plus mode and yeah

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.419 
can put it to its plus mode and yeah
it's<00:01:39.020> directed<00:01:39.469> back<00:01:39.619> towards<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:40.099> like<00:01:40.249> the

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
it's directed back towards and like the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.849 
it's directed back towards and like the
mouthpiece<00:01:41.060> straight<00:01:41.869> off<00:01:42.109> so<00:01:42.590> there's<00:01:42.740> give

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 
mouthpiece straight off so there's give

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:44.679 
mouthpiece straight off so there's give
me<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:43.009> much<00:01:43.219> better<00:01:43.249> flow<00:01:43.789> much<00:01:44.450> better

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
me a much better flow much better

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.379 
me a much better flow much better
breathability<00:01:45.549> lots<00:01:46.549> more<00:01:46.609> comfort<00:01:47.090> as<00:01:47.209> well

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:47.389 
breathability lots more comfort as well

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:49.779 
breathability lots more comfort as well
so<00:01:48.139> in<00:01:48.499> a<00:01:48.619> situation<00:01:48.859> where<00:01:49.310> someone's<00:01:49.639> in

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
so in a situation where someone's in

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.300 
so in a situation where someone's in
perhaps<00:01:50.749> a<00:01:50.929> little<00:01:50.989> bit<00:01:51.139> panics<00:01:51.529> you<00:01:51.979> just

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
perhaps a little bit panics you just

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.769 
perhaps a little bit panics you just
remember<00:01:52.639> to<00:01:52.669> push<00:01:52.909> it<00:01:52.999> into<00:01:53.119> this<00:01:53.270> position

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:53.779 
remember to push it into this position

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:55.389 
remember to push it into this position
and<00:01:53.899> they'll<00:01:54.349> feel<00:01:54.649> like<00:01:54.919> they're<00:01:55.069> getting<00:01:55.189> a

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
and they'll feel like they're getting a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
and they'll feel like they're getting a
lot<00:01:55.520> more<00:01:55.549> air<00:01:55.849> than<00:01:55.880> they<00:01:56.149> would<00:01:56.299> be<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:58.419> mean

00:01:59.409 --> 00:01:59.419 
lot more air than they would be I mean

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.539 
lot more air than they would be I mean
look<00:01:59.569> at<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.779> underside<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.649> second<00:02:01.369> stage

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
look at the underside the second stage

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.539
