00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.700
 heli is warm 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.809
 Welcome to a new video you have 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.309

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.109
 less noticed that is now the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.900
 Last days and weeks he said that 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.240
 all over january about not so many 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.010
 Videos belonged to it was that now 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.470
 Especially the last days 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.230
 no time had so little time as 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.410
 currently or the last days I had 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.940
 I do not know very long years 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.380
 years in any case years 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.559
 but I have to say I have to the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.180
 last nights always a bit 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.760
 Battlefield played and I have to say 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.739
 that me especially this game 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.780
 battlefield 3 also with david 4 but me 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.129
 really have more battlefield 3 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.239
 played so much I have too 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.879
 not played as I said I hardly had 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.550
 time but what I have played 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.370
 it makes me currently as pronounced as fun 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.960
 I have that again last night 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.390
 if you just do not notice the game 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.730
 looks so serious and just take a look 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.589
 shit makes him do the game 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.170
 damn much fun and i have 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.850
 right now or just so full the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.400
 Badebetrieb and I hope that too 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.530
 I want to continue now 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.689
 Do not promise that this will happen 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.130
 today or tomorrow because now 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.689
 probably sees this video and 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.060
 Oh thinks oh cool now it starts again 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.560
 now there are videos or im again 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.650
 On the contrary, I do not have to do anything 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.150
 You'll endure that shit again 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.299
 I do not want to promise it now 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.430
 from now or from today perfect again 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.079
 Get started with daily battlefield videos 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.240
 I try it in any case 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.100
 It can always be when I am 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.619
 what promise yes then always comes 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.210
 there is no one in between 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.829
 That's why it's extra now 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.310
 not that it will be the next tomorrow 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.110
 Video 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.399
 another video and so on 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.520
 whatever happens in between now 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.140
 next day but especially now 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.850
 It looks good again with the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.670
 time means also right now it looks quite 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.520
 good with having regular or 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.080
 even daily videos especially 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.479
 Now in a few days, I'll just say 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.159
 let's go the hardliner and me 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.470
 knows how it is with such a beta 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.050
 is simply any partie as the channel 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.989
 there are hard lane out every day 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.600
 bludgeon and, above all, everyone else 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.769
 Otherwise, the mitwelt will not be that way 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.450
 much on the hat as for example none 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.980
 we'll get along or we will 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.709
 also beat out hardliner and you 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.510
 you'll see that everywhere, and that's exactly what 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.220
 I do not want to, I also want a lot 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.209
 But I want to bring cyclists too 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.950
 by the way, Battlefield 3 and 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.450
 Battlefield 4 will not do that now 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.250
 really no idea how long the beta 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.650
 I will not go at all 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.340
 I'll just say just say it 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.540
 a week ago 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.849
 we go now from the week or 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.950
 from two weeks out that the whole two 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.630
 Weeks every day always hard everywhere 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.030
 lane videos come where it gets me like that 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.319
 That's why I'm going to die in time 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.410
 try because even battlefield 3 and 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.140
 Battlefield 4 because otherwise 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.390
 It's a pretty hard one 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.130
 incisions you just have to say 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.049
 all know how the opinions 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.850
 right now are to act and continue 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.560
 I get the I that now 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.200
 heard so recently among the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.600
 all hotline post and videos and what 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.819
 because everything goes off, yes you are not yet 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.470
 little bit of the game has seen 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.470
 I consider myself there with my opinion 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.760
 still back in too hard because yes me 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.720
 the game has not really played yet 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.910
 I have stayed until then and we are waiting now 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.350
 times off until hotline is out there or is 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.000
 first the out there is then wait 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.220
 we from what they make out of it as the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.650
 finished game looks like a dlc 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.109
 it will come to that and then we will look 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.810
 what you can say to the game if 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.180
 shit now or is it cool? 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.290
 or okay or what stop for 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.880
 in between a bit 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.920
 Variation is here and in the gameplay 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.560
 Incidentally, somehow such a 50 0 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.630
 Island park background in gameplay 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.720
 I should have taken this tv the 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.640
 had ridden us in the del shit 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.260
 that's the form flown by delhi 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.970
 look at how many I shoot 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.160
 the one wing is just not there 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.770
 yes and from the moment you have easy 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.599
 everything on us heli jets everything 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.940
 at once and we have somehow 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.840
 nothing came in seconds or in 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.540
 the section here 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.000
 we had to be extremely defensive in the round 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.069
 because just because everyone design 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.669
 one can also have a good time 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.560
 but understand why so 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.310
 I have you guys the ones 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.079
 hottest 10 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.460
 a bit chained up because 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.260
 but one or the other cool scene 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.010
 it was here, for example, now extreme 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.750
 just here with the jets and survived 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.040
 and so on back to the event 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.030
 hotline i am looking forward to any event 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.060
 driveway leyen 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.100
 I 'm looking forward to what you get out of it 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.139
 and I want to do more 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.760
 not synonymous for now 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.800
 there can still happen so much 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.010
 to be removed and so on 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.650
 I want to say something now 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.810
 that I can not promise that 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.169
 now from tomorrow and the day after tomorrow 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.700
 again regular videos will come 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.289
 but so in the next time it will be 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.360
 You can start again 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.000
 and it will be like that too 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.830
 or something else to come to you 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.560
 which you may be happy about 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.479
 can also write the comments 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.789

 what kind of series videos something 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.590
 yes not something but no 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.090
 I did not notice what was noticeable about live streams or something 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.640
 a professional writes the comments 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.400
 then we'll see what I have there 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.750
