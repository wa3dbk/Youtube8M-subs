00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
a milk chocolate all the way there into

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.330 
a milk chocolate all the way there into
what's<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.439> our<00:00:22.560> darkest<00:00:23.100> chocolate

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
what's going to be our darkest chocolate

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.380 
what's going to be our darkest chocolate
than<00:00:23.730> 80%<00:00:24.660> cocoa<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.910> what<00:00:26.910> makes<00:00:27.150> this

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
than 80% cocoa and what makes this

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.089 
than 80% cocoa and what makes this
chocolate<00:00:27.720> interesting<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:29.010> bit

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
chocolate interesting a little bit

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.009 
chocolate interesting a little bit
different<00:00:29.490> two<00:00:29.760> things<00:00:30.060> one<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> quality

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
different two things one is the quality

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.410 
different two things one is the quality
so<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> cocoa<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.189> exists<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.730> Madagascar

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
so the cocoa that exists in Madagascar

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.400 
so the cocoa that exists in Madagascar
is<00:00:33.510> different<00:00:33.809> than<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> cocoa<00:00:34.290> from

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
is different than the cocoa from

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.470 
is different than the cocoa from
anywhere<00:00:34.739> else<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> world<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:36.090> has<00:00:36.149> this

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
anywhere else in the world it has this

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.240 
anywhere else in the world it has this
fruity<00:00:36.960> aftertaste<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.129> that's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
fruity aftertaste to it and that's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.010 
fruity aftertaste to it and that's
because<00:00:38.399> genetically<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> cocoa<00:00:39.870> in

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
because genetically the cocoa in

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.560 
because genetically the cocoa in
Madagascar<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.940> isolated<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.210> kind<00:00:42.510> of

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
Madagascar is isolated and it kind of

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360 
Madagascar is isolated and it kind of
exists<00:00:43.050> there<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.559> nowhere<00:00:43.710> else

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
exists there and nowhere else

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.369 
exists there and nowhere else
the<00:00:44.850> second<00:00:45.239> thing<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.539> makes<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.899> good<00:00:46.230> in

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the second thing that makes this good in

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.560 
the second thing that makes this good in
addition<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> quality<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:48.420> is

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
addition to the quality is this is

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.200 
addition to the quality is this is
believe<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.050> or<00:00:49.170> not<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:50.070> only<00:00:50.210> fine

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
believe it or not the only fine

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.029 
believe it or not the only fine
chocolate<00:00:51.660> made<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.899> all<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.140> Africa<00:00:52.469> and

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
Africa produces about 60% of the world's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.849 
Africa produces about 60% of the world's
cocoa<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.390> no<00:00:57.600> real<00:00:57.899> fine<00:00:58.350> finished

Madagascar and we kind of fell in love

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.350 
Madagascar and we kind of fell in love
with<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> country<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.850> realized<00:01:12.210> how

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
with the country and we realized how

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.390 
with the country and we realized how
poor<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> was<00:01:12.990> then<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.799> realized<00:01:14.159> how<00:01:14.250> good

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
poor it was then we realized how good

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.219 
poor it was then we realized how good
the<00:01:14.520> cocoa<00:01:14.880> was<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.540> no<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:15.900> was<00:01:16.020> making

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the cocoa was and that no one was making

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.380 
the cocoa was and that no one was making
chocolate<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.100> thought<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:18.090> could<00:01:18.119> do

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
chocolate and we thought we could do

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.820 
chocolate and we thought we could do
something<00:01:18.659> about<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.439> started<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
something about this so we started the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.120 
something about this so we started the
company<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.850> way<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> help<00:01:21.830> transfer<00:01:22.830> skills

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
company as a way to help transfer skills

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.350 
company as a way to help transfer skills
and<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.580> people<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.970> start<00:01:24.210> making

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and to get people to start making

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.910 
and to get people to start making
chocolate<00:01:24.869> instead<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.170> shipping<00:01:25.590> cocoa

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
