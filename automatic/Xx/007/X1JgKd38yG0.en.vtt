let's take a look at a couple of

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.130 
let's take a look at a couple of
examples<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.760> instance<00:00:26.820> when<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.779> turn<00:00:27.960> the

examples for instance when you turn the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.310 
examples for instance when you turn the
air<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.619> on<00:00:28.920> your<00:00:29.099> scuba<00:00:29.369> system<00:00:29.869> did<00:00:30.869> he<00:00:31.019> tell

what<00:01:55.799> they've<00:01:55.979> done<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.460> put<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.850> pressure

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
what they've done is a put a pressure

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
look at the boot that your pressure

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.270 
look at the boot that your pressure
gauges<00:02:27.990> in<00:02:28.140> whether<00:02:28.410> it's<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.650> single<00:02:28.830> boot<00:02:29.130> or

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
gauges in whether it's a single boot or

gauges in whether it's a single boot or
a<00:02:29.340> konso<00:02:29.790> you'll<00:02:30.240> see<00:02:30.390> there's<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.660> hole<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.260> the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.600 
did the same John but a lot difficult
and<00:03:21.570> with<00:03:21.930> these<00:03:22.049> old<00:03:22.350> old<00:03:22.769> valves

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
and with these old old valves

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.250 
and with these old old valves
occasionally<00:03:24.090> when<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.480> open<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.870> valve<00:03:24.989> all

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
occasionally when you open the valve all

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.490 
occasionally when you open the valve all
the<00:03:25.470> way<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:26.160> brass<00:03:26.430> would<00:03:26.700> expand<00:03:27.500> or

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
the way the brass would expand or

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.920 
the way the brass would expand or
contract<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.820> little<00:03:30.060> person<00:03:30.239> ever<00:03:30.660> get

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
contract and a little person ever get

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.690 
contract and a little person ever get
jammed<00:03:31.230> up<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.920> couldn't<00:03:32.280> get<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.489> darn

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
jammed up and you couldn't get the darn

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.210 
jammed up and you couldn't get the darn
thing<00:03:32.940> turned<00:03:33.269> off<00:03:33.420> at<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.750> end<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.049> day

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
thing turned off at the end of the day

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.650 
thing turned off at the end of the day
so<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.400> was<00:03:35.519> common<00:03:35.880> practice<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.269> open<00:03:36.570> the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
so it was common practice to open the

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.199 
so it was common practice to open the
valve<00:03:36.840> all<00:03:37.049> stuck<00:03:37.739> right<00:03:37.920> there<00:03:38.070> turn<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.120> off

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
valve all stuck right there turn it off

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.850 
valve all stuck right there turn it off
all<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.540> way<00:03:39.630> open<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.080> then<00:03:40.200> turn<00:03:40.380> it<00:03:40.470> back<00:03:40.620> a

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
all the way open and then turn it back a

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.410 
all the way open and then turn it back a
little<00:03:41.010> bit<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.580> that<00:03:41.610> wouldn't<00:03:42.000> happen<00:03:42.120> very

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
little bit so that wouldn't happen very

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.420 
little bit so that wouldn't happen very
common<00:03:42.840> now<00:03:43.440> let's<00:03:43.650> take<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.799> look<00:03:44.010> at<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.130> modern
