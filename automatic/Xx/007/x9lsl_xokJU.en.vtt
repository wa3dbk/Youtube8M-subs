00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
for this okay we'll use them Cadbury

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.179 
for this okay we'll use them Cadbury
melts<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.990> real<00:00:25.230> chocolate<00:00:25.890> and

melts and this is real chocolate and

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.970 
melts and this is real chocolate and
it's<00:00:26.849> specifically<00:00:27.840> formulated<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.890> it

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
it's specifically formulated so that it

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.400 
it's specifically formulated so that it
melts<00:00:29.310> beautifully<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.029> quickly<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.660> what

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
melts beautifully and quickly and what

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.080 
melts beautifully and quickly and what
we're<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.740> actually<00:00:31.920> do<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.640> heat

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
we're going to actually do is to heat

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.170 
we're going to actually do is to heat
the<00:00:33.120> cream<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.230> form<00:00:34.800> basically<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.610> ganache

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the cream so we form basically a ganache

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.979 
the cream so we form basically a ganache
and<00:00:36.540> that's<00:00:36.870> done<00:00:37.140> by<00:00:37.460> heating<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> cream

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
and that's done by heating the cream

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.619 
and that's done by heating the cream
just<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.790> just<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> boil<00:00:42.450> it

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
just up to just up to the boil it

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.850 
just up to just up to the boil it
doesn't<00:00:42.899> need<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.110> cook<00:00:43.260> for<00:00:43.440> any<00:00:43.559> length<00:00:43.710> of

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
doesn't need to cook for any length of

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.619 
doesn't need to cook for any length of
time<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.730> heat<00:00:45.390> through

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
time it's just to heat through

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.880 
time it's just to heat through
essentially<00:00:46.020> because<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.320> want<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.500> melt<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
essentially because you want to melt the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.369 
essentially because you want to melt the
chocolate<00:00:47.340> that's<00:00:47.879> right<00:00:48.180> now<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.230> add

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
chocolate that's right now you can add

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.930 
chocolate that's right now you can add
flavors<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.430> there's<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.610> couple<00:00:50.789> of

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
flavors to it and there's a couple of

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.060 
flavors to it and there's a couple of
variations<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.899> recipe<00:00:52.350> we're<00:00:53.039> going

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
variations for this recipe we're going

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.590 
variations for this recipe we're going
to<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> orange<00:00:53.850> flavored<00:00:54.270> one<00:00:54.390> because

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
to do the orange flavored one because

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.810 
to do the orange flavored one because
Jaffer<00:00:55.170> flavors<00:00:55.649> are<00:00:55.770> always<00:00:56.010> great<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.520> look

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
Jaffer flavors are always great and look

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.939 
Jaffer flavors are always great and look
here<00:00:57.059> as<00:00:57.210> always<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.539> favorite<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.800> would

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
here as always a favorite so this would

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.330 
here as always a favorite so this would
be<00:00:59.010> nice<00:00:59.190> three<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.480> three<00:01:00.989> teaspoons

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
be nice three to three teaspoons

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:10.940 
be nice three to three teaspoons
teaspoon<00:01:09.140> all<00:01:10.140> right<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.680> need<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
teaspoon all right so we just need to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.399 
teaspoon all right so we just need to
allow<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.580> come<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.090> boil<00:01:12.409> which

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
allow that to come to the boil which

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.929 
allow that to come to the boil which
doesn't<00:01:13.710> take<00:01:13.740> very<00:01:13.890> long<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.700> say<00:01:14.850> it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
doesn't take very long as I say it

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.280 
doesn't take very long as I say it
doesn't<00:01:14.970> need<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.450> be<00:01:15.570> cooked<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.170> we're

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
doesn't need to be cooked and then we're

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.100 
doesn't need to be cooked and then we're
going<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.530> pour<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.979> over<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.670> chocolate<00:01:18.180> so

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
going to pour it over the chocolate so

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.050 
going to pour it over the chocolate so
what<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.380> need<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.100> put<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> whole

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
what we need to do is to put the whole

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.560 
what we need to do is to put the whole
bag<00:01:21.330> there<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> 350<00:01:22.320> grams<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:24.390> heat

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
bag there the 350 grams in and the heat

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.730 
bag there the 350 grams in and the heat
of<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.810> should<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.110> enough<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.470> melt<00:01:25.650> down

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
of this should be enough to melt down

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.109 
of this should be enough to melt down
the<00:01:25.890> chocolate<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> form

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
the chocolate and this is going to form

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.700 
the chocolate and this is going to form
the<00:01:27.180> ganache<00:01:27.540> or<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> base<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.590> this

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the ganache or the base in this

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.679 
the ganache or the base in this
particular<00:01:29.070> type<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.460> truffle<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.030> pretty

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
particular type of truffle is pretty

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.330 
particular type of truffle is pretty
much<00:01:30.810> based<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.259> Swiss<00:01:31.619> truffles<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.130> see

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
much based on Swiss truffles you see

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.510 
much based on Swiss truffles you see
lots<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.610> other<00:01:32.729> types<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.210> truffles<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.659> about

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
lots of other types of truffles of about

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.740 
lots of other types of truffles of about
you<00:01:35.520> know<00:01:35.549> sometimes<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.299> Americans

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
you know sometimes with Americans

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.420 
you know sometimes with Americans
they'll<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.170> biscuit<00:01:37.619> braces<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.280> so

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
they'll have like biscuit braces and so

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.830 
they'll have like biscuit braces and so
forth<00:01:38.729> which<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.090> be<00:01:39.240> really<00:01:39.479> good<00:01:39.659> and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
forth which can be really good and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.140 
forth which can be really good and
peanut<00:01:40.200> butter<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.829> forth<00:01:41.159> which<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:42.030> be

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
peanut butter and so forth which can be

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.670 
peanut butter and so forth which can be
quite<00:01:42.390> nice<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:42.840> these<00:01:43.110> probably<00:01:43.560> are<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
quite nice I think these probably are a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.319 
quite nice I think these probably are a
little<00:01:43.829> more<00:01:44.009> adult<00:01:44.250> than<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.850> yeah<00:01:45.149> and

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
little more adult than that yeah and

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.630 
little more adult than that yeah and
we're<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> use<00:01:46.560> dark<00:01:46.829> chocolate<00:01:47.009> but

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
we're going to use dark chocolate but

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.310 
we're going to use dark chocolate but
you<00:01:47.790> could<00:01:47.939> use<00:01:48.060> white<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:48.329> milk<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.899> coat<00:01:49.110> them

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
you could use white or milk to coat them

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.940 
you could use white or milk to coat them
as<00:01:49.470> well

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
as well

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.649 
as well
all<00:01:50.280> sorts<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.670> different<00:01:50.850> toppings<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.540> be

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
all sorts of different toppings can be

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.120 
all sorts of different toppings can be
used<00:01:51.899> like<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.320> know<00:01:52.439> finely<00:01:52.740> ground<00:01:52.920> nuts

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
used like you know finely ground nuts

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.010 
used like you know finely ground nuts
etcetera<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.640> well<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:54.840> love

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
etcetera as well and I just I just love

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
etcetera as well and I just I just love
it<00:01:55.200> because<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.680> all<00:01:55.890> about<00:01:56.009> creating

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
it because it's just all about creating

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.370 
it because it's just all about creating
creating<00:01:57.149> your<00:01:57.299> own<00:01:57.509> that's<00:01:57.869> exactly<00:01:58.200> right

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
creating your own that's exactly right

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.899 
creating your own that's exactly right
you<00:01:58.500> make<00:01:58.740> your<00:01:58.890> own<00:01:58.979> signature<00:01:59.250> truffles

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
you make your own signature truffles

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.149 
you make your own signature truffles
that<00:02:00.119> makes<00:02:00.780> sense<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.229> think<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.979> should

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
that makes sense I think and that should

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.679 
that makes sense I think and that should
melt<00:02:02.369> down<00:02:02.579> really<00:02:02.939> really<00:02:03.180> quite<00:02:03.420> quickly

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
melt down really really quite quickly

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.350 
melt down really really quite quickly
what<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.469> need<00:02:04.799> for<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.340> do<00:02:05.520> then<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
what we need for this to do then is to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.540 
what we need for this to do then is to
just<00:02:06.600> take<00:02:06.990> its<00:02:07.229> time<00:02:07.500> Sokol<00:02:08.160> out<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.610> firm

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
just take its time Sokol out to firm

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.070 
just take its time Sokol out to firm
we'll<00:02:09.790> finish<00:02:10.030> mixing<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.600> we'll<00:02:10.780> leave<00:02:10.960> it

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
we'll finish mixing that we'll leave it

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.140 
we'll finish mixing that we'll leave it
on<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.230> bed<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.980> then<00:02:12.550> we'll<00:02:12.640> allow<00:02:12.940> that

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
on the bed and then we'll allow that

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.700 
on the bed and then we'll allow that
confirm<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.720> we'd<00:02:13.960> come<00:02:14.140> back<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.620> in

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
confirm that we'd come back to that in

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.220 
confirm that we'd come back to that in
an<00:02:14.770> hour<00:02:14.950> or<00:02:15.100> so

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.050 

okay<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.680> now<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.310> ganache<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.610> firmed

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
okay so now that the ganache is firmed

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.830 
okay so now that the ganache is firmed
we<00:02:24.900> can<00:02:25.110> start<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.560> spoon<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:25.950> out<00:02:26.540> like<00:02:27.540> so

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
we can start to spoon it out like so

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.220 
we can start to spoon it out like so
it's<00:02:28.680> gonna<00:02:28.770> go<00:02:28.950> onto<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.190> lined<00:02:29.490> tray<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:31.050> can

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
it's gonna go onto a lined tray it can

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.510 
it's gonna go onto a lined tray it can
be<00:02:31.350> kind<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.620> rough<00:02:31.680> at<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.010> moment

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
be kind of rough at the moment

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.040 
be kind of rough at the moment
essentially<00:02:33.240> this<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.420> going<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.720> form<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
essentially this is going to form the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.740 
essentially this is going to form the
center<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.770> our<00:02:34.980> truffles<00:02:35.460> we<00:02:36.210> actually<00:02:36.600> need

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
center of our truffles we actually need

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.450 
center of our truffles we actually need
to<00:02:36.780> put<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.140> back<00:02:37.290> into<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.680> refrigerator<00:02:37.860> for

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
to put it back into the refrigerator for

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.610 
to put it back into the refrigerator for
a<00:02:38.610> short<00:02:38.880> while<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.120> firm<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.720> up<00:02:39.930> again<00:02:40.320> and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
a short while to firm it up again and

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.040 
a short while to firm it up again and
then<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.460> can<00:02:41.490> roll<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.690> just<00:02:42.900> put<00:02:43.020> a

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
then we can roll it and I just put a

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.230 
then we can roll it and I just put a
little<00:02:43.140> bit<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.380> baking<00:02:43.770> spray<00:02:44.240> underneath

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
little bit of baking spray underneath

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.660 
little bit of baking spray underneath
that<00:02:45.570> just<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:45.990> so<00:02:46.530> when<00:02:46.710> you<00:02:46.770> do<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.250> makes<00:02:47.550> a

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
that just so so when you do this makes a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.820 
that just so so when you do this makes a
dicey<00:02:48.240> so<00:02:48.540> does<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> slip<00:02:49.050> away<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.650> makes

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
dicey so does a slip away that makes

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.710 
dicey so does a slip away that makes
sense<00:02:50.100> over<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.370> tray<00:02:50.610> now<00:02:51.270> this<00:02:51.420> has<00:02:51.570> become

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
sense over the tray now this has become

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.660 
sense over the tray now this has become
really<00:02:52.170> nice<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.770> firm<00:02:53.040> if<00:02:53.310> you're<00:02:53.400> allowed

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
really nice and firm if you're allowed

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.250 
really nice and firm if you're allowed
to<00:02:53.700> sit<00:02:54.090> for<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.330> while<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.630> will<00:02:54.720> become<00:02:55.050> quite

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
to sit for a while it will become quite

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.990 
to sit for a while it will become quite
firm<00:02:55.680> because<00:02:56.220> what<00:02:56.370> will<00:02:56.490> happen<00:02:56.520> is<00:02:56.820> we

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
firm because what will happen is we

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.450 
firm because what will happen is we
start<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.660> roll<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:58.590> now<00:02:58.830> it's<00:02:59.160> gonna<00:02:59.280> go

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
start to roll this now it's gonna go

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.610 
start to roll this now it's gonna go
sticky<00:02:59.760> on<00:02:59.940> our<00:03:00.060> head<00:03:00.240> look<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.260> think<00:03:01.320> it's

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
sticky on our head look I think it's

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.560 
sticky on our head look I think it's
just<00:03:01.740> an<00:03:01.920> insurance<00:03:02.400> policy<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.270> know<00:03:03.390> put

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
just an insurance policy to you know put

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.390 
just an insurance policy to you know put
it<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.810> refrigerator<00:03:04.140> for<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.130> short

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
it in a refrigerator for just a short

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.680 
it in a refrigerator for just a short
while<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.610> let<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.060> cool<00:03:06.270> down<00:03:06.540> because

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
while to let it cool down because

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.300 
while to let it cool down because
essentially<00:03:07.410> this<00:03:07.590> hasn't<00:03:07.950> been<00:03:08.070> in<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
essentially this hasn't been in the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.250 
essentially this hasn't been in the
refrigerator<00:03:08.460> yet<00:03:09.270> it's<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:09.960> sit

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
refrigerator yet it's just sit

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.510 
refrigerator yet it's just sit
beautifully<00:03:10.800> as<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.330> it<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:12.870> nice<00:03:13.260> and

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.010 

in<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.550> fridge<00:03:17.760> mm-hmm<00:03:18.390> what's<00:03:18.570> cool<00:03:18.870> that

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
in the fridge mm-hmm what's cool that

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.170 
in the fridge mm-hmm what's cool that
down<00:03:19.260> just<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:20.070> chill<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.460> off<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:20.880> that's

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
down just to chill it off so that's

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.530 
down just to chill it off so that's
ready<00:03:21.540> for<00:03:21.630> rolling<00:03:22.050> okay

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.539 

so<00:03:29.540> Alka<00:03:30.109> Nash<00:03:30.290> is<00:03:30.560> in<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.829> fridge<00:03:31.069> and<00:03:31.370> that's

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
so Alka Nash is in the fridge and that's

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.910 
so Alka Nash is in the fridge and that's
firming<00:03:32.090> nicely<00:03:32.510> so<00:03:33.079> what<00:03:33.230> we<00:03:33.319> need<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.530> do<00:03:33.769> is

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
firming nicely so what we need to do is

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.009 
firming nicely so what we need to do is
get<00:03:34.069> organized<00:03:34.519> to<00:03:34.730> actually<00:03:35.180> coat<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.750> now

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
get organized to actually coat it now

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.030 
get organized to actually coat it now
and<00:03:36.670> we're<00:03:37.670> using<00:03:37.909> the<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:39.200> dark<00:03:39.620> chocolate

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
and we're using the the dark chocolate

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.240 
and we're using the the dark chocolate
melts<00:03:40.370> again<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:41.140> what<00:03:42.140> we<00:03:42.290> need<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.500> do<00:03:42.799> here

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
melts again and what we need to do here

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.610 
melts again and what we need to do here
because<00:03:43.730> as<00:03:43.970> we<00:03:44.120> said<00:03:44.329> earlier<00:03:44.569> the<00:03:45.109> melts<00:03:45.409> are

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
because as we said earlier the melts are

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.470 
because as we said earlier the melts are
all<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.129> Cadbury<00:03:46.400> baking<00:03:46.760> ranges<00:03:47.090> real

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
all the Cadbury baking ranges real

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.800 
all the Cadbury baking ranges real
chocolate<00:03:48.140> we<00:03:48.859> actually<00:03:49.220> need<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.659> temper<00:03:50.659> the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
chocolate we actually need to temper the

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.379 
chocolate we actually need to temper the
chocolate<00:03:51.010> this<00:03:52.010> is<00:03:52.220> just<00:03:52.430> a<00:03:52.519> quick<00:03:52.849> cheats

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
chocolate this is just a quick cheats

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.390 
chocolate this is just a quick cheats
way<00:03:53.599> if<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:53.900> like<00:03:54.079> and<00:03:54.349> it's<00:03:54.590> called<00:03:54.829> seeding

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
way if you like and it's called seeding

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.970 
way if you like and it's called seeding
so<00:03:55.639> you<00:03:55.700> melt<00:03:56.060> say<00:03:56.659> half<00:03:57.109> to<00:03:57.319> two-thirds<00:03:57.799> of

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
so you melt say half to two-thirds of

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.190 
so you melt say half to two-thirds of
the<00:03:58.129> chocolate<00:03:58.519> that<00:03:58.639> you<00:03:58.819> need<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.209> use<00:03:59.569> take

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
the chocolate that you need to use take

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.589 
the chocolate that you need to use take
it<00:04:00.290> off<00:04:00.409> the<00:04:00.620> heat<00:04:00.859> and<00:04:01.099> use<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.700> rest<00:04:02.299> of<00:04:02.480> the

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
it off the heat and use the rest of the

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.360 
it off the heat and use the rest of the
heat<00:04:02.810> in<00:04:02.989> the<00:04:03.079> chocolate<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.919> heat<00:04:04.099> through

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
heat in the chocolate to heat through

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.729 
heat in the chocolate to heat through
the<00:04:04.400> remaining<00:04:04.909> sort<00:04:05.389> of<00:04:05.450> half<00:04:05.629> 2/3<00:04:06.169> that's

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
the remaining sort of half 2/3 that's

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.949 
the remaining sort of half 2/3 that's
left<00:04:07.069> over<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.790> reason<00:04:08.150> why<00:04:08.269> you<00:04:08.329> do<00:04:08.689> that<00:04:08.900> is

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
left over the reason why you do that is

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.879 
left over the reason why you do that is
because<00:04:09.879> it's<00:04:10.879> the<00:04:11.090> cocoa<00:04:11.569> butter<00:04:11.889> proportion

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
because it's the cocoa butter proportion

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.349 
because it's the cocoa butter proportion
of<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.099> chocolate<00:04:13.519> that's<00:04:13.760> what<00:04:13.939> makes<00:04:14.180> it

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
of the chocolate that's what makes it

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.210 
of the chocolate that's what makes it
real<00:04:14.540> chocolate<00:04:14.989> because<00:04:15.260> it<00:04:15.409> contains<00:04:15.769> cocoa

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
real chocolate because it contains cocoa

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.460 
real chocolate because it contains cocoa
butter<00:04:16.430> but<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.090> cocoa<00:04:17.479> butter<00:04:17.660> is<00:04:18.019> full<00:04:18.349> of

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
butter but the cocoa butter is full of

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.770 
butter but the cocoa butter is full of
crystals<00:04:18.979> and<00:04:19.280> we<00:04:19.759> need<00:04:19.970> to<00:04:20.150> allow<00:04:20.419> time<00:04:20.449> for

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
crystals and we need to allow time for

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.719 
crystals and we need to allow time for
those<00:04:21.169> cocoa<00:04:21.650> butter<00:04:21.859> crystals<00:04:21.949> to<00:04:22.490> sort<00:04:22.669> of

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
those cocoa butter crystals to sort of

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.120 
those cocoa butter crystals to sort of
get<00:04:22.880> back<00:04:23.030> into<00:04:23.090> order<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:23.960> that<00:04:24.620> produces

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
get back into order and that produces

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.760 
get back into order and that produces
that<00:04:25.280> lovely<00:04:25.639> crisp<00:04:26.389> and<00:04:26.660> snap<00:04:27.380> it's<00:04:27.680> the

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
that lovely crisp and snap it's the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.740 
that lovely crisp and snap it's the
texture<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.340> changes<00:04:29.000> and<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.570> know<00:04:29.630> when

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
texture that changes and you know when

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.540 
texture that changes and you know when
you<00:04:29.810> bite<00:04:30.050> into<00:04:30.199> a<00:04:30.320> choc<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:30.740> hear<00:04:30.889> of<00:04:31.130> crack

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
you bite into a choc and hear of crack

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.219 
you bite into a choc and hear of crack
like<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.120> that's<00:04:32.479> exactly<00:04:32.659> what<00:04:33.020> it<00:04:33.110> does

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
like that that's exactly what it does

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.290 
like that that's exactly what it does
that's<00:04:33.500> right<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.919> snap<00:04:34.190> so<00:04:34.550> that's<00:04:34.729> that's

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
that's right the snap so that's that's

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.029 
that's right the snap so that's that's
ready<00:04:35.630> isn't<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:36.020> to<00:04:36.229> stop

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
ready isn't it to stop

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.260 
ready isn't it to stop

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
and not for too long because we don't

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.870 
and not for too long because we don't
want<00:04:51.500> to<00:04:51.530> warm<00:04:51.710> them<00:04:51.860> up<00:04:51.919> too<00:04:52.130> much<00:04:52.280> just<00:04:52.699> roll

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
want to warm them up too much just roll

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.370 
want to warm them up too much just roll
them<00:04:53.060> into<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.330> ball<00:04:53.510> into<00:04:53.720> a<00:04:53.840> ball<00:04:54.110> so<00:04:54.349> that

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
them into the ball into a ball so that

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.320 
them into the ball into a ball so that
creates<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:55.039> the<00:04:55.400> center<00:04:55.760> of<00:04:55.849> your<00:04:55.970> truffle

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
creates the the center of your truffle

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.140 
creates the the center of your truffle
and<00:04:56.479> then<00:04:57.080> you<00:04:57.620> can<00:04:57.770> I<00:04:57.889> I<00:04:57.919> probably<00:04:58.550> find<00:04:58.970> it<00:04:59.120> a

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
and then you can I I probably find it a

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.700 
and then you can I I probably find it a
couple<00:04:59.449> of<00:04:59.599> spoons<00:04:59.840> just<00:05:00.199> as<00:05:00.320> easy<00:05:00.530> as

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
couple of spoons just as easy as

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.680 
couple of spoons just as easy as
anything<00:05:01.099> else<00:05:01.280> a<00:05:01.490> quick<00:05:02.180> roll<00:05:02.419> in<00:05:02.599> the

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
anything else a quick roll in the

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.580 
anything else a quick roll in the
chocolate<00:05:03.139> and<00:05:04.870> over<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:05.990> over<00:05:06.229> a<00:05:06.289> couple<00:05:06.500> of

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
chocolate and over and over a couple of

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.830 
chocolate and over and over a couple of
times<00:05:06.650> try<00:05:07.400> and<00:05:07.490> get<00:05:07.610> off<00:05:07.729> to<00:05:07.880> any<00:05:08.030> excess<00:05:08.599> and

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
times try and get off to any excess and

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.960 
times try and get off to any excess and
then<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:09.620> can<00:05:09.770> go<00:05:09.889> straight<00:05:10.099> back<00:05:10.340> down<00:05:10.400> onto

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
then that can go straight back down onto

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.360 
then that can go straight back down onto
the<00:05:11.169> tray<00:05:12.169> all<00:05:12.740> right<00:05:12.860> want<00:05:13.010> me<00:05:13.070> to<00:05:13.159> give<00:05:13.280> these
