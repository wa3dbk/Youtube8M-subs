formalist that is thrown at different
artists<00:00:45.469> means<00:00:45.710> that<00:00:45.949> the<00:00:46.039> work<00:00:46.219> is

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
artists means that the work is

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.299 
artists means that the work is
meaningless<00:00:46.940> empty<00:00:47.780> well<00:00:48.410> form<00:00:48.829> it<00:00:49.129> means

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
meaningless empty well form it means

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.880 
meaningless empty well form it means
everything<00:00:49.940> we<00:00:50.660> don't<00:00:50.840> make<00:00:51.140> anything<00:00:51.530> or

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
everything we don't make anything or

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.090 
everything we don't make anything or
think<00:00:52.160> anything<00:00:52.730> outside<00:00:53.269> of<00:00:53.329> a<00:00:53.719> form<00:00:54.170> and

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
think anything outside of a form and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.029 
think anything outside of a form and
form<00:00:55.640> is<00:00:55.850> also<00:00:56.079> beautiful<00:00:57.079> it's<00:00:57.649> it's

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
form is also beautiful it's it's

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.750 
form is also beautiful it's it's
intensely<00:00:58.579> beautiful<00:00:58.879> but<00:00:59.870> it's<00:01:00.019> hard<00:01:00.289> to<00:01:00.410> be

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
intensely beautiful but it's hard to be

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.530 
intensely beautiful but it's hard to be
articulate<00:01:01.760> about<00:01:02.030> why<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:03.550> I<00:01:04.550> think<00:01:05.330> it's<00:01:05.449> a

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
articulate about why and I think it's a

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.940 
articulate about why and I think it's a
little<00:01:05.600> bit<00:01:05.840> like<00:01:06.050> watching<00:01:06.350> people<00:01:06.620> play<00:01:06.800> the

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
little bit like watching people play the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.410 
little bit like watching people play the
piano

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
piano

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.270 
piano
obviously<00:01:08.420> people's<00:01:08.810> fingers<00:01:09.380> learn<00:01:09.800> how<00:01:10.250> to

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
obviously people's fingers learn how to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.040 
obviously people's fingers learn how to
play<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.700> piano<00:01:10.850> they<00:01:11.210> don't<00:01:11.390> sit<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.780> think

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
play the piano they don't sit and think

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.430 
play the piano they don't sit and think
about<00:01:12.230> each<00:01:12.590> note<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:13.840> working<00:01:14.840> with<00:01:14.990> color

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
about each note and working with color

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.950 
about each note and working with color
and<00:01:15.860> form<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.490> shape<00:01:16.850> in<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.510> way<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:17.840> I'm

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
and form and shape in the way that I'm

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.160 
and form and shape in the way that I'm
working<00:01:18.530> I<00:01:18.850> know<00:01:19.850> what<00:01:20.120> I'm<00:01:20.240> doing<00:01:20.690> at<00:01:20.900> some

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
working I know what I'm doing at some

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.640 
working I know what I'm doing at some
level<00:01:21.700> both<00:01:22.700> physically<00:01:23.510> and<00:01:23.650> conceptually

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
level both physically and conceptually

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.680 
level both physically and conceptually
there's<00:01:25.190> a<00:01:25.250> kind<00:01:25.400> of<00:01:25.430> thinking<00:01:25.910> process<00:01:26.480> that

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
there's a kind of thinking process that

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.920 
there's a kind of thinking process that
goes<00:01:26.840> on<00:01:27.140> that<00:01:27.650> I<00:01:27.710> can't<00:01:28.340> tell<00:01:28.790> you<00:01:28.970> about<00:01:29.090> it's

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
goes on that I can't tell you about it's

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.780 
goes on that I can't tell you about it's
not<00:01:30.170> like<00:01:30.230> you<00:01:30.530> know<00:01:30.620> I<00:01:30.650> can't<00:01:31.250> think<00:01:31.580> about

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
not like you know I can't think about

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.730 
not like you know I can't think about
each<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:32.510> every<00:01:32.660> one<00:01:32.870> of<00:01:33.080> those<00:01:33.320> little<00:01:33.620> tiny

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
each and every one of those little tiny

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.030 
each and every one of those little tiny
decisions<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.820> put<00:01:35.300> words<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.320> still

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
decisions and put words to it and still

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.670 
decisions and put words to it and still
work<00:01:37.580> there's<00:01:38.510> true<00:01:38.720> there's<00:01:38.930> a<00:01:38.990> lot<00:01:39.230> going<00:01:39.560> on

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
work there's true there's a lot going on
