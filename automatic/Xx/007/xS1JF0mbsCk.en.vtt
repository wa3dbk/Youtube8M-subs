spots<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:56.690> junior<00:00:57.690> Centennial's<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.680> orbit

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
spots are junior Centennial's in orbit

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.110 
spots are junior Centennial's in orbit
tower<00:00:59.570> also<00:01:00.570> three<00:01:01.260> tricksters<00:01:01.859> which<00:01:02.820> are

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
tower also three tricksters which are

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.870 
tower also three tricksters which are
Ludi<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.979> save<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> lot<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.549> pots<00:01:05.729> by

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
Ludi and you can save a lot of pots by

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.030 
Ludi and you can save a lot of pots by
training<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.270> them<00:01:06.390> because<00:01:06.540> they<00:01:06.960> only<00:01:07.710> move

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
training on them because they only move

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.910 
training on them because they only move
vertically<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.240> they<00:01:09.689> can't<00:01:10.200> really<00:01:10.380> hate<00:01:10.619> you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
vertically so they can't really hate you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.880 
vertically so they can't really hate you
so<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.610> saves<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.030> pots<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.830> honestly<00:01:13.830> if

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
so it saves you on pots and honestly if

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.380 
so it saves you on pots and honestly if
you<00:01:13.979> want<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.549> can<00:01:14.700> train<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.000> teddies<00:01:15.360> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you want to you can train on teddies and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.870 
you want to you can train on teddies and
Ludi<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> that's<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:18.869> XP<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.890> level<00:01:19.920> 30<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
Ludi so that's the XP to level 30 and

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.090 

yeah<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:58.630> then<00:02:58.930> four<00:02:59.230> on<00:02:59.350> decks<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.950> then

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
yeah and then four on decks and then

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.940 
yeah and then four on decks and then
flan<00:03:00.400> stir<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.180> that's<00:03:01.359> perfect<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.709> I'll
