00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.830
 first workouts with his 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.900
 hello first experiences hello once 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.730
 all my first impressions are 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.770
 Of course it is always great 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 something different in comparison to 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.670
 my last teams but the first 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.260
 units were really very good me 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.449
 I am very happy here in Hanover too 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.789
 The pace in the training is very high 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.789
 we are really focused 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.809
 besides, it is a dream in the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.850
 to play the Bundesliga is really 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.760
 one of the best leagues in the world 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.230
 is everything fine with me what do you know 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.050
 already about the club and the city 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.670
 Hanover 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.620
 Of course that's a tricky question 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.969
 Unfortunately for me I do not know yet 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.949
 much about the city of Hanover 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.590
 but I have everything now 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.539
 know what you have to for goals 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.719
 hannover 96 what do you want everything 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.719

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.229
 i will be there if the team is me 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.510
 i know that our team needs a lot 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.640
 Strong is we really have some very 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.290
 good players and I will try that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.290
 to help team in some games 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.080
 of course I will also for the young ones 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.970
 If there is a player, be there 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.280
 need or just ask a few 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.720
 but we will see how it comes 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.310
 I prefer to give the answers on the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.259
 place and not in front of the camera 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.000
 you can always talk a lot but im 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.380
 Finally, we want to answer the answer 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.380
 with the ball on the foot 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.299

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.299
 to you 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.320
 I know and understand a lot more than 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.030
 I was young at school 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.770
 liter and not learned english but 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.509
 German and today I speak in 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.909
 English but not in German 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.500

 and I hope that I even at one 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.770
 German teachers take a few hours 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.420
 can and then i hope i will soon 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.750
