00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.250 
different butterflies and I've tried all
of<00:06:05.650> them<00:06:06.070> and<00:06:06.190> none<00:06:06.460> of<00:06:06.490> them<00:06:06.790> will<00:06:07.000> fit<00:06:10.260> anyway

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
of them and none of them will fit anyway

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.730 
of them and none of them will fit anyway
let's<00:06:12.010> do<00:06:12.340> some<00:06:12.880> interior<00:06:13.380> decorating<00:06:14.380> we're

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
let's do some interior decorating we're

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.560 
let's do some interior decorating we're
going<00:06:14.860> to<00:06:14.920> put<00:06:15.100> some<00:06:15.130> of<00:06:15.400> these<00:06:15.490> photos<00:06:16.030> here

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
going to put some of these photos here

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.520 
going to put some of these photos here
on<00:06:16.690> this<00:06:16.810> little<00:06:17.080> stand<00:06:17.710> I<00:06:19.050> really<00:06:20.050> like<00:06:20.200> this

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
on this little stand I really like this

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.160 
on this little stand I really like this
picture<00:06:20.830> of<00:06:21.160> Fluttershy<00:06:21.990> put<00:06:22.990> this<00:06:23.260> here<00:06:25.170> if

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.170 
picture of Fluttershy put this here if

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.500 
picture of Fluttershy put this here if
we<00:06:26.440> can<00:06:26.590> get<00:06:26.710> it<00:06:26.830> to<00:06:26.860> stay<00:06:27.220> oh<00:06:27.460> it's<00:06:28.060> two<00:06:28.510> angled

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
we can get it to stay oh it's two angled

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.080 
we can get it to stay oh it's two angled
see<00:06:31.510> how<00:06:31.720> that<00:06:31.930> angles<00:06:32.500> downward<00:06:33.250> even<00:06:33.970> when

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
see how that angles downward even when

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.150 
see how that angles downward even when
it's<00:06:34.240> closed<00:06:34.600> it's<00:06:34.900> kind<00:06:35.200> of<00:06:35.260> angled<00:06:35.800> so

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 
it's closed it's kind of angled so

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.130 
it's closed it's kind of angled so
that's<00:06:36.760> kind<00:06:37.120> of<00:06:37.180> a<00:06:37.300> bummer<00:06:37.510> I<00:06:37.870> thought<00:06:38.080> I

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
that's kind of a bummer I thought I

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.400 
that's kind of a bummer I thought I
would<00:06:38.320> put<00:06:38.440> some<00:06:38.800> of<00:06:38.950> the<00:06:39.010> photos<00:06:39.250> there<00:06:39.700> but<00:06:40.060> i

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
would put some of the photos there but i

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.580 
would put some of the photos there but i
guess<00:06:41.410> not<00:06:42.330> even<00:06:43.330> the<00:06:43.450> stickers<00:06:43.900> don't<00:06:44.200> stay

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
guess not even the stickers don't stay

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.440 
guess not even the stickers don't stay
on<00:06:44.620> very<00:06:45.220> well<00:06:45.340> you<00:06:45.670> can<00:06:45.850> see<00:06:46.120> how<00:06:46.300> they're

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.450 
on very well you can see how they're

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.500 
on very well you can see how they're
kind<00:06:46.690> of<00:06:46.780> coming<00:06:47.740> off<00:06:47.950> I<00:06:48.400> guess<00:06:48.790> maybe<00:06:49.270> the

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
kind of coming off I guess maybe the

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.620 
kind of coming off I guess maybe the
nice<00:06:49.690> thing<00:06:50.020> about<00:06:50.050> that<00:06:50.530> is<00:06:50.590> that<00:06:50.890> you<00:06:51.250> could

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
nice thing about that is that you could

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.880 
nice thing about that is that you could
remove<00:06:52.630> them<00:06:52.960> and<00:06:52.990> put<00:06:53.380> them<00:06:53.410> in<00:06:53.680> different

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 
remove them and put them in different

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.520 
remove them and put them in different
places<00:06:54.370> but<00:06:55.120> they<00:06:55.630> come<00:06:55.840> off<00:06:56.050> a<00:06:56.080> little<00:06:56.260> too

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:56.530 
places but they come off a little too

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.330 
places but they come off a little too
easily<00:06:57.160> and<00:06:57.790> the<00:06:58.510> wings<00:06:58.810> are<00:06:59.200> so<00:06:59.500> difficult<00:06:59.890> to

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
easily and the wings are so difficult to

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.570 
easily and the wings are so difficult to
get<00:07:00.490> in<00:07:00.640> I<00:07:00.820> think<00:07:00.880> that<00:07:01.420> probably<00:07:02.080> a<00:07:02.620> kid<00:07:03.250> might

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
get in I think that probably a kid might

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.660 
get in I think that probably a kid might
have<00:07:03.820> a<00:07:03.850> little<00:07:04.090> trouble<00:07:04.240> with<00:07:04.660> that<00:07:05.670> overall

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:06.670 
have a little trouble with that overall

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.330 
have a little trouble with that overall
I<00:07:06.700> think<00:07:06.970> the<00:07:07.360> set<00:07:07.630> is<00:07:07.840> a<00:07:07.870> cute<00:07:08.260> idea<00:07:08.500> I<00:07:08.890> just

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
I think the set is a cute idea I just

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.070 
I think the set is a cute idea I just
wish<00:07:09.550> things<00:07:09.850> had<00:07:10.210> worked<00:07:10.240> a<00:07:10.660> little<00:07:10.780> better

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
wish things had worked a little better

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.430 
wish things had worked a little better
so<00:07:11.470> you<00:07:11.500> could<00:07:11.800> actually

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 
so you could actually

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.770 
so you could actually
use<00:07:12.530> those<00:07:12.770> cute<00:07:13.190> little<00:07:13.370> butterflies<00:07:14.180> but

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:14.780 
use those cute little butterflies but

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.150 
use those cute little butterflies but
still<00:07:15.530> it's<00:07:15.860> a<00:07:15.980> cute<00:07:16.310> set<00:07:16.670> if<00:07:17.710> you<00:07:18.710> have<00:07:18.890> any<00:07:19.070> of

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 
still it's a cute set if you have any of

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.850
