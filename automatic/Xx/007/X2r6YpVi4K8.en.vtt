00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:07.889
 yes no no I do not like to be in the 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.870
 where are we 

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:12.260
 logically that we have to leave as much 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.010
 before d 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:19.470
 from that place I think that 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.510
 we have had football moments 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.150
 that invite us to 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:31.520
 to delude ourselves that we can leave 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.890
 that position are already at the moment is in 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.280
 the campus and is being considered 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.290
 for even for the day's game 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.190
 Saturday we have not modified this mount 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:47.660
 it's like you'll know playing in the sub-20 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.059
 who has already participated I think that between 75 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.890
 and 80 minutes the last game that has been 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.710
 better sense 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.220
 that continues with evolution is missing 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.230
 still some more game in the super is 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.820
 that until there is the possibility of 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.000
 strengthen the team we are going to 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.970
 be open to that possibility and I think 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.590
 that are less than 4 or 5 days or less 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.630
 so that the last one is closed 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.400
 possibility and from there without closing 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.130
 definitely the template we were 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.450
 this period between the preseason and 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.160
 these two or three parties that we lead 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.700
 playing to evaluate situations and of 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.310
 according to that 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.840
 we evaluate our report of what is it 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.939
 we can strengthen and based on that is 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.310
 they look for alternatives and they can 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.259
 find favorably and that's what 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.890
 we believe that it has happened with jonathan for 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.409
 luck is practically without any 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.420
 sequel and today he has worked with a lot 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.130
 intensity and we believe that it will be 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.929
 available for next week if 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.700
 not if there is no problem there 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.560
 others who deliver with us after 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.250
 they go down to play the substitute and we try 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.270
 to observe all this within 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.030
 that group of players and I think the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.189
 the greatest complication goes through 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.170
 control the urgencies that we 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.050
 we know to control the anxiety that 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.320
 we have of 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.190
 and leave that awkward position that neither 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.490
 me or the players we like to be 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.210
 and from there try to impose 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.819
 our game I think that 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.970
 the last game we could 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.750
 in large part of d 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.440
 of the party impose what we want and 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.210
 that we do not win because of an issue 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.360
 fortuitous 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.510
 and we will try to 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.850
 that in this opportunity making a 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.480
 equal or similar game 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.060
 helped us a little bit to give a little more to 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.080
 be able to compete with all two teams 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.880
 and I am convinced that they have given me 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.400
 shows that we have the potential to 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.450
 leave to never last state like 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.350
 coach I do not like is 5 - uncomfortable and 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.860
 we have to 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.420
 to get out of this position regardless of 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.420
 that's the part of the job 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.820
 group day to day with the players and 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.840
 we're 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.800
 happy and convinced that this 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.330
 team has to be above I'm 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.880
 happy that we have given a sample of 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:35.020
 rebellion in the last game where 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.420
 it is difficult to impose the domain that 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.060
 we imposed playing as a visitor 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.160
 before a rival who had the need 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.610
 also to score points 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.520
 and the team with a domino authority 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.030
 at pleasure practically 90 minutes 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.370
 so that I did not tell myself previously 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.080
 invites me to hope that 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.450
 we are going to be in the place that 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.790
 we pretend our mentality always 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:05.020
 it's the same not to play at home and outside 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.320
 in the same way if we believe that the 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.580
 public have already demonstrated it plays a 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.150
 important role and we need 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.810
 that are 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:20.269
 and supporting us to 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.269
 to help us win the game
