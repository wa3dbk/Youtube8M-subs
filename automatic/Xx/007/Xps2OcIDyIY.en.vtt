00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.540 

then<00:05:17.380> I<00:05:17.470> go<00:05:17.590> to<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.800> screen<00:05:18.010> matte<00:05:18.190> section

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
then I go to the screen matte section

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.980 
then I go to the screen matte section
and<00:05:18.790> take<00:05:18.910> a<00:05:18.940> look<00:05:19.150> at<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.330> clip<00:05:19.570> black<00:05:19.690> and

clip<00:05:20.140> white<00:05:20.350> values<00:05:20.710> now<00:05:21.070> these<00:05:21.190> values<00:05:21.370> will

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
clip white values now these values will

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.550 
clip white values now these values will
vary<00:05:21.700> between<00:05:22.060> different<00:05:22.270> projects<00:05:22.930> but<00:05:23.470> I'd

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
vary between different projects but I'd

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.990 
vary between different projects but I'd
like<00:05:23.710> to<00:05:23.830> clip<00:05:23.980> my<00:05:24.100> whites<00:05:24.310> between<00:05:24.640> 50<00:05:24.970> and

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
like to clip my whites between 50 and

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.900 
like to clip my whites between 50 and
100<00:05:25.480> and<00:05:25.840> my<00:05:25.960> blacks<00:05:26.200> between<00:05:26.530> 0<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:26.860> 40<00:05:27.070> the

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
more you clip the whites the more

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.660 
more you clip the whites the more
natural<00:05:29.320> your<00:05:29.680> image<00:05:29.920> will<00:05:30.070> look<00:05:30.190> against<00:05:30.490> its

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
natural your image will look against its

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.550 
natural your image will look against its
background<00:05:30.730> but<00:05:31.540> also<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.990> more<00:05:32.170> you<00:05:32.290> will<00:05:32.410> be

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
background but also the more you will be

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.200 
background but also the more you will be

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
able to see through the foreground so

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.430 
able to see through the foreground so
you<00:05:34.270> have<00:05:34.420> to<00:05:34.540> be<00:05:34.630> careful<00:05:34.990> clipping<00:05:35.350> the

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
you have to be careful clipping the

you have to be careful clipping the
blacks<00:05:35.620> works<00:05:35.890> in<00:05:35.980> the<00:05:36.070> same<00:05:36.250> way<00:05:36.400> except<00:05:37.000> the

a<00:05:48.580> completely<00:05:48.880> different<00:05:49.000> color<00:05:51.750> finally<00:05:52.750> I

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
a completely different color finally I

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.620 
a completely different color finally I
put<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:53.230> screen<00:05:53.470> softness<00:05:53.860> at<00:05:54.040> 0.5<00:05:54.550> and<00:05:55.510> that

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
put the screen softness at 0.5 and that

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.670 
put the screen softness at 0.5 and that
should<00:05:55.780> give<00:05:55.900> you<00:05:55.990> a<00:05:56.020> general<00:05:56.410> idea<00:05:56.440> for
