like<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.560> said<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:33.040> me<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.400> thought<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.730> looked

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
like I said on me I thought it looked

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.540 
like I said on me I thought it looked
like<00:02:34.120> tiger-stripe<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:35.020> unnatural<00:02:35.620> so

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
like tiger-stripe in unnatural so

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.040 
like tiger-stripe in unnatural so
because<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:36.940> didn't<00:02:37.240> like<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.600> dyed<00:02:37.840> my<00:02:37.870> hair

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
because I didn't like it I dyed my hair

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.420 
because I didn't like it I dyed my hair
brown<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:39.960> loved<00:02:40.960> that<00:02:41.050> for<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.470> while<00:02:41.710> but<00:02:42.130> I

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
brown and I loved that for a while but I

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.460 
brown and I loved that for a while but I
didn't<00:02:42.820> do<00:02:43.000> anything<00:02:43.030> with<00:02:43.450> my<00:02:43.690> hair<00:02:43.930> after

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
didn't do anything with my hair after

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.810 
didn't do anything with my hair after
that<00:02:44.500> because<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.370> just<00:02:47.520> didn't<00:02:48.520> want<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.670> keep

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
that because I just didn't want to keep

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.190 
that because I just didn't want to keep
touching<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.210> didn't<00:02:49.420> wanna<00:02:49.540> keep<00:02:49.660> diet

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
touching it didn't wanna keep diet

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
important part of the whole hair process

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.410 
important part of the whole hair process
is<00:03:58.450> actually<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:59.019> toner<00:03:59.290> that<00:03:59.530> he<00:03:59.680> uses<00:04:00.209> so<00:04:01.209> on

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
is actually the toner that he uses so on

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.550 
is actually the toner that he uses so on
me<00:04:01.630> uses<00:04:02.110> specific<00:04:02.830> toner<00:04:03.160> that<00:04:03.940> is<00:04:04.239> going<00:04:04.450> to

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
me uses specific toner that is going to

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.020 
me uses specific toner that is going to
allow<00:04:05.560> me<00:04:05.769> to<00:04:05.920> achieve<00:04:06.070> a<00:04:06.459> really<00:04:06.700> creamy

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
allow me to achieve a really creamy

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.570 
allow me to achieve a really creamy
honey<00:04:07.690> blonde<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.410> that's<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.430> most

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
honey blonde and that's the most

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.190 
honey blonde and that's the most
important<00:04:10.060> part<00:04:10.330> of<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:10.660> so<00:04:10.870> it's<00:04:11.049> not

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
important part of it so it's not

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.080 
important part of it so it's not
actually<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.830> hair<00:04:12.010> dye<00:04:12.250> itself<00:04:12.670> it's<00:04:12.880> the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
actually the hair dye itself it's the

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.630 
actually the hair dye itself it's the
toner<00:04:13.360> he<00:04:13.570> uses<00:04:13.900> after<00:04:14.110> he<00:04:14.500> dies<00:04:14.680> my<00:04:14.890> so<00:04:15.370> when<00:04:15.610> I

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
toner he uses after he dies my so when I

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.460 
toner he uses after he dies my so when I
got<00:04:15.850> my<00:04:15.970> haircut<00:04:16.209> I<00:04:16.450> went<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:16.930> as<00:04:17.080> well<00:04:17.260> and

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
got my haircut I went to you as well and

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.259 
got my haircut I went to you as well and
he<00:04:17.590> put<00:04:17.830> quite<00:04:18.070> a<00:04:18.130> lot<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.400> through<00:04:18.580> a<00:04:18.729> texture

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
he put quite a lot of through a texture

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:19.979 
he put quite a lot of through a texture
through<00:04:19.450> my<00:04:19.600> hair

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
through my hair

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.300 
through my hair
he<00:04:20.380> put<00:04:20.650> quite<00:04:20.950> a<00:04:21.010> lot<00:04:21.130> of<00:04:21.220> layering<00:04:21.519> not

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
he put quite a lot of layering not

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.940 
he put quite a lot of layering not
but<00:04:22.850> just<00:04:23.030> texture<00:04:23.480> through<00:04:23.660> my<00:04:23.780> hair<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.200> I

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
but just texture through my hair and I

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.430 
but just texture through my hair and I
think<00:04:25.190> it<00:04:25.310> just<00:04:25.520> suits<00:04:25.970> long<00:04:26.690> bulbs<00:04:27.020> much<00:04:27.200> more

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
think it just suits long bulbs much more

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.020 
think it just suits long bulbs much more
because<00:04:27.740> it<00:04:27.860> just<00:04:27.980> gives<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.400> texture

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
because it just gives you that texture

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.659 
because it just gives you that texture
and<00:04:29.210> that<00:04:29.419> nice<00:04:30.139> framing<00:04:30.889> of<00:04:31.190> your<00:04:31.370> face

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
and that nice framing of your face

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.350 
and that nice framing of your face
without<00:04:32.419> it<00:04:32.570> being<00:04:32.780> too<00:04:33.100> jagged<00:04:34.100> but<00:04:34.790> yeah<00:04:35.030> so

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
without it being too jagged but yeah so

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.629 
without it being too jagged but yeah so
basically<00:04:35.720> that's<00:04:36.260> what<00:04:36.590> we<00:04:36.800> do

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
basically that's what we do

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.210 
basically that's what we do
hope<00:04:37.850> I've<00:04:38.060> been<00:04:38.110> slightly<00:04:39.110> insightful<00:04:39.919> I've

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540
