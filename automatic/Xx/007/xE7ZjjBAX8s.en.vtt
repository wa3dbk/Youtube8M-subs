defense<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.540> track<00:00:57.810> and<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.980> take<00:00:59.220> it<00:00:59.310> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
defense on track and really take it to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.830 
defense on track and really take it to
them<00:00:59.610> in<00:00:59.760> there<00:00:59.910> before<00:01:00.030> they're<00:01:00.510> looking<00:01:00.720> for

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840

them in there before they're looking for
wins<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.079> think<00:01:01.110> we<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.440> still<00:01:01.649> qualify<00:01:02.100> if

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
wins I think we can still qualify if

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.579 
wins I think we can still qualify if
they<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.390> win<00:01:03.630> over<00:01:03.810> the<00:01:03.930> last<00:01:04.049> two<00:01:04.199> games<00:01:04.229> so

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
they do I win over the last two games so

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.679 
they do I win over the last two games so
we<00:01:05.280> need<00:01:05.399> definitely<00:01:05.549> hopefully<00:01:06.360> put<00:01:06.509> it<00:01:06.570> down

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
we need definitely hopefully put it down

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.480 
we need definitely hopefully put it down
for<00:01:06.840> damper<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.799> play<00:01:08.310> our<00:01:08.460> game

our season back on track well you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.530 
our season back on track well you
obviously<00:01:11.040> where<00:01:11.460> revenge<00:01:11.700> you'll<00:01:12.149> be<00:01:12.270> high

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
on their approaches yeah certainly I

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.520

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
think last time we caught them slide

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.260 
think last time we caught them slide
nothing<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.130> had<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> really<00:01:17.579> good<00:01:17.700> game<00:01:17.880> our

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
nothing we had a really good game our

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.690 
nothing we had a really good game our
defense<00:01:18.569> was<00:01:18.749> cracking<00:01:19.340> which<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.490> need<00:01:20.639> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
defense was cracking which we need to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.149 
defense was cracking which we need to
repeat<00:01:21.030> obviously<00:01:21.539> come<00:01:21.840> out<00:01:21.960> firing<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
repeat obviously come out firing the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.609 
repeat obviously come out firing the
nord<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.609> expect<00:01:23.939> hopefully<00:01:24.929> was<00:01:25.079> what<00:01:25.319> we're

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
nord a expect hopefully was what we're

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.190
