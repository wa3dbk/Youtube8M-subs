00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.529
 and that has it but good nothing at all 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.529
 sometimes when he pulls the same 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.559
 like in the movies 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.620
 I do not see you 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:31.490
 - a technique of the best since 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.370
 could show that there is a factual take 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.199
 proved much more very effective than 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.199
 a person just like you can from some 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.199
 decrease 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 then come on let's go 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.269
 look look einstein let's imagine 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.620
 let's go to the program can not play 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:00.480
 it's just super important to be clear that 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.129
 when we go to a combat at 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.659
 ground 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.580
 one has that one has to some 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.200
 way to be clear that you never have to 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:15.200
 try to stay down always look 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.200
 be up and let's face 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.830
 one leg and I will pull towards me 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.690
 to the rest of conditions like graceland 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.360
 that I did the end of avenue is 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.060
 clear of advantage because I say it of 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.920
 look is to pass my leg over his 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.220
 leg to find a mounted position 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.220
 hand 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.140
 or not 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.010
 I will hug our young people not 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.170
 could be like this this has nothing to do with 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.710
 force or nothing did not see us hard today 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.710
 surely this section of now 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.250
 didactic 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:01.510
 and here is low hand 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.130
 no no 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:16.750
 and what will happen to you and that is going to 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.750
 do that 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:33.500
 and never again and always you go down first 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.500
 to keep the distance possible 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.310
 Leg 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.090
 I did not know him 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.090
 for two days 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:59.750
 the name of the first 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:02.750
 then the arrival inks 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.750
 big 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:17.090
 up what happens then 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.130
 Thank you 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:51.550
 in this environment where the houses 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.870
 I did not want to ask if truth 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.470
 true the game and the class 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.470
 personal 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.830
