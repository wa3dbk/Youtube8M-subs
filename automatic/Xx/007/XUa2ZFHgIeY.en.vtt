00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.380
 decided to make a letter 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:14.820
 fixtures to face 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:26.660
 the bars on the frame are racing 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:30.929
 side topmost bar 252 250 la 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.840
 220 can be the whole thing of course 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.129
 circulars 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:42.710
 do know almost mechanically 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.710
 hacksaw selling it is safer and 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.680
 when not in a hurry you can mix 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:54.449
 do where there is no electricity yet there 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:59.660
 I can easily take the line from me 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:06.229
 Made from 50 boards 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:15.409
 one hundred fifty fifty fifty also 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:16.920
 25 to 120 top to put stamps 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.290
 it's me 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.500
 limiters so say i to manual 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.479
 the hacksaw didn't walk here in little I 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.700
 decided to make limiters so here 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.500
 very convenient put him a facing and 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:40.909
 can saw off and so I took straight 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.909
 right angle is already 10 wheels and straight from 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.720
 railing 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.430
 of course some will say easier 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:01.710
 circular but it shows 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:14.700
 who does not have a circular as I do now to me 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:17.569
 it is necessary to make the size limit and the first 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:32.780
 we have a small frame 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:35.780
 135 on the floor frame measure 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.780
 135 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:47.580
 further we have already nested frame 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.580
 i.e. 290 millimeters 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:15.580
 then you need to use the lower bar 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.810
 for this for frame that is 41 with 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:24.760
 halves lower ramps so as calculating 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:30.900
 I take not 8 millimeters side plate 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:33.180
 and 10 millimeters would be good so 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:39.240
 lower bar 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.240
 then another 470 do the last size 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:05.910
 4 sizes this is what is 35 millimeters here 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:13.110
 290 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:19.359
 29 centimeters that is here and 415 ointment 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:22.810
 470 here are the dimensions go to processing 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:26.130
 frame standard frame on 300 and on the floor 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:30.010
 frame 145 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:35.710
 other sizes are not needed here in order 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:37.390
 to make a limiter here that is 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:44.880
 I need to make it small 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:47.080
 framed by a hundred and thirty five millimeters i 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:52.900
 adapted here such here 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:55.960
 gadgets made four 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:00.690
 gadgets made found such loops 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.200
 I was at home took an ordinary corner 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.319
 some in hand 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:11.830
 approaches 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:16.410
 I cut God out of him so that she lay down 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.410
 child and welded 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:55.589
 check to my 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:06:03.599
 and we also fix to the network solution 135 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:06:07.369
 the size of the healthy will now try 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.369
 make blanks 

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:22.189
 danced and turn him over 90 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:39.550
 plank cut size ready 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:42.940
 so all the slats what size is needed 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:46.270
 open and close there and at the gate 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:49.810
 and here is such a simple device 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:53.250
 always come in handy somewhere was not 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.740
 it's not hard to take with you and 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.740
 to use 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.740
 good luck
