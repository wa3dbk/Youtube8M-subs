into<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:28.080> location<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:28.680> perhaps<00:00:28.949> trying

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
into this location here perhaps trying

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.730 
into this location here perhaps trying
to<00:00:29.609> do<00:00:29.730> some<00:00:30.000> mineral<00:00:30.420> scouting<00:00:30.869> mineral

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
to do some mineral scouting mineral

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.470 
to do some mineral scouting mineral
scouting<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.189> when<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.579> take<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> unit<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.390> you

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
scouting is when you take a unit and you

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.810 
scouting is when you take a unit and you
try<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> scout<00:00:34.079> out<00:00:34.320> your<00:00:34.530> opponent<00:00:35.040> by<00:00:35.399> trying

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
try to scout out your opponent by trying

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.690 
try to scout out your opponent by trying
to<00:00:35.910> see<00:00:36.180> where<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.660> gold<00:00:36.989> where<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.309> minerals

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
to see where the gold where the minerals

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.090 
to see where the gold where the minerals
are<00:00:38.760> actually<00:00:39.149> being<00:00:39.690> mined<00:00:40.440> from<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.710> oh<00:00:40.860> no

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
are actually being mined from and oh no

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.740 
are actually being mined from and oh no
just<00:00:41.370> doing<00:00:41.579> perhaps<00:00:41.910> setting<00:00:42.090> up<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.300> proxy

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
just doing perhaps setting up a proxy

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.139 
just doing perhaps setting up a proxy
pylon<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.579> he's<00:00:44.789> doing<00:00:44.910> a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
pylon and that is it so he's doing a

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.139 
pylon and that is it so he's doing a
blind<00:00:45.510> gateway<00:00:46.170> now<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.190> works<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.850> metal

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149

proxy pylon down here he can get some

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.340 
proxy pylon down here he can get some
gateways<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.970> running<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.510> then<00:01:06.990> chrono

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
gateways up and running and then chrono

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.230 
gateways up and running and then chrono
boost<00:01:07.619> them<00:01:07.830> straight<00:01:08.220> into<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> base<00:01:08.790> taking

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
boost them straight into the base taking

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.750 
boost them straight into the base taking
a<00:01:09.420> look<00:01:09.540> back<00:01:09.659> over<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:10.020> gt1<00:01:10.590> not<00:01:11.250> getting

a look back over here gt1 not getting
any<00:01:11.939> additional<00:01:12.360> probes<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:13.020> he<00:01:13.260> has<00:01:13.290> are

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
any additional probes so all he has are

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.160 
any additional probes so all he has are
these<00:01:13.979> 9<00:01:14.310> probes<00:01:14.700> currently<00:01:15.180> mining<00:01:15.630> away<00:01:15.930> and

another gateway could be amble warped in

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.990 
another gateway could be amble warped in
in<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.930> moment<00:01:19.350> wait<00:01:20.220> for<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.610> second

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
in just a moment wait for that second

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.730 
in just a moment wait for that second
gateway<00:01:21.299> as<00:01:21.630> soon<00:01:21.840> as<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.049> second<00:01:22.500> gateway

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740

gateway as soon as that second gateway
is<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:23.100> most<00:01:23.340> likely<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.700> probe<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.210> gonna<00:01:24.390> try

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
is up most likely the probe is gonna try

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.749 
is up most likely the probe is gonna try
to<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:24.990> some<00:01:25.200> scouting<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:26.040> probe<00:01:26.340> over<00:01:26.580> here

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
to do some scouting this probe over here

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.120 
to do some scouting this probe over here
is<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.270> make<00:01:27.689> its<00:01:27.869> way<00:01:28.020> over<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.590> then

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
is going to make its way over and then

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.880 
is going to make its way over and then
pretty<00:01:29.400> much<00:01:29.600> see<00:01:30.600> what<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.020> doesn't<00:01:31.320> want<00:01:31.530> to

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
pretty much see what it doesn't want to

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.890 
pretty much see what it doesn't want to
see<00:01:32.070> an<00:01:32.280> empty<00:01:32.549> base<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.720> an

see an empty base and that is an

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.480 
see an empty base and that is an

absolute absolute nightmare the probe
now<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> come<00:01:36.000> inside<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.479> knows

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.179 
now going to come inside here knows
there<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.229> nothing<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:37.799> come<00:01:38.040> back

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
there is nothing and then come back

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.490 
there is nothing and then come back
around<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.090> see<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.540> mana<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.140> trying

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
out in 10 to 15 seconds earlier also he

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.990 
out in 10 to 15 seconds earlier also he
could<00:04:04.380> have<00:04:04.500> done<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.770> number<00:04:05.430> of<00:04:05.610> different

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
could have done a number of different

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.280 
could have done a number of different
options<00:04:06.150> as<00:04:06.540> well<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:06.870> would<00:04:07.020> have<00:04:07.110> worked

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
options as well that would have worked

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.340 
options as well that would have worked
out<00:04:07.440> much<00:04:08.070> much<00:04:08.370> better<00:04:08.550> for<00:04:08.850> him<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.209> yes<00:04:09.450> gt1

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
out much much better for him so yes gt1

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.250 
out much much better for him so yes gt1
