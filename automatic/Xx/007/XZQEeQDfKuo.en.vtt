00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.410
 do not 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.059
 good your fears to a new good video 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.549
 at the sound of platinum number 83 and 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.920
 in addition to the new rock &amp; patch 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.890
 click basically for it will be a video then 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.199
 that I will comment on the two things 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.820
 the patch is 1.0 3 and is living from 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.410
 background then the good of rock &amp; light in 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.450
 the one that I have to give more of all times 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.980
 round and round and round for 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.480
 get the last trophy that I get 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.400
 it was missing that was the kilometers that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.140
 is the most fucking heavy and that like a 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.719
 total of 500 kilometers for the 80 or 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.030
 so it skips now no longer with this 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.069
 patch not now direct from the notes of 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.350
 patch and others and good appears other but 

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:43.109
 What I did was with a couple of rubber bands 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.649
 give the address and something and the button 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.749
 to accelerate another way there's no reason why 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.399
 because in the online it did not count 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.620
 now he has this patch now 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.269
 will explain a bit how it goes and therefore 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.739
 it would be heavy if I had counted too 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.510
 play online and so on, good without 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.789
 No problem he ends up taking out for him 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.980
 over time but playing only offline 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.540
 Well, it was a bit of a pain 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.100
 so nothing we are going to explain what 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.470
 makes this patch while you see me 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.880
 going around with fucking assholes and 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.110
 well let's go to the chat commands 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.170
 fast can now be used between 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.700
 ps4 pc platforms then also in the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.680
 bot skin now fits the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.150
 level of players if you quit 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.060
 a starting match will be banned 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.540
 for 15 minutes in the matchmaking 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.250
 added 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.960
 in steam has added the sensitivity of 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.630
 mouse in fits in steam also has me 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.040
 gone the support for more resolutions and 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.990
 then also the statistics of 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.400
 won and lost are now shown two 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.950
 in a correct percentage too 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.880
 corrected most errors 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.990
 corrected flags and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.940
 translations some translations 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.440
 wrong some flags of usa that 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.660
 I think I had fewer stars than 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.270
 normal then one or the other was 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.979
 rotated is turned around and I think the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.659
 Mexico was bad too and the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.399
 evolutions too 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.409
 looking and searching in all 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.509
 regions I was looking for in all the 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.249
 religions good a translation is a 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.479
 little bad done then also the trophy 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:03.130
 of the kilometers can now be done 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.170
 also online and has also been corrected 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.759
 the distance that is a bit a bitch 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.560
 quite big but good is added 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.879
 also the one that can be done online what 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.290
 good that in order to finished the house taking out 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.700
 because the line is fun the way 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.950
 history because I know that this is 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.709
 we're getting pretty tired so nothing 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.510
 Well, basically, I think the patch 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.069
 Weighed a gig and peak is quite heavy 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.580
 the patch for what are we going to fool 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.170
 it is very heavy is not it is a giga 800 or so 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.299
 writing now shows delayed a 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.519
 little in download by the way the fucked 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.069
 patch so nothing more is 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.140
 living now in a ratillo as jumps 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.049
 the platinum the platinum is the number 83 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.230
 as or to repeat already are 88 thousand 58 in the 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.239
 40 trophies to see if to a kind of 8 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.150
 thousand trophies and showed a little bit how they go 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.609
 how do they all go and I have some 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.349
 look for another one to take it out too 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.690
 the deadly combat is about to be left 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.700
 little but good is more expensive because 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.859
 I have to raise the faction to level 50 goes 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.510
 to cost a chicken then also the one 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.200
 fifa is also almost ready but 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.670
 some trophy 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.970
 of mark before the ground that is a 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.500
 putada then also the one of the sun I call by 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.840
 cent is also about what happens 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.980
 is that it's also a bit of a plague bitch 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.810
 because you have to be a lot of level 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.640
 but there are several that are 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.890
 dot to dot to dot to oblivion 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.780
 the platinums that you know but when not 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.180
 I feel overwhelmed because I do not take it out and that's it or 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.459
 is not a thing that I miss I am not 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.140
 a hunter there have been trophies has like 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.610
 any shit is not the game I like 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.130
 because he did not try to take me out but he is 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.060
 very heavy because it is impossible for example 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.650
 the batman 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.970
 I would like to get it out but it's done to me 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.370
 uphill to look for all the trophies 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.989
 the riddler and others but it's a game that 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.420
 yes I have pending but also 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.260
 we go as I say with patience and until 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.760
 more and if I can not then I can not and period 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.950
 what interests me is also 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.730
 try the different games that there are and 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.959
 It is done 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.489
 so well nothing more guys this has 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.269
 been everything and nothing else we go in the next 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.269
 video until next time
