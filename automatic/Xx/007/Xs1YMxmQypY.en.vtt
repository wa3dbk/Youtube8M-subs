team<00:02:43.830> in<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.130> future<00:02:44.550> but<00:02:44.820> i<00:02:44.970> don't<00:02:45.090> think<00:02:45.300> i

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
team in the future but i don't think i

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.290 
team in the future but i don't think i
would<00:02:45.450> right<00:02:45.780> now<00:02:46.010> because<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.340> have<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.940> lot

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
would right now because I have a lot

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.210 
would right now because I have a lot
like<00:02:48.540> going<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:49.020> at<00:02:49.230> my<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.410> don't<00:02:49.650> want<00:02:50.160> to

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
like going on at my I don't want to

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.770 
like going on at my I don't want to
focus<00:02:50.370> on<00:02:50.610> phase<00:02:50.880> I<00:02:51.120> don't<00:02:51.270> want<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.450> focus<00:02:51.570> on

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
focus on phase I don't want to focus on

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.040 
focus on phase I don't want to focus on
a<00:02:51.840> completely<00:02:52.320> different<00:02:52.440> team<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.990> I

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
a completely different team so and I

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.240 
a completely different team so and I
want<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.230> focus<00:02:55.350> on<00:02:55.530> my<00:02:55.650> own<00:02:55.770> channel<00:02:56.160> as<00:02:56.220> well

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
want to focus on my own channel as well

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.550 
want to focus on my own channel as well
so<00:02:56.640> even<00:02:57.360> if<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.540> did<00:02:57.780> lead<00:02:57.960> a<00:02:57.990> team<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.380> now<00:02:58.530> I

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
so even if I did lead a team I now I

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.410 
so even if I did lead a team I now I
would<00:02:58.830> probably<00:02:59.130> be<00:02:59.220> co-leading<00:02:59.790> I<00:03:00.090> wouldn't

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
would probably be co-leading I wouldn't

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.960 
would probably be co-leading I wouldn't
call<00:03:00.720> them<00:03:00.870> like<00:03:01.200> take<00:03:01.950> any<00:03:02.130> major<00:03:02.610> leader

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
call them like take any major leader

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.290 
call them like take any major leader
position<00:03:03.540> boom<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:05.010> yeah<00:03:05.520> that's<00:03:05.730> what<00:03:05.910> that's

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
position boom so yeah that's what that's

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.720 
position boom so yeah that's what that's
what<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:07.320> institute<00:03:07.770> question<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:08.340> probably

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
what that institute question so probably

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.490 
what that institute question so probably
in<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.030> future<00:03:09.420> but<00:03:09.690> definitely<00:03:10.290> not<00:03:10.350> right

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
in the future but definitely not right

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.630 
in the future but definitely not right
now<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.790> then<00:03:12.270> last<00:03:12.750> question<00:03:13.260> from<00:03:13.640> dere
