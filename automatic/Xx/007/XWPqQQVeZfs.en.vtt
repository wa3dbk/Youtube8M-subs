00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:14.930
 The mobile app is a whole is Anne Three is the biggest weakness of hd rmv 1 today 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:20.960
 I talked about 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:25.099
 In this time, I will talk about the other minor weaknesses and the points I want you to improve. 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.250
 Mu first is around the battery and the catalog spec 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.860
 This is a storage bag 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.400
 You can shoot 120 minutes with b, but sometimes you want to go longer 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.820
 Ne 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:45.690
 So I want you to be able to shoot while supplying power using such a mobile battery 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.240
 Well there is an easy way to get around that problem, but the maker officially supports it 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.000
 I want you to 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:58.000
 Nyu- Speaking of long time shooting, 4 gig limit is also a problem 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.430
 One of the file is more than the ki and this guy also automatically once the stop of 6 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.020
 Recording will start again 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.230
 I myself quite important for people who are doing music but I'm not in trouble at all 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.940
 It is a point 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:14.760
 That's more than Sony's problem 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.360
 As a technical outside but I do not know I surely better planning issues are intertwined in various ways 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.700
 Also 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:24.060
 It is good to be solved, but it is provided for free from it already 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.930
 Video editing software nvr studio 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:34.300
 8 It is this software does not have to introduce that I used once in my videos 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:37.120
 A little bit nail or apply reverb and that say scoop read is basically 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:42.250
 It's a much that can say to change or 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:48.950
 So I think it would be nice to be able to do simple cut edits 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:54.890
 Well , I'm looking forward to future updates I would like to have Wind Jammer available as an option 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:58.250
 In other words, mv 1 is built on the premise that it is used indoors, so it is outdoors 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.929
 Wind noise will come in violently when used 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:07.759
 So I'm making my own windy way but I still make it 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.940
 I do not look good for a moment, I hope you want out with genuine options 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.150
 The cool guy 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:18.300
 This guy I made thank you in about 2000 yen 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:23.800
 Music video recorder probably individuals are made in order to say that easy to take the music 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:27.730
 Of course I want to use even street musicians 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.390
 It is an extravagant request that causes unreasonableness from here 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:36.250
 First of all I want you to have an electronic level 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:41.170
 mv 1 is a bit hard to get water mud There is a grid line in the body for the time being 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.790
 However, because it looks like this from the side of the liquid crystal , it is difficult to do it 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.230
 If possible, even if equipped with electronic level 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:52.099
 I think it would be nice to see it on the smartphone side 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:58.310
 I want you to have a camera shake correction 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:59.209
 After all I think that it is made on the assumption that it is fixed and used with such a mini tripod, but I 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.780
 After all 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:07.980
 I want to take out more and more, so I want a camera shake correction 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:11.010
 Because it is also equipped with a smaller action cam than this 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:18.390
 I think that technically it is not so difficult 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:23.800
 How do I use mv 1 as an external microphone Here's a line in terminal 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:28.600
 I'll bring another microphone, so there is an audio input from here 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:31.480
 It can be recorded and I'd like to vice versa I guess 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:37.330
 Since this microphone is what too performance is good 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.379
 I would like to line out from here and connect to another camera and use it as an external microphone 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.590
 I think 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:46.480
 People who have nv 1 have a fairly high probability 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:51.129
 I think I have a video camera and digital SLR , I want to improve their sound quality 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.470
 Even if you think about it , buying new bikes and linear pcm recorders 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.060
 Peck 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:00.170
 I think that the hurdle is high If you can use it, it is already more 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:04.940
 It is more than I think you a wider range of applications 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:09.260
 Well there are other things in detail but I think I could say all the important things 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.490
 The specs of the zoom q 4 that came out later are also quite high 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.540
 Then also Canon's ivis mini 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:20.010
 The sound quality has been enhanced and the successor has been announced 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.000
 At first I thought it was a very niche market, but in this field too hot 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.130
 It has become 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:31.480
 Nari successor to update was not 's end also I put lots of guy Sony 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:33.720
 Nari issue I want to go to grow this area more and more it is 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.720
 Follow 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.270
