what the doctors and nurses are doing

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.970 
what the doctors and nurses are doing

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
but I try not to think about the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.680 
but I try not to think about the
operation<00:00:26.490> itself<00:00:26.849> because<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.779> scares<00:00:28.140> me

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.970

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
reality is math you shouldn't be dead

the worst category and then if you

cuber<00:01:00.469> after<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:00.890> first<00:01:01.129> operation<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.790> put

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
you in the worst case i mean you can't

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.680 
you in the worst case i mean you can't
get<00:01:03.620> any<00:01:04.159> worse<00:01:04.399> than<00:01:04.430> that<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:04.850> really<00:01:05.149> he<00:01:05.330> his

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
get any worse than that so really he his

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.900 
get any worse than that so really he his
chance<00:01:05.990> of<00:01:06.110> survival<00:01:06.649> was<00:01:06.830> measured<00:01:07.610> in<00:01:07.700> terms

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
chance of survival was measured in terms

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.200 
chance of survival was measured in terms
of<00:01:08.179> less<00:01:08.390> than<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.840> 1%<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:10.070> then<00:01:10.460> when<00:01:11.060> he<00:01:11.119> got

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
of less than a 1% and then when he got

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.419 
of less than a 1% and then when he got
recurrence<00:01:11.780> years<00:01:12.320> and<00:01:12.530> years<00:01:12.649> later<00:01:12.920> one

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
recurrence years and years later one

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:14.919 
recurrence years and years later one
would<00:01:13.640> think<00:01:13.880> that<00:01:13.940> that<00:01:14.149> would<00:01:14.330> spell<00:01:14.720> the

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
would think that that would spell the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:17.410 
would think that that would spell the
end<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.440> that<00:01:15.560> means<00:01:15.800> that<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.190> tumor<00:01:16.460> is<00:01:16.610> you

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
end and that means that the tumor is you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.300 
end and that means that the tumor is you
know<00:01:17.539> resistant<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.110> all<00:01:18.289> therapies<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.190> it's

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
know resistant to all therapies and it's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.469 
know resistant to all therapies and it's
going<00:01:19.429> to<00:01:19.520> come<00:01:19.670> back<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.179> it's<00:01:20.300> going<00:01:20.420> to

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
going to come back and it's going to

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.410 
going to come back and it's going to
kill<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:20.840> quickly<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:21.850> he<00:01:22.850> survived<00:01:23.210> another

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
kill you quickly and he survived another

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.130 
kill you quickly and he survived another
two<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:23.869> half<00:01:24.020> years<00:01:24.440> with<00:01:25.159> recurrent

two and a half years with recurrent

two and a half years with recurrent
malignant<00:01:27.140> chairman<00:01:29.050> so<00:01:30.460> he<00:01:31.460> really<00:01:31.729> has

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
malignant chairman so he really has

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:57.640 
malignant chairman so he really has
defied<00:01:32.300> all<00:01:32.479> odds

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.190

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
even with cutting-edge technology one

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.899 
even with cutting-edge technology one
tumor<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.950> proving<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.790> real<00:02:03.150> challenge

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
tumor is proving to be a real challenge

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.280 
tumor is proving to be a real challenge
this<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> really<00:02:06.390> dangerous<00:02:06.600> one<00:02:06.900> man<00:02:07.080> all

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
this is a really dangerous one man all

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.390 
this is a really dangerous one man all
this<00:02:07.440> white<00:02:08.069> tissue<00:02:08.459> here<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.940> brain<00:02:09.179> stem

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
this white tissue here is brain stem

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.470 
this white tissue here is brain stem
it's<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.180> very<00:02:12.450> crucial<00:02:13.730> unfortunately<00:02:14.730> it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
it's all very crucial unfortunately it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.820 
it's all very crucial unfortunately it
has<00:02:15.720> full<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.260> invaded<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> brain<00:02:17.250> stem<00:02:17.550> again

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
has full of invaded the brain stem again

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.350 
has full of invaded the brain stem again
so<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:20.250> not<00:02:20.400> as<00:02:20.520> if<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:20.880> peel<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.239> off

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
so it's not as if you can peel it off

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.490 
so it's not as if you can peel it off
with<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.630> distinctive<00:02:22.080> you've<00:02:22.260> got<00:02:22.410> to
