00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.980
 another one of the site's 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.380
 the user games personal has some warnings 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.860
 For you, that's why this blog 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.780
 I'm upset here, man, I'm sad if 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.420
 can see that today on the channel we go 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.449
 have four videos as usual because 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.980
 if the bush you did not record because it matures 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.289
 you from my afternoon 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.710
 if you were unable to record your videos 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.050
 people know me preparing to edit the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.710
 videos of the channel and behold in the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.840
 time to play videos on sony vegas 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.540
 is that the program I use to edit 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.750
 and when I see them guys everyone is 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.550
 without sound I basically lost three videos 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.600
 because my recorder could not record 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.129
 The sound of it was a little sad, was not it? 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.559
 this time and the crowd that when the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.570
 youtube asks for a serious video and it gets 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.030
 closed because it was because I spent a 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.059
 time to ask for a video sound district one 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.890
 act of terror and a model but do the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.899
 which is good and I also took advantage of 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.790

 the new course was this is is is here there is a 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.019
 place where youtube to record the video is 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.709
 so I did not even say I'm going to record far 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.290
 so anyway but it's expensive then the channel 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.849
 has not started the staff because we 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.250

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.049
