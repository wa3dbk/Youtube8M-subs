00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.379
 the traffic drives refrain from splitting the company into three 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:04.960
 separate entities 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.950
 doubts about the pension scheme 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.189
 mainly Germany 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.649
 make a split 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:10.909
 feasible 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.339
 the management of that 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:15.499
 according to the municipality it did not want to 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.369
 the situation between today and two years ago that we have that 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.159
 chosen because of the situation 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:24.749
 so it is totally different in that mainly in the financial market and 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.119
 has changed a lot 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.099
 and it's so kind of that 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.590
 that works in that we would continue to do that work was dangerous with the three 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:35.320
 companies would be in which we do not 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.700
 give it a fair chance and started just to grow apartments and a system 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.580
 a wildcard for the citizen on the snap for the gate each of those companies 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.400
 that is why we have decided not to do it 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.330
 and then look at what the along with slower what other alternatives he has 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.550
 also points to a front 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.320
 for the other alternative in general 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.390
 he is to alalter lasarte french banks investment bank lazard indeed has one 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.870
 received a mandate from fifteen minutes 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.930
 and both sides received exactly a mandate 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.630
 they met the definitive panda twice before a shot Monday a broad one 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.990
 mandate that they have looked in order to ascertain what is possible in the eu 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.370
 the circumstances 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.390
 on the world markets what is possible and what is possible and what is not 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.230
 we said wherever you are 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.490
 the proposals were more continuous should be clear to him 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.810
 Jan 2 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.520
 several degree two first name criteria change roger answer and that is 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.560
 10 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.230
 it must be the division 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.120
 or strengthen the business 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.240
 create shareholder value otherwise we will not do it 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.020
 The last few days, Kristol regularly talked about putting on the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.080
 reference shareholders 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.300
 heart failure or 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.090
 for none of the divisions 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.590
 is that after the preferred scenario of the leadership of harvard at the moment that 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.250
 is one of the scenarios 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.760
 That is not specific preference that is one of his parents and are very like one 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.929
 and we have a very broad view of the day 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.089
 and for the sake of clarity julien doesn't want to go home 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:17.449
 only a minority who do not look for a reference to the need 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:22.230
 because that is absolutely necessary because the draw the rocks at agfa is not 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.900
 the reason I understand that is indeed correct that is not the case there 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.819
 can take effect 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:27.790
 with waste 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.439
 there are also with the knowledge that we have what today 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.409
 in the market today we can deliver per piece 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.699
 can't quietly apologize and we work hard often we can work there 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:42.169
 the neighborhood that is not so that date is the problem tomorrow and this 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:43.839
 not at all 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:47.219
 it is apparently the intention to move towards more strategic flexibility 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:48.649
 to have 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:52.399
 play a major role in attracting such a performance from a capital injection 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.819
 that is indeed your thinking 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.099
 oh well 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.519
 can indeed just continue aegon has the ability to just continue 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.639
 but you know in the world 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.099
 were lost and other business people happen so much libya needs 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.279
 can also play a strategic role 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:11.290
 And so for centuries a try wants me to make sure that we are also strategic 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:13.119
 can play along like you do with them 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:15.789
 the head on the world market 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:20.569
 in in the rws and and the sisters estimates that work is active in the row others 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.519
 in one way or another
