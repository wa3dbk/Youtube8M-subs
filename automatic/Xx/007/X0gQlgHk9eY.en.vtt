00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.760
 last week predicted the brain 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.500
 buses four matches well 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.960
 this week it's Luciano's turn 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.869
 striker 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.279
 but ona against cambuur i think 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.730
 cambuur the first three points 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.829
 suits of this season in the Premier League 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.300
 so a two 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.189
 they play tonight all that would mean 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.409
 that they come above Heerenveen this 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.060
 weekend 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.950
 yes then they will just be above Heerenveen 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.149
 that you don't last long I think 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.860
 ok then we'll move on to the next one 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.080
 match delicious rest against zwolle 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.310
 two teams here more often at the arts 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.710
 play 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.800
 That's why I think that Heracles is nothing 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.750
 has no advantage with artificial grass 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.120
 but i think ira glass does have one 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.400
 strong team has a good chance for me 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.780
 so I think they are going now 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.970
 major winners 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.800
 how the eagles at home the evening the hague 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.030
 I think this is a draw 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.470
 is becoming 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.420
 nac heerenveen night nac but we 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.070
 played here for last week with a lot 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.610
 persuasion 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.570
 went to tasty so we keep getting the 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.880
 three points 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.970
 heerenveen psv neck think the psv 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.430
 the three points at home is about 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.420
 feyenoord twente is the tess was back 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.250
 for feyenoord 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.869
 also not lost in the cockpit last year 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.710
 so I think feyenoord will do this too 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.790
 to win 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.900
 you were born near 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.450

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.460
 born in rotterdam itself yes they are special 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.300
 via a feyenoord or 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:41.619
 yes feyenoord is still like me they go 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.259
 Groningen FC Utrecht and Groningen 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.840
 fill the last week very well you 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:50.050

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.649
 Groningen home advantage again his 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.649

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.850
 az ajax is a tricky one 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.440

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:07.590
