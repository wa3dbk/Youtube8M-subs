this massive fusion cannon which is as
you<00:02:25.650> can<00:02:25.680> see<00:02:25.800> pretty<00:02:26.220> much<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.730> same<00:02:26.880> height

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
you can see pretty much the same height

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.540 
you can see pretty much the same height
as<00:02:27.330> he<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.600> but<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.320> doesn't<00:02:28.710> look<00:02:28.890> overbearing

ways the toy this this just oozes

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.570 
ways the toy this this just oozes
quality<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:37.860> because<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.220> amount<00:02:38.400> of

quality just because of the amount of
detail<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.570> mean<00:02:39.870> let's<00:02:40.020> have<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.200> closer

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
detail to it I mean let's have a closer

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.070 
detail to it I mean let's have a closer
look<00:02:40.680> at<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.010> look<00:02:41.610> at<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.880> sculpting<00:02:42.840> down

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
look at that look at the sculpting down

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.320 
look at that look at the sculpting down
it<00:02:43.290> look<00:02:43.710> at<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.010> quality<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.970> what<00:02:45.240> they

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
it look at the quality of what they

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.760 
it look at the quality of what they
don't<00:02:45.480> obviously<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:46.200> does<00:02:46.410> what<00:02:46.530> all<00:02:46.560> good

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
don't obviously it does what all good

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.910 
don't obviously it does what all good
missiles<00:02:47.100> do<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:48.300> fires<00:02:51.170> but<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.320> detailing

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
missiles do it fires but the detailing

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.950

the<00:02:53.310> work<00:02:53.340> that's<00:02:53.970> gone<00:02:54.210> into<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> fact

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
the work that's gone into it the fact

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.720 
the work that's gone into it the fact
that<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.230> buttons<00:02:55.650> actually<00:02:55.950> got<00:02:56.040> sculpting

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
that the buttons actually got sculpting

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.110 
that the buttons actually got sculpting
on<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.480> different<00:02:57.960> colored<00:02:58.170> paint<00:02:58.410> apps

for shame but from what I can gather
this<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.840> an<00:03:09.960> ideal<00:03:10.550> representation<00:03:11.550> of<00:03:11.790> them

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
this is an ideal representation of them

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.830 
this is an ideal representation of them
opposed<00:03:13.080> ability<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.620> great<00:03:14.040> as<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:15.090> can<00:03:15.210> get

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
opposed ability is great as you can get

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.930 
opposed ability is great as you can get

of<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.560> robot<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:07.980> feel<00:04:08.190> like<00:04:08.340> these<00:04:08.459> leg

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
of the robot you feel like these leg

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.580 
of the robot you feel like these leg
sections<00:04:09.300> should<00:04:09.510> be<00:04:09.690> smaller<00:04:10.170> they<00:04:10.410> should

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
sections should be smaller they should

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.190 
sections should be smaller they should
be<00:04:10.680> slightly<00:04:11.040> tidier<00:04:11.760> at<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.510> bottom<00:04:12.720> but<00:04:12.930> it

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
be slightly tidier at the bottom but it

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.710 
be slightly tidier at the bottom but it
is<00:04:13.620> reminiscent<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.400> g1<00:04:15.000> toy<00:04:15.300> you<00:04:15.360> have

these big panels if you remember the

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.750 
these big panels if you remember the
about<00:04:20.640> a<00:04:20.669> grip

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
you just know this is a little bit of

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.440 
you just know this is a little bit of
detail<00:05:15.740> around<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.910> stomach<00:05:17.270> area

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450

around the ABS and everything but

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.340 
around the ABS and everything but
nothing<00:05:19.250> to<00:05:19.790> the<00:05:19.910> detail<00:05:20.480> and<00:05:20.510> the<00:05:20.690> work<00:05:21.050> and

nothing to the detail and the work and

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.960 
nothing to the detail and the work and

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
the love and affection is obviously gone

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.850 
the love and affection is obviously gone
into<00:05:23.210> that<00:05:23.240> point<00:05:23.660> and<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:24.200> symbol<00:05:24.530> on<00:05:24.740> the

back<00:05:25.040> which<00:05:25.370> is<00:05:25.580> very<00:05:25.850> reminiscent<00:05:26.810> of<00:05:27.110> the

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
back which is very reminiscent of the

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.970 
back which is very reminiscent of the
