00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.200
 Welcome from Munich with the 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.670
 brand new htc onex that is available now 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.639
 Germany available at vodafone 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.740
 of course, the other 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.929
 mobile operators with a 5.9 inches 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.880
 full hd display we have ten 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.230
 millimeter thick clock it feels so 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.699
 quite pleasant holders recognize that 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.010
 design already from the old trenches the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.820
 This could be when and mini 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.090
 if we of course the same 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.680
 but otherwise compare to the design 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.570
 of course, has a size on each 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.460
 case what needs to be done to get involved 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.489
 good technical data like for example 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.180
 in snapdragon 600 that new htc 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.370
 sense 55 as far as the operating system is concerned 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.510
 and also htc brings here with it 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.670
 which of course I'll show you right away 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.899
 camel's bell here is the look sees 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.309
 has a few innovations we get 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.260
 For example, if they are on 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.829
 article goes on as later 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.180
 could mark reading and even then 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.039
 accordingly also the whole offline 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.449
 Of course you can read something very practical 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.690
 is if you just in the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.010
 aviator sits and the news on board 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.719
 Just did not want to read before 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.880
 managed to read otherwise 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.590
 Not much has happened on the surface 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.360
 Of course it is much more fun 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.119
 watch some movies on such a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.140
 big screen or if we 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.000
 different contents also themselves 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.600
 want to edit or create 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.350
 can now synonymous movies and the like 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.610
 do accordingly and they here 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.290
 See also be an example 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.689
 We'll show you later like that 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.560
 then so on his big one 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.000
 screens when detailed video 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.380
 do 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.270
 then we have a micro-sim 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.220
 behind the coming in but go before 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.900
 we again briefly on the device outside we 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.369
 here have the on and off switch now 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.869
 thereby gets so big you would 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.119
 see here heavy heavy right here 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.439
 can with my large hand would 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.670
 that's pretty impractical and 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.680
 of course with the thumb you get on 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.320
 no more fall in the upper corner so 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.520
 you already need two hands for that 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.750
 This could be very simple here 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.369
 and also turn off the volume 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.229
 settle that then there is no problem 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.149
 say we still have one in front 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.909
 very good camera synonymous already atc 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.259
 one with it was with 2 1 megapixel and 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.200
 Pee 88 and have the f2 aperture on top 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.420
 we the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.770
 Infrared sensor looks back on 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.719
 switch but you can not press that 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.580
 here really only infrared we have the 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.319
 headphone jack here on the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.989
 the back continues to be the microphone here 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.959
 this white plastic here is the 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.900
 camera from htc mini with also an app 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:26.200
 2.0 aperture 88 millimeters or resolution 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:28.959
 from 2.688 1520 with lightning otherwise htc 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.090
 logo and here we can not 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.370
 because there is so dry there to say so 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.430
 after shells to the corresponding 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.430
 but about 3100 milliampere breathe 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.290
 can be extended to 4,500 here on 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.420
 this page is a small switch 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.730
 when we press the back 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.019
 so to speak, jumps off on one side 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.790
 at least, and then we can from 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.849
 and insert the sim card here 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.620
 and also micro sd cards for the first time 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.599
 in the hard series for me, too 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.730
 the memory does not expand 16 gb 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.680
 would be too big of the 11 was somehow 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.700
 are available and then here you see 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.700
 also micro sd 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.500
 there comes the sdxc card purely 64 each 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.720
 cost now only about the 30th 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.880
 or 40 euros to make easy by her 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.160
 the whole presses on it and then 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.370
 can you continue that nice? 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.920
 use in everyday life micro usb microphone 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.980
 still here and with us and on the 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.780
 side was already up the back 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.040
 fingerprint reader we can too 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.760
 just use it with your finger over it 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.620
 to brush 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.069
 similar to 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.140
 then iphone to secure ours 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.700
 our device can actually now 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.010
 demonstrate because then we from htc 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.599
 started to want to go back and only 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.040
 our finger is available now 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.870
 maybe hung up shortly 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.239
 and otherwise we'll do that for a second 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.680
 makes comparison makes that is still 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:53.079
 short out so htc won against onex 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.819
 there is also a call was made shortly 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.319
 if you see each other then 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.540
 you will also find a bit of that here 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.950
 about 1 centimeter and above it one 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.109
 tailfinger then the whole as 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.489
 size difference it in the thick see 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.489
 her also a bit of a difference 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.260
 then we have the one mini in 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.400
 black for it also registered 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.170
 already done again than that not yet 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.640
 knows where we see it 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.669
 Of course that is also considerable 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.380
 thinner but 4.3 witness 5.92 there's 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.720
 of course also significant differences 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.789
 In the field of work would now be on everyone 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.280
 so let's say that's it 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.830
 really one further on 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.229
 then you really see that the display 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.060
 here maybe almost two or 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.740
 two and a half times about the picture 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.229
 fit and I still have the apple now 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.760
 iphone 5 where we also in the 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.740
 Sizing comparison can of course sing 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.510
 that it's just a difference just that 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.919
 Maybe you know everyday life because 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.840
 what do many people have? 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.090
 and if you think again then 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.460
 You see, that's in there 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.870
 the size says a big difference 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.820
 that was the htc why max so to speak 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.229
 first impression we like it on everyone 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.780
 if there is much further from sony 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.030
 report will be happy to show you soon 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.320
 but that another video and on am 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.699
 best just on our website 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.300
 daily many had watched my 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.300
 mister switzerland
