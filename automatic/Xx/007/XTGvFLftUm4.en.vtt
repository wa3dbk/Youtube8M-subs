00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.289
 or 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.890
 Yes 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.140
 we find at chambley chambley for 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.699
 perform the autopsies section that we 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.519
 initiated in previous number the number 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.589
 200 with the subaru brz and we came back 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.329
 for this second edition with the clio 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:02.100
 rs of fourth generation that lies 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.320
 just behind difficult conditions 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.060
 since time oscillated between rain 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.740
 wind we are not ideal conditions 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.689
 which made the track soggy 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.880
 casion all day so conditions 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.720
 not optimal but that did not stop 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.720
 fun time with the car 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.830
 I invite you to come 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.140
 but serious or must be rewarded 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.140
 their accounts to be completed 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.090
 be much clearer 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.909
 it's really suitable for more than 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.150
 several worlds 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.640
 it's sport for all in the end 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.620
 Yes 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.990
 some purists who will moan in 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:00.409
 saying that it's just a rocker 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.409
 manly to be too simple for his part 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.150
 you ate 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.820
 no but I hold brain 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.240
 in 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.240
 finally 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.180
 compared to the previous generation 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:18.170
 and a huge gap route the changes 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.120
 aesthetic we do not need to 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.159
 spread on it really already feeling 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.480
 want on board that nothing to see the 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.829
 breakage is much more neat to 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.840
 the interior the atmosphere is much more 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.670
 pleasant everyday and especially in 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.409
 driving especially on the circuit we have 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.930
 a car and less that is I want to play 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.489
 say that the previous generation who 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.659
 is more accessible is the sport for 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.129
 everyone the car is over 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.239
 homogeneous but it does not prevent 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.560
 to have fun and it prevents especially 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.190
 not the car of the very efficient on 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.420
 circuit we can have fun there is 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.459
 different driving modes in addition 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.590
 either we let his car handle everything that 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.769
 this is the transmission all or one has 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.599
 a sport mode or reis with the spd plus 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.310
 or less degraded and whatever 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.409
 the stadiums of sp on has a car that 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.940
 is not tricky at all that wraps 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.940
 having fun at the rear end 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.880
 our ways they did super super 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.160
 content 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.470
 spend a report hectares a little slow 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.190
 tour that you have searched down I 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.190
 find them very happy 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.890
 we follow m 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.150
 here 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.099
 on this fourth generation ago 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.870
 two evolutions rather two changes 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.980
 principal the first is the 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.390
 change of the engine block since we 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.920
 was on an atmospheric block on the 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.750
 previous generation there we went 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.060
 on a test on hbo and it's mostly 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.250
 the arrival of a double transmission 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.780
 clutch with donated steering wheel paddles 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.069
 while the previous generation was 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.140
 only available in mechanical box 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.549
 and this one will not be 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.890
 available in mechanical box 6 to three 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.690
 positive points to note about this 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.239
 car already it's the versatility its 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.280
 ease of handling and approval 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.540
 engine that is really incomparable by 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.709
 compared to the previous generation who 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.890
 had a tray of a block 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.890
 atmospheric 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.380
 the first one to be the pallets 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.580
 so some critics do because 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.900
 the palaces of his fixed but that's not it 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.490
 the most embarrassing is especially when the 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.200
 ergonomics level is missing some 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.250
 centimeters in the lower part of 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.239
 pallets that makes that one is sometimes 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.030
 obliged to let go of the steering wheel 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.440
 recover the pallets we are endowed 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.060
 of a cup chassis on this version this 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.860
 which makes the car relatively 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.510
 raid on circuit it's less annoying but 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.880
 on bumpy road everyday it's 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.110
 still hard enough to cash in and 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.580
 it's the main faults really 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.580
 that can be noted on 7 out of 7
