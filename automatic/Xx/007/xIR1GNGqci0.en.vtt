00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
particular so they're good starting off

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.170 
particular so they're good starting off
with<00:00:49.530> every<00:00:50.100> Apple<00:00:50.610> product<00:00:51.260> be<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.559> design

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
with every Apple product be the design

the<00:00:54.180> design<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.870> at<00:00:55.260> least<00:00:55.530> noteworthy<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.879> my

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the design is at least noteworthy in my

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.770 
the design is at least noteworthy in my
opinion<00:00:58.100> like<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.399> Mac<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.879> made<00:01:00.149> out<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
opinion like this Mac is made out of a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.770 
opinion like this Mac is made out of a
single<00:01:01.230> block<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.530> aluminum<00:01:02.090> that's<00:01:03.090> crafted

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
single block of aluminum that's crafted

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.140 
single block of aluminum that's crafted
very<00:01:04.170> beautifully<00:01:05.600> next<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> trackpad

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
very beautifully next is the trackpad

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.300 
very beautifully next is the trackpad
macbook<00:01:09.150> pro<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.689> does<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> big<00:01:10.619> large

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
macbook pro it does have a big large

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.240 
macbook pro it does have a big large
trackpad<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.869> bigger<00:01:13.229> than<00:01:13.350> an<00:01:13.619> inch<00:01:13.950> and

trackpad it's bigger than an inch and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.210 
trackpad it's bigger than an inch and
it's<00:01:15.119> probably<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.810> best<00:01:15.840> feature<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.619> this

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
it's probably the best feature of this

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.660 
it's probably the best feature of this
Mac<00:01:17.900> because<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.290> trackpad<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.159> big<00:01:20.490> you

could update it form for free so that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.050 
could update it form for free so that
was<00:01:42.240> pretty<00:01:42.420> nice<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.229> best<00:01:43.680> feature<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.520> mac

still<00:02:36.090> work<00:02:36.360> flawlessly<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.940> OS<00:02:39.900> 10<00:02:40.200> is

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410

probably the best feature of this Mac so

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.509 
probably the best feature of this Mac so
the<00:02:44.100> next<00:02:44.280> thing<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.700> boot<00:02:45.150> camp<00:02:45.680> for<00:02:46.680> people

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519

hundred and fifty dollar and you will

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.670

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
get eight gigs of ram so even better

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.880 
get eight gigs of ram so even better
specs<00:05:32.190> than<00:05:32.280> this<00:05:32.960> the<00:05:33.960> price<00:05:34.260> is<00:05:34.500> probably

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
specs than this the price is probably

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.890 
specs than this the price is probably
the<00:05:35.040> most<00:05:35.070> important<00:05:35.910> reason<00:05:36.330> why<00:05:36.360> I<00:05:36.570> was

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
the most important reason why I was

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.310 
the most important reason why I was
hesitant<00:05:37.410> about<00:05:37.560> buying<00:05:38.070> this<00:05:38.340> mac<00:05:38.669> and<00:05:39.320> also

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
hesitant about buying this mac and also

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.800 
hesitant about buying this mac and also
this<00:05:40.650> macbook<00:05:41.160> pro<00:05:41.370> this<00:05:41.610> particular<00:05:42.300> macbook

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
this macbook pro this particular macbook

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.210 
this macbook pro this particular macbook
pro<00:05:43.080> has<00:05:43.530> a<00:05:43.560> 1280<00:05:44.520> by<00:05:44.760> 800<00:05:45.030> display<00:05:46.220> that's

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
pro has a 1280 by 800 display that's

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.500 
pro has a 1280 by 800 display that's
lower<00:05:47.760> than<00:05:47.790> most<00:05:48.450> 7-inch<00:05:49.080> tablet<00:05:49.620> right<00:05:49.919> now

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
lower than most 7-inch tablet right now

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.040 
lower than most 7-inch tablet right now
so<00:05:51.510> the<00:05:51.870> display<00:05:52.320> is<00:05:52.500> probably<00:05:52.919> the<00:05:53.160> most

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
so the display is probably the most

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.880 
so the display is probably the most
probably<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.200> worst<00:05:55.530> factor<00:05:56.190> in<00:05:56.400> this<00:05:56.610> back

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
probably the worst factor in this back

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.400 
probably the worst factor in this back
so<00:05:58.890> the<00:05:59.070> last<00:05:59.250> thing<00:05:59.400> I<00:05:59.580> want<00:05:59.760> to<00:05:59.820> say<00:05:59.910> is<00:06:00.410> why

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
so the last thing I want to say is why

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.440 
so the last thing I want to say is why
Mac<00:06:02.060> the<00:06:03.060> reason<00:06:03.419> would<00:06:03.600> be<00:06:03.630> everything<00:06:04.290> works

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
Mac the reason would be everything works

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.150 
Mac the reason would be everything works
anyone<00:06:06.450> could<00:06:06.630> use<00:06:06.870> mac<00:06:07.260> and<00:06:07.530> still<00:06:07.770> be<00:06:07.980> able

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
anyone could use mac and still be able

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.900 
anyone could use mac and still be able
to<00:06:08.460> use<00:06:08.640> it<00:06:08.669> very<00:06:09.540> well<00:06:09.900> just<00:06:10.470> like<00:06:10.650> iOS<00:06:11.100> any

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
to use it very well just like iOS any

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.690 
to use it very well just like iOS any
gestures<00:06:12.480> like<00:06:12.810> Mission<00:06:13.380> Control<00:06:13.680> expose<00:06:14.490> you

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
gestures like Mission Control expose you

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.150 
gestures like Mission Control expose you
don't<00:06:14.880> have<00:06:15.090> to<00:06:15.270> use<00:06:15.419> those<00:06:15.750> if<00:06:16.590> you<00:06:16.770> just<00:06:16.980> want

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
don't have to use those if you just want

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.220 
don't have to use those if you just want
to<00:06:17.220> go<00:06:17.340> to<00:06:17.370> Internet<00:06:18.000> you<00:06:18.570> don't<00:06:18.750> have<00:06:18.930> to<00:06:19.110> do

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
to go to Internet you don't have to do

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.010 
to go to Internet you don't have to do
anything<00:06:19.470> so<00:06:20.460> what<00:06:20.790> my<00:06:20.940> point<00:06:21.300> would<00:06:21.540> be<00:06:21.570> is

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
anything so what my point would be is

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.260 
anything so what my point would be is
