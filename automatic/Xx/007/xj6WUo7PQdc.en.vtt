created this year we call it the session
VI<00:00:14.590> basically<00:00:15.590> it's<00:00:16.039> it's<00:00:16.550> availing

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:17.530 
VI basically it's it's availing

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.200 
VI basically it's it's availing
post-processing<00:00:18.530> that<00:00:19.220> musicians<00:00:19.520> have<00:00:20.060> in

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
post-processing that musicians have in

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.980 
post-processing that musicians have in
the<00:00:20.300> studio<00:00:20.600> for<00:00:21.410> live<00:00:21.619> work<00:00:22.780> working<00:00:23.780> with<00:00:23.810> a

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
the studio for live work working with a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.170 
the studio for live work working with a
bunch<00:00:24.260> of<00:00:24.440> producers<00:00:25.250> and<00:00:25.490> musicians<00:00:25.699> and

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
bunch of producers and musicians and

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.590 
bunch of producers and musicians and
engineers<00:00:26.750> in<00:00:27.289> Nashville<00:00:27.800> we<00:00:28.490> learned<00:00:28.820> a<00:00:29.210> lot

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
engineers in Nashville we learned a lot

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.750 
engineers in Nashville we learned a lot
of<00:00:29.660> what<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:30.109> studio<00:00:30.470> magic<00:00:31.100> is<00:00:31.310> in

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
of what the studio magic is in

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.360 
of what the studio magic is in
post-processing<00:00:32.509> so<00:00:33.320> you<00:00:33.739> know<00:00:33.860> you<00:00:33.920> got<00:00:34.190> your

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
post-processing so you know you got your

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.520 
post-processing so you know you got your
guitar<00:00:34.460> going<00:00:35.030> into<00:00:35.270> a<00:00:35.300> board<00:00:35.630> it<00:00:36.110> can<00:00:36.260> sound

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
guitar going into a board it can sound

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.920 
guitar going into a board it can sound
really<00:00:36.590> good<00:00:36.980> but<00:00:37.790> when<00:00:38.149> it<00:00:38.270> comes<00:00:38.480> out<00:00:38.690> as<00:00:38.899> a

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
really good but when it comes out as a

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.710 
really good but when it comes out as a
CD<00:00:39.320> it's<00:00:39.770> like<00:00:39.980> whoa<00:00:40.399> you<00:00:40.910> know<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:41.329> we've

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
CD it's like whoa you know so we've

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.479 
CD it's like whoa you know so we've
tried<00:00:41.870> to<00:00:41.989> figure<00:00:42.260> out<00:00:42.410> what<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:42.920> actually

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
tried to figure out what that actually

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.229 
tried to figure out what that actually
what<00:00:43.970> that<00:00:44.000> wool<00:00:44.480> was<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:46.040> we<00:00:46.399> found<00:00:46.700> out<00:00:46.940> that

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
what that wool was and we found out that

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.560 
what that wool was and we found out that
it's<00:00:47.420> basically<00:00:47.630> two<00:00:48.140> major<00:00:48.380> tools<00:00:48.860> that<00:00:49.700> that

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
it's basically two major tools that that

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.250 
it's basically two major tools that that
the<00:00:50.719> engineers<00:00:51.200> use<00:00:51.500> to<00:00:52.250> finish<00:00:52.719> the<00:00:53.719> sound

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
the engineers use to finish the sound

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.650 
the engineers use to finish the sound
it's<00:00:54.680> like<00:00:54.829> an<00:00:54.980> enhancement<00:00:55.610> and<00:00:55.910> elevation

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
it's like an enhancement and elevation

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.650 
it's like an enhancement and elevation
the<00:00:57.469> primary<00:00:58.010> tools<00:00:58.489> that<00:00:58.730> we<00:00:58.850> learned<00:00:59.180> that

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
the primary tools that we learned that

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.690 
the primary tools that we learned that
they<00:00:59.870> use<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:00.469> elevate<00:01:00.980> these<00:01:01.160> instantly

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
they use to elevate these instantly

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.179 
they use to elevate these instantly
loved<00:01:01.969> ate<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:02.239> tracks<00:01:02.600> are<00:01:03.440> some<00:01:03.800> form<00:01:04.070> of

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
loved ate the tracks are some form of

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.609 
loved ate the tracks are some form of
saturation<00:01:04.820> or<00:01:05.269> it's<00:01:05.810> physically<00:01:06.440> it's

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
saturation or it's physically it's

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.280 
saturation or it's physically it's
Distortion<00:01:07.369> but<00:01:07.880> this<00:01:08.210> is<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.360> special<00:01:08.900> type<00:01:09.110> of

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
Distortion but this is a special type of

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.469 
Distortion but this is a special type of
distortion<00:01:09.650> that<00:01:10.220> just<00:01:10.760> adds<00:01:11.030> sweet

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
distortion that just adds sweet

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.750 
distortion that just adds sweet
harmonics<00:01:12.229> into<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.650> sound<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.400> just<00:01:13.460> makes

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
harmonics into the sound it just makes

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.940 
harmonics into the sound it just makes
it<00:01:13.909> yummier<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:14.720> bigger<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.350> richer<00:01:15.530> and

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
it yummier and bigger and richer and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.039 
it yummier and bigger and richer and
more<00:01:16.100> interesting<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:17.030> just<00:01:17.570> kind<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.900> like

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
more interesting and just kind of like

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.210 
more interesting and just kind of like
you<00:01:18.590> know

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
you know

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.450 
you know
it<00:01:19.670> gives<00:01:19.850> you<00:01:19.940> that<00:01:20.000> buoy<00:01:20.420> right<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.500> then

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
it gives you that buoy right and then

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.820 
it gives you that buoy right and then
the<00:01:22.580> other<00:01:22.730> tool<00:01:23.030> that<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:23.840> we<00:01:23.990> found<00:01:24.290> that's

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
the other tool that that we found that's

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.420 
the other tool that that we found that's
huge<00:01:25.730> in<00:01:26.390> studio<00:01:26.960> work<00:01:27.260> is<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.740> form<00:01:28.250> of

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
huge in studio work is a form of

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.080 
huge in studio work is a form of
multiband<00:01:29.360> compression<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.590> we<00:01:30.820> call<00:01:31.820> this

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
multiband compression and we call this

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.880 
multiband compression and we call this
comp<00:01:32.450> EQ<00:01:33.020> it's<00:01:33.920> actually<00:01:34.730> touch<00:01:35.260> sensitive<00:01:36.260> EQ

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
comp EQ it's actually touch sensitive EQ

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.300 
comp EQ it's actually touch sensitive EQ
so<00:01:37.640> this<00:01:37.850> is<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.000> three<00:01:38.510> band<00:01:38.780> compressor<00:01:39.380> bass

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
so this is a three band compressor bass

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.390 
so this is a three band compressor bass
mid<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.180> treble<00:01:41.570> tuned<00:01:42.410> for<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.860> acoustic

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
mid and treble tuned for the acoustic

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.360 
mid and treble tuned for the acoustic
guitar<00:01:43.510> problem<00:01:44.510> frequencies<00:01:45.290> but<00:01:46.160> it's

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
guitar problem frequencies but it's

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.020 
guitar problem frequencies but it's
dynamic<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.720> responds<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.560> your<00:01:48.770> touch<00:01:49.030> so

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
dynamic it responds to your touch so

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.380 
dynamic it responds to your touch so
this<00:01:50.480> knob<00:01:50.720> here<00:01:50.770> sets<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.980> threshold<00:01:52.220> so<00:01:52.880> you

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
this knob here sets the threshold so you

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.660 
this knob here sets the threshold so you
can<00:01:53.630> use<00:01:53.810> more<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.290> more<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.650> more<00:01:54.710> of<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.220> and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
can use more and more and more of it and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.690 
can use more and more and more of it and
as<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.540> bring<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:56.930> up<00:01:57.080> it's<00:01:57.620> just<00:01:57.800> as<00:01:58.160> you<00:01:58.220> dig

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
as you bring it up it's just as you dig

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.460 
as you bring it up it's just as you dig
into<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.000> guitar<00:01:59.540> an<00:01:59.960> acoustic<00:02:00.080> guitar

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
into the guitar an acoustic guitar

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.190 
into the guitar an acoustic guitar
changes<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:01.490> doesn't<00:02:01.820> stay<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.150> same<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:03.050> this

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
changes it doesn't stay the same so this

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.590 
changes it doesn't stay the same so this
mimics<00:02:03.830> what<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.220> guitar<00:02:04.610> top<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:05.150> actually

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
mimics what the guitar top is actually

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.160 
mimics what the guitar top is actually
doing<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.620> these<00:02:07.100> two<00:02:07.340> tools<00:02:07.700> are<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.540> primary

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
doing so these two tools are the primary

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.310 
doing so these two tools are the primary
studio<00:02:09.679> tools<00:02:10.070> that<00:02:10.790> mixing<00:02:11.450> engineers<00:02:11.960> use

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
studio tools that mixing engineers use

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.839 
studio tools that mixing engineers use

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
we built a variable high-pass filter on

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.420 
we built a variable high-pass filter on
into<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.180> unit<00:02:37.569> so<00:02:37.870> depending<00:02:38.560> on<00:02:38.650> what<00:02:39.219> your

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.089 
output and we have run over this isn't a
specific<00:03:12.909> one<00:03:13.480> but<00:03:14.019> we<00:03:14.139> ran<00:03:14.409> over<00:03:14.439> one<00:03:14.949> of

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
specific one but we ran over one of

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.509 
specific one but we ran over one of
these<00:03:15.219> four<00:03:16.000> times<00:03:16.359> with<00:03:16.810> my<00:03:16.989> truck<00:03:17.379> and<00:03:18.040> it

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
these four times with my truck and it

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.670 
these four times with my truck and it
still<00:03:18.790> works<00:03:19.120> so<00:03:19.359> it's<00:03:19.719> going<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:19.989> last<00:03:20.259> a<00:03:20.500> long

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
still works so it's going to last a long

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.759 
still works so it's going to last a long
time<00:03:21.040> be<00:03:21.639> roadworthy<00:03:22.419> and<00:03:22.810> we<00:03:23.319> think<00:03:23.590> there's

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
time be roadworthy and we think there's

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.649 
time be roadworthy and we think there's
really<00:03:24.009> going<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.340> enhance<00:03:24.509> what<00:03:25.509> you're

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
really going to enhance what you're

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.800 
really going to enhance what you're
doing<00:03:26.079> with<00:03:26.229> the<00:03:26.349> live<00:03:26.650> musician<00:03:27.400> has<00:03:27.639> wanted
