hi welcome laughs go price tag I'm price

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.030 
hi welcome laughs go price tag I'm price
and<00:00:02.820> today<00:00:03.659> I<00:00:03.689> took<00:00:04.049> out<00:00:04.380> my<00:00:04.410> motherboard

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
and today I took out my motherboard

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.960 
and today I took out my motherboard
oughta<00:00:05.400> make<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.730> nice<00:00:05.850> because<00:00:07.519> my<00:00:08.519> heat<00:00:08.730> sink

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
oughta make a nice because my heat sink

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.140 
oughta make a nice because my heat sink
wiggles<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:10.500> really<00:00:11.250> don't<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.670> and

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
wiggles and I really don't like that and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.020 
wiggles and I really don't like that and
I<00:00:12.240> think<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.630> may<00:00:12.840> affect<00:00:12.960> my<00:00:13.259> temps<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:14.400> tighten

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
I think it may affect my temps I tighten

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.150 
I think it may affect my temps I tighten
it<00:00:15.089> down<00:00:15.120> as<00:00:15.450> hard<00:00:15.630> as<00:00:15.809> i<00:00:15.870> could<00:00:16.049> with<00:00:16.560> Alan's

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
it down as hard as i could with Alan's

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.890 
it down as hard as i could with Alan's
until<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> point<00:00:18.060> where<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.300> start<00:00:18.480> stripping

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
until the point where I start stripping

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.750 
until the point where I start stripping
it<00:00:19.050> but<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.010> still<00:00:20.189> not<00:00:20.310> tighten<00:00:20.640> all<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
it but it's still not tighten all the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.960 
it but it's still not tighten all the
way<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:20.970> I'm<00:00:21.180> giving<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.510> proper<00:00:22.410> socket<00:00:23.220> to

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
way so I'm giving a proper socket to

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.160 
way so I'm giving a proper socket to
tighten<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.480> down<00:00:24.510> because<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:26.990> don't<00:00:27.990> want<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
tighten it down because I don't want to

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.900 
tighten it down because I don't want to
lose<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.529> want<00:00:28.740> better<00:00:28.920> comes<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.550> how<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
lose that I want better comes and how to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.200 
lose that I want better comes and how to
take<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.150> out<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.510> my<00:00:30.810> hop<00:00:31.019> acts<00:00:32.000> to<00:00:33.000> do<00:00:33.090> this

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
take it out of my hop acts to do this

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.290 
take it out of my hop acts to do this
was<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.570> literally<00:00:33.840> no<00:00:34.020> rooms<00:00:34.260> biggie<00:00:34.739> sink

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
was just literally no rooms biggie sink

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.170 
was just literally no rooms biggie sink
so<00:00:36.300> we're<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.260> tighten<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.500> down<00:00:37.969> or<00:00:38.969> if

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
so we're going to tighten it down or if

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:49.910 
so we're going to tighten it down or if
we<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.719> see<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:40.890> happens<00:00:48.469> he's<00:00:49.469> getting<00:00:49.739> way

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
we can see what happens he's getting way

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.470 
we can see what happens he's getting way
more<00:00:49.950> leverage<00:00:50.640> now<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:51.030> he's<00:00:51.180> using<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
more leverage now that he's using a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.090 
more leverage now that he's using a
socket<00:00:51.719> rather<00:00:52.110> than<00:00:52.320> an<00:00:52.469> Allen<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.980> Allen

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
socket rather than an Allen and Allen

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.950 
socket rather than an Allen and Allen
you're<00:00:53.340> only<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.699> strip<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.539> inside

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
you're only going to strip the inside

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.340 
you're only going to strip the inside
and<00:00:55.230> then<00:00:55.379> which<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.890> did<00:00:56.100> which<00:00:56.699> he<00:00:57.570> did<00:00:57.750> so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and then which I did which he did so

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.049 
and then which I did which he did so
make<00:00:58.710> sure<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.920> get<00:00:59.250> a<00:01:00.170> socket<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.620> ratchet

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
make sure to get a socket and a ratchet

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.109 
make sure to get a socket and a ratchet
forestry<00:01:03.059> growling<00:01:03.570> he's<00:01:03.719> got<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:05.970> get

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
forestry growling he's got so you get

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.850 
forestry growling he's got so you get
proper<00:01:06.510> leverage<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:07.140> recommend<00:01:07.500> getting<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
proper leverage I recommend getting a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.310 
proper leverage I recommend getting a
mini<00:01:08.100> ratchet<00:01:08.520> or<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:09.390> whatever<00:01:10.049> size

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
mini ratchet or this whatever size

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.250 
mini ratchet or this whatever size
ratchet<00:01:10.770> won't<00:01:10.950> work<00:01:11.159> yeah<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.260> extension

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
ratchet won't work yeah and extension

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.490 
ratchet won't work yeah and extension
area<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.430> like<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.210> pivot<00:01:15.509> extension<00:01:15.960> so

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
area like a like a pivot extension so

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.740 
area like a like a pivot extension so
you<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.710> get<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:16.979> yeah<00:01:17.880> pivot<00:01:18.210> extensions

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
you can get in yeah pivot extensions

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.810 
you can get in yeah pivot extensions
definitely<00:01:19.350> where<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.009> at<00:01:20.159> as<00:01:20.430> far<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.670> this

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
definitely where it's at as far as this
