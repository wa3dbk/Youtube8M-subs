it up with the water to get hot and then

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.179 
it up with the water to get hot and then
we<00:01:33.479> turned<00:01:33.719> it<00:01:33.840> off<00:01:33.959> so<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.530> water<00:01:34.679> still<00:01:34.979> warm

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
we turned it off so the water still warm

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580 
we turned it off so the water still warm
so<00:01:35.459> basically<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.719> lot<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.899> just<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
so basically a lot of just one of the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.309 
so basically a lot of just one of the
hydrant<00:01:37.979> spouts<00:01:38.250> out<00:01:38.459> of<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.899> inside<00:01:39.899> and<00:01:40.200> get

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
hydrant spouts out of it inside and get

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:47.330 
hydrant spouts out of it inside and get
all<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.590> paint<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:45.619> hot<00:01:46.619> water<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.069> better

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
all the paint and hot water is better

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.949 
all the paint and hot water is better
because<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.939> paint<00:01:48.149> does<00:01:48.360> come<00:01:48.539> off<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.720> lot

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
because the paint does come off a lot

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.770 
because the paint does come off a lot
easier<00:01:49.099> there's<00:01:50.099> a<00:01:50.369> lot<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> massive<00:01:51.539> amount<00:01:51.750> of

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
easier there's a lot a massive amount of

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.800 
easier there's a lot a massive amount of
sleepy<00:01:52.200> or<00:01:52.319> anything

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.660 

so

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.980 

the<00:02:47.150> edges<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:48.880> Destin<00:02:49.880> vast<00:02:50.150> matted<00:02:50.690> master

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
the edges so Destin vast matted master

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.440 
the edges so Destin vast matted master
suite<00:02:51.320> so<00:02:51.700> next<00:02:52.700> thing<00:02:52.820> we<00:02:53.000> want<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.210> check<00:02:53.390> for

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
suite so next thing we want to check for

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.910 
suite so next thing we want to check for
is<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.900> strap<00:02:55.450> my<00:02:56.450> strap<00:02:56.720> is<00:02:56.840> pretty<00:02:56.870> clean<00:02:57.350> so

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
move on but ends sort of it clean about

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.720 
move on but ends sort of it clean about
this<00:03:03.230> part<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:04.040> part<00:03:04.100> is<00:03:04.460> really<00:03:04.490> hard

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
this part this part is really hard

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.330 
this part this part is really hard
because<00:03:05.290> sometimes<00:03:06.290> you<00:03:06.620> can<00:03:06.740> see<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.100> paint

because sometimes you can see the paint

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.600 
because sometimes you can see the paint
gets<00:03:07.520> down<00:03:07.790> there<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:08.630> we're<00:03:08.840> going<00:03:08.960> to<00:03:09.050> do<00:03:09.200> is

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.770 

and<00:03:50.299> this<00:03:50.480> could<00:03:50.690> take<00:03:50.840> anywhere<00:03:51.319> from<00:03:51.410> like

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780

depending how much you got shot and

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.410 
depending how much you got shot and
where<00:04:03.609> I'm<00:04:04.609> going<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:04.819> do<00:04:04.879> is<00:04:05.000> I'm<00:04:05.269> actually

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
where I'm going to do is I'm actually

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.110 
where I'm going to do is I'm actually
just<00:04:05.660> thing<00:04:05.900> at<00:04:05.989> this<00:04:06.109> whole<00:04:06.319> thing<00:04:06.349> one

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
just thing at this whole thing one

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.980 
just thing at this whole thing one
everything<00:04:08.120> else<00:04:08.390> is<00:04:08.540> off<00:04:08.720> of<00:04:08.750> it<00:04:09.079> so

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.050 

so<00:04:13.950> that<00:04:15.920> it<00:04:16.920> isn't<00:04:17.250> an<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.520> have<00:04:17.670> this<00:04:17.790> precious

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
so that it isn't an I have this precious

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.390 
so that it isn't an I have this precious
wood<00:04:18.480> because<00:04:18.900> tell<00:04:19.860> you<00:04:20.010> what<00:04:20.160> with<00:04:20.280> your

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
wood because tell you what with your

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:32.770 
wood because tell you what with your
slam<00:04:20.730> Uli's<00:04:23.990> funds<00:04:24.990> we<00:04:30.440> water<00:04:31.440> them<00:04:31.710> in<00:04:31.770> there

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
slam Uli's funds we water them in there

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.610 
slam Uli's funds we water them in there
you<00:04:33.780> know<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:34.200> spray<00:04:34.530> paint

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.200 

everything<00:04:39.550> from<00:04:39.730> over<00:04:39.880> here<00:04:40.240> is<00:04:40.360> long<00:04:42.210> and

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
everything from over here is long and

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.909 
everything from over here is long and
this<00:04:43.360> is<00:04:44.080> probably<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.500> easiest<00:04:44.710> way<00:04:44.889> to

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
this is probably the easiest way to

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.280 
this is probably the easiest way to
clean<00:04:45.190> this<00:04:45.340> mess<00:04:45.840> just<00:04:46.840> to<00:04:46.930> get<00:04:47.080> all<00:04:47.200> the

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
clean this mess just to get all the

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.780 
clean this mess just to get all the
paint<00:04:47.500> off<00:04:47.650> because<00:04:47.919> there's<00:04:48.520> a<00:04:48.610> lot<00:04:48.760> of

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
paint off because there's a lot of

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.930 
paint off because there's a lot of
places<00:04:49.060> were<00:04:49.360> painted<00:04:49.750> bean<00:04:50.460> so<00:04:51.460> basically

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
places were painted bean so basically

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.010 
places were painted bean so basically
just<00:04:52.300> when<00:04:53.290> you<00:04:53.350> don't<00:04:53.760> inspect<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:55.000> make<00:04:55.240> sure

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
just when you don't inspect it make sure

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.620 
just when you don't inspect it make sure
there's<00:04:56.169> no<00:04:56.260> more<00:04:56.380> paint<00:04:56.680> anywhere<00:04:57.480> that<00:04:58.480> what

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
there's no more paint anywhere that what

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.860 
there's no more paint anywhere that what
you<00:04:58.750> want<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:58.990> do<00:04:59.110> is<00:05:00.330> just<00:05:01.330> dry<00:05:01.600> it<00:05:01.630> off<00:05:01.810> a

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
you want to do is just dry it off a

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.710 
you want to do is just dry it off a
little<00:05:02.110> bit

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
little bit

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:21.269 
little bit
sleep<00:05:04.720> some<00:05:06.840> Sun<00:05:09.600> shine<00:05:10.600> up

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:21.279 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:46.610 

in<00:05:21.849> the<00:05:22.089> term

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.310 

so<00:05:47.660> that<00:05:48.660> part<00:05:48.900> is<00:05:48.960> pretty<00:05:49.230> much<00:05:49.410> clean<00:05:51.320> you

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
so that part is pretty much clean you

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.990 
so that part is pretty much clean you
can<00:05:52.500> see<00:05:52.530> there's<00:05:52.890> no<00:05:53.010> paint<00:05:53.370> on<00:05:53.460> the<00:05:53.580> insides

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
can see there's no paint on the insides

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.960 
can see there's no paint on the insides
a<00:05:55.160> little<00:05:56.160> bit<00:05:56.280> by<00:05:56.430> their<00:05:56.610> nose<00:05:57.650> okay<00:05:58.650> so<00:05:59.460> when

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
a little bit by their nose okay so when

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.270 
a little bit by their nose okay so when
you<00:06:00.060> got<00:06:00.180> that<00:06:00.420> all<00:06:00.600> cleaned<00:06:00.900> up<00:06:01.160> next<00:06:02.160> thing

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
you got that all cleaned up next thing

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.880 
you got that all cleaned up next thing
you<00:06:02.400> want<00:06:02.580> to<00:06:02.610> do<00:06:02.760> is<00:06:02.940> and<00:06:03.330> this<00:06:04.200> part<00:06:04.560> is<00:06:04.650> still

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
you want to do is and this part is still

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.800 
you want to do is and this part is still
probably<00:06:05.100> gonna<00:06:05.280> be<00:06:05.520> wet<00:06:05.730> but<00:06:05.940> it's<00:06:06.090> okay<00:06:06.390> if

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
probably gonna be wet but it's okay if

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.550 
probably gonna be wet but it's okay if
you<00:06:06.960> undo<00:06:07.260> this<00:06:07.380> is<00:06:07.590> just<00:06:09.170> you<00:06:10.170> could<00:06:10.350> just

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
you undo this is just you could just
