the past but I'm using a different
microphone<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.799> problem<00:02:29.189> I<00:02:29.280> have<00:02:29.430> with<00:02:29.549> this

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
microphone the problem I have with this

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.250 
microphone the problem I have with this
one<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:32.040> does<00:02:32.579> make<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.599> does<00:02:33.870> capture

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
one is that it does make it does capture

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.940 
one is that it does make it does capture
the<00:02:34.560> blowing<00:02:35.069> sound<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.900> heart<00:02:37.140> bees<00:02:37.500> are

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
the blowing sound so the heart bees are

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.050 
the blowing sound so the heart bees are
pretty<00:02:38.459> obvious<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.989> used<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.439> on

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
pretty obvious and I have used this on

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.910 
pretty obvious and I have used this on

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
to worry you don't even have to do that

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.860 
to worry you don't even have to do that
and<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.829> actually<00:03:26.280> doesn't<00:03:26.549> take<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.359> full

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
and it actually doesn't take a full

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.129 
and it actually doesn't take a full
season<00:03:28.139> which<00:03:28.829> is<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.159> length<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.609> the<00:03:30.419> that

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
season which is the length that the that

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.920

the<00:03:31.260> skill<00:03:31.500> card<00:03:31.769> last<00:03:32.099> words<00:03:32.430> though<00:03:32.699> I<00:03:33.000> know

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
the skill card last words though I know

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.319 
the skill card last words though I know
it's<00:03:34.349> quite<00:03:34.979> still<00:03:35.400> it's<00:03:35.639> only<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.000> second

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
it's quite still it's only the second

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.680 
it's quite still it's only the second
match<00:03:36.449> but<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:36.750> do<00:03:36.979> check<00:03:37.979> the<00:03:38.459> progress<00:03:39.090> on<00:03:39.569> the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
match but I do check the progress on the

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.420 
match but I do check the progress on the
skills<00:03:39.989> after<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.590> third<00:03:40.829> match<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:41.310> it's

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
skills after the third match and it's

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.430 
skills after the third match and it's
she<00:03:41.909> was<00:03:42.060> right<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:42.510> doesn't<00:03:42.870> actually<00:03:42.989> take

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
she was right it doesn't actually take

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.280 
she was right it doesn't actually take
that<00:03:43.650> long<00:03:44.060> we<00:03:45.060> only<00:03:45.239> play<00:03:45.629> three<00:03:45.870> matches

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
that long we only play three matches

what what a trooper what a trooper cool

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.420 
what what a trooper what a trooper cool
anyway<00:05:17.720> I<00:05:17.990> think<00:05:18.230> it<00:05:18.560> kind<00:05:18.920> of<00:05:18.980> does<00:05:19.130> have<00:05:19.280> been

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
anyway I think it kind of does have been

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.150 
anyway I think it kind of does have been
like<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.850> long-range<00:05:20.420> drive<00:05:20.930> maybe<00:05:21.170> it<00:05:21.440> it

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
like the long-range drive maybe it it

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.230 
like the long-range drive maybe it it
goes<00:05:22.460> up<00:05:23.090> a<00:05:23.930> lot<00:05:24.530> faster<00:05:25.100> if<00:05:25.280> we<00:05:25.580> actually<00:05:25.730> go

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
goes up a lot faster if we actually go

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.840 
goes up a lot faster if we actually go
for<00:05:26.680> long-range<00:05:27.680> shot<00:05:28.040> which<00:05:28.370> makes<00:05:28.640> sense

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
for long-range shot which makes sense

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.400 
for long-range shot which makes sense
and<00:05:29.090> the<00:05:29.180> speed<00:05:29.480> merchant<00:05:29.660> maybe<00:05:30.050> if<00:05:30.230> we

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
and the speed merchant maybe if we

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.160 
and the speed merchant maybe if we
actually<00:05:30.620> go<00:05:30.980> like<00:05:31.280> long<00:05:32.150> runs<00:05:32.690> and<00:05:32.960> stuff

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
actually go like long runs and stuff

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.110 
actually go like long runs and stuff
which<00:05:33.530> we<00:05:33.800> actually<00:05:33.950> do<00:05:34.280> a<00:05:34.310> lot<00:05:34.490> both<00:05:34.820> of<00:05:35.030> them

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
which we actually do a lot both of them

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.630 
which we actually do a lot both of them
so<00:05:35.360> it<00:05:35.510> shouldn't<00:05:35.720> be<00:05:35.840> a<00:05:35.900> problem<00:05:36.050> for<00:05:36.260> us

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
so it shouldn't be a problem for us

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.540 
so it shouldn't be a problem for us
anyway<00:05:37.640> Cole<00:05:38.140> setups<00:05:39.140> TVG<00:05:39.830> there<00:05:40.070> with<00:05:40.250> a<00:05:40.280> goal

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
anyway Cole setups TVG there with a goal

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.490 
anyway Cole setups TVG there with a goal

and then gets a second one with the

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.440 
and then gets a second one with the
finish<00:05:42.770> always<00:05:43.130> fair<00:05:43.430> enough<00:05:43.640> was<00:05:43.850> very<00:05:44.210> good

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
finish always fair enough was very good

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.570 
finish always fair enough was very good
on<00:05:44.870> target<00:05:45.530> but<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.710> keeper<00:05:46.010> I<00:05:46.220> don't<00:05:46.490> know

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
on target but the keeper I don't know

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.140 
on target but the keeper I don't know
why<00:05:46.850> he<00:05:47.120> was<00:05:47.270> positioned<00:05:47.870> so<00:05:48.170> on<00:05:48.530> his<00:05:48.890> right<00:05:49.310> it

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
why he was positioned so on his right it

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.510 
why he was positioned so on his right it
was<00:05:50.420> like<00:05:50.630> he<00:05:50.840> was<00:05:50.990> anticipating<00:05:51.410> a<00:05:51.920> corner<00:05:52.370> I

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
was like he was anticipating a corner I

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.100 
was like he was anticipating a corner I
don't<00:05:52.670> know<00:05:52.760> what<00:05:52.970> he<00:05:53.210> was<00:05:53.360> trying<00:05:53.600> to<00:05:53.690> do<00:05:53.870> but

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
don't know what he was trying to do but

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.190 
don't know what he was trying to do but
anyway<00:05:54.560> that<00:05:55.310> leaves<00:05:55.850> a<00:05:56.210> goal<00:05:56.450> with<00:05:56.720> an<00:05:56.840> easy

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
anyway that leaves a goal with an easy

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.610 
anyway that leaves a goal with an easy
goal<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:58.130> that<00:05:58.880> is<00:05:58.940> to<00:05:59.060> nail<00:05:59.540> we<00:06:00.110> always<00:06:00.410> feel
