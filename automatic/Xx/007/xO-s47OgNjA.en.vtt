00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.290 

again<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:10.050> is<00:01:10.259> an<00:01:10.470> issue<00:01:10.909> even<00:01:11.909> though<00:01:12.090> it's

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
again it is an issue even though it's

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.630 
again it is an issue even though it's
getting<00:01:12.899> cooler<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.960> weather<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.070> quite<00:01:17.369> hot

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
getting cooler the weather is quite hot

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.260 
getting cooler the weather is quite hot
still<00:01:20.600> that's<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:22.020> duck<00:01:22.410> on<00:01:23.149> on<00:01:24.149> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
still that's the duck on on the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.210 
still that's the duck on on the
packaging<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.869> looks<00:01:25.110> quite<00:01:25.380> dark<00:01:25.649> let's<00:01:25.950> see

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
packaging it looks quite dark let's see

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.560 
packaging it looks quite dark let's see
how<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.259> reality<00:01:28.460> it<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.640> my<00:01:29.880> crazy

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
how it's in reality it is my crazy

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.029 
how it's in reality it is my crazy
KitKat<00:01:31.530> theory<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:33.619> think<00:01:34.619> that's<00:01:34.800> not<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
KitKat theory I think that's not a

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.160 
KitKat theory I think that's not a
coincidence

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
coincidence

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.770 
coincidence
are<00:01:37.170> these<00:01:37.470> meant<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.160> be<00:01:38.570> replacement<00:01:39.570> for

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
are these meant to be replacement for

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.740 
are these meant to be replacement for
cigarettes<00:01:40.200> because<00:01:41.090> they're<00:01:42.090> packed<00:01:42.570> in

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
cigarettes because they're packed in

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.680 
cigarettes because they're packed in
Silla<00:01:43.110> foil<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.800> you<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.970> individually

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
Silla foil and you can individually

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.800 
Silla foil and you can individually
break<00:01:46.170> them<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:47.300> pieces<00:01:48.300> of<00:01:48.420> cigarette

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
break them like pieces of cigarette

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.320 
break them like pieces of cigarette
maybe<00:01:49.550> by<00:01:51.500> using<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.920> trick<00:01:53.220> they<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.880> win

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
maybe by using this trick they can win

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.930 
maybe by using this trick they can win
the<00:01:54.660> cigarette<00:01:55.380> smokers<00:01:55.830> I<00:01:56.250> don't<00:01:56.489> know<00:01:56.610> yes
