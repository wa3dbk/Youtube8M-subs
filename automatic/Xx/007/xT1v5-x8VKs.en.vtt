hits this thing going at 200 miles an
hour<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.930> explodes<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.670> don't<00:01:29.909> have

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
hour and explodes and we don't have

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.270 
hour and explodes and we don't have
friction<00:01:30.450> creating<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> flower<00:01:31.530> instead<00:01:32.130> we

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
friction creating the flower instead we

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.880 
friction creating the flower instead we
have<00:01:32.460> high-velocity<00:01:33.090> impact<00:01:33.530> it's<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> same

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
have high-velocity impact it's the same

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.499 
have high-velocity impact it's the same
as<00:01:35.040> throwing<00:01:35.310> an<00:01:35.520> apple<00:01:35.820> at<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> car<00:01:36.240> when<00:01:36.420> it

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
as throwing an apple at a car when it

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.700 
as throwing an apple at a car when it
goes<00:01:36.689> by<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.409> know<00:01:37.530> splat<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.710> this

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
goes by you know splat so this

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.530 
goes by you know splat so this
controlled<00:01:41.250> by<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.549> amount<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.240> air<00:01:42.509> that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
controlled by the amount of air that

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.990 
controlled by the amount of air that
comes<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.110> with<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> more<00:01:43.890> air<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.430> we

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
comes in with it so the more air that we

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.730 
comes in with it so the more air that we
put<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.329> with<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.810> course<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> grind

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
put in with it the course of the grind

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.880 
put in with it the course of the grind
will<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.720> if<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:49.049> always<00:01:49.229> hits<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:49.770> the

will be and if it always hits at the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.889 
will be and if it always hits at the
same<00:01:50.130> speed<00:01:50.520> depending<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.240> where<00:01:51.420> you've<00:01:51.600> set

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
same speed depending on where you've set

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.889 
same speed depending on where you've set
it<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.409> dial<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.640> all<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.149> pieces<00:01:54.600> of

it on the dial and so all the pieces of

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.319 
it on the dial and so all the pieces of
flower<00:01:55.170> will<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> same<00:01:55.890> size<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.880> that's

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
flower will be the same size and that's

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.459 
flower will be the same size and that's
what's<00:01:57.570> really<00:01:57.630> neat<00:01:58.020> because<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.229> get<00:01:58.439> a

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
what's really neat because you get a

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.469 
what's really neat because you get a
great<00:01:58.740> texture<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.399> your<00:01:59.430> bread<00:01:59.820> because<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
great texture to your bread because the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.620 
great texture to your bread because the
flour<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.380> same<00:02:01.619> size<00:02:01.950> now<00:02:02.939> because<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.479> is

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
flour is the same size now because it is

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.999 
flour is the same size now because it is
not<00:02:03.810> ground<00:02:04.740> or<00:02:05.250> milled<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.740> stone<00:02:07.740> mill

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
not ground or milled with a stone mill

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.770 
not ground or milled with a stone mill
or<00:02:08.250> something<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.640> creates<00:02:08.970> friction<00:02:09.209> our

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
or something that creates friction our

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.350 
or something that creates friction our
temperature<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.530> lot<00:02:10.830> lower<00:02:11.220> than<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:12.150> would

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
temperature is a lot lower than it would

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.650 
temperature is a lot lower than it would
be

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
be

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.330 
be
if<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.780> were<00:02:12.930> using<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.500> type<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:13.920> mill<00:02:14.190> that

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
if you were using a type of mill that

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.910 
if you were using a type of mill that
was<00:02:14.490> actually<00:02:15.060> grinding<00:02:15.600> this<00:02:16.410> mill<00:02:16.710> Mills

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
was actually grinding this mill Mills

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.970 
was actually grinding this mill Mills
around<00:02:17.190> 100<00:02:17.580> degrees<00:02:17.700> Fahrenheit<00:02:18.570> where<00:02:18.980> 180

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
around 100 degrees Fahrenheit where 180

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.650 
around 100 degrees Fahrenheit where 180
degrees<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.520> where<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.850> start<00:02:21.150> losing<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
degrees is where you start losing the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.810 
degrees is where you start losing the
nutrients<00:02:22.140> how<00:02:22.350> they<00:02:22.440> get<00:02:22.620> great<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.700> is

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
nutrients how they get great so that is

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.460 
nutrients how they get great so that is
another<00:02:24.090> reason<00:02:24.210> we<00:02:24.600> like<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.990> do<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.290> we

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
another reason we like to do this we

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.110 
another reason we like to do this we
know<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.650> all<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.070> nutrition<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.670> here

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
know that all the nutrition is here

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.930 
know that all the nutrition is here
however<00:02:27.930> 15<00:02:28.710> minutes<00:02:29.040> after<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.490> have<00:02:29.670> mailed

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
however 15 minutes after you have mailed

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.970 
however 15 minutes after you have mailed
your<00:02:30.180> flour<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.840> start<00:02:31.170> losing<00:02:31.350> nutrients

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
your flour you start losing nutrients

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.310 
your flour you start losing nutrients
into<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.400> air<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.910> three<00:02:33.540> days<00:02:33.750> later<00:02:33.780> you've

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
into the air and three days later you've

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.400 
into the air and three days later you've
lost<00:02:34.530> over<00:02:34.980> 60%<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.970> your<00:02:36.090> nutrition<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:37.380> that

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
lost over 60% of your nutrition so that

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.710 
lost over 60% of your nutrition so that
is<00:02:37.650> why<00:02:37.830> we<00:02:38.040> always<00:02:38.280> mill<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.820> flour<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.450> then

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
is why we always mill the flour and then

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.080 
is why we always mill the flour and then
use<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.350> our<00:02:40.410> bread<00:02:40.890> immediately<00:02:41.730> we<00:02:41.880> don't

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
use it in our bread immediately we don't

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.120 
use it in our bread immediately we don't
leave<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.450> sitting<00:02:42.690> around<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.710> do<00:02:43.920> have

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
leave it sitting around if you do have

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.310 
leave it sitting around if you do have
to<00:02:44.340> leave<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.550> thick<00:02:44.940> freeze<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.930> that's<00:02:46.110> the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
to leave it thick freeze that that's the

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.930 
to leave it thick freeze that that's the
best<00:02:46.470> way<00:02:46.710> of<00:02:46.740> keeping<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.400> will<00:02:47.520> keep<00:02:47.700> up

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
best way of keeping and it will keep up

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.090 
best way of keeping and it will keep up
to<00:02:48.120> 330<00:02:48.720> days<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.260> your<00:02:49.410> freezer

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
to 330 days in your freezer

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.330 
to 330 days in your freezer
but<00:02:50.520> outside<00:02:50.760> 10<00:02:51.690> days<00:02:51.960> 10<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.770> 12<00:02:52.980> days<00:02:53.130> and

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
but outside 10 days 10 to 12 days and

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.030 
but outside 10 days 10 to 12 days and
the<00:02:53.550> wheat<00:02:53.730> germ<00:02:54.000> here<00:02:54.270> will<00:02:54.420> go<00:02:54.570> rancid<00:02:55.170> now

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
the wheat germ here will go rancid now

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.420 
the wheat germ here will go rancid now
that<00:02:56.430> brings<00:02:56.700> me<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.270> point<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.810> why<00:02:58.430> we

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
that brings me to the point of why we

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.430 
that brings me to the point of why we
mill<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.820> flour<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.390> get<00:03:00.570> all<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.960> nutrients

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
mill the flour to get all the nutrients

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.800 
mill the flour to get all the nutrients
in<00:03:01.590> our<00:03:01.710> bread<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.060> little<00:03:03.360> kit<00:03:03.600> that

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
in our bread this is a little kit that

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.830 
in our bread this is a little kit that
shows<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.350> how<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:05.430> flour<00:03:06.090> industry<00:03:06.630> makes

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
shows you how the flour industry makes

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.230 
shows you how the flour industry makes
them<00:03:07.170> they're<00:03:07.590> flour<00:03:07.860> they<00:03:08.520> start<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.000> same

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
them they're flour they start the same

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.240 
them they're flour they start the same
way<00:03:09.420> we<00:03:09.630> do<00:03:09.810> with<00:03:09.960> foot<00:03:10.230> with<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.710> grain<00:03:10.950> or<00:03:11.220> the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
way we do with foot with a grain or the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.280 
way we do with foot with a grain or the
wheat<00:03:11.550> but<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.540> first<00:03:12.780> thing<00:03:12.990> they<00:03:13.110> do<00:03:13.260> is

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
wheat but the first thing they do is

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.830 
wheat but the first thing they do is
remove<00:03:13.710> the<00:03:13.920> bread<00:03:14.220> or<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.730> outer<00:03:15.480> layer<00:03:15.810> of

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
remove the bread or the outer layer of

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.440 
remove the bread or the outer layer of
the<00:03:16.140> green<00:03:16.590> which<00:03:17.340> have<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.610> lot<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.090> vitamin

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
the green which have a lot of vitamin

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.110 
the green which have a lot of vitamin
B's<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.930> them<00:03:19.020> lots<00:03:19.350> of<00:03:19.530> fiber<00:03:19.830> when<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.730> bran

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
B's and them lots of fiber when the bran

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.570 
B's and them lots of fiber when the bran
is<00:03:21.300> removed<00:03:21.330> they<00:03:21.930> also<00:03:22.140> take<00:03:22.530> out<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
is removed they also take out the the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.310 
is removed they also take out the the
middlings<00:03:24.000> or<00:03:24.150> shorts<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:24.810> is<00:03:24.959> attached

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
middlings or shorts and this is attached

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.680 
middlings or shorts and this is attached
to<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.620> bread<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.100> here<00:03:26.550> in<00:03:26.700> Canada<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:27.540> is

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
to the bread and here in Canada this is

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.660 
to the bread and here in Canada this is
what<00:03:27.870> they<00:03:27.990> feed<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.380> pigs<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:29.280> we<00:03:29.400> have<00:03:29.550> the

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
what they feed the pigs so we have the

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.449 
what they feed the pigs so we have the
healthiest<00:03:30.150> pigs<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.720> sickest<00:03:31.050> people

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
healthiest pigs of the sickest people

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.190 
healthiest pigs of the sickest people
then<00:03:32.459> they<00:03:32.640> take<00:03:32.880> out<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.390> wheat<00:03:33.600> germ<00:03:33.959> and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
then they take out the wheat germ and

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.949 
then they take out the wheat germ and
the<00:03:34.680> wheat<00:03:34.860> germ<00:03:35.130> oil<00:03:35.430> now<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.420> these<00:03:36.690> two

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
the wheat germ oil now this these two
