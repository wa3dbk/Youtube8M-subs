00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.920
 hello to all and welcome to a 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.240
 new tutorials video and this 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.430
 I will show you how 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.300
 recognize a fake of a real version 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.730
 pokemon 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.770
 so in front of you on your left you 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.250
 have and the real versions and on your 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.609
 right 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.199
 the effect that game boy advance as well 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.610
 that yellow versions 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.500
 I will start with the sale of 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.050
 cartridges and show you first 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.030
 the image so the fecq that is in 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.190
 top and the real version that is found 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.440
 downstairs let's start already with the real 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.220
 it's true that the image is 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.320
 rather holographic and very bright 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.030
 and on the fact that brilliant also 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.409
 you're going to tell me that's right but 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.239
 rather a glossy effect 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.150
 indeed it was printed on paper 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.400
 iced and there the difference anyway 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.100
 the image is seen a lot so that already 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.799
 it's a bad sign 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.570
 here is what to take in 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.400
 account also these are the famous logo 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.030
 you can see on the front of 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.700
 the cartridge the golden logo of nintendo 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.200
 seal of quality with the other premises 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.900
 Nintendo in red and white 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.150
 the pokemon company and the logo c 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.570
 and e and numbers and letters all 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.100
 downstairs that we can now with the fake 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.930
 let's see theirs too the offer 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.260
 political and also a glossy effect 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 so much darker than the one who 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.490
 is on the real version is on the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.500
 right you can see also a 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.150
 little white edge in frankly that 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.820
 really dirty is really bad 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.040
 does the red one a nintendo logo is in 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.630
 white on the other hand no difference and 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.330
 it's about the rest that the difference is 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.040
 sees at the level of the cee and especially on this 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.610
 which is below on the numbers and 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.320
 letters 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.300
 it is much more pronounced on the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.729
 does that from above than on the real 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.810
 version this pokemon company also one 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.570
 looks like he's writing 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.540
 different so that's good too 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.729
 avoid one always on the front of the 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.290
 cartridge on the real versions you 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.539
 will be able to see figures 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.280
 are embedded in the image here while 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.430
 you can see a small 0.1 and 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.230
 1,7 and there on the fecq against you 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.730
 can search failed goal do all this 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.159
 that you want there is nothing at all 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.950
 registered no figure is the same on 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.810
 the others nothing at all though if I 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.510
 shows you the emerald version 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.250
 here the figure in water the 2 0 they are 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.349
 well registered no it is 1 0 and at 9 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.780
 rather so here are the numbers are good 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.580
 present I will resume the version 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.099
 emerald and show you inside 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.709
 now the little circuit you can 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.530
 glimpse nintendo of registered on the 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.410
 circuit here is here it's perfect same 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.260
 for all others normally the logo 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.370
 Nintendo must be inscribed inside 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.540
 which is different for versions 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.519
 red hair and verfeil 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.940
 there is the registered nintendo logo 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.790
 but he is also surrounded version 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.250
 verfeuil So there it is perfect is 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.840
 correct 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.170
 let's take an example here on the version 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.760
 ruby the logo is also nintendo but 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.459
 look at it is much more pronounced 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.980
 and he is he was made bold also we 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.299
 would say and the letters ny is the 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.430
 second is born it looks like they are 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.170
 stuck so that was really yes it's 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.140
 pig troll is indeed good 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.110
 this here it is the same but if it is 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.700
 much more pronounced the red version 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.750
 hair and verfeuil version by 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.609
 against it is also alone but cons 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.220
 he is not surrounded and yes the cocos 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.310
 you forgot to add this and 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.090
 that's one more thing 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.920
 the back now and I'm going to take 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.650
 the version rui because it's on that 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.420
 it sells best so the logo 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.850
 nintendo registered on both 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.319
 cartridges and also other small 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.470
 things but it's mostly at the level of 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.389
 the writing you see on the party 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.639
 version that is at the bottom it looks like 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.859
 that it was stretched where it's a writing 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.959
 different but good anyway it's 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.370
 well there but unfortunately it is not 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.220
 not quite that could not 1 it's not 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.780
 the real logo with the true writing is 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.510
 something else at the circuit level it 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.769
 must therefore observe the fecq version which 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.400
 can be found below you can 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.600
 see small vertical bars 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.919
 and on the affect version that are found 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.240
 here by cons nothing at all 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.620
 see there is nothing so there is this is 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.710
 the same so plays world for example the 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.360
 version wii mote it's exactly the same 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.729
 and here is the real one that's here and 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.729
 the pit that is there so good it's not 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.680
 tip top toussaint and now let's talk 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.129
 backup i'm going to show you the 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.779
 fake emerald version 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.520
 the time it is approached to launch 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:44.330
 show you closer the device is 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.189
 quite normal here the same and that's 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.800
 especially there actually when you launch the 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:50.839
 game there are those who appear on the 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.149
 previous file this will be loaded you 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:55.610

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:57.529
 have already seen this on your versions not of 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.619
 all ben me either so that proves that 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:02.449
 again it's a fake 

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:04.249

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.119
 no need for glasses 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.979
 the cartridges it's the same poor 

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:22.159

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:39.769
 seal of quality no you have this famous 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.389
 black logo on the e and Nintendo 

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:42.829
 seal of quality on versions 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:45.589
 normally he must be here 

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:47.419
