00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello my name is versys invite 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.520
 take you to the new animated version 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.520
 inquisitive minds 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.840
 today i have you great 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.970
 question did you think about how you 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.750
 doing a cartoon version 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.670
 lewd cartoon lesson yes you 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.009
 just think how many children will be 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:29.099
 now I don't think you look 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:31.450
 do without darsiz wind professionals 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.690
 amazing karma 2 overs succeed 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.010
 make everything so beautiful 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.450
 the best way to understand how 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.110
 multipliers animate their 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.480
 characters 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.480
 go where they work 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.859
 animation studio automaton 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.859
 specializes in commercials 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.960
 planets do you think is most logical 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.949
 start here where the multiplier draws 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.699
 your hero 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:07.240
 here and wrong and we will start here 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:11.860
 where they record the voices of all the characters 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.860
 my corner and always sell 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.440
 jack bonaparte to circus james 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.730
 grabbing a flat freak why at first 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.770
 record voices 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.530
 the fact is it is very difficult to draw 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.440
 the movement of the character's lips does not hear him 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.130
 voice and voice helps determine when 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.650
 and how should phonogram types move 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:39.630
 carefully analyze from it to allocate 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:41.940
 separate sounds for each of these sounds 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.140
 fits your lip position 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.750
 for example summer and lip position 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.150
 match the sound with 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.070
 this is the position of the lips and the sound of these sheets 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.110
 helps the multiplier to achieve that 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.869
 to make the characters move their lips 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.869
 matching plot to recorded city 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.740
 jack was around the apartment circus is the best and so 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.830
 now when we have u per gram and 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.870
 you can start drawing as well 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.760
 animate still figure like 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.250
 make it move when the artist 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.410
 finished drawing he puts a new one on it 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.860
 a sheet of paper I thought makes a new 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.959
 picture 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.110
 but at the same time change the position of the character 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.930
 referring to the first picture 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.790
 then does it again and again in 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.880
 each time slightly changes position 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.540
 character and it turns out the whole series 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.150
 drawings 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.170
 each of which depicts his moment 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.300
 of the movie but it looks like it is just a borg with 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.680
 fixed pages where does it come from 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.930
 movements 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.450
 when we move from one drawing to 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.250
 another character as jumping from disappears 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.989
 because of that place and appears in another 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.069
 close to him together in real life 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.530
 objects can't suddenly 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.870
 disappear and suddenly they appear 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:12.680
 move from one point to another 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:17.239
 when our brains are logical but wrong 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.400
 concludes that the character moves on there 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.069
 tooth difficulty you have one to 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.260
 there was an illusion of smooth movement in front 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.919
 you must pass at least 24 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.260
 frames per second is 1440 drawings on 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:32.510
 one minute of the film that is more than a hundred 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.349
 thousands of drawings on cartoon usually 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:41.599
 lengths as a multiplier handle 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:45.049
 this hardest task one way is 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:47.239
 just divide worked usually chief 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.760
 the multiplier draws only key 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.099
 the position of the figures for example if the character 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.810
 moves from point a to point b world and 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.780
 the main multiplier draws only 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.900
 key provisions a and b his assistants 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.079
 draw all intermediate positions then 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.430
 there are all positions between key 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.530
 finished and the drawings are transferred to the department 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:13.790
 colorization where other artists 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:16.220
 put colored paint but 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.590
 not original pictures are painted 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.919
 they are transferred to a transparent plastic 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.919
 sheet 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:30.430
 plastic sheets are called blanks 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.460
 and these blanks are painted 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.460
 Well 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:42.839
 have briskly here luck to conceive endured 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:45.459
 all movie layers we save time 

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:47.650
 use blanks we draw only 

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:49.960
 what is necessary 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.240
 for example if in this episode move 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.250
 only characters 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.710
 why over and over again redraw back 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.410
 plan c tefal various elements back 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.410
 character plan foreground transfers 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.900
 hay different billet this frame consists 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.479
 of four layers type since all layers 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:12.360
 Transparent artist need to redraw 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:15.419
 only what moves is visible 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:20.580
 lived filatu and headquarters 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.580
 clothing and food from the self. 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:30.300
 now we have all the individual items 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.370
 but as a cartoon unifier here 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.010
 come into play this device it 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.230
 called 1 frustrated camera it 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.720
 basis is kinako it corrodes 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.660
 shooting through the layers placed here 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.780
 billets operator will sit here 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:49.620
 day after day taking one frame afterwards 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:53.670
 changing blanks then take another shot 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.930
 and so on until the film is ready in 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.270
 it's a boring process 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.060
 but almost all the cartoons were 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:04.320
 made that way until recently 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:07.020
 time nowadays more and more more 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.120
 cartoons are done on computers but 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.930
 what is happening here is no they 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.950
 secretly , fundamentally, this is the same 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.030
 multipliers have been involved for many years 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.230
 the multiplier still begins 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.419
 pencil drawings 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.650
 but instead of transmitting them to 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.320
 colorization department 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.710
 he scans them in a computer computer 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.450
 can easily combine all the drawings 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.160
 characters plans and get the final 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.210
 product 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.430
 color frame can simply 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.040
 move the mouse and click 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.660
 computer speeds up the process saving us 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:45.060
 from blanks and hand coloring 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.400
 cross look now we really 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.120
 we can make a cartoon version 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.560
 inquisitive minds 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.380
 anything can be on the computer 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.340
 turn the cartoon wonder why 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.340
 this red button 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.720
 sneci let what is why are you on me 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.720
 so you watch 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:12.470
 inquiring minds 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:16.030
 you thought about 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:18.800
 christ what are you doing dish up 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.830
 wonder how the multiplier manages 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.440
 make everything so beautiful 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:27.070
 what is it I say and repeat everything myself 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.070
 beginnings
