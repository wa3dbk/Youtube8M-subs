new<00:00:14.059> technology<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.299> we<00:00:15.660> brought<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
new technology that we brought to the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.980 
new technology that we brought to the

I<00:00:20.150> hate<00:00:21.150> condensers<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.260> now<00:00:23.039> can<00:00:23.430> prove<00:00:23.820> why

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
I hate condensers I now can prove why

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.320 
I hate condensers I now can prove why
I've<00:00:24.689> hated<00:00:24.900> them<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.289> 50<00:00:25.859> years<00:00:26.119> they<00:00:27.119> have

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
I've hated them for 50 years they have

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.810 
I've hated them for 50 years they have
too<00:00:27.539> much<00:00:27.689> gain<00:00:28.050> too<00:00:28.560> much<00:00:28.590> sensitivity<00:00:29.310> they

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
too much gain too much sensitivity they

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.999 
too much gain too much sensitivity they
have<00:00:29.939> no<00:00:30.240> rear<00:00:30.539> rejection<00:00:31.230> why<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.619> we<00:00:31.859> using

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
have no rear rejection why are we using

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.130 
have no rear rejection why are we using
them<00:00:32.369> they're<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.059> sensitive<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.660> hang<00:00:33.989> them

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
them they're so sensitive you hang them

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.860 
them they're so sensitive you hang them
three<00:00:34.440> feet<00:00:34.620> above<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.040> cymbal<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.870> everything

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
three feet above a cymbal and everything

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.290 
three feet above a cymbal and everything
else<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.380> there<00:00:37.680> all<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.250> guitars<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.879> stuff

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
else is there all the guitars and stuff

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.000 
else is there all the guitars and stuff
but<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.840> symbols<00:00:40.230> aren't<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.649> got<00:00:40.770> anything

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
but the symbols aren't you got anything

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.639 
but the symbols aren't you got anything
there's<00:00:41.910> no<00:00:42.030> reason<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.110> changed

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
there's no reason to that so we changed

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.340 
there's no reason to that so we changed
that<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> was<00:00:44.820> very<00:00:45.180> fortunate<00:00:45.809> and

to sit on their stages with my
analytical<00:01:13.140> equipment<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:14.570> find<00:01:15.570> out<00:01:15.810> what

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
analytical equipment and find out what

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.530 
analytical equipment and find out what
was<00:01:16.260> going<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.490> first<00:01:17.790> thing<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.210> did<00:01:18.360> was

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
was going on the first thing we did was

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.710 
was going on the first thing we did was
a<00:01:18.600> kick<00:01:18.930> drum<00:01:18.960> microphone<00:01:20.090> yeah<00:01:21.090> everybody

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
a kick drum microphone yeah everybody

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.930 
a kick drum microphone yeah everybody
builds<00:01:22.110> one<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.800> a<00:01:22.920> cheap<00:01:23.160> little<00:01:23.400> $2.00

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
builds one but it's a cheap little $2.00

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.230 
builds one but it's a cheap little $2.00
nothing<00:01:24.509> element<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.350> has<00:01:25.560> no<00:01:26.070> design<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.790> it

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
nothing element that has no design to it

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.630 
nothing element that has no design to it
it's<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.720> there<00:01:28.580> well<00:01:29.580> know<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.110> did

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
it's just there well know what we did

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.900 
it's just there well know what we did
after<00:01:32.640> looking<00:01:33.450> at<00:01:33.600> all<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.910> analytical

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
after looking at all of the analytical

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.090 
after looking at all of the analytical
equipment<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.600> about<00:01:36.930> two<00:01:37.200> years<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:37.920> road

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
equipment of about two years on the road

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.249 
equipment of about two years on the road
we<00:01:39.090> discovered<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.930> all<00:01:40.229> bass<00:01:40.800> drums

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
we discovered that all bass drums

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.410 
we discovered that all bass drums
averages<00:01:43.259> around<00:01:43.410> fifty<00:01:44.100> two<00:01:44.280> hundred<00:01:44.420> this

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
averages around fifty two hundred this

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.690 
averages around fifty two hundred this
is<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.660> big<00:01:46.020> dynamic<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.979> an<00:01:47.160> inch<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> half

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
is a big dynamic it's an inch and a half

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.920 
is a big dynamic it's an inch and a half
it's<00:01:48.240> huge

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
it's huge

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.139 
it's huge
all<00:01:49.560> other<00:01:49.860> dynamics<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.670> see<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.000> about

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
all other dynamics you see is about

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.469 
all other dynamics you see is about
half-inch<00:01:52.080> no<00:01:52.679> no<00:01:52.830> we<00:01:53.220> build<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.580> big<00:01:53.789> one<00:01:54.000> and

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
half-inch no no we build a big one and

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.169 
half-inch no no we build a big one and
we<00:01:56.149> spike<00:01:57.320> passively<00:01:58.399> we<00:01:59.399> put<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> low<00:01:59.910> pass

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
we spike passively we put a low pass

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.330 
we spike passively we put a low pass

the beater and then rolled it all off at
8k<00:02:13.349> now<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.849> have<00:02:15.120> an<00:02:15.390> incredible<00:02:16.819> kick<00:02:17.819> drum

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
8k now we have an incredible kick drum

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.690 
8k now we have an incredible kick drum
like<00:02:18.360> even<00:02:19.290> listening<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.099> drum<00:02:20.370> techs

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
like even listening to the drum techs

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.880 
like even listening to the drum techs
they<00:02:20.880> said<00:02:21.180> make<00:02:21.660> sure<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:22.260> don't<00:02:22.410> make<00:02:22.650> this

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
they said make sure you don't make this
