00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 all of them crisis this is the benchmark 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.020
 at which graphics solutions compete today 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.670
 let's go and we'll see each other now 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.530
 times with our intel core i7 57 70 c 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.530
 if the integrated graphic creates it 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.590
 Intel's new broadway processors 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.720
 a strong focus on the integrated 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.150
 Graphics has the processor performance itself 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.070
 not so much improved but the 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.830
 Power absorbed by the 14 nanometer 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.660
 Process and the saved chip 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.489
 intel has very strong reserves in 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.650
 the graphics are integrated so now too 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.420
 the desktop cpu we are here in the test 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.260
 have the highest expansion level 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.520
 which is called a pro has 6200 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.400
 128 megabytes of RAM on board 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.199
 and 48 execution units 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.409
 that's a big jump over 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.860
 the predecessor and we will take a look now 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:03.620
 times whether this graphic solution price is in 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.920
 full hd and in good details play 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.350
 can 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.900
 we have the current one here 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.430
 Top model of contains for the pedestal 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.680
 11.50 installed the new 17 57 75 ccs 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.299
 karl means that the processor 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.570
 a free multiplier you can 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:26.960
 So overclock as in the processors 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.990
 which must also have the above 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.579
 intel a two megawatt slice of the l3 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.189
 sacrificing caches so there is only one left 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.920
 six megabytes of l3 cache for that if we 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.070
 give us the goblet of the banks 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.930
 here we see 128 megabytes of cache for 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.670
 that made it all enough for pro graphics 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.780
 the preface circle friend we have in 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.940
 background already started and 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.909
 now we can see that too, hopefully 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.049
 starts the same can sometimes advance already 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:03.380
 times the detail settings we show 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.240
 have here full hd resolution and indeed 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.869
 not in low details or so 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.789
 but gamer details texture resolution 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.310
 is always on with integrated graphics 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.360
 but makes no difference 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.360
 for the performance 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.560
 and if we do that in the game 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.990
 even watch 32 fps so the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.110
 magic 30 fps brand for integrated 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.560
 graphic has fallen that is not 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.870
 bad is always better and indeed 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.550
 with integrated with with dedicated 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.610
 graphics, of course, but for such a 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.310
 integrated processor of none 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.740
 graphics card has more features are 30 fps in 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.740
 Crysis in full hd worthy of all honors 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.770
 So you see, even if I'm in here 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:00.490
 the vegetation goes on anyway 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.780
 30 fps, even if they are the ones here 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.500
 memory connection hard work 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.960
 must perform the power consumption 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.460
 we see up here 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.140
 for the whole system we are in 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:16.210
 moment at 138 will be about that 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.800
 Of course, well above the tdp of 65 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.840
 watt but there is of course still the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.190
 Memory of fans the hard disk and 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.510
 everything else and the inefficiency ahead 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.770
 power supply in so far as you can 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.020
 actually be happy with that 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.310
 total system 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.990
 However, I have to admit a little bit 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.459
 but that's what I'm showing now 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:39.130
 again at the memory 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:45.130
 speed officially gives intel the 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:47.230
 57 7 15 o'clock for ddr3 800 1600 free with 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.870
 800 megahertz that would be displayed here 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.830
 but we have ddr3 18 66 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.310
 adjusted 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.380
 this will be for dc 3 v 4 processors 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.430
 offered as well as for the mobile 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.200
 variants of intel 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.180
 so far , it's just a little cheating 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.340
 the graphics are shown 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.430
 yes, not so bad for integrated 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.769
 graphic 30 fps in the price so the question 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.659
 where we can circle with yes 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:16.459
 answer at least what all pro 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.459
 graphic 6200 is concerned
