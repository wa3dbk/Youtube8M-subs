that got the least amount of views of
anything<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.480> I<00:02:37.540> reviewed<00:02:37.720> this<00:02:38.020> week<00:02:38.230> is

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
anything that I reviewed this week is

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.380 
anything that I reviewed this week is
this<00:02:38.650> putt-putt<00:02:39.220> golf<00:02:39.580> video<00:02:39.940> but<00:02:40.270> it's

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
this putt-putt golf video but it's

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.270 
this putt-putt golf video but it's
probably<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.900> best<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.560> think<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.100> here<00:02:42.250> I

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
probably the best I think to here I

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.740 
probably the best I think to here I
guess<00:02:42.459> this<00:02:42.580> dude<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:42.910> playing<00:02:43.120> mini<00:02:43.360> golf<00:02:43.600> and

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
guess this dude is playing mini golf and

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.360 
guess this dude is playing mini golf and
I<00:02:43.870> guess<00:02:44.020> he<00:02:44.110> got<00:02:44.230> his<00:02:44.380> ball<00:02:44.680> trapped<00:02:45.100> in<00:02:45.250> the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
I guess he got his ball trapped in the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.130 
I guess he got his ball trapped in the
water<00:02:45.610> here<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:46.180> only<00:02:46.330> got<00:02:46.480> 300,000

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
water here and this only got 300,000

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.990 
water here and this only got 300,000
views<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.440> 3<00:02:47.650> days<00:02:47.800> it's<00:02:48.100> only<00:02:48.250> 30<00:02:48.580> seconds

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
views in 3 days it's only 30 seconds

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.130 
views in 3 days it's only 30 seconds
long<00:02:49.209> but<00:02:49.360> it's<00:02:49.510> one<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:49.720> those<00:02:49.810> things<00:02:50.050> that

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
long but it's one of those things that

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.900 
long but it's one of those things that
you<00:02:50.260> could<00:02:50.380> only<00:02:50.620> capture<00:02:51.100> on<00:02:51.250> camera<00:02:51.280> like

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
you could only capture on camera like

00:02:51.910 --> 00:03:02.470 
you could only capture on camera like
once<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.690> lifetime<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.150> ghost<00:02:58.420> ball

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.759
