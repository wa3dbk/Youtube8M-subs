00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.550
 it says that on this av the square is heart 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.659
 the Greek 

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:11.659
 no 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.480
 remember the term is welcome the episode of yes 8 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.130

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.039
 lead lead leak what no this is the very first episode and I wanted today 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.249
 explain driven 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.109
 what exactly the intention is to do this series something 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.050
 You see me live now, by the way, if I can do anything that goes on 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.260
 play online shop game ever this is in my opinion the best game ever in it 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.170
 where far was actually the only one 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.010
 very nice idea must be the board of heavy fan that new 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.990
 I think a super trio everybody is waving great giggs doesn't seem like a purchase price either 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.990
 that everyone are quickscopes and could really stand on for hours 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.880
 the scanner that people who used to be at that time 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.659
 that doesn't matter in any case 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.069
 jan you can or if you buy yoy looks yes if that is the largest gas field 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:00.060
 witkop did 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.960
 that goes along with 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.360
 among others to deal with me 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.980
 doing a brace what we are going to do is racing against each other and that if 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.850

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.990
 that other courage 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.350
 we just have to find out exactly how 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.540
 go do it but well you the they lose there shows the winner day 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.290

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.860
 now we will focus a bit better on the game because it seems to me 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.390
 I say I'm going to view photos better 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.180

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.789

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.919
 I have no idea 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.919
 that's true 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.090
 that meet to stand on there with the three of them with the gasket 3 sat I make one 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.619

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.739
 I only had them in the alberti 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.739
 dozens do know what shooting is a tire jump 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.649
 or I get fired because it seems bro trouble with it 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:37.579
 I may well get enough of it if it keeps going on because that 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.959
 the law I'm just going to call 26 good ten in this demo 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.579

 that is my problem seriously it hits the beginning of recording I can't manage anymore 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.859
 this is how it always works 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:55.489
 only after shot is read more if we demand that the square has arrived 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.319
 the Greek 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.319

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:09.279

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:11.619

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:13.549
 calmness 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.759

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:37.569

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.519

 what on paper are expats' fingers or something 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.719

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.550

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.469

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.400
 modern 4 look so it can go but that is it was a bit of an idea 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.139
 how i play and stuff 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.490
 it was a split set of 4 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.629
 for the band 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:46.169
 oomen belg stood 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.599

 stood there this morning 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:53.969

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:28.249
 I can't stand it when I jump but he doesn't speak 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.770
 this is not the image of the opponent 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.020
 boomstra cala may have people come to watch this time then say that again 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.520
 show off a bit too 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.180
 they are waiting but I also have to go to the club 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.369
 to watch professional football 

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:58.309
 very much looking at the couch and the situation next time later 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:00.269
 but the council
