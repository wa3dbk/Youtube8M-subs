most beginners pick up that kind of
stuff<00:00:16.109> pretty<00:00:16.320> quickly<00:00:16.700> the<00:00:17.700> hard<00:00:17.910> part<00:00:18.180> comes

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
stuff pretty quickly the hard part comes

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.390 
stuff pretty quickly the hard part comes
when<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.780> need<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.960> move<00:00:19.140> from<00:00:19.650> one<00:00:19.890> chord<00:00:20.310> to

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
when you need to move from one chord to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.850 
when you need to move from one chord to

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
another and usually the biggest

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.210 
another and usually the biggest
challenge<00:00:23.400> here<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:24.529> fingers<00:00:25.529> wise<00:00:25.710> trying<00:00:26.100> to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
remember one ship from the other because

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.769 
remember one ship from the other because
they<00:00:29.279> all<00:00:29.400> seem<00:00:29.609> completely<00:00:30.000> distinct<00:00:30.660> and

quite separate from each other what we
want<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.510> try<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.929> find<00:00:34.170> common<00:00:35.069> things

so<00:00:38.579> say<00:00:38.789> we<00:00:38.909> take<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.179> chords<00:00:39.479> G<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.839> D<00:00:42.409> now<00:00:43.409> if

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:43.499 
so say we take the chords G and D now if

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.319 
so say we take the chords G and D now if
you<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> look<00:00:43.920> at<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> PDF<00:00:44.519> on<00:00:44.789> Dave<00:00:44.969> marks

process up a little is to leave our

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.810 
process up a little is to leave our
third<00:01:18.450> finger<00:01:18.780> where<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.640> look<00:01:20.700> at

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
third finger where it is if you look at

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.590 
third finger where it is if you look at
the<00:01:20.850> G<00:01:21.060> chord<00:01:22.250> it<00:01:23.250> has<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.640> note<00:01:23.850> played<00:01:24.450> with

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the G chord it has that note played with

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.700 
the G chord it has that note played with
the<00:01:24.690> third<00:01:24.899> finger<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.960> D<00:01:28.140> chord<00:01:28.380> has<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the third finger the D chord has the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.649 
the third finger the D chord has the
same<00:01:30.830> so<00:01:31.830> my<00:01:32.220> third<00:01:32.520> finger<00:01:32.789> never<00:01:33.479> actually

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
same so my third finger never actually

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.160 
same so my third finger never actually
leaves<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.259> position<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.039> rest<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.520> my<00:01:35.610> hand

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
leaves that position the rest of my hand

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.130 
leaves that position the rest of my hand
comes<00:01:37.170> away<00:01:37.429> pivots<00:01:38.429> around<00:01:38.550> that<00:01:38.940> finger<00:01:39.330> so

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
comes away pivots around that finger so

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.169 
comes away pivots around that finger so
that<00:01:40.289> finger<00:01:40.619> gives<00:01:40.800> me<00:01:41.009> stability<00:01:41.280> within<00:01:41.850> my

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
that finger gives me stability within my

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.809 
that finger gives me stability within my
chord<00:01:42.479> change<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.500> gives<00:01:43.770> me<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> guy<00:01:44.429> to

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
chord change it gives me like a guy to

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.300 
chord change it gives me like a guy to
show<00:01:45.210> me<00:01:45.390> where<00:01:45.630> each<00:01:46.350> ship<00:01:46.710> should<00:01:46.920> go<00:01:47.069> from

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
show me where each ship should go from

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.279 
show me where each ship should go from
one<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.700> next<00:01:47.819> so<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.450> think<00:01:48.720> my<00:01:48.840> G<00:01:49.050> ship

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
one to the next so I think my G ship

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.169 
one to the next so I think my G ship
happens<00:01:49.470> down<00:01:49.830> here<00:01:49.860> third<00:01:50.550> finger<00:01:50.909> stays

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
happens down here third finger stays

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.630 
happens down here third finger stays

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
have a little bit practice with that

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.890 
have a little bit practice with that
just<00:02:11.380> moving<00:02:11.740> from<00:02:11.920> G<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.760> D<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.330> back<00:02:13.720> again

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
just moving from G to D and back again

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.020 
just moving from G to D and back again
and<00:02:14.260> if<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.740> have<00:02:14.860> any<00:02:14.890> particular<00:02:15.310> strum

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
and if you have any particular strum

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.490 
and if you have any particular strum
patterns<00:02:16.420> or<00:02:16.540> exercises<00:02:17.050> that<00:02:17.170> your<00:02:17.320> teacher

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
patterns or exercises that your teacher

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.590 
patterns or exercises that your teacher
has<00:02:17.620> given<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.100> work<00:02:18.790> on<00:02:18.940> using<00:02:19.240> those<00:02:19.360> two

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
has given you work on using those two

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.120 
has given you work on using those two
chords<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.080> move<00:02:20.260> between<00:02:20.410> them<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.920> lot<00:02:21.100> of

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
chords to move between them a lot of

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.830 
chords to move between them a lot of
people<00:02:21.220> practice<00:02:21.790> strum<00:02:22.060> patterns<00:02:22.450> with<00:02:22.630> just

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
people practice strum patterns with just

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.050 
people practice strum patterns with just
one<00:02:23.020> chord<00:02:23.380> but<00:02:24.010> if<00:02:24.250> you're<00:02:24.490> able<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.880> get

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
one chord but if you're able to get

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.330 
one chord but if you're able to get
these<00:02:25.270> two<00:02:25.510> concepts<00:02:26.080> happening<00:02:27.010> at<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.160> same

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
these two concepts happening at the same

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.220 
these two concepts happening at the same
time<00:02:27.610> then<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.540> can<00:02:28.690> double<00:02:28.960> up<00:02:29.020> on<00:02:29.140> your

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
time then you can double up on your

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:39.960 
time then you can double up on your
practice<00:02:29.650> just<00:02:30.520> work<00:02:30.730> on<00:02:30.880> G<00:02:38.640> have<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.700> good<00:02:39.850> time

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
practice just work on G have a good time

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.230 
practice just work on G have a good time
practicing<00:02:40.420> I'll<00:02:40.690> see<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:40.870> next<00:02:40.960> time
