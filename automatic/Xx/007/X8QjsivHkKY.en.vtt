00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
your finger up here to see what kind of

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.660 
your finger up here to see what kind of
words<00:02:37.140> going<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.470> give<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.680> next<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.250> it

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.130 
the calculator that it looks like this
and<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:05.400> looks<00:03:05.550> pretty<00:03:05.670> nice<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.960> does

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
and it looks pretty nice and it does

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.810 
and it looks pretty nice and it does
work<00:03:07.170> like<00:03:07.590> if<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:07.860> put<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.340> it's<00:03:08.640> going<00:03:08.760> to

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
work like if you put that it's going to

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.330 
work like if you put that it's going to
actually<00:03:09.060> do<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.450> for<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.050> you<00:03:10.950> can<00:03:11.070> score

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
actually do it for you and you can score

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.470 
actually do it for you and you can score
right<00:03:11.550> through<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.060> there's<00:03:12.210> other

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
right through it and there's other

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.630 
right through it and there's other
options<00:03:12.570> as<00:03:13.080> well<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.770> can<00:03:13.920> add<00:03:14.130> all<00:03:14.400> this

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
options as well you can add all this

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.190 
options as well you can add all this
crap<00:03:14.910> whatever<00:03:15.240> that<00:03:15.450> means<00:03:15.630> I'm<00:03:15.959> not<00:03:16.080> really

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
crap whatever that means I'm not really

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.620 
crap whatever that means I'm not really
good<00:03:16.350> at<00:03:16.410> math<00:03:16.620> but<00:03:17.160> if<00:03:17.520> you<00:03:17.970> go<00:03:18.120> all<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.600> way

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
good at math but if you go all the way

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.210 
good at math but if you go all the way
to<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.900> end<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.230> also<00:03:19.470> have<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.650> graph<00:03:19.950> which

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
to the end you also have a graph which

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.860 
to the end you also have a graph which
is<00:03:20.340> pretty<00:03:20.490> cool<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.060> there<00:03:21.240> you<00:03:21.390> go<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.510> can

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
is pretty cool and there you go you can

is pretty cool and there you go you can
actually<00:03:21.990> see<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.320> graph<00:03:22.500> from<00:03:22.620> there<00:03:22.860> and

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
actually see the graph from there and

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.190 
actually see the graph from there and
you<00:03:23.490> can<00:03:23.640> actually<00:03:23.970> zoom<00:03:24.000> in<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:25.020> see

you can actually zoom in and you can see

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.010 
you can actually zoom in and you can see
the<00:03:25.290> graph<00:03:25.530> in<00:03:25.830> full<00:03:26.310> view<00:03:26.550> there<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.810> can

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
the graph in full view there and you can

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.780 
the graph in full view there and you can
go<00:03:28.170> right<00:03:28.380> through<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.770> and<00:03:28.920> check<00:03:29.520> out<00:03:29.670> the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
go right through it and check out the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.100 
go right through it and check out the
graph<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.330> also<00:03:30.540> have<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:31.620> thing<00:03:32.720> this<00:03:33.720> this

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
graph you also have this thing this this

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.990 
graph you also have this thing this this
this<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.709> then<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.070> can<00:03:35.220> bring<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.490> down<00:03:35.760> to

bring it back up and then you can delete

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.350 
bring it back up and then you can delete

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
jellybean 4.2 it's pretty much the same

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.340 
jellybean 4.2 it's pretty much the same
thing<00:04:20.940> check<00:04:21.600> it<00:04:21.720> out<00:04:21.810> these

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350
