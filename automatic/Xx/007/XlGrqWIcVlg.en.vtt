it's<00:03:30.630> probably<00:03:31.110> brushed<00:03:31.320> rider<00:03:31.620> but<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:31.830> think

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
it's probably brushed rider but I think

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.620 
it's probably brushed rider but I think
you<00:03:32.100> could<00:03:32.250> make<00:03:32.370> an<00:03:32.489> argument<00:03:32.550> for<00:03:32.970> mutable<00:03:33.390> I

you could make an argument for mutable I

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.900 
you could make an argument for mutable I
mean<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.290> would<00:03:34.320> think<00:03:34.620> it's<00:03:34.830> yeah<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.790> could<00:03:35.880> be

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
mean I would think it's yeah it could be

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.479 
mean I would think it's yeah it could be
either<00:03:36.090> i<00:03:36.300> would<00:03:36.690> think<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.200> mutavault<00:03:37.590> just

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
either i would think it's mutavault just

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.620

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.219 
green agro has actually been has been

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:44.589 
green agro has actually been has been
pretty<00:05:43.550> decent<00:05:44.030> so<00:05:44.150> far<00:05:44.180> on<00:05:44.330> the<00:05:44.389> foreman<00:05:44.570> I

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
pretty decent so far on the foreman I

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:45.969 
pretty decent so far on the foreman I
think<00:05:44.840> what<00:05:44.930> it<00:05:45.020> preys<00:05:45.229> on<00:05:45.409> is<00:05:45.590> these<00:05:45.740> other

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
think what it preys on is these other

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.279 
think what it preys on is these other
aggressive<00:05:46.550> Dex<00:05:46.729> Dex<00:05:46.789> like<00:05:47.180> mono<00:05:47.360> black<00:05:47.659> agro

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
aggressive Dex Dex like mono black agro

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.100 
aggressive Dex Dex like mono black agro
um<00:05:49.060> certainly<00:05:50.060> that's<00:05:50.180> like<00:05:50.300> mono<00:05:50.509> right<00:05:50.780> even

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
um certainly that's like mono right even

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.990 
um certainly that's like mono right even
uh<00:05:51.440> it's<00:05:51.979> gonna<00:05:52.340> be<00:05:52.460> great<00:05:52.580> against<00:05:52.789> any<00:05:52.940> of

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
uh it's gonna be great against any of

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.040 
uh it's gonna be great against any of
those<00:05:53.060> just<00:05:53.270> because<00:05:53.449> it's<00:05:53.570> creatures<00:05:53.780> are

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
those just because it's creatures are

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.200 
those just because it's creatures are
all<00:05:54.199> bigger<00:05:54.500> and<00:05:54.800> it<00:05:54.889> that's<00:05:55.310> a<00:05:55.370> tad<00:05:55.490> occupies

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
all bigger and it that's a tad occupies

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.790 
all bigger and it that's a tad occupies
about<00:05:56.419> the<00:05:56.719> same<00:05:56.870> spot<00:05:57.110> in<00:05:57.139> the<00:05:57.289> metagame<00:05:57.530> as

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
about the same spot in the metagame as

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.290 
about the same spot in the metagame as
them<00:05:57.979> it's<00:05:58.159> pretty<00:05:58.430> you<00:05:58.639> know<00:05:58.729> its<00:05:58.849> aggressive

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
them it's pretty you know its aggressive

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.420
