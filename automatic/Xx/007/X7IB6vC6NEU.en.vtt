00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:50.589 
ripped all the muscles in my stomach but

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:52.610 
ripped all the muscles in my stomach but
I<00:05:50.650> was<00:05:50.919> still<00:05:51.129> you<00:05:51.370> know<00:05:51.490> able<00:05:51.699> to<00:05:51.819> walk<00:05:52.060> and

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
I was still you know able to walk and

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.149 
I was still you know able to walk and
you<00:05:53.620> know<00:05:53.740> I<00:05:53.770> had<00:05:54.159> gauze<00:05:54.610> on<00:05:54.909> my<00:05:55.089> hands<00:05:56.159> but

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 
you know I had gauze on my hands but

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:59.579 
you know I had gauze on my hands but
most<00:05:57.400> mostly<00:05:58.000> it<00:05:58.150> was<00:05:58.270> psychological<00:05:58.449> like<00:05:59.409> I

00:05:59.579 --> 00:05:59.589 
most mostly it was psychological like I

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:02.820 
most mostly it was psychological like I
at<00:06:00.339> that<00:06:00.520> time<00:06:00.940> had<00:06:01.210> never<00:06:01.389> had<00:06:01.690> a<00:06:01.719> close<00:06:02.500> call

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
at that time had never had a close call

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.089 
at that time had never had a close call
like<00:06:03.669> that<00:06:04.000> before<00:06:04.210> and<00:06:04.569> I<00:06:04.629> haven't<00:06:04.990> since<00:06:05.289> and

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
like that before and I haven't since and

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.200 
like that before and I haven't since and
it<00:06:06.219> really<00:06:06.370> just<00:06:06.580> made<00:06:06.759> me<00:06:06.789> feel<00:06:06.909> vulnerable

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
it really just made me feel vulnerable

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.529 
it really just made me feel vulnerable
for<00:06:07.949> about<00:06:08.949> two<00:06:09.279> years<00:06:09.310> where<00:06:10.060> I<00:06:10.089> couldn't

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
for about two years where I couldn't

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:13.709 
for about two years where I couldn't
quite<00:06:11.319> um<00:06:11.589> push<00:06:12.520> myself<00:06:12.759> I<00:06:13.300> didn't<00:06:13.509> have<00:06:13.629> the

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
quite um push myself I didn't have the

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:17.850 
quite um push myself I didn't have the
drive<00:06:13.990> I<00:06:14.349> I<00:06:14.650> normally<00:06:15.460> had<00:06:15.669> and<00:06:16.650> and<00:06:17.650> that's

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
drive I I normally had and and that's

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.829 
drive I I normally had and and that's
when<00:06:18.039> I<00:06:18.069> really<00:06:18.490> learned<00:06:18.729> that<00:06:19.029> like<00:06:19.210> it's<00:06:19.690> not

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:19.839 
when I really learned that like it's not

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.990 
when I really learned that like it's not
worth<00:06:20.080> it<00:06:20.289> to<00:06:20.349> push<00:06:20.650> too<00:06:20.889> fast<00:06:21.129> that<00:06:21.819> was<00:06:21.969> a

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
worth it to push too fast that was a

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.909 
worth it to push too fast that was a
two-year<00:06:23.520> downslope<00:06:24.520> in<00:06:24.759> progression<00:06:25.830> and<00:06:26.830> it

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
two-year downslope in progression and it

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:28.920 
two-year downslope in progression and it
would<00:06:27.009> have<00:06:27.099> been<00:06:27.190> better<00:06:27.370> if<00:06:27.520> I<00:06:27.759> if<00:06:28.120> I<00:06:28.270> didn't

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
would have been better if I if I didn't

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.350
