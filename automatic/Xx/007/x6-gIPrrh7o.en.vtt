00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
over the place and I don't want to

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.979 
over the place and I don't want to
chance<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.220> I'm<00:02:28.820> really<00:02:29.000> just<00:02:29.209> untwisting

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
chance that I'm really just untwisting

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.449 
chance that I'm really just untwisting
and<00:02:30.410> then<00:02:31.600> separating<00:02:32.980> because<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.070> took<00:02:34.130> you

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.160 
and then separating because I took you
know<00:02:34.580> big<00:02:34.910> chunks<00:02:35.330> of<00:02:35.450> hair<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:36.080> I'm

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
know big chunks of hair so I'm

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.930 
know big chunks of hair so I'm
separating<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.040> pieces<00:02:37.549> as<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:38.600> twist<00:02:39.910> so<00:02:40.910> that

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
separating the pieces as I twist so that

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.880 
separating the pieces as I twist so that
way<00:02:41.209> I<00:02:41.239> won't<00:02:41.390> have<00:02:41.660> too<00:02:41.989> much<00:02:42.230> left<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.680> do

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
way I won't have too much left to do

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.280 
way I won't have too much left to do
once<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.310> finish<00:02:43.820> just<00:02:44.330> after<00:02:44.720> I'm<00:02:44.840> twisting

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
once I finish just after I'm twisting

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.060 
once I finish just after I'm twisting
all<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.400> them<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:48.049> really<00:02:48.470> that's<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.860> I

length<00:03:05.780> today<00:03:06.260> which<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.280> why<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.049> am<00:03:09.049> a<00:03:09.200> fan<00:03:09.440> of

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
length today which is why I am a fan of

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.759 
length today which is why I am a fan of
older<00:03:10.970> twists<00:03:11.239> out<00:03:11.480> because<00:03:12.140> of<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.530> length

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
older twists out because of the length

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.710 
older twists out because of the length
that<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.130> get<00:03:13.720> come<00:03:14.720> up<00:03:14.870> close<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.470> can<00:03:15.620> see

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.190

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.780 
either way I'm running late so I'm
really<00:03:38.500> at<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.739> time<00:03:38.920> that<00:03:39.159> once<00:03:39.400> again<00:03:39.700> it

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
really at the time that once again it

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.899 
really at the time that once again it
came<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.209> it<00:03:40.450> right<00:03:41.319> now<00:03:41.560> but<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:42.280> didn't

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
came to it right now but it didn't

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.000 
came to it right now but it didn't
really<00:03:43.000> need<00:03:43.329> much<00:03:43.629> fluffing<00:03:44.200> as<00:03:44.470> long<00:03:44.680> as<00:03:44.860> you
