00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
temperature pain touch or taste so you

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.300 
temperature pain touch or taste so you
think<00:02:51.040> sour<00:02:51.310> buds<00:02:51.670> plus<00:02:52.480> pain<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.980> doesn't

think sour buds plus pain that doesn't

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.620 
think sour buds plus pain that doesn't
seem<00:02:54.430> bright<00:02:54.670> for<00:02:54.970> some<00:02:55.090> reason<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.480> dual

activation of the buds and the nerves

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.160 
activation of the buds and the nerves
creates<00:02:57.580> a<00:02:57.700> pleasurable<00:02:58.180> sensation<00:02:58.540> for<00:02:59.050> the

creates a pleasurable sensation for the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
brain instead of the sour painful one

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.450 
brain instead of the sour painful one
and<00:03:01.840> that's<00:03:01.960> kind<00:03:02.140> of<00:03:02.170> weird<00:03:02.340> scientists<00:03:03.340> with

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
and that's kind of weird scientists with

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.130 
and that's kind of weird scientists with
the<00:03:03.550> NIH<00:03:03.760> think<00:03:04.240> it<00:03:04.330> might<00:03:04.480> be<00:03:04.510> because<00:03:04.840> the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
the NIH think it might be because the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.050 
the NIH think it might be because the
bubbles<00:03:05.440> are<00:03:05.590> made<00:03:05.710> of<00:03:05.830> carbon<00:03:06.160> dioxide<00:03:06.190> so

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
bubbles are made of carbon dioxide so

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.090 
bubbles are made of carbon dioxide so
they<00:03:07.180> trigger<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.690> ca4<00:03:08.440> differently

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
they trigger that ca4 differently

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.830 
they trigger that ca4 differently
normally<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:09.670> enzyme<00:03:10.000> helps<00:03:10.360> us<00:03:10.510> convert

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
normally the enzyme helps us convert

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.020 
normally the enzyme helps us convert
carbon<00:03:11.200> dioxide<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.830> water<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.340> bicarbonate

carbon dioxide and water to bicarbonate

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.540 
carbon dioxide and water to bicarbonate
and<00:03:13.180> protons<00:03:13.600> so<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.260> body<00:03:14.470> can<00:03:14.740> use<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.130> to

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
and protons so the body can use that to

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.130 
and protons so the body can use that to
balance<00:03:15.790> acids<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:16.600> bases<00:03:16.780> in<00:03:17.080> the
