00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.100
 good afternoon dear channel viewers 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.780
 plant today as always maxim 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.880
 makes me laugh and we are at the nursery 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.650
 which is called the ogre town we 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.619
 a greenhouse which romance very many of them are not 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.410
 love for the fact that the fall of Prabang a little bit 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.010
 brown becomes so little 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.430
 reddish and he is rather disheveled 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.240
 but he does not like the one who can not with him 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.520
 to manage 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.770
 the fact that he is getting brown in winter is not true 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.230
 scary but the most basic 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.870
 the positive trait of Brabant is that of 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.730
 him you can put all that you corner 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.710
 can plant 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.710
 hedge due to the fact that it is cheaper 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.629
 many very and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.789
 can be planted hedge width 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.730
 Brabant reaches somewhere meter or even 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:03.070
 more height have it let the Russians 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.970
 he will cut at least four meters 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.410
 and even more love comes to 7 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.410
 you can cut it 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.360
 on the sides making out some kind of 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.710
 form you can shave it 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.049
 dice or just remove the crown and give 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.509
 he grows wide 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.850
 so it is for this nickname landscape 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.039
 Brabant and valued that can be cut off 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.220
 anything he is growing 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:39.659
 grows somewhere up to 40 cm on each 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.270
 escape so if you mow him 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.569
 already if in the spring you have devoted something to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.500
 in the fall you will see something like what you 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.950
 wanted to see 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.759
 next fall it will be clear 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.670
 a picture of what you wanted therefore about 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.950
 jar planted cut it like you 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.229
 do you want to shoot him even a hedgehog 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.770
 though duck it will still be fine 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.229
 looks good grow and if you him 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.030
 rather often he will be more 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.650
 tight they are so loose 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.230
 as if to let it go by old age therefore 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.829
 I do not think Abram Bam is one of the most 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.799
 bad fight so we drop it off 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:25.440
 we cut her and see what we have 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.590
 it turns out all good, see our 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.590
