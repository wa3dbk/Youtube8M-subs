00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.160
 this video that for you simply 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.840

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.790
 there a warning 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.640
 I hope you understand then who 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.190
 The reason for mw3 is that I am simply 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.620
 no internet at the moment i 'm going to stay 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.890
 for a period of 15 20 days there I am 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.430
 change I have a 1100 with the xbox 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.290
 xbox should're lost than in any box 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.790
 edited and I'm 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.750
 using a gameplay that I had 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.210
 right here 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.030
 I am posting here for you fund is 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.049
 that you follow what I'm going to say 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.030
 for you, right? 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:06.900
 so I 'm going to stay about 15 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.820
 20 days there absent here on the canal 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.340
 for this reason putting me at night 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.350
 All change so I'm without internet 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.630
 or phone with nothing not 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.850
 So for me to edit the videos do 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.640
 two backoffice gameplay has no way 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.460
 does not have conditions at the moment is without 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.190
 no chance even what I have 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.530
 intentions, I do not know if it will work or 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.180
 no but I could do some kind 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.070
 blog is a video game with baby but with 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.950
 talking even exchanging ideas with you 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.980
 there of some specific subject that you 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.320
 also wish to no longer know that there will 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.140
 depending on you I have 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.450
 or two videos, not a kind of blog in the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.659
 channel 1 that was 15 thousand registered in the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.290
 and the other or others that do not 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.780
 Did not think it was only one if you 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.729
 I want if you have an interest 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.620
 this kind of video can make me 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.530
 while you think I'm going to do this 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.360
 Like, I just understood, it 's just a video. 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.680
 making the recording it will him to 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.780
 you to the pa 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.760
 I can father in the house of a 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.640
 A colleague knows how to do this. 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.580
 to upload it without 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.800
 problems the problem is their editing 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.540
 do something more different 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.830
 I will not have conditions even if I 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.040
 I'm without pc without anything 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.770
 I'm just maybe getting settled in the year that 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.830
 is that I agree even 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.930
 with all the equipment today I go 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.540
 preparing a local area only 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.430
 for the state the channel is not to make the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.320
 videos so I'm going to show you that 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.340
 You are not interacting too. 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.290
 more with me still in question 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.360
 settings quoted this staff speaks 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.610
 That's going to have something cool even 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.590
 For me it 's making you 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.560
 but it can also be one of them here 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.410
 in the channel that finally I do not know 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.910
 exactly the date I 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.240
 I was coming back, right? 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.970
 but I want it to be left for you guys 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.100
 want some kind of video a subject 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.860
 talk about something and can already be 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.350
 clear of games in the same code area 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.510
 any doubt that you have some 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.300
 I do not know, there are some kind of 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.300
 fact is that you want me to stay 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.490
 and I see that you comment that 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.090
 I talk about dew and I see what I can do. 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.640
 huh 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.100
 I'm not guaranteed any chan I just 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.590
 I'm trying to get a way understand 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.080
 do not get a very large hole without 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.680
 not a very long time and I 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.120
 at least posted on the blog for you there 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.030
 stay a stronger thing does not have to 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.620
 to be such a distant thing in a vacuum 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.019
 very large right is at least we do not 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.510
 Leave the world very close, right? 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.610
 so I do not know if surely the time 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.930
 So let's get kind of in the 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.780
 expectation and I hope the fastest 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.420
 It's possible that everything is legalized here. 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.630
 that I have of all the equipment of 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:06.420
 back to the internet can do for you 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:08.459
 then psoe's gameplay is mw3 such then 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.989
 at the moment without conditions 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.120
 in December now I hope you 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:16.070
 have understood that you 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.200
 understand it 's because I do not have many 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.750
 exits do not have many different things 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.930
 To make you the best I can. 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.479
 I can do is try to make a blog without 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.030
 edition and bring you on the channel 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:33.690
 so if you do not give it to me, post it 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.249
 videos before Christmas and New Year 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.459
 the wish to you 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:40.079
 A good party for you, it 's a great Christmas. 

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:42.419
 a great new year 

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:44.459
 the staff reflects a little too, right? 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.859
 on the subjects that I brought 

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:49.499
 For you in the channel, it's these things. 

00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:51.839
 controversy does not even know that we can be 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:53.939
 to start the man who comes with a 

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:55.889
 mentality that are also in the 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:58.079
 games we are talking about here is the 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.029
 We will not talk about the 

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:02.129
 respect of a new year here in the games is 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:05.939
 Everyone has their own personal life there. 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:09.209
 Then each wishes his prosperous 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.919
 christmas new year there like you always do 

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:14.129
 but here on the channel let's talk about it 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.769
 of the game channel also then that this 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:20.699
 whether it is a great personal example 

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:21.629
 It's avoiding a lot of fights. It gets boring. 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.349
 even do not 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:27.149
 but it is generally understood that 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.789
 messages that I spent in these 

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:30.779
 recent videos here have been a bit controversial 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.489
 huh 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:34.589
 No one is willing to appear 

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:36.749
 That's when I actually want to talk to 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:39.299
 You guys, I like to say what you like. 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:41.819
 to make the videos sensitive to 

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:45.659
 you and it's this kind of audience that I 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:47.789
 I want to train but then good to boot 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:49.739
 you are a happy new year 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.719
 in this case does not have to post video 

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:53.399
 I'm saying goodbye to you, right? 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:55.799
 in this case to bet and we will 

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:57.749
 touching another idea then beauty 

00:05:55.799 --> 00:06:01.110

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:03.509
