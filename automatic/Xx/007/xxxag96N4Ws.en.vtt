00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
basically understood the gist of it and

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.740 
basically understood the gist of it and
I<00:02:44.290> haven't<00:02:44.560> read<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.799> first<00:02:45.010> one<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:46.209> i<00:02:46.450> will

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
I haven't read the first one so i will

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.180 
I haven't read the first one so i will
be<00:02:46.900> looking<00:02:47.049> into<00:02:47.290> finding<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.799> first<00:02:48.010> one

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
be looking into finding the first one

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.270 
be looking into finding the first one
but<00:02:49.319> storyline<00:02:50.319> is<00:02:50.440> pretty<00:02:50.680> cool<00:02:52.920> not<00:02:53.920> much<00:02:54.099> to

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
but storyline is pretty cool not much to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.430 
but storyline is pretty cool not much to
say<00:02:54.459> it's<00:02:54.640> aliens<00:02:57.239> takes<00:02:58.239> place<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:59.170> doesn't

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
say it's aliens takes place it doesn't

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.630 
say it's aliens takes place it doesn't
take<00:02:59.560> place<00:02:59.769> on<00:02:59.920> lv-426<00:03:00.760> like<00:03:01.480> in<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.900> movies

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640
