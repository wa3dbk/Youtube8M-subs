sticks up into the X and then here I'm
just<00:01:29.820> pushing<00:01:30.060> out<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.840> here's<00:01:31.079> what<00:01:31.229> the

just pushing out so here's what the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.330 
just pushing out so here's what the
first<00:01:31.500> line<00:01:31.829> looks<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:33.439> wait<00:01:34.439> click<00:01:35.100> left

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
first line looks like wait click left

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:45.469 
first line looks like wait click left
right<00:01:38.340> hand<00:01:43.159> now<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.579> first<00:01:44.970> technical

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
right hand now the first technical

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.080 
right hand now the first technical
hurdle<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> lot<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.619> students<00:01:47.009> have<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.280> UM

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
hurdle that a lot of students have to UM

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.719 
hurdle that a lot of students have to UM
is<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.750> five<00:01:49.110> stroke<00:01:49.530> roll<00:01:49.560> into<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
is that five stroke roll into the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.240 
is that five stroke roll into the
paradiddle<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.390> let<00:01:51.600> me<00:01:51.689> demonstrate<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:53.750> did

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
paradiddle and let me demonstrate it did

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.499 
paradiddle and let me demonstrate it did
okay<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.850> from<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> five<00:01:57.479> stroke<00:01:59.329> might<00:02:00.329> be

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
okay going from the five stroke might be

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.760 
okay going from the five stroke might be
a<00:02:00.540> little<00:02:00.780> bit<00:02:00.869> difficult<00:02:01.350> because<00:02:01.439> we've

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
a little bit difficult because we've

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.350 
a little bit difficult because we've
never<00:02:01.890> put<00:02:02.189> those<00:02:02.340> two<00:02:02.640> together<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.270> you

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
never put those two together so you

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.240 
never put those two together so you
might<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.049> practice<00:02:04.259> just<00:02:04.920> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
might just have to practice just that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.140 
might just have to practice just that
for<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.610> while

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.550 

just<00:02:13.150> over<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.600> over<00:02:13.870> getting<00:02:13.990> used<00:02:14.410> to

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
just over and over getting used to

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.590 
just over and over getting used to
playing<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:15.070> 5<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.670> period<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.030> will<00:02:16.120> 5<00:02:16.330> and

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
playing that 5 in a period it will 5 and

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.820 
playing that 5 in a period it will 5 and
a<00:02:16.630> period<00:02:16.870> it'll<00:02:17.020> over<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.290> over<00:02:17.440> that's<00:02:17.710> what

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
a period it'll over and over that's what

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.190 
a period it'll over and over that's what
I<00:02:17.890> call<00:02:18.160> looping<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.150> we're<00:02:19.540> doing<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.960> in<00:02:20.110> a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
I call looping it so we're doing it in a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.720 
I call looping it so we're doing it in a
loop<00:02:20.380> doing<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:20.860> over<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.280> over<00:02:21.580> until

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
loop doing it over and over until

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.510 
loop doing it over and over until
everybody's<00:02:22.540> got<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.750> nice<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.770> solid<00:02:23.920> the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
everybody's got that nice and solid the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.370 
everybody's got that nice and solid the
second<00:02:24.940> line<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.300> lot<00:02:25.570> like<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.960> first<00:02:26.110> line

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
second line is a lot like the first line

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.650 
second line is a lot like the first line
got<00:02:26.650> kind<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.130> same<00:02:27.340> stickings<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.450> same

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
got kind of the same stickings the same

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.260 
got kind of the same stickings the same
5<00:02:28.930> stroke<00:02:29.140> rolls<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.680> same<00:02:29.920> visual<00:02:30.850> elements

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
5 stroke rolls the same visual elements

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.390 
5 stroke rolls the same visual elements
except<00:02:31.720> for<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.020> last<00:02:32.290> two<00:02:32.530> measures<00:02:33.220> and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
except for the last two measures and

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.490 
except for the last two measures and
let's<00:02:33.970> take<00:02:34.180> that<00:02:34.420> because<00:02:34.900> there's<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.320> little

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
let's take that because there's a little

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.620 
let's take that because there's a little
trick<00:02:35.800> involved<00:02:36.250> with<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.490> one<00:02:36.670> as<00:02:36.790> well<00:02:36.970> the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
trick involved with that one as well the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.180 
trick involved with that one as well the
last<00:02:37.810> two<00:02:37.990> measures<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.500> start<00:02:38.740> off<00:02:38.830> with<00:02:38.860> 2

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
last two measures I start off with 2

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.580 
last two measures I start off with 2
paradiddles<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.970> don't<00:02:43.450> lift<00:02:43.930> all<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.560> way

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
paradiddles but I don't lift all the way

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.430 
paradiddles but I don't lift all the way
up<00:02:44.980> on<00:02:45.280> my<00:02:45.340> second<00:02:45.940> paradiddle<00:02:46.510> because<00:02:47.020> in

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
up on my second paradiddle because in

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.350 
up on my second paradiddle because in
the<00:02:47.620> last<00:02:47.830> measure<00:02:48.160> I<00:02:48.430> don't<00:02:48.760> start<00:02:49.090> with<00:02:49.330> a

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
the last measure I don't start with a

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.320 
the last measure I don't start with a
down<00:02:49.570> stroke<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.080> start<00:02:50.470> with<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:51.100> medium<00:02:51.910> height

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
down stroke I start with a medium height

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.380 
down stroke I start with a medium height
roll<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:53.260> I'm<00:02:53.590> gonna<00:02:53.740> go<00:02:53.950> pair<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:55.060> dough

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
roll so I'm gonna go pair the dough

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.140 
roll so I'm gonna go pair the dough
flare<00:02:55.750> dead<00:02:56.410> bolt<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:56.950> only<00:02:57.340> lift<00:02:57.610> up<00:02:57.880> to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
flare dead bolt and only lift up to

flare dead bolt and only lift up to
about<00:02:58.330> half<00:02:58.660> height<00:02:58.930> for<00:02:59.500> my<00:03:00.780> 9<00:03:01.780> stroke<00:03:02.170> roll

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
about half height for my 9 stroke roll

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.180 
about half height for my 9 stroke roll
at<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.560> end<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.250> watch<00:03:03.430> how<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.790> looks

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.860 

that's<00:03:09.190> all<00:03:09.370> there<00:03:09.550> is<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.000> now<00:03:10.510> I'm<00:03:10.750> gonna

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
that's all there is to it now I'm gonna

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.540 
that's all there is to it now I'm gonna
play<00:03:11.140> all<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.530> way<00:03:11.560> through<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.130> rudimental

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
play all the way through the rudimental

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.820 
play all the way through the rudimental
etude<00:03:12.850> with<00:03:13.210> the<00:03:13.450> quarter<00:03:13.780> note<00:03:13.959> equals<00:03:14.110> 90

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
etude with the quarter note equals 90

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.830 
etude with the quarter note equals 90
using<00:03:15.190> double<00:03:15.520> stroke<00:03:15.730> rolls<00:03:16.000> if<00:03:16.270> you<00:03:16.660> don't

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
using double stroke rolls if you don't

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.300 
using double stroke rolls if you don't
have<00:03:16.959> your<00:03:17.050> double<00:03:17.320> stroke<00:03:17.530> rolls<00:03:17.800> worked<00:03:18.160> up

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
have your double stroke rolls worked up

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.250 
have your double stroke rolls worked up
to<00:03:18.580> this<00:03:18.700> feed<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.600> might<00:03:19.750> have<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.050> take<00:03:20.230> a

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
to this feed you might have to take a

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.990 
to this feed you might have to take a
little<00:03:20.470> slower<00:03:20.860> tempo<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.640> doesn't<00:03:21.910> really

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
little slower tempo it doesn't really

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.970 
little slower tempo it doesn't really
matter<00:03:22.209> how<00:03:22.420> fast<00:03:22.690> we<00:03:22.870> do<00:03:23.080> it<00:03:23.230> as<00:03:23.350> long<00:03:23.770> as<00:03:23.830> we

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
matter how fast we do it as long as we

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.220 
matter how fast we do it as long as we
do<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.280> well<00:03:24.700> so<00:03:25.060> here's<00:03:25.630> what<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.840> looks<00:03:26.080> like

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
do it well so here's what it looks like

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:52.140 
do it well so here's what it looks like
at<00:03:26.470> 90<00:03:26.800> beats<00:03:26.950> per<00:03:27.100> minute<00:03:50.850> so<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:51.880> last

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
at 90 beats per minute so that last

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.680 
at 90 beats per minute so that last
paradiddle<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:52.930> really<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.290> Down<00:03:53.680> stroke<00:03:54.040> and

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
paradiddle is really a Down stroke and

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.510 
paradiddle is really a Down stroke and
three<00:03:55.690> taps<00:03:56.020> instead<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.680> an<00:03:56.770> upstroke<00:03:57.130> so

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
three taps instead of an upstroke so

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.670 
three taps instead of an upstroke so
there<00:03:57.700> it<00:03:57.820> is<00:03:57.850> now<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:58.720> can<00:03:58.900> play<00:03:59.050> it<00:03:59.170> faster

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
there it is now you can play it faster

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.470 
there it is now you can play it faster
if<00:03:59.890> you've<00:04:00.190> got<00:04:00.550> your<00:04:00.700> double<00:04:00.970> strokes<00:04:01.180> worked

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
if you've got your double strokes worked

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.840 
if you've got your double strokes worked
up<00:04:01.660> or<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:02.770> can<00:04:02.920> play<00:04:03.100> it<00:04:03.220> with<00:04:03.250> multiple

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
up or you can play it with multiple

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.400 
up or you can play it with multiple
bounces<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.420> this<00:04:04.540> is<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.780> way<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:05.020> is<00:04:05.080> on<00:04:05.320> the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
bounces and this is the way it is on the

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.050 
bounces and this is the way it is on the
accompaniment<00:04:05.830> CD<00:04:06.250> so<00:04:06.580> now<00:04:06.760> I've<00:04:06.880> got<00:04:07.030> my

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
accompaniment CD so now I've got my

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.479 
accompaniment CD so now I've got my
tempo<00:04:07.570> at<00:04:07.720> a<00:04:07.750> hundred<00:04:08.190> listen<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.280> what<00:04:09.400> it

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
tempo at a hundred listen to what it

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:31.630 
tempo at a hundred listen to what it
sounds<00:04:09.580> like<00:04:09.760> with<00:04:10.150> multiple<00:04:10.600> bounces

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.320 

and<00:04:32.640> there<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:32.970> have<00:04:33.000> it

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
and there you have it

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.900 
and there you have it
