soon<00:01:19.590> know<00:01:19.619> because<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.189> soon<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.580> move<00:01:20.850> it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
soon know because as soon as I move it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.630 
soon know because as soon as I move it
it<00:01:21.210> will<00:01:21.360> set<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.720> off<00:01:22.009> let's<00:01:23.009> give<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.369> again

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
it will set it off let's give that again

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.630 
it will set it off let's give that again
just<00:01:25.759> reset<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.799> now<00:01:28.799> once<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.250> alarm<00:01:29.490> has

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
just reset that now once the alarm has

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.580 
just reset that now once the alarm has
been<00:01:29.670> triggered<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.689> will<00:01:30.990> automatically

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
been triggered it will automatically

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.249 
been triggered it will automatically
reset<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.640> still<00:01:33.090> up<00:01:33.270> still<00:01:33.600> active<00:01:34.079> now

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
reset so it is still up still active now

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.640 
reset so it is still up still active now
so<00:01:34.500> I'll<00:01:34.650> move<00:01:34.829> again<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:38.720> likewise<00:01:39.720> if<00:01:40.380> one

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
so I'll move again and likewise if one

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.100 
so I'll move again and likewise if one
of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> other<00:01:40.979> sensors<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:42.840> gets

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
of the other sensors and get gets

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.569 
of the other sensors and get gets
triggered<00:01:43.409> Outlawz<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.950> set<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.250> off<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.549> just

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
triggered Outlawz to set it off so just

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.740 
triggered Outlawz to set it off so just
off<00:01:45.740> if<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.920> connect<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.790> ignition<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.659> it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
off if I connect up the ignition so it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.149 
off if I connect up the ignition so it
thinks<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.110> being<00:01:49.259> hot-wired<00:01:51.979> that<00:01:52.979> also

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
thinks it's being hot-wired that also

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.990 
thinks it's being hot-wired that also
sets<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.700> off<00:01:53.869> deactivate<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.380> alarm<00:01:55.470> no

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
triggered whilst you've been away and if

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.359 
triggered whilst you've been away and if
you<00:02:00.479> look<00:02:00.600> at<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.750> status<00:02:01.020> LED<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.890> flashes

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
you look at the status LED that flashes

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.139 
you look at the status LED that flashes
to<00:02:02.460> say<00:02:02.640> what<00:02:02.880> triggered<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.729> four<00:02:05.729> flashes

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
to say what triggered it so four flashes

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.630 
to say what triggered it so four flashes
means<00:02:06.390> an<00:02:06.600> attempted<00:02:07.140> Hotwire<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.220> three

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
means an attempted Hotwire and three

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.630 
means an attempted Hotwire and three
flashes<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.300> ultrasonic<00:02:10.069> she'll<00:02:11.069> show<00:02:11.370> both

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
flashes is ultrasonic she'll show both

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.250 
flashes is ultrasonic she'll show both
of<00:02:11.670> those
