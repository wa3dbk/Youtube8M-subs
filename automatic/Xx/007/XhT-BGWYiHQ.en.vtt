gives us a great opportunity in many

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.539 
gives us a great opportunity in many
ways<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:10.080> blur<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.500> lines<00:00:10.709> between<00:00:11.010> inside

ways to blur the lines between inside

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.459 
ways to blur the lines between inside
and<00:00:11.610> out<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.330> idea<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.690> bringing<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.020> garden

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
and out this idea of bringing the garden

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.920 
and out this idea of bringing the garden
indoors<00:00:13.830> we<00:00:14.459> do<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.699> with<00:00:14.820> holiday<00:00:15.270> plants

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
indoors we do it with holiday plants

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.109 
indoors we do it with holiday plants
such<00:00:16.139> as<00:00:16.170> poinsettias<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.310> Christmas<00:00:17.850> cactus

such as poinsettias and Christmas cactus
and<00:00:18.510> then<00:00:19.050> there's<00:00:19.199> no<00:00:19.380> end<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> greens

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
and then there's no end of the greens

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
Christmas they don't require as much

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.430 
Christmas they don't require as much
energy<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.700> most<00:00:45.450> traditional<00:00:46.050> Christmas

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
energy as most traditional Christmas

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.080 
energy as most traditional Christmas
lights<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.160> matter<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.460> fact<00:00:47.730> they<00:00:47.910> use

lights as a matter of fact they use

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.610 
lights as a matter of fact they use
approximately<00:00:48.420> 90<00:00:49.140> percent<00:00:49.560> less

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
approximately 90 percent less

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.500 
approximately 90 percent less

electricity than conventional
incandescent<00:00:51.960> bulbs<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.310> what<00:00:53.700> they<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:53.880> also

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
incandescent bulbs so what they can also

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.750 
incandescent bulbs so what they can also
do<00:00:54.600> by<00:00:54.870> keeping<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.740> temperature<00:00:56.340> down<00:00:56.580> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
do by keeping the temperature down and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.610 
do by keeping the temperature down and
you<00:00:56.820> see<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.150> get<00:00:57.360> hot<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:58.260> actually

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you see they don't get hot they actually

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.110 
you see they don't get hot they actually
keep<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.920> tree<00:00:59.400> from<00:00:59.580> drying<00:00:59.910> out

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
keep your tree from drying out

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.030 
keep your tree from drying out
prematurely<00:01:00.900> if<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.470> touch<00:01:01.710> one<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
prematurely if you touch one of the

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.920 
prematurely if you touch one of the
bulbs<00:01:02.250> you'll<00:01:02.520> find<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:02.880> actually<00:01:03.090> cool<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
bulbs you'll find it's actually cool to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.810 
bulbs you'll find it's actually cool to
the<00:01:04.049> touch<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:05.159> other<00:01:05.369> thing<00:01:05.700> that's

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the touch the other thing that's

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.429 
the touch the other thing that's
interesting<00:01:06.090> about<00:01:06.479> these<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
interesting about these is that the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.010 
interesting about these is that the
strands<00:01:07.770> themselves<00:01:08.340> will<00:01:08.520> last<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.119> long<00:01:09.509> time

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
strands themselves will last a long time

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.880 
strands themselves will last a long time
and<00:01:10.259> you're<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.469> to<00:01:10.499> think<00:01:10.679> this<00:01:10.770> is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
and you're going to think this is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.999 
and you're going to think this is
ridiculous<00:01:11.640> but<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.149> can<00:01:12.539> get<00:01:12.689> up<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.869> 10<00:01:13.649> to

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
ridiculous but you can get up to 10 to

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.620 
ridiculous but you can get up to 10 to
20,000<00:01:14.939> hours<00:01:15.149> of<00:01:16.100> beauty<00:01:17.100> out<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.729> one<00:01:18.240> strand

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
20,000 hours of beauty out of one strand

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.209 
20,000 hours of beauty out of one strand
of<00:01:18.780> light<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> other<00:01:19.469> thing<00:01:19.859> is<00:01:19.979> they're

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
of light and the other thing is they're

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.910 
of light and the other thing is they're
made<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.670> plastic<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.630> there's<00:01:22.200> no<00:01:22.380> breakage

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
made of plastic so there's no breakage

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.709 
made of plastic so there's no breakage
involved<00:01:23.429> like<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.729> had<00:01:23.939> with<00:01:24.149> incandescent

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 
involved like you had with incandescent

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:27.260 
involved like you had with incandescent
bulbs<00:01:25.409> each<00:01:25.770> year<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.039> try<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> create<00:01:26.609> a<00:01:26.999> little

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
bulbs each year I try to create a little

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.809 
bulbs each year I try to create a little
different<00:01:27.630> theme<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.170> my<00:01:28.259> Christmas<00:01:28.740> tree
