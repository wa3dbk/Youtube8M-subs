00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
I am blaming partner with perler

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.329 
I am blaming partner with perler
electric<00:00:03.600> and<00:00:03.840> what<00:00:04.529> I<00:00:04.560> have<00:00:04.770> in<00:00:04.920> front<00:00:04.950> of<00:00:05.250> me

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
electric and what I have in front of me

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.860 
electric and what I have in front of me
here<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:06.049> 1998<00:00:07.130> 1999<00:00:08.540> Zr<00:00:09.540> or<00:00:10.019> ZL<00:00:11.870> 500-600

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
here is a 1998 1999 Zr or ZL 500-600

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.060 
here is a 1998 1999 Zr or ZL 500-600
carb<00:00:13.620> stator<00:00:14.120> so<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> carbureted<00:00:16.619> unit

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
carb stator so this is a carbureted unit

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.210 
carb stator so this is a carbureted unit
not<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> efi<00:00:17.970> like<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.420> say<00:00:18.630> 98<00:00:19.109> 99<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.920> was<00:00:20.100> on

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
not a efi like I say 98 99 this was on

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.540 
not a efi like I say 98 99 this was on
the<00:00:20.310> 500s<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.029> 600<00:00:21.689> 's<00:00:21.859> whether<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:22.980> was<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> zr

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
the 500s and 600 's whether it was a zr

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.029 
the 500s and 600 's whether it was a zr
z<00:00:23.910> L<00:00:24.029> doesn't<00:00:24.300> matter<00:00:24.630> that's<00:00:24.869> more<00:00:25.199> chassis

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
z L doesn't matter that's more chassis

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.740 
z L doesn't matter that's more chassis
setup<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.789> forth<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:28.349> stator<00:00:28.650> here

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750

goes to your CDI box and this is the one

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.759 
goes to your CDI box and this is the one
we<00:01:02.579> check<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.300> check<00:01:03.600> resistance<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.589> our

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
we check to check resistance for our

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.280 
we check to check resistance for our
ignition<00:01:04.949> coils<00:01:05.700> our<00:01:06.270> ignition<00:01:06.420> coils<00:01:07.140> are

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
ignition coils our ignition coils are

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.219 
ignition coils our ignition coils are
the<00:01:07.409> two<00:01:07.590> larger<00:01:08.040> coils<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.229> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the two larger coils here and the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.289 
the two larger coils here and the
largest<00:01:10.740> tiers<00:01:11.010> are<00:01:11.220> considered<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:11.970> low

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
largest tiers are considered the low

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.420 
largest tiers are considered the low
side<00:01:12.630> coil<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.530> that's<00:01:13.650> basically<00:01:14.130> what's

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
side coil and that's basically what's

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.999 
side coil and that's basically what's
used<00:01:14.729> when<00:01:15.030> sled<00:01:15.960> has<00:01:16.110> started<00:01:16.530> up<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
used when sled has started up and

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.090 
used when sled has started up and
running<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.330> know<00:01:18.420> low<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> medium<00:01:19.080> rpms<00:01:19.799> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
running you know low to medium rpms and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.590 
running you know low to medium rpms and
then<00:01:20.189> we've<00:01:20.310> got<00:01:20.400> our<00:01:20.430> high<00:01:20.670> side<00:01:20.970> coil<00:01:21.270> here

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
then we've got our high side coil here

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.390 
then we've got our high side coil here
which<00:01:21.750> helps<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.860> high<00:01:23.280> rpms<00:01:24.080> so<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:26.220> rest

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
which helps on the high rpms so the rest

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.800 
which helps on the high rpms so the rest
of<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> stator<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.450> these<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:27.780> just

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
of the stator here these are just

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.230 
of the stator here these are just
lighting<00:01:28.290> coils<00:01:28.740> that's<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.130> power<00:01:29.340> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
lighting coils that's the power that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.960 
lighting coils that's the power that
goes<00:01:30.450> through<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.079> plug<00:01:31.439> here<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.009> powers

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
goes through this plug here and powers

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.530 
goes through this plug here and powers
your<00:01:33.119> lights<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.810> forth<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:35.329> what<00:01:36.329> we'll

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
your lights and so forth so what we'll

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.260 
your lights and so forth so what we'll
do<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.259> go<00:01:37.799> ahead<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.040> check<00:01:38.369> our<00:01:38.610> ohms<00:01:38.880> here

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
do is go ahead and check our ohms here

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
do is go ahead and check our ohms here
for<00:01:39.600> our<00:01:39.810> two<00:01:40.619> ignition<00:01:41.130> coils<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.509> plug

be four hundred and fifty ohms and that

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.690 
be four hundred and fifty ohms and that
is<00:02:49.230> for<00:02:49.590> your<00:02:50.280> large<00:02:50.940> low<00:02:51.420> side<00:02:51.720> coil<00:02:52.080> only<00:02:52.700> so

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
is for your large low side coil only so

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.600 
is for your large low side coil only so
off<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.970> test<00:02:54.210> it<00:02:54.740> obviously<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:56.040> settings<00:02:56.430> on

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
off to test it obviously the settings on

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.880 
off to test it obviously the settings on
your<00:02:56.660> multimeter<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:58.290> need<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.740> at

matter at all which one we measure so

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.860 
matter at all which one we measure so
we'll<00:03:14.730> start<00:03:15.060> off<00:03:15.350> first<00:03:16.350> with<00:03:16.650> our<00:03:17.660> with<00:03:18.660> our

be 45 ohms and sometimes getting
connection<00:03:28.080> in<00:03:28.230> here<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.530> little<00:03:28.800> bit<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.280> a

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
connection in here is a little bit of a

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.790 
connection in here is a little bit of a
pain<00:03:29.610> sometimes<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.300> got<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.450> push<00:03:30.810> hard<00:03:31.530> but

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
pain sometimes you got to push hard but

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.310 
pain sometimes you got to push hard but
not<00:03:31.950> too<00:03:32.010> hard<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.850> then<00:03:33.360> wiggle<00:03:33.960> them<00:03:34.290> around

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
not too hard and then wiggle them around

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.310 
not too hard and then wiggle them around
a<00:03:34.680> little<00:03:34.800> bit<00:03:35.100> so<00:03:35.940> we<00:03:36.360> go<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.540> test<00:03:36.930> our<00:03:37.140> high

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
a little bit so we go to test our high

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.180 
a little bit so we go to test our high
side<00:03:37.650> coil<00:03:38.040> on<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.550> in<00:03:38.810> no<00:03:39.810> ohms<00:03:40.110> you<00:03:40.980> just

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
side coil on this in no ohms you just

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.310 
side coil on this in no ohms you just
see<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.370> 1<00:03:41.760> on<00:03:42.000> there<00:03:42.270> if<00:03:42.510> there's<00:03:42.750> connection

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
see a 1 on there if there's connection

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.320 
see a 1 on there if there's connection
between<00:03:43.530> your<00:03:43.920> two<00:03:44.130> leads<00:03:44.430> at<00:03:44.850> least<00:03:45.090> gives

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
between your two leads at least gives

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.620 
between your two leads at least gives
you<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.480> zero<00:03:46.160> so<00:03:47.160> when<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.940> open<00:03:48.420> when

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
you a zero so when this is open when

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.570 
you a zero so when this is open when
there's<00:03:48.780> no<00:03:48.930> connection<00:03:49.320> I've<00:03:49.770> got<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.010> 1<00:03:50.340> on

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
there's no connection I've got a 1 on

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.000 
there's no connection I've got a 1 on
mine<00:03:50.850> if<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.660> had<00:03:51.750> an<00:03:51.870> analog<00:03:52.320> obviously<00:03:52.890> the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
mine if you had an analog obviously the

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.160 
mine if you had an analog obviously the
needle<00:03:53.310> wouldn't<00:03:53.580> move<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:54.600> kind<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.930> thing

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
needle wouldn't move that kind of thing

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.730 
needle wouldn't move that kind of thing
so<00:03:55.500> when<00:03:56.220> we<00:03:56.370> check<00:03:56.670> our<00:03:56.970> high<00:03:57.660> side<00:03:58.020> coil<00:03:58.410> on

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
so when we check our high side coil on

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.940 
so when we check our high side coil on
this<00:03:58.980> stator<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.700> is<00:04:00.420> dead<00:04:00.900> we<00:04:01.230> have<00:04:01.410> an<00:04:01.530> open

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
this stator it is dead we have an open

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.010 
this stator it is dead we have an open
condition<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.850> I<00:04:02.940> knew<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.300> going<00:04:03.480> in<00:04:03.810> this

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
condition and I knew that going in this

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.650 
condition and I knew that going in this
is<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.220> bad<00:04:05.220> unit<00:04:05.490> that<00:04:05.790> needs<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.150> be<00:04:06.180> rewound

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
is a bad unit that needs to be rewound

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.970 
is a bad unit that needs to be rewound
so<00:04:07.700> when<00:04:08.700> we<00:04:08.880> go<00:04:09.120> ahead<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.480> check<00:04:09.780> our<00:04:10.350> low

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
so when we go ahead and check our low

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.830 
so when we go ahead and check our low
side<00:04:11.370> coil<00:04:12.110> which<00:04:13.110> is<00:04:13.140> supposed<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.650> be<00:04:13.760> 450

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
side coil which is supposed to be 450

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.270 
side coil which is supposed to be 450
you<00:04:15.840> can<00:04:16.049> see<00:04:16.230> it<00:04:16.380> checks<00:04:17.270> 453<00:04:18.270> 454<00:04:19.190> you<00:04:20.190> know

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
you can see it checks 453 454 you know

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.780 
you can see it checks 453 454 you know
it's<00:04:20.460> like<00:04:20.580> 450<00:04:21.330> plus<00:04:22.229> or<00:04:22.440> minus<00:04:22.770> 10%<00:04:23.190> or<00:04:23.580> so

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
it's like 450 plus or minus 10% or so

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.760 
it's like 450 plus or minus 10% or so
the<00:04:24.450> warmer<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:24.930> is<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.229> higher<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.440> ohm

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
the warmer it is the higher the ohm

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.950 
the warmer it is the higher the ohm
readings<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.400> colder

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
readings the colder

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.740 
readings the colder
is<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.350> lower<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:28.069> ohm<00:04:28.220> readings<00:04:28.699> but<00:04:29.000> you

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
is the lower the ohm readings but you

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.790 
is the lower the ohm readings but you
know<00:04:29.840> if<00:04:29.930> you<00:04:30.020> started<00:04:30.289> getting<00:04:30.410> something

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
know if you started getting something

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.719 
know if you started getting something
that's<00:04:31.069> checking<00:04:31.699> for<00:04:32.979> 8500<00:04:33.979> and<00:04:34.190> more<00:04:34.430> when

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
that's checking for 8500 and more when

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.070 
that's checking for 8500 and more when
it's<00:04:34.910> cold<00:04:35.210> out<00:04:35.479> or<00:04:35.800> if<00:04:36.800> it's<00:04:37.039> cold<00:04:37.539> and<00:04:38.539> it's

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
it's cold out or if it's cold and it's

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.070 
it's cold out or if it's cold and it's
checking<00:04:39.349> like<00:04:39.620> below<00:04:39.949> 400<00:04:40.669> ohms<00:04:40.900> then<00:04:41.900> you

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
checking like below 400 ohms then you

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.330 
checking like below 400 ohms then you
know<00:04:42.229> your<00:04:42.530> your<00:04:43.430> coil<00:04:43.789> is<00:04:44.120> is<00:04:44.509> if<00:04:44.990> not<00:04:45.380> gone

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
know your your coil is is if not gone

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.760 
know your your coil is is if not gone
bad<00:04:46.729> it's<00:04:47.000> going<00:04:47.479> bad<00:04:47.720> and<00:04:48.080> could<00:04:48.410> be<00:04:48.530> causing

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
bad it's going bad and could be causing

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.850 
bad it's going bad and could be causing
you're<00:04:49.190> in<00:04:49.310> intermittent<00:04:50.259> conditions<00:04:51.259> so

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
you're in intermittent conditions so

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.580 
you're in intermittent conditions so
when<00:04:52.280> we<00:04:52.430> go<00:04:52.780> kitty-corner<00:04:53.780> here<00:04:54.639> and<00:04:56.530> try<00:04:57.530> to

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
when we go kitty-corner here and try to

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.740 
when we go kitty-corner here and try to
get<00:04:57.860> our<00:04:58.840> are<00:05:00.280> roughly<00:05:01.280> 500<00:05:01.910> ohms<00:05:02.120> we<00:05:02.570> get

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
get our are roughly 500 ohms we get

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.620 
get our are roughly 500 ohms we get
nothing<00:05:03.229> it's<00:05:03.410> open<00:05:03.919> zero<00:05:04.340> so<00:05:04.910> that<00:05:05.150> tells<00:05:05.389> me

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
nothing it's open zero so that tells me

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.300 
nothing it's open zero so that tells me
the<00:05:06.169> connection<00:05:07.090> between<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:09.110> large<00:05:09.949> the

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
large low side and the high side coil

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.670 
large low side and the high side coil
there<00:05:12.979> we've<00:05:13.729> got<00:05:13.759> a<00:05:13.970> broken<00:05:14.810> connection<00:05:15.530> in

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
there we've got a broken connection in

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.439 
there we've got a broken connection in
there<00:05:15.860> somewhere<00:05:16.160> so<00:05:16.639> on<00:05:17.120> this<00:05:17.270> particular

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
there somewhere so on this particular

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.180 
there somewhere so on this particular
stator<00:05:18.110> if<00:05:18.289> it<00:05:18.380> was<00:05:18.500> in<00:05:18.620> your<00:05:18.710> sled<00:05:18.979> you

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
stator if it was in your sled you

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.920 
stator if it was in your sled you
measured<00:05:19.550> it<00:05:19.639> you<00:05:20.030> knew<00:05:20.300> you<00:05:20.599> would<00:05:20.750> know<00:05:20.900> that

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
measured it you knew you would know that

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.170 
measured it you knew you would know that
the<00:05:21.199> high<00:05:21.349> side<00:05:21.650> coil<00:05:22.009> was<00:05:22.400> there's<00:05:22.699> an<00:05:22.789> open

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
the high side coil was there's an open

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.260 
the high side coil was there's an open
condition<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:24.099> our<00:05:25.099> low<00:05:25.280> side<00:05:25.580> is<00:05:25.819> testing

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
condition and our low side is testing

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.710 
condition and our low side is testing
okay<00:05:26.659> on<00:05:26.870> it<00:05:27.020> when<00:05:27.500> I<00:05:27.530> rewind<00:05:28.220> these<00:05:28.520> I<00:05:28.849> rewind

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
okay on it when I rewind these I rewind

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.980 
okay on it when I rewind these I rewind
both<00:05:30.520> ignition<00:05:31.520> coils<00:05:31.909> on<00:05:32.120> this<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:32.479> don't<00:05:32.539> do

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
both ignition coils on this I don't do

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.760 
both ignition coils on this I don't do
just<00:05:33.409> one<00:05:34.060> so<00:05:35.060> this<00:05:35.210> is<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.419> Zr<00:05:36.280> 500<00:05:37.280> and<00:05:37.400> 600

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
just one so this is the Zr 500 and 600

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.990 
just one so this is the Zr 500 and 600
