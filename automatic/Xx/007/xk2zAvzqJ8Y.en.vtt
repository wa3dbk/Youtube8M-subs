00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.290 
for the self I did and then the hair is
the<00:02:27.810> gas<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.560> crosses<00:02:29.100> over<00:02:29.430> goes<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.090> here

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
the gas to the crosses over goes in here

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.320 
the gas to the crosses over goes in here
same<00:02:30.990> with<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.290> one<00:02:31.350> I've<00:02:31.680> got<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.970> then<00:02:33.150> let

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
same with this one I've got and then let

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.480 
same with this one I've got and then let
back<00:02:33.510> here<00:02:33.840> I've<00:02:34.350> got<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.500> return<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.400> it

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
back here I've got a return so it

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.930 
back here I've got a return so it
actually<00:02:35.640> has<00:02:36.709> two<00:02:37.709> inlets<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.340> two<00:02:38.550> returns

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
actually has two inlets and two returns

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.990 
actually has two inlets and two returns
on<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.270> cell<00:02:39.560> just<00:02:40.560> an<00:02:41.100> experiment<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.910> see

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
on the cell just an experiment to see

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.070 
on the cell just an experiment to see
what<00:02:42.090> happens

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
what happens

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.860 
what happens
the<00:02:43.950> both<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.430> amperage<00:02:45.000> hasn't<00:02:45.330> stabilized

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
the both the amperage hasn't stabilized

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.670 
the both the amperage hasn't stabilized
it<00:02:46.080> jumps<00:02:46.290> between<00:02:46.440> 38<00:02:47.190> amps<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.910> 44<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.590> I

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
it jumps between 38 amps and 44 but I

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.890 
it jumps between 38 amps and 44 but I
haven't<00:02:49.860> had<00:02:50.130> any<00:02:50.730> kind<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.060> steam<00:02:51.360> problem

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
haven't had any kind of a steam problem

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.860 
haven't had any kind of a steam problem
goes<00:02:52.410> right<00:02:52.650> here<00:02:52.680> before<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.190> turbo<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.810> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
goes right here before the turbo and the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.340 
goes right here before the turbo and the
inlet<00:02:55.790> it's<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.030> vacuum<00:02:57.239> side<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:57.959> turbos

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
inlet it's the vacuum side of the turbos

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.570 
inlet it's the vacuum side of the turbos
where<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.680> want<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.890> put<00:02:59.070> it<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.400> is

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
where you want to put it and it is

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.390 
where you want to put it and it is
behind<00:03:00.000> what<00:03:00.570> I'm<00:03:00.810> pretty<00:03:01.440> sure<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.370> a

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
behind what I'm pretty sure that is a

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.949 
behind what I'm pretty sure that is a
MAF<00:03:03.830> I'm<00:03:04.830> one<00:03:05.820> percent<00:03:06.239> positive<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.630> is<00:03:06.840> an

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
MAF I'm one percent positive that is an

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.840 
MAF I'm one percent positive that is an
MF<00:03:07.260> even<00:03:07.560> though<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.680> was<00:03:07.860> told<00:03:08.130> erroneously

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
MF even though I was told erroneously

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.380 
MF even though I was told erroneously
that<00:03:09.440> Diesel's<00:03:10.440> don't<00:03:10.650> have<00:03:10.800> an<00:03:10.920> MAF<00:03:11.390> well

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
that Diesel's don't have an MAF well

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.460 
that Diesel's don't have an MAF well
there's<00:03:12.660> one<00:03:12.840> right<00:03:12.989> there<00:03:13.050> I'm<00:03:13.350> looking

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
there's one right there I'm looking

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.140 
there's one right there I'm looking
right<00:03:13.739> at<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.600> so<00:03:15.769> I'm<00:03:16.769> not<00:03:16.860> having<00:03:17.160> this<00:03:17.220> steam

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
right at it so I'm not having this steam

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.720 
right at it so I'm not having this steam
problem<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.780> output<00:03:18.810> looks<00:03:19.350> good<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:20.010> might

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
problem the output looks good I might

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.990 
problem the output looks good I might
turn<00:03:20.910> this<00:03:21.090> thing<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:21.450> I'll<00:03:22.200> show<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:23.000> inside

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
turn this thing on I'll show you inside

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.090 
turn this thing on I'll show you inside
the<00:03:24.209> bubbler<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:25.110> let<00:03:25.260> me<00:03:25.320> stop<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.709> video<00:03:25.980> and

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
the bubbler so let me stop the video and

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.910 
the bubbler so let me stop the video and
I<00:03:26.130> restarted<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.670> minute
