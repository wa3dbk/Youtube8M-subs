00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 good friends how are you like 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.089
 man in the video a while ago the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.639
 salami 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.400
 william active the binaries the samsung 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.990
 galaxy corp so I set it to do the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.030
 homework and we 'll show you how 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.509
 reset binaries with the try on the web 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.509
 to the video 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.090
 good in this video I'm going to show you 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.900
 then how to reset the mining of your 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.260
 samsung galaxy core in this case is the 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.120
 82 60 l that the ration for Latin America 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.850
 and what we will do what unlike 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.980
 what we usually do is restart 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.079
 give a way in a manual way like 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.870
 we do this we press home key 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.850
 and volume down key 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.680
 lit at the same time what I 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.720
 I always recommend doing is pressing 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.260
 first volume down and home and 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.480
 after giving him the key on 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.120
 We wait until the phone vibrates 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.469
 once it finishes vibrating let's go 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.330
 that and we keep volume tight and home 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.899
 now we give volume upwards to 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.470
 continue and notice that in the state of 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:13.600
 device to see cast the state 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.440
 of the system is caston and the counter 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.250
 binary says a binary because 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.560
 basically because we install 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.290
 gaston recovery enlists in a partition 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.150
 through the odin it is activated from the control 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.220
 of binaries then let's restart 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.560
 devices I will show you how 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.270
 resist the binary county for 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.719
 can return it to zero 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.990
 good what we are going to do then with 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.310
 the cell already restarted 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.200
 keep in mind that this also does not 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.820
 just activate the binaries to install 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.469
 a partition but it also produces 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.649
 the yellow triangle at the start one 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:52.240
 true samsung and the yellow triangle 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.549
 the receptive 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.860
 what we are going to do also removes the 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.829
 yellow triangle but keep in mind 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.770
 that this is dangerous what we are going to 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:06.159
 use then is an application called 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.399
 bring wayne that is chain fire that 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.170
 is the same as the super show and that the time 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.239
 by downloading the link that I told you in 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.430
 the description of this video so 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.709
 we already did notice will 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.780
 install bring the water and have to 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.610
 have unknown origins activated if 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.120
 no they will not be able to do it we install 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.120
 this 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.620
 we give it done and we will look 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.330
 then the application extraction of 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.480
 applications bear in mind that it brings 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.120
 in the huayno it works with all 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.940
 devices and let us know when 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.700
 we enter the interface of the application 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.830
 the first advance to be fixed is that 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.530
 we have access to it and secondly what 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.060
 that is going to be fixed is that let's say that 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.790
 the device model that we have 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.350
 be supported in this and have in 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.330
 account that this to replace the 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.489
 bootloader so that if you 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.840
 we do wrong our phone is not 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.530
 supported and we run this probably 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.300
 let's have a hard bridge if it is to say that 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.239
 we can not use our 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.720
 phone without changing the plate then 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:16.440
 look at the expensive shirt in status sing 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.530
 one minar and castón and he gives me the model and 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.420
 in the option that is under me 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.900
 says ricet flash candás 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.800
 once we have this we give him louis 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.239
 &amp; tell me that this is an operation 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.030
 dangerous and that this could from some 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.130
 way to permanently damage the 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.430
 device if I'm willing to continue 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:43.090
 we give him continue and then we give him 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.730
 yes and we hope that the 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:51.180
 phone the phone will restart on 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.180
 a permanent notice bootloader 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.420
 notice that it tells us that if this does not 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.630
 resist after we run 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.270
 this process we paste the information 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.160
 in the ideas forum and this also 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.020
 You can see that we have a spending canal 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.030
 a record expense and that also has to be 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.120
 keep in mind because the counters of 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.190
 binaries are fixed that we have an expense 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.560
 a channel or that we have an expense in 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.000
 recovery continues like this is the control of 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.650
 binary is always reactivated 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.330
 but this is simply a 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.160
 demonstration and to take into account 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.580
 how to do it if they need only the 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.580
 warranty 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.219
 supposedly this should already have 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.169
 I worked Let's see if that was 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:37.110
 at another time reinstalled a bot 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.580
 loader the truth is that now you see that 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.830
 the new versions are many times 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.409
 while not fight because neither nor no2 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.580
 all three were super doctors for this 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:50.520
 program if the galaxy not one notice 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.830
 karan status zero binner and official is 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.310
 say that we felt the triangle 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.629
 yellow and binary counter for 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.250
 demonstrate and prove better what 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.330
 let's do is restart our 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.939
 device 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.280
 let's go it's one thing let's turn it off 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:08.289
 we are going to restart it in download for 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.199
 check effectively that this is how 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.639
 it's not something from the application and then what 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.189
 what are we going to do to restart and why? 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.610
 we have no more the yellow triangle in 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.610
 the device 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.600
 then again to restart the 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.889
 give mood volume down key 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.020
 home and on until it vibrates if a 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.760
 Once you make the vibration see it we can 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.490
 release the button 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:39.110
 we start by lumen towards 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:41.540
 up and see if you notice 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.650
 we have to combine and we do not have to 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.330
 ashton system is all official and not 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.400
 we have in the activated binary wants 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.470
 say bring the water and it works 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.810
 perfectly and we have our 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.130
 device like fresh out of 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.840
 factory although we have a gaston 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.630
 recovery 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.370
 that we have to prove now that 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.380
 indeed the yellow triangle has 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.180
 already disappeared when we reset the 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.850
 phone let's do it and with this 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.710
 we are going to conclude the video of 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.440
 a successful way if you want 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.410
 call it somehow 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.410
 we keep pressing the button then 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.720
 ignition a little while until the 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.800
 phone 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.800
 restart 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.800
 there we are, we jump them and I do not know 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:38.509
 restart release let's notice that now 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.400
 I should restart and once I restart 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:43.189
 the yellow triangle should appear 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.050
 we are not in yellow triangle wants 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:48.430
 saying that it works correctly enters 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.900
