Hi!

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.230
I’m Jennifer, and I’m part of the Belkin
WeMo Team.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.750
I’m going to take a few minutes to show
you how to set up your Wemo.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.600
To get set up you’ll need your WeMo Baby
and an iOS device.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.470
I’m going to use to my IPhone, but you could
also use an iPad or IPod, the setup is exactly

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.930
the same for all three.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.390
You’ll also need a Wi-Fi Router.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.660
Now I’m a little biased, so I’d recommend
a Belkin router but any major brand will do.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.250
Make sure you have the name of your network
and if it has a password you’ll need that

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.250
too.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.300
As we go through this setup, you’ll occasionally
see a screen like this with a list of items

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.620
or steps.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.030
These screens are a good place to pause the
video, so you can gather items or do the steps

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.980
yourself before I move on to the next ones.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.079
So, you may want to pause now and gather everything
I just mentioned if you haven’t already.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.820
Alright, the first step is to plug the power
cord into your WeMo Baby, you’ll hear a

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.659
snap when it’s all the way in.

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.450
Then plug it into an AC Outlet.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.850
Now you’ll need to wait up to a minute or
two while the WeMo Baby gets ready.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.000
The light will flash blue and amber when it’s
good to go.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.550
Next you’ll need to go to the App Store,
search for WeMo Baby and download the App.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.060
Once you have the App, tap the Settings icon,
then tap Wi-Fi.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.530
Then select the WeMo Baby Network.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.060
It pretty obvious which one it is, but it’s
also listed on the bottom of the WeMo Baby.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.180
Once the check mark comes up, hit the Home
button and open the WeMo Baby App.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.160
The WeMo Baby will take about 30 seconds and
look for the available WiFi networks.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.640
A list will come up and you can select your
network.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.410
If your network has a password you’ll need
to enter it now and then click Join.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.850
Now the WeMo Baby will take about another
30 seconds and then let you know when it’s

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.690
connected to your network.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.690
There we go.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.870
By the way, if you want to connect to a hidden
network scroll to the bottom of the network

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.200
list and choose other.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.750
Then you will need to enter the network name
and password.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.540
That’s it, you’re all setup.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.629
Go ahead and tap Start Listening and you’re
good to go!

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.069
To see all the cool features in the App take
a look at our Using WeMo Baby video.

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.329

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:27.560
Support site.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560
Good luck!

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.329
And enjoy your little one!
