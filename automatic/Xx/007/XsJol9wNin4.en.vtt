00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
when we pick these hops we literally

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.289 
when we pick these hops we literally
walk<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.140> about<00:01:43.680> every<00:01:43.950> half<00:01:44.159> hour<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.729> start

immediately then what we have to do is
we<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.350> grind<00:01:53.070> them<00:01:53.310> then<00:01:53.880> at<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.149> point

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
we have to grind them then at that point

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.600 
we have to grind them then at that point
in<00:01:54.509> time<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.899> take<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:56.040> ground

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
in time we take the ground

in time we take the ground
pop<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.329> pour<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.659> through<00:01:57.930> into<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> hopper

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.340 
kicks off the pellets there are a few

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.050 
styles of beer that use whole hops but
for<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.650> most<00:02:21.830> part<00:02:21.980> breweries<00:02:22.580> use<00:02:22.760> hops

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
for the most part breweries use hops

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.050

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
now how pop pellets are easier to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.520 
now how pop pellets are easier to
measure<00:02:28.010> have<00:02:28.970> much<00:02:29.240> longer<00:02:29.690> shelf<00:02:29.990> life<00:02:30.140> and

when it comes to starting a hop farm now
as<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.630> can<00:03:05.720> see<00:03:05.780> all<00:03:06.110> of<00:03:06.140> these<00:03:06.470> here<00:03:06.800> have

as you can see all of these here have

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.900 
as you can see all of these here have
been<00:03:07.040> harvested<00:03:07.610> already<00:03:07.970> this<00:03:08.180> year

and this is what's left of the nugget we
started<00:03:14.090> planning<00:03:14.860> these<00:03:15.860> four<00:03:16.130> rows<00:03:16.400> right

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
started planning these four rows right

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.210 
started planning these four rows right
here<00:03:16.760> last<00:03:17.450> year<00:03:17.680> they<00:03:18.680> went<00:03:18.800> in<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:18.980> ground

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
different ways one is the scientific way

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.670 
different ways one is the scientific way
of<00:03:50.360> measuring<00:03:51.290> your<00:03:51.500> moisture<00:03:52.070> or<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:53.090> can<00:03:53.680> if

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
of measuring your moisture or you can if

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.680 
of measuring your moisture or you can if
you<00:03:54.830> roll<00:03:55.040> them<00:03:55.190> against<00:03:55.850> your<00:03:55.940> ear<00:03:56.210> you<00:03:56.510> can

you roll them against your ear you can

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.870 
you roll them against your ear you can
