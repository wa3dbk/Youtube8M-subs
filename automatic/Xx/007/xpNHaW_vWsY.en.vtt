00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.030 
get through if Joe and I both make it
through<00:04:21.970> one<00:04:22.090> more<00:04:22.120> heat<00:04:22.420> then<00:04:23.140> you<00:04:23.800> know<00:04:23.890> I'm

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
through one more heat then you know I'm

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.090 
through one more heat then you know I'm
slightly<00:04:24.310> ahead<00:04:24.520> of<00:04:24.640> him<00:04:24.850> and<00:04:25.710> then<00:04:26.710> you<00:04:27.010> know

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
slightly ahead of him and then you know

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.070 
slightly ahead of him and then you know
he<00:04:27.280> has<00:04:27.520> then<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.940> pressure<00:04:28.510> kind<00:04:28.780> of<00:04:28.840> goes<00:04:28.960> on

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
he has then the pressure kind of goes on

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
he has then the pressure kind of goes on
to<00:04:29.170> him<00:04:29.290> because<00:04:29.470> he<00:04:29.530> has<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.680> win<00:04:29.860> that<00:04:29.950> heat

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
to him because he has to win that heat

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.070 
to him because he has to win that heat
first<00:04:30.340> but<00:04:30.580> once<00:04:30.910> he<00:04:31.090> does<00:04:31.210> every<00:04:31.630> bit<00:04:32.050> of

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
first but once he does every bit of

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.300 
first but once he does every bit of
pressures<00:04:32.410> back<00:04:32.530> on<00:04:32.710> me<00:04:32.830> its<00:04:32.980> kind<00:04:33.130> you<00:04:33.220> know

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
pressures back on me its kind you know

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.550 
pressures back on me its kind you know
it's<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.460> cool<00:04:33.670> little<00:04:33.870> scenario<00:04:34.870> we<00:04:35.140> got<00:04:35.320> going

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460
