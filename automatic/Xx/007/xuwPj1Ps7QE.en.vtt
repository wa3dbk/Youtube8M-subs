00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
many total of grand of protein that you

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.750 
many total of grand of protein that you
need<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.450> subtract<00:02:37.020> from<00:02:37.530> other<00:02:38.520> sources

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
need and subtract from other sources

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.680
