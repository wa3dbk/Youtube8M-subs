you<00:01:51.420> don't<00:01:51.540> have<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.930> calibrate<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.920> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
you don't have to calibrate so you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.130 
you don't have to calibrate so you
really<00:01:53.310> save<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:54.119> hour<00:01:54.299> or<00:01:54.600> two<00:01:54.780> hours

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
really save a one hour or two hours

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.940 
really save a one hour or two hours
where<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.619> do<00:01:55.740> all<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
where you have to do all the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.830 
where you have to do all the
measurements<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.549> calibration<00:01:57.180> because

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
measurements and calibration because

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.719 
measurements and calibration because
there's<00:01:58.290> no<00:01:58.439> calibration<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.219> also<00:01:59.399> means

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
there's no calibration it also means

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.270 
there's no calibration it also means
that<00:01:59.850> there's<00:02:00.090> no<00:02:00.210> sweet<00:02:00.509> spot<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.860> doesn't

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
that there's no sweet spot so it doesn't

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.649 
that there's no sweet spot so it doesn't
matter<00:02:02.430> where<00:02:02.700> you're<00:02:02.880> positioned<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
matter where you're positioned in the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.670 
matter where you're positioned in the
room<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.930> don't<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.469> big

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
room you don't have to have a big

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.350 
room you don't have to have a big
armchair<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.520> middle<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.000> room<00:02:06.180> to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
armchair in the middle of the room to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.479 
armchair in the middle of the room to
get<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.719> perfect<00:02:07.320> sound<00:02:07.469> image<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.369> be

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
get the perfect sound image you can be

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.449 
get the perfect sound image you can be
anywhere<00:02:08.910> now<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.289> me<00:02:10.319> has<00:02:10.770> got<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.430> a

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
anywhere now that to me has got to be a

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.520 
anywhere now that to me has got to be a
major<00:02:11.760> attraction<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.690> think<00:02:12.930> for<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> lot<00:02:13.349> of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
major attraction I think for a lot of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.820 
major attraction I think for a lot of
people

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
people

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.500 
people
yeah<00:02:14.040> because<00:02:14.490> especially<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:15.090> have<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.270> you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
yeah because especially you have a you

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.630 
yeah because especially you have a you
have<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.840> audiophiles<00:02:16.770> certainly<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> lot

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
have the audiophiles certainly a lot

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.580 
have the audiophiles certainly a lot
major<00:02:17.940> portion<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.480> our<00:02:18.570> audiences<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.380> that

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
major portion of our audiences like that

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.410 
major portion of our audiences like that
no<00:02:19.800> doubt<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.250> they're<00:02:20.820> very<00:02:20.970> good<00:02:21.240> at<00:02:21.390> what

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
no doubt and they're very good at what

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.090 
no doubt and they're very good at what
they<00:02:21.600> do<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.990> they<00:02:22.080> really<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:22.680> tell<00:02:22.830> about

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
they do and they really can tell about

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.500 
they do and they really can tell about
all<00:02:23.220> kinds<00:02:23.490> of<00:02:23.580> sound<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.940> then<00:02:24.210> you<00:02:24.300> have<00:02:24.420> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
all kinds of sound and then you have the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.720 
all kinds of sound and then you have the
rest<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.990> us<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.680> want<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.010> hear<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.550> want

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
rest of us that want to hear it and want

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.700 
rest of us that want to hear it and want
to<00:02:26.790> hear<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.030> well<00:02:27.240> but<00:02:27.960> we're<00:02:28.380> not<00:02:28.530> about

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
to hear it well but we're not about

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.890 
to hear it well but we're not about
sweet<00:02:29.100> spots<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.700> know<00:02:29.790> maybe<00:02:30.030> there's<00:02:30.360> four

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
sweet spots you know maybe there's four

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.930 
sweet spots you know maybe there's four
or<00:02:31.020> five<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.350> us<00:02:31.440> wanting<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.950> listen<00:02:32.550> to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
or five of us wanting to listen to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.810 
or five of us wanting to listen to
something<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.920> one<00:02:34.920> person<00:02:35.340> shouldn't<00:02:35.580> get

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
something and one person shouldn't get

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.510 
something and one person shouldn't get
no<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.390> best<00:02:36.570> sound<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.560> our<00:02:37.770> technology<00:02:38.400> is

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
no the best sound and our technology is

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.430 
no the best sound and our technology is
based<00:02:38.760> on<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> principle<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.870> wave<00:02:40.110> field

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
based on a principle of wave field

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.650 
based on a principle of wave field
synthesis<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.760> really<00:02:42.000> doesn't<00:02:42.270> rely<00:02:42.630> on

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
synthesis so it really doesn't rely on

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.690 
synthesis so it really doesn't rely on
the<00:02:42.870> dimensions<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.740> room<00:02:43.920> either<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.640> you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
the dimensions of the room either so you

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.250 
the dimensions of the room either so you
can<00:02:44.910> place<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.270> device<00:02:45.420> anywhere<00:02:45.960> in<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
can place the device anywhere in the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.960 
can place the device anywhere in the
room<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.650> as<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.890> said<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.310> listener<00:02:47.610> can<00:02:47.640> be

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
room and as I said the listener can be

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.580 
room and as I said the listener can be
anywhere<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.600> listening<00:02:48.900> room<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
anywhere in the listening room and the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.440 
anywhere in the listening room and the
whole<00:02:49.770> room<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.310> filled<00:02:50.640> with<00:02:50.790> sound<00:02:51.180> waves

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
whole room is filled with sound waves

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.170 
whole room is filled with sound waves
and<00:02:51.830> today<00:02:52.830> as<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.250> said<00:02:53.430> we're<00:02:53.580> launching<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
and today as I said we're launching the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.490 
and today as I said we're launching the
Linko<00:02:54.720> sound<00:02:55.020> bar

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
Linko sound bar

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.220 
Linko sound bar
unlike<00:02:56.490> other<00:02:56.700> sound<00:02:57.330> bars<00:02:57.540> available<00:02:57.690> on<00:02:58.140> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
unlike other sound bars available on the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.980 
unlike other sound bars available on the
market<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.830> doesn't<00:02:59.190> rely<00:02:59.430> on<00:02:59.459> beaming<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.660> it

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
market it doesn't rely on beaming so it

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.480 
market it doesn't rely on beaming so it
doesn't<00:03:01.320> matter<00:03:01.440> what<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.920> shape<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.310> the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
doesn't matter what the shape of the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.920 
doesn't matter what the shape of the
room<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.850> or<00:03:03.090> where<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.420> product<00:03:03.780> is

room is or where the product is
positioned<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:06.330> really<00:03:06.840> just<00:03:07.020> creates<00:03:07.200> a

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
positioned it really just creates a

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.960 
positioned it really just creates a
field<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:08.010> sound<00:03:08.190> waves<00:03:08.459> throughout<00:03:08.790> the

field of sound waves throughout the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.660 
field of sound waves throughout the
whole<00:03:09.120> entire<00:03:09.720> room<00:03:09.860> very<00:03:10.860> cool<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.430> mean<00:03:11.550> I'm

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
whole entire room very cool I mean I'm

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.610 
whole entire room very cool I mean I'm
liking<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.180> whole<00:03:12.330> concept<00:03:12.870> because<00:03:13.170> now<00:03:13.590> I

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
liking the whole concept because now I

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.820 
liking the whole concept because now I
understand<00:03:14.220> it<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:14.580> step<00:03:15.180> up<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.830> and

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
understand it is that step up it is and

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.130 
understand it is that step up it is and
the<00:03:17.520> other<00:03:17.670> point<00:03:18.000> is<00:03:18.150> unlike<00:03:18.870> all<00:03:19.080> other

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
the other point is unlike all other

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.229 
the other point is unlike all other
audio<00:03:19.920> technologies<00:03:20.580> available<00:03:20.790> on<00:03:21.150> the

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
the device anymore you hear all around

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.000 
the device anymore you hear all around
you<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.019> wouldn't<00:03:43.260> even<00:03:43.380> notice<00:03:43.620> where<00:03:43.980> the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
you you wouldn't even notice where the

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.410 
you you wouldn't even notice where the
device<00:03:44.310> is<00:03:44.340> positioned<00:03:44.970> if<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.209> weren't

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
device is positioned if you weren't

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.410 
device is positioned if you weren't
looking<00:03:46.170> where<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:47.190> in<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.940> long<00:03:48.120> run<00:03:48.330> I

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
looking where it is so in the long run I

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.630 
looking where it is so in the long run I
guess<00:03:48.600> that's<00:03:48.870> important<00:03:49.410> because

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
guess that's important because

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.920 
guess that's important because

factor in many cases you don't want to

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.530
