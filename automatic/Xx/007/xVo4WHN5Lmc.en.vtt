Motorsport 4 I just finished a race it's

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.420 
Motorsport 4 I just finished a race it's
not<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.510> best<00:00:18.660> lap<00:00:19.320> time<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.590> think<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.130> got

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
not the best lap time I think I got

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.700 
not the best lap time I think I got
around<00:00:20.869> minute<00:00:22.670> 46<00:00:23.779> which<00:00:24.779> with<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:25.680> a

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
around minute 46 which with it with a

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.640 
around minute 46 which with it with a
new<00:00:25.920> car<00:00:26.250> last<00:00:27.180> time<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.570> checked<00:00:27.599> I'm<00:00:28.320> not

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
new car last time I checked I'm not

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.099 
new car last time I checked I'm not
completely<00:00:29.189> up<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.820> date<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.150> top<00:00:30.539> here<00:00:30.869> but

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
completely up to date on top here but

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.959 
completely up to date on top here but
the<00:00:31.230> last<00:00:31.439> episode<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.859> walked<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.669> tom

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the last episode I walked in with tom

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.540 
the last episode I walked in with tom
cruise<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.660> cameron<00:00:35.660> diaz<00:00:37.010> Tom<00:00:38.010> Cruise<00:00:38.340> had

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
cruise and cameron diaz Tom Cruise had

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.930 
cruise and cameron diaz Tom Cruise had
just<00:00:38.730> got<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.879> top<00:00:39.120> spot<00:00:39.390> with<00:00:39.800> 144<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.550> I

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
just got the top spot with 144 to I

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.229 
just got the top spot with 144 to I
think<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:43.370> it's<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:44.520> exactly<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> best<00:00:45.030> time

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
think so it's not exactly the best time

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.750 
think so it's not exactly the best time
but<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:46.530> decent<00:00:46.920> enough<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> first

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
but it's decent enough for the first

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.139 
but it's decent enough for the first
couple<00:00:48.570> rounds<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.379> not<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.190> mention<00:00:50.340> those

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
couple rounds and not to mention those

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.090 
couple rounds and not to mention those
guys<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.140> state<00:00:52.440> teaching<00:00:52.890> them<00:00:53.010> what

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
guys have the state teaching them what

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.410 
guys have the state teaching them what
to<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.410> think<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:56.579> roi<00:00:56.879> considering<00:00:57.390> i

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
to do so I think I'm roi considering i

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.020 
to do so I think I'm roi considering i

also got the same camera angles as in
the<00:01:13.710> show<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:15.030> from<00:01:15.750> what<00:01:15.780> I've<00:01:16.020> seen

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
the show so from what I've seen

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.560 
the show so from what I've seen
gran<00:01:17.799> turismo<00:01:17.979> five<00:01:18.430> doesn't<00:01:19.180> have<00:01:19.360> those

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
gran turismo five doesn't have those

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.219 
gran turismo five doesn't have those
camera<00:01:19.990> angles<00:01:20.380> but<00:01:21.479> turn<00:01:22.479> ten<00:01:22.750> was<00:01:22.930> smart

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
camera angles but turn ten was smart

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.370 
camera angles but turn ten was smart
enough<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:23.649> add<00:01:23.950> in<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.189> right<00:01:24.399> camera<00:01:24.610> angles

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
enough to add in the right camera angles

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.230 
enough to add in the right camera angles
unfortunately<00:01:26.380> they<00:01:27.100> can't<00:01:27.369> get<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.640> picture

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
unfortunately they can't get a picture

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.740 
unfortunately they can't get a picture
of<00:01:28.390> my<00:01:28.600> mug<00:01:28.869> in<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.200> car<00:01:29.920> while<00:01:30.369> I'm<00:01:30.549> driving

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750

expect that so everyone should post up
in<00:01:39.579> the<00:01:39.700> comments<00:01:40.149> what<00:01:40.299> their<00:01:40.420> times<00:01:40.689> are
