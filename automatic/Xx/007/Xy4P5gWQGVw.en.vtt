00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
it so I just kind of ran around and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.810 
it so I just kind of ran around and
caused<00:00:47.360> trouble<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:48.190> used<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:49.280> tease<00:00:49.489> all<00:00:49.670> the

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.330 

well<00:01:16.810> when<00:01:17.020> we<00:01:17.140> first<00:01:17.410> started<00:01:17.740> skating<00:01:17.980> my

well when we first started skating my

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.360 
well when we first started skating my
thoughts<00:01:18.640> were<00:01:19.320> pretty<00:01:20.320> awkward<00:01:20.860> I'm<00:01:21.160> not

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
thoughts were pretty awkward I'm not

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.770 
thoughts were pretty awkward I'm not
sure<00:01:21.550> there<00:01:21.760> was<00:01:21.850> anything<00:01:22.390> particularly

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
sure there was anything particularly

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.890 
sure there was anything particularly
special<00:01:23.050> about<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.800> two<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.040> us<00:01:24.160> at<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.460> time

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
special about the two of us at the time

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.090 
special about the two of us at the time
you<00:01:25.900> know<00:01:26.020> I<00:01:26.050> was<00:01:26.260> just<00:01:26.290> kind<00:01:26.620> of<00:01:26.680> doing<00:01:26.920> it<00:01:27.040> to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
you know I was just kind of doing it to

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.550 
you know I was just kind of doing it to
keep<00:01:27.700> my<00:01:27.850> mom<00:01:28.060> happy<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:28.630> my<00:01:29.290> older<00:01:29.530> brother

keep my mom happy and my older brother
did<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.100> so<00:01:30.280> I<00:01:30.310> kind<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:30.940> was<00:01:31.060> just<00:01:31.240> doing<00:01:31.479> it<00:01:31.540> to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
try and keep up with him I guess we

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.950 
try and keep up with him I guess we
didn't<00:01:33.700> say<00:01:33.790> a<00:01:33.820> word<00:01:33.910> to<00:01:34.150> each<00:01:34.420> other<00:01:34.660> for

didn't say a word to each other for
probably<00:01:35.320> at<00:01:35.470> least<00:01:35.500> two<00:01:35.950> years<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.670> I<00:01:37.240> know

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
probably at least two years and I know

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.030 
probably at least two years and I know
we<00:01:37.600> were<00:01:37.690> dating<00:01:37.900> so<00:01:38.410> there<00:01:38.530> was<00:01:38.619> some<00:01:38.800> sort<00:01:39.010> of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
we were dating so there was some sort of

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.710 
we were dating so there was some sort of
relationship<00:01:39.460> there<00:01:39.760> which<00:01:40.030> maybe<00:01:40.300> made<00:01:40.540> it<00:01:40.660> a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
relationship there which maybe made it a

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.260 
relationship there which maybe made it a
little<00:01:40.900> bit<00:01:41.080> more<00:01:41.260> awkward<00:01:41.500> I<00:01:42.070> was<00:01:42.580> a<00:01:42.729> huge<00:01:43.060> fan

2005 we wanted to come out as a new team
we<00:02:16.420> didn't<00:02:16.630> want<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.840> look<00:02:16.900> junior<00:02:17.319> we<00:02:17.830> wanted

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.899

and we were quite young I was only 15

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.149 
and we were quite young I was only 15
it's<00:02:24.659> hard<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.930> look<00:02:25.019> mature<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.469> the<00:02:25.560> ice<00:02:25.709> but

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
it's hard to look mature on the ice but

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.860 
it's hard to look mature on the ice but
we<00:02:26.310> came<00:02:26.430> up<00:02:26.579> with<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.730> tango<00:02:27.150> program<00:02:27.540> that

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870

we came up with a tango program that
showed<00:02:28.409> our<00:02:28.590> connection<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:30.150> passionate

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
we feel like that's one of our strengths

we feel like that's one of our strengths
scarlet<00:03:05.150> more<00:03:05.330> technical<00:03:05.840> than<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:06.080> am<00:03:06.260> when

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
scarlet more technical than I am when

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.590 
scarlet more technical than I am when
we're<00:03:06.770> putting<00:03:07.040> together<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.790> program<00:03:08.150> he's

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
we're putting together a program he's

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.970 
we're putting together a program he's
always<00:03:08.750> worried<00:03:09.020> about<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.380> elements<00:03:09.860> and

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
always worried about the elements and

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.560 
always worried about the elements and
the<00:03:10.040> edges<00:03:10.430> what's<00:03:10.850> gonna<00:03:11.060> get<00:03:11.240> us<00:03:11.330> a<00:03:11.420> level

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
the edges what's gonna get us a level

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.080 
the edges what's gonna get us a level
four<00:03:11.900> which<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.230> great<00:03:12.650> on<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.400> flip<00:03:13.610> side<00:03:13.640> I'm

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
four which is great on the flip side I'm

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.730 
four which is great on the flip side I'm
always<00:03:14.270> worried<00:03:14.600> about<00:03:14.630> our<00:03:14.960> movements<00:03:15.560> and

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
always worried about our movements and

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.520 
always worried about our movements and
expression<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.610> positions<00:03:17.270> I<00:03:17.660> think<00:03:18.320> in<00:03:18.410> that

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
expression and positions I think in that

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.870 
expression and positions I think in that
sense<00:03:18.770> we<00:03:18.920> balance<00:03:19.250> each<00:03:19.340> other<00:03:19.490> out<00:03:19.610> really

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
sense we balance each other out really

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.950 
sense we balance each other out really
well<00:03:21.850> we'd<00:03:22.850> like<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.120> think<00:03:23.360> that<00:03:23.540> it's<00:03:23.690> our

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
well we'd like to think that it's our

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.900 
well we'd like to think that it's our
connection<00:03:24.290> that<00:03:25.010> sets<00:03:25.250> us<00:03:25.400> apart<00:03:25.520> for

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
connection that sets us apart for

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.530 
connection that sets us apart for
everybody<00:03:26.180> else<00:03:27.520> along<00:03:28.520> with<00:03:28.760> that<00:03:28.910> is<00:03:29.240> our

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
everybody else along with that is our

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.990 
everybody else along with that is our
intricate<00:03:29.960> lifts<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:30.680> our<00:03:30.920> power<00:03:31.490> that<00:03:31.880> we

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
intricate lifts and our power that we

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.760 
intricate lifts and our power that we
bring<00:03:32.270> and<00:03:32.570> we<00:03:32.900> like<00:03:33.080> to<00:03:33.170> think<00:03:33.320> that<00:03:33.440> we<00:03:33.620> do

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
bring and we like to think that we do

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.440 
bring and we like to think that we do
have<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.400> complete<00:03:34.760> package<00:03:34.940> and<00:03:35.360> our

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
have the complete package and our

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.040 
have the complete package and our
skating<00:03:35.870> I<00:03:40.120> can't<00:03:41.120> remember<00:03:41.300> really<00:03:41.570> thinking

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
skating I can't remember really thinking

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.140 
skating I can't remember really thinking
about<00:03:42.290> wanting<00:03:43.100> to<00:03:43.310> be<00:03:43.520> an<00:03:43.640> Olympic<00:03:43.970> ice

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150

about wanting to be an Olympic ice
dancer<00:03:44.690> at<00:03:45.230> nine<00:03:45.440> years<00:03:45.770> old<00:03:45.950> I<00:03:46.190> think<00:03:46.490> it<00:03:46.580> was

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
dancer at nine years old I think it was

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.460 
dancer at nine years old I think it was
pretty<00:03:46.970> lucky<00:03:47.390> that<00:03:47.600> everything<00:03:48.110> kind<00:03:48.350> of

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
pretty lucky that everything kind of

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.960 
pretty lucky that everything kind of
fell<00:03:48.590> into<00:03:48.770> place<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.460> you<00:03:49.670> know<00:03:49.790> we've

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
fell into place and you know we've

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.780 
fell into place and you know we've
worked<00:03:50.090> really<00:03:50.300> hard<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.630> get<00:03:50.780> here<00:03:50.990> but<00:03:51.260> I

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
worked really hard to get here but I

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.460 
worked really hard to get here but I
think<00:03:52.790> I'm<00:03:52.970> pretty<00:03:53.270> fortunate<00:03:53.510> when<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.230> think

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
think I'm pretty fortunate when I think

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.110 
think I'm pretty fortunate when I think
back<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:54.860> three<00:03:55.520> year<00:03:55.700> old<00:03:55.850> little<00:03:56.030> girl

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
back to that three year old little girl

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.540 
back to that three year old little girl
in<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:56.480> picture<00:03:57.010> it's<00:03:58.010> hard<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.370> imagine

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
in that picture it's hard to imagine

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.550 
in that picture it's hard to imagine
that<00:03:59.330> I've<00:03:59.450> grown<00:03:59.960> into<00:04:00.200> an<00:04:00.710> Olympian<00:04:02.320> it<00:04:03.320> was

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
that I've grown into an Olympian it was

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.620 
that I've grown into an Olympian it was
always<00:04:03.740> some<00:04:04.070> sort<00:04:04.100> of<00:04:04.370> distant<00:04:04.880> dream<00:04:05.300> that
