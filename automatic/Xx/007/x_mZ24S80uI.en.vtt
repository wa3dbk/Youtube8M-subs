00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.439
 virtual gr 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.240
 the device is the result of a 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.859
 partnership with eyeglass technology 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.050
 the company responsible for the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.150
 rift virtual reality and integrated with 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.890
 galaxy note 4 that works as a viewer 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.840
 connected to the network 7 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.730
 the glasses are placed on the head together 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.649
 with earphone on top has a 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.480
 adjustment to the focus then you just 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.850
 pat on the right side of the glasses 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.410
 so that the video starts rotating and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.960
 From now on, what you see is that 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.149
 the bunch of crazy generating body looking 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.700
 to the open mouth wall trying 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.800
 pick up nonexistent objects from here until 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.260
 lol, he got scared with objects 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.390
 that appeared in front of her is fat Mike 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.670
 love and she said she thought it was amazing 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.980
 appear the elephant objects in front 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.539
 that she tried to get the animal and that 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.060
 it was like she was really 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.159
 in that environment and it fails the text 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.159
 ricard already in portugal a light song 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.110
 our cell phone the people of 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.060
 world I want to see now using these games 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.770
 imagine people using it on the streets 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.380
 in their homes 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.939
 will this create parallel worlds 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.740
 Regina agrees with me but thinks 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.600
 This can be awesome for kids. 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.890
 with use ranging from education to 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.630
 pure entertainment 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.190
 In fact, samsung has been struggling 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.539
 develop interesting partnerships to 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.740
 creating content for the glasses 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.600
 marvel river worx imax live and cirque du 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.170
 soleil if any of the partners shown 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.789
 on here 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.439
 in addition one of the main focuses of the 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.420
 device will also be in the 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.190
 for games according to the company games 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.789
 available for the rift 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.140
 be cut because it's vr 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.390
 in the end the glasses surprised 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.100
 positively so far rift glasses 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.049
 for example they had the same law 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.520
 little marchinha looked to the side 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.380
 the projected image in a little bit 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.310
 then the graphic quality sometimes does not 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.530
 It was so good. 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.700
 but the guide vr outweighs all that have already 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.140
 we have seen so far 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.480
 according to Samsung the accelerometer 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.940
 device and up to five times more 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.299
 than what currently exists 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.040
 smartphones 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.720
 the immersion is phenomenal and the great 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.910
 differential here the amount of 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.440
 Available content already in the presentation 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.730
 The only criticism we make is that 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.950
 manufacturers have not yet been able to 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.290
 develop 3d that really convinces 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.850
 It has depth but it seems 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.769
 little screen in front of the image 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.900
 it is not so sharp anyway 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.390
 used is the galaxy note 4 that has a 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.400
 Almost incredible hd screen but at the time of 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.810
 generate 3d the manufacturers still 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.579
 needs to evolve 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.769
 still no release date or 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.570
 prices announced for the gr but he 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.640
 should be available by the end of the year 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.140
 in some more developed markets 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.060
 if you liked or like it down here and so 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.840
