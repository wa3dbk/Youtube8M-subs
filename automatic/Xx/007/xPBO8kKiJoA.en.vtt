spring off pump it all back over to the
main<00:02:27.049> tank<00:02:27.349> and<00:02:27.590> start<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.890> boil

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
main tank and start the boil

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.130 
main tank and start the boil
so<00:02:28.909> we'll<00:02:29.150> see<00:02:29.329> what<00:02:29.420> happens<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:29.900> don't<00:02:29.959> you

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
so we'll see what happens I don't you

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.360 
so we'll see what happens I don't you
guys<00:02:30.260> got<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.620> see<00:02:30.829> that<00:02:31.299> but<00:02:32.980> what<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.190> can

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
guys got to see that but what I can

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.080 
guys got to see that but what I can
maybe<00:02:34.610> do<00:02:34.849> a<00:02:34.879> little<00:02:35.030> better<00:02:35.269> let's<00:02:36.079> see

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
maybe do a little better let's see

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.589 
maybe do a little better let's see
here's<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.209> wort<00:02:39.220> hold<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.340> level<00:02:40.519> hmm<00:02:41.480> oh

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
here's the wort hold it level hmm oh

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.640 
here's the wort hold it level hmm oh
that<00:02:42.170> was<00:02:42.290> enough<00:02:42.470> hands<00:02:43.690> right<00:02:44.690> there's<00:02:45.379> the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
that was enough hands right there's the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.030 
that was enough hands right there's the
wort

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
wort

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.210 
wort
now<00:02:46.129> I'm<00:02:46.220> gonna<00:02:46.310> put<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.579> drop<00:02:46.849> iodine<00:02:47.359> in<00:02:47.540> there

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
now I'm gonna put a drop iodine in there

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.940 
now I'm gonna put a drop iodine in there
maybe<00:02:49.989> maybe<00:02:51.549> still<00:02:52.549> trying<00:02:53.709> still<00:02:54.709> try<00:02:54.950> it

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
maybe maybe still trying still try it

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.440 
maybe maybe still trying still try it
there<00:02:57.950> we<00:02:58.040> go<00:02:58.220> all<00:02:58.849> right<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.150> see<00:02:59.329> how<00:02:59.389> the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
there we go all right you see how the

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.270 
there we go all right you see how the
iodine<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.200> wish<00:03:00.590> I'd<00:03:00.739> have<00:03:00.859> done<00:03:00.889> a<00:03:01.010> test

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
iodine I wish I'd have done a test

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.160 
iodine I wish I'd have done a test
earlier<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.030> can<00:03:02.209> see<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.540> what<00:03:02.720> it'll<00:03:02.870> do

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
earlier so you can see it what it'll do

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.319 
earlier so you can see it what it'll do
is<00:03:03.609> iodine<00:03:04.609> will<00:03:05.269> turn<00:03:05.950> starch<00:03:06.950> is<00:03:07.159> black<00:03:07.549> okay

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
is iodine will turn starch is black okay

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.180 
is iodine will turn starch is black okay
that<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.930> wort<00:03:09.290> would<00:03:09.470> just<00:03:09.650> turn<00:03:09.859> black

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
that that wort would just turn black

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.490 
that that wort would just turn black
black<00:03:10.519> block<00:03:10.760> being<00:03:11.659> that<00:03:11.780> it's<00:03:11.930> converted<00:03:12.409> to

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
black block being that it's converted to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.860 
black block being that it's converted to
sugar<00:03:12.530> now<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:12.980> iodine<00:03:13.609> doesn't<00:03:14.569> turn<00:03:14.750> it

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
sugar now the iodine doesn't turn it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.020 
sugar now the iodine doesn't turn it
black<00:03:15.049> it's<00:03:15.379> just<00:03:15.620> color<00:03:15.980> iodine<00:03:16.519> so<00:03:16.819> now<00:03:16.970> you

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
black it's just color iodine so now you

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.210 
black it's just color iodine so now you
know<00:03:17.269> your<00:03:17.419> conversion<00:03:17.930> stuff<00:03:18.169> to<00:03:18.739> me<00:03:18.889> that's

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
know your conversion stuff to me that's

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.369 
know your conversion stuff to me that's
the<00:03:19.400> best<00:03:19.699> way<00:03:20.000> I've<00:03:20.329> ever<00:03:20.359> found<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:21.139> see<00:03:21.290> if

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
the best way I've ever found to see if

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.550 
the best way I've ever found to see if
my<00:03:21.500> conversions<00:03:22.129> done<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:23.359> it<00:03:23.989> just<00:03:24.019> makes<00:03:24.410> a

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
my conversions done and it just makes a

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.210 
my conversions done and it just makes a
lot<00:03:24.590> of<00:03:24.739> sense

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
lot of sense

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.729 
lot of sense
all<00:03:25.340> right<00:03:25.459> now<00:03:25.639> I'm<00:03:25.940> done<00:03:26.389> mashing<00:03:27.019> still

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
all right now I'm done mashing still

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.640 
all right now I'm done mashing still
running<00:03:28.129> is<00:03:28.519> what<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.760> do<00:03:28.879> is<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.269> heat<00:03:29.510> up<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.959> heat

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
running is what I do is I heat up I heat

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.500 
running is what I do is I heat up I heat
up<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.829> white<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.340> can't<00:03:31.639> see<00:03:31.819> my<00:03:31.970> thermostat

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
up the white you can't see my thermostat

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.930 
up the white you can't see my thermostat
but<00:03:32.629> I<00:03:32.720> heat<00:03:32.900> it<00:03:32.930> up<00:03:33.079> to<00:03:33.260> 168<00:03:33.859> just<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.519> stop<00:03:34.790> the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
but I heat it up to 168 just to stop the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.020 
but I heat it up to 168 just to stop the
enzymes<00:03:35.389> I'm<00:03:36.169> ready<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.530> mash<00:03:36.739> out<00:03:37.040> now<00:03:37.250> my

different things like I said I rested it

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.400 
different things like I said I rested it
143<00:04:37.880> for<00:04:38.120> 20<00:04:38.390> minutes<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:38.900> then<00:04:38.960> I<00:04:39.140> mashed

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
143 for 20 minutes and then I mashed

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.350 
143 for 20 minutes and then I mashed
what<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.160> little<00:04:40.400> harder<00:04:40.670> of<00:04:40.820> this<00:04:40.940> one<00:04:41.120> with

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
what a little harder of this one with

that's it

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.070 
that's it
based<00:04:46.400> on<00:04:46.550> 80%<00:04:47.120> efficiency<00:04:47.540> because<00:04:47.900> that's

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
based on 80% efficiency because that's

what I get in here my story gravity

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.420 
what I get in here my story gravity
should<00:04:50.210> be<00:04:50.420> like<00:04:50.960> a<00:04:50.990> 1054<00:04:51.860> which<00:04:52.100> is<00:04:52.250> about

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
should be like a 1054 which is about

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.050 
should be like a 1054 which is about
right<00:04:52.670> with<00:04:52.910> 22<00:04:53.300> pounds<00:04:53.630> of<00:04:53.720> grain<00:04:53.930> at<00:04:54.350> 80%<00:04:55.060> and

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
right with 22 pounds of grain at 80% and

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.690 
right with 22 pounds of grain at 80% and
I<00:04:56.630> figured<00:04:57.110> out<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.290> 12<00:04:57.680> gallon<00:04:57.950> batch<00:04:58.340> size

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
I figured out a 12 gallon batch size

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.440 
I figured out a 12 gallon batch size
because<00:04:59.690> of<00:04:59.810> all<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.310> I<00:05:01.310> lose<00:05:01.700> I<00:05:01.880> can<00:05:02.030> count<00:05:02.300> on

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
because of all the I lose I can count on

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.780 
because of all the I lose I can count on
a<00:05:02.600> half<00:05:02.840> through<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.590> Terminator<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.490> all<00:05:04.610> my

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
a half through the Terminator and all my

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.510 
a half through the Terminator and all my
to<00:05:04.850> bean<00:05:05.300> and<00:05:05.600> whatnot<00:05:06.470> so<00:05:06.710> it<00:05:07.130> seems<00:05:07.370> to<00:05:07.430> work

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
to bean and whatnot so it seems to work

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.380 
to bean and whatnot so it seems to work
out<00:05:07.730> pretty<00:05:07.790> good

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
out pretty good
