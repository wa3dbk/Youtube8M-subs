 window of the soul through which we contemplate 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.860
 the hectic life of the world and it makes us 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.800
 to be more interested in the people who 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.260

 Then came that night of nights 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.830
 in which the pastors were in the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.680
 fields and the angel of the Lord appeared 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.930
 before them announcing the birth of the 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.050
 Savior, you, just like me 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.660
 will recall the words of Isaiah I 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.479
 here that a virgin will conceive and give 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.210
 light a son and he will call his name emmanuel 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.210

 the times change the years go by

 quickly but Christmas continues to be 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.610
 sacred the opportunities to give of 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.620
 ourselves are unlimited there 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.170
 hearts that brighten words 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.800

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.710
 Christmas 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.460
 we must look for the carpenter's hand 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.890
 with every step we take in their tracks 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.290
 we left a doubt and won a 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.769
