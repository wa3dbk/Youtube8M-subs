00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.920
 our sena code point web page 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.779
 net in this video we're going to do the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.750
 analysis of a universal application 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.640
 for this is that it is called tune box this 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.009
 is the incognito is a magical application 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.390
 to me at least I love they are very 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.399
 Attentive because we are going to give away promo with 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.170
 is both at the end of this video as 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.940
 also on the website of this with 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.600
 dot net promoters of this application 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.760
 which is priced at 5 dollars a 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.079
 449 euros approximately and good 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.489
 first let's do the analysis and 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.320
 then we will raffle and enter the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.539
 application and notice that we have then 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.739
 here different tabs not first if 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.570
 explain a little what it does is 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.999
 magical, you really have a 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.850
 dropbox account you put music in 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.710
 your dropbox and all the music or everything 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.620
 all audios whether music be it 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.390
 podcast whatever all the files of 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.800
 audio that you have in dropbox is going to 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.720
 find this application I 'm going to 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.480
 show as if from an application of 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.070
 music it's about is I think that a 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.570
 very clear alternative to the application 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.860
 native music what happens that the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.750
 native music application 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.960
 to put music we have to use 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.360
 iTunes we connect the iPhone iTunes and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.950
 we passed the music there are no people 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.960
 because that does not please him then nothing 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.570
 simply with this tunisian box option 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.670
 we will be able to put music in dropbox and 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.570
 magically our iphone will appear 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.370
 ipad or ipod or whatever the truth is not 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.540
 that really work really well and I 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.800
 I think it's an alternative for this 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.050
 to pass the favorite music that 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.580
 let's have in our computer 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.280
 wirelessly through the cloud 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.630
 because with our team we are going to see 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.610
 first that the artists tab 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.190
 obviously we are going to see the artists of 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.200
 the music that we have put here 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.610
 in albums we are going to see the names of 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.310
 all those albums that we 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.440
 we have no music in our top box 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.509
 fix and that looks like a none because this 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.920
 It is an audio file that is the wedge 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.130
 that we have in the podcast of 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.700
 according to the wedge that we are going to face 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.700
 to red 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.400
 Podcast arranged with the world to Paul 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.170
 presented and directed by sergio is that 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.670
 this is the cradle that made us so and 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.860
 marquez send a big hello 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.900
 from here many thanks with a 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.060
 super professional wedge more options 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.800
 we have here the song tab of 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.239
 we are from here we will see ordered 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.890
 in alphabetical order all 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.690
 absolutely all the songs of 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.920
 I agree that we have an option 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.319
 very cool that is when we give the know 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.390
 playing we are going to play again 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.830
 where we had not left the song that 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.959
 is this one that is sounding at this moment 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.030
 we are giving the play we can pause arlit 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.830
 in this case we are going to lower the 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.630
 volume and fixed what we have here 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.550
 different options not for example let's 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.040
 to get in here to notice that here we see 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.260
 the music of this security disc 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.840
 social we have two options we press 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.550
 to reproduce it, notice that now 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.060
 would be reproducing or we have another 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.100
 option 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.380
 from here we simply click on the 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.000
 icon of the cloud and the audio is going to 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.500
 download fixes that has already been 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.239
 downloaded the super fast song 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.560
 because it weighs very little, not because 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.900
 truth is that we can download it 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.730
 also to listen to it offline if 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.830
 let's go to the adjustments 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.799
 note that we can tell him to work 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.019
 in online mode in offline mode we can 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.900
 tell him to download the audio only 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.489
 from from wifi wifi sorry 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.110
 and well here you have all these options 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.299
 we can not unlock those of our 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.790
 dropbox account and such an application 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.829
 super interesting if you do not like itunes 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.439
 and you want to live with dropbox and put the 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.180
 music in dropbox and use is generated 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:41.129

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.709
 application a promo code of this great 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.049
 Tune box application is not universal for 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.609
 ios then nothing simply the first 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.930
 answer in the comments to the 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.739
 next question takes the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.579

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.379

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.690
