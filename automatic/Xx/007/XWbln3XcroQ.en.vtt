00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
or weight to the iPad I think it's a

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.149 
or weight to the iPad I think it's a
really<00:02:53.480> nice<00:02:53.780> fit<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.319> fact<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.739> works<00:02:54.950> with

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
really nice fit the fact it works with

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.879 
really nice fit the fact it works with
the<00:02:55.310> smart<00:02:55.639> cover<00:02:55.909> as<00:02:56.090> well<00:02:56.239> is<00:02:56.810> brilliant<00:02:57.319> now

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
the smart cover as well is brilliant now

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.479 
the smart cover as well is brilliant now
I<00:02:58.129> didn't<00:02:58.700> like<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.420> new<00:03:00.349> smart<00:03:00.889> case<00:03:01.190> I

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
I didn't like the new smart case I

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.069 
I didn't like the new smart case I
forget<00:03:01.609> what<00:03:01.879> it<00:03:02.000> was<00:03:02.030> called<00:03:02.359> now<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.599> Apple

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
forget what it was called now the Apple

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.059 
forget what it was called now the Apple
released<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.849> didn't<00:03:05.269> fit<00:03:05.480> nicely<00:03:05.739> so<00:03:06.739> i<00:03:06.769> would

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
released it didn't fit nicely so i would

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.339 
released it didn't fit nicely so i would
go<00:03:07.220> with<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.430> smart<00:03:07.879> cover<00:03:08.150> in<00:03:08.450> combination

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
go with a smart cover in combination

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.319 
go with a smart cover in combination
with<00:03:09.379> something<00:03:09.859> like<00:03:10.010> this<00:03:10.040> i<00:03:10.519> think<00:03:11.150> it's<00:03:11.269> a

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
with something like this i think it's a

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.180 
with something like this i think it's a
much<00:03:11.659> better<00:03:11.690> option<00:03:12.049> because<00:03:12.650> this<00:03:12.799> fits

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
much better option because this fits

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.089 
much better option because this fits
really<00:03:13.730> nicely<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:15.079> sort<00:03:15.379> of<00:03:15.410> hugs<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.949> back

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
really nicely it sort of hugs the back

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.970 
really nicely it sort of hugs the back
of<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.340> ipad<00:03:16.760> it's<00:03:17.389> a<00:03:17.480> nice<00:03:17.750> material<00:03:18.260> the

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
of the ipad it's a nice material the

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.220 
of the ipad it's a nice material the
price<00:03:19.310> is<00:03:19.549> good<00:03:19.609> too<00:03:20.030> this<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:20.720> coming<00:03:21.049> in<00:03:21.139> at

so definitely go for this combo with the
Apple<00:03:28.340> Smart<00:03:28.699> Cover<00:03:28.970> rather<00:03:29.780> than<00:03:30.139> the<00:03:30.290> case

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
Apple Smart Cover rather than the case

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.830 
Apple Smart Cover rather than the case
that<00:03:30.769> Apple<00:03:31.010> offer<00:03:31.160> much<00:03:31.790> better<00:03:32.060> combination
