00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.800
 here the text leaves deep distress that 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.360
 you will learn in the following video like this 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.950
 first of all asked here has the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.980
 This is pretty annoying 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.170
 textile factory and we already see 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.660
 hugos too, he was already there 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.519
 small video of the youth labs 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.199
 at the research lab and I guess 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.080
 really everyone 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.580
 everyone who goes also only a few 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.960
 played for hours there is this 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.020
 buildings know us water fell something 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.520
 textile factory and there you can 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.860
 since then updates and me again 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.120
 purely slippery 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.530
 The whole thing went before but already 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.770
 then it was patched and now works 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.239
 thanks again it is called update and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.440
 you just have to go where I am 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.100
 just in the video for the first time two 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.820
 ladders up 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:56.039
 hopefully that evening then 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.670
 Are you not there not there but here 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.469
 Go back and do this last in youth 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.870
 Labor if you have watched now and you 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.260
 take a job 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.950
 now it is downloaded so probably 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.000
 jobs from leicester or that's it 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.710
 ron martin irion and not 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.350
 kind of from newspapers or something 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.110
 from other jobs from other hits 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.700
 also and then you see here are the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.360
 third and here you can see it already 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.479
 a few women are currently living 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.479
 are 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.930
 can see definitely looks today 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.939
 then you just have to stay here as well 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.729
 but can not get in here and the lab 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:50.070
 I'm already working in the office 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:53.430
 but that's the reason why you can 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.020
 not through the door but one puts 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.759
 also how we got in here 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.860
 here on the wall 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.850
 minute again a job on however 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.189
 we have to think here comes after that 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.880
 no more out there to kill you 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:10.539
 takes a job at Abandoned again 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.830
 and yes I am and is also the 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.489
 Last of Leicester and you can 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.280
 Of course surf the internet here too 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:21.099
 So I think I'm funny too 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.269
 Great couch and now I have to prove it 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.970
 you could not get him out again 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.769
 even if you do that again 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.819
 do with the leak switch or as well 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.489
 that always means I know it 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.930
 not allowed so job accepted there 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.040
 go out and you are still in there 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.910
 So you can not get out of here 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.860
 you have to live the life and hubert 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.239
 you too English and me 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.410
 Actually , that was it again 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.640
 everything important with the video 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.420

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.440
 I'll see you until the next video 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.239
 and if you liked the video 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.560
 then we could like a lighter 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.500
 let or maybe subscribe 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.730

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.310

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.000

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.000
 would have shot leto 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.850
 now it's always going to be pure, but hugo 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:15.430
 Do you still want to say yes that nothing 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.609
 actually nothing in this sense 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.609
