00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
it for the first time without having had

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.540 
it for the first time without having had
it<00:00:59.300> before<00:00:59.449> compared<00:01:00.260> to<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.649> other<00:01:00.859> formula

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
it before compared to the other formula

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.090 
it before compared to the other formula
from<00:01:01.699> before<00:01:02.089> and<00:01:02.320> I<00:01:03.320> wanted<00:01:03.739> to<00:01:03.800> do<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:04.010> on

video<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:04.670> despite<00:01:06.010> everything<00:01:07.030> so<00:01:08.030> that<00:01:08.060> you

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
video and despite everything so that you

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.170 
video and despite everything so that you
could<00:01:08.630> sort<00:01:08.870> of<00:01:09.250> share<00:01:10.250> along<00:01:10.670> with<00:01:10.700> me<00:01:11.000> my

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
could sort of share along with me my

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.470 
could sort of share along with me my
first<00:01:11.360> experience<00:01:11.930> with<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.500> new<00:01:12.620> formula<00:01:13.480> um

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
first experience with the new formula um

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.660 
first experience with the new formula um
I'm<00:01:15.410> not<00:01:15.560> going<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.740> put<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:15.920> whole<00:01:16.130> lot<00:01:16.340> in<00:01:16.490> this

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
I'm not going to put a whole lot in this

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.730 
I'm not going to put a whole lot in this
this<00:01:16.940> time<00:01:17.210> use<00:01:18.080> a<00:01:18.110> little<00:01:18.410> bit<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.560> water

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
this time use a little bit of water

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.800 
this time use a little bit of water
because<00:01:19.040> I<00:01:19.190> really<00:01:19.370> don't<00:01:19.520> want<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:19.760> mask<00:01:20.000> the

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
because I really don't want to mask the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.660 
because I really don't want to mask the
taste<00:01:21.160> um<00:01:23.740> certainly<00:01:24.740> is<00:01:24.860> more<00:01:25.070> water<00:01:25.310> than<00:01:25.550> I

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
taste um certainly is more water than I
