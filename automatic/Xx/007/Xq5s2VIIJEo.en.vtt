00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:09.240
 the wines of poems and the fotonovelas the 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.240
 net it rains 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.580
 and that, as they are, I hope they are 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.580
 very well welcome to a mod of 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.800
 jeta 5 we are seeing the skin mod 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.990
 big we are playing like big foot 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.630
 no need to explain to them what 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.240
 is happening is simply big foot 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.390
 bastard in the city throwing balls 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.400
 baseball balls of dog do not know 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.470
 before continuing to see this mode 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.110
 left under the channel link where 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.970
 I found that it's called try tutorial no 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.210
 I know if some remember the mod 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.010
 this I raised it a few months ago 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.019
 where you could fly with your bike in 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.850
 jeta on line below I leave the link if not 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.100
 you've seen it so you can see it and the most 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.830
 funny in this way is that people do not 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.680
 it reacts logically because it is only 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.540
 visible to us that is the machines 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.420
 they do not realize that he is a monster 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.519
 supposedly grabbed a car steals it 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.340
 he walks on the street and everything is good 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.950
 trunks to trustee is the yeti there is no 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.229
 big foot farts that wave is fine 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.870
 tranquilitos all bastard and the stealing 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.940
 cars walking this is the first mode 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.750
 I wanted to show you especially because 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.330
 we have always had 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.480
 the curiosity of what it would be like to fly a 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.730
 UFO or a flying saucer in GT to how 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.410
 it would be seen from our screen I 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.780
 I've always wondered that how 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.840
 would see or what but would be Chinese would be 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.760
 culero then here through mods 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.220
 they did the flying saucer 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.770
 it's like you're flying an airplane 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.619
 but logically puts in the skin of 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.820
 flying saucer and it looks great 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.590
 lately I've seen that many mods have 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.170
 come out and these two have been the most 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.110
 I liked them especially because they are two 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.390
 things like mysterious quotes in the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.160
 big foot and the flying saucer or 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.770
 things that we all always stay 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.050
 with doubts about how it could be or how 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.240
 it looks or what the fuck so I decided 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.340
 share them in this video now 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.410
 it is only necessary that the yeti climbs a 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.990
 flying saucer and handle it would be what 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.940
 last would be the most epic no one has 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.980
 done for those who are going to ask me 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.380
 how can they do this as they can put 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.410
 these things on your consoles in your xbox 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.100
 360 the problem here is that to do 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.019
 this you need modified consoles 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.590
 you need hacked consoles and I think that 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.810
 do what 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.569
 difficult is simply to download some 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.670
 files out there out there of the mods and 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.550
 then pass them to a usb memory and 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.560
 then do half-strange things half 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.690
 crazy too I would not like to upload a 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.550
 video of how to do it because I think that 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.739
 many people can be affected 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.690
 remember that rockstar vane people 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.849
 that does this that modifies their consoles 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.980
 but it's still cool to see what 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.930
 does people like I always say in these 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.760
 videos I recommend you better no more 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.040
 see what there is or whatever but 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.290
 just go see you see what they do 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.299
 and point do not go to do blowjobs for 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.730
 that later they go and see you and in two 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.500
 thousand years I can continue playing gta if 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.630
 You are very funny to comment and want 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.849

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.920

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.140
