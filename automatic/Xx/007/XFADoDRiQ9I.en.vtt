hi this is my backlash predictions for

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.650 
hi this is my backlash predictions for
2008<00:00:04.710> since<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.670> called<00:00:06.210> 27<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:07.140> toy<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:08.660> go

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
2008 since I called 27 to toy and go

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.640 
2008 since I called 27 to toy and go
starts<00:00:10.050> up<00:00:10.139> for<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.380> World<00:00:10.559> Championship

starts up for the World Championship
match<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.580> think<00:00:11.759> as<00:00:12.570> much<00:00:12.630> was<00:00:12.990> like<00:00:13.170> 16<00:00:13.559> when

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
match I think as much was like 16 when

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.340 
match I think as much was like 16 when
edge<00:00:14.099> will<00:00:14.460> win<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:15.540> know<00:00:15.599> another<00:00:15.900> title

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
edge will win you know another title

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.609 
edge will win you know another title
reign<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.680> I'm<00:00:17.300> you<00:00:18.300> know<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:19.170> whole<00:00:19.350> thing

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
reign and I'm you know this whole thing

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.920 
reign and I'm you know this whole thing
that<00:00:19.770> he<00:00:19.980> Guerrero<00:00:20.130> matru<00:00:20.609> Sahel<00:00:21.000> because

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
that he Guerrero matru Sahel because

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.200 
that he Guerrero matru Sahel because
Eddie<00:00:22.260> died<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.699> corner<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.150> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
Eddie died and the corner is a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.210 
Eddie died and the corner is a
relationship<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.800> think<00:00:25.830> it's

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
relationship like that and I think it's

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.550 
relationship like that and I think it's
the<00:00:26.550> way<00:00:26.699> storyline<00:00:27.240> going<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.720> edge<00:00:28.320> doesn't

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
the way storyline going and edge doesn't

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.900 
the way storyline going and edge doesn't
deserve<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> title<00:00:30.170> moving<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.910> title

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
deserve the title moving on to the title

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.540 
deserve the title moving on to the title
match<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.420> think<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.380> Randy<00:00:34.739> Orton<00:00:35.040> routine

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
match I think that Randy Orton routine

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.119 
match I think that Randy Orton routine
because<00:00:36.270> he's<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.480> umbrella<00:00:36.870> champion<00:00:37.350> you

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
because he's the umbrella champion you
