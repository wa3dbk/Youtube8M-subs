this<00:00:17.210> machine<00:00:17.599> came<00:00:17.869> in<00:00:18.140> because<00:00:18.410> any<00:00:19.400> time

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
this machine came in because any time

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.450 
this machine came in because any time
the<00:00:19.820> cord<00:00:20.090> was<00:00:20.270> jiggled<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:21.130> machine<00:00:22.130> would

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
the cord was jiggled the machine would

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.960 
the cord was jiggled the machine would
cut<00:00:22.730> in<00:00:22.970> and<00:00:23.119> out<00:00:23.410> and<00:00:24.410> now<00:00:25.340> it<00:00:25.460> won't<00:00:25.610> work<00:00:25.790> at

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
cut in and out and now it won't work at

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.260 
cut in and out and now it won't work at
all

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
all

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.819 
all
so<00:00:26.779> these<00:00:27.169> are<00:00:27.380> a<00:00:27.410> bit<00:00:27.590> unique<00:00:27.770> in<00:00:28.130> that<00:00:29.829> you've

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
so these are a bit unique in that you've

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.930 
so these are a bit unique in that you've
got<00:00:31.130> an<00:00:32.090> option<00:00:32.300> here<00:00:32.989> where<00:00:33.290> you<00:00:33.410> can<00:00:33.559> just

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
got an option here where you can just

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.600 
got an option here where you can just
push<00:00:34.940> that<00:00:35.120> up<00:00:35.329> and<00:00:35.899> then<00:00:36.590> your<00:00:36.739> entire<00:00:37.040> handle

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
push that up and then your entire handle

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.210 
push that up and then your entire handle
comes<00:00:38.090> out<00:00:38.350> that's<00:00:39.350> going<00:00:39.590> to<00:00:39.649> make<00:00:39.800> it<00:00:39.980> super

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
comes out that's going to make it super

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.180 
comes out that's going to make it super

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
you're unplugged a power point cut that

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.270 
you're unplugged a power point cut that
off<00:01:12.159> and<00:01:13.159> now<00:01:13.780> we're<00:01:14.780> going<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.080> rethread<00:01:15.530> the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
off and now we're going to rethread the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.000 
off and now we're going to rethread the
new<00:01:16.460> cord<00:01:16.820> inside<00:01:17.270> here<00:01:17.659> now<00:01:17.870> I<00:01:18.620> actually<00:01:18.830> have

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
new cord inside here now I actually have

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.830 
new cord inside here now I actually have
already<00:01:19.430> soldered<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:20.300> ends<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:20.659> this

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
already soldered the ends of this

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.110 
already soldered the ends of this
because<00:01:21.500> it<00:01:21.620> makes<00:01:21.800> it<00:01:21.890> much<00:01:22.010> better<00:01:22.120> stronger

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
because it makes it much better stronger

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.880 
because it makes it much better stronger
fitting<00:01:24.640> push<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:25.850> through<00:01:26.500> so<00:01:27.500> now<00:01:27.620> it's<00:01:27.799> a

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
fitting push that through so now it's a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.000 
fitting push that through so now it's a
simple<00:01:28.070> matter<00:01:28.400> of<00:01:28.670> just<00:01:29.630> exactly<00:01:30.470> copying

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
simple matter of just exactly copying

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.820 
simple matter of just exactly copying
what<00:01:31.130> we<00:01:31.250> had<00:01:31.430> going<00:01:31.670> on<00:01:31.850> here<00:01:32.120> so<00:01:33.080> again<00:01:33.380> we'll

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
what we had going on here so again we'll

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.350 
what we had going on here so again we'll
get<00:01:33.950> our<00:01:34.100> screwdriver<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.850> what<00:01:35.000> happened

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
get our screwdriver and what happened

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.020 
get our screwdriver and what happened
this<00:01:35.570> goes<00:01:35.780> in<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:36.440> under<00:01:37.100> a<00:01:37.130> cord<00:01:37.490> clamp<00:01:37.820> and

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
this goes in and under a cord clamp and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.270 
this goes in and under a cord clamp and
then<00:01:38.659> it<00:01:38.810> jumps<00:01:39.080> up<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.350> around<00:01:39.650> into<00:01:40.250> the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
then it jumps up and around into the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.800 
then it jumps up and around into the
switch<00:01:40.700> proper<00:01:43.960> just

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
switch proper just

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.890 
switch proper just
take<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:48.049> off

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.880 

okay

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.100 

it's<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.400> little<00:02:00.640> bit<00:02:00.760> more<00:02:00.910> on<00:02:01.120> this<00:02:01.270> one

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
it's a little bit more on this one

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.930 
it's a little bit more on this one
okay<00:02:03.920> now<00:02:04.760> what<00:02:05.000> we<00:02:05.120> can<00:02:05.360> do<00:02:05.540> here<00:02:06.880> we<00:02:07.880> can

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
okay now what we can do here we can

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.130 
okay now what we can do here we can
actually<00:02:08.149> move<00:02:08.509> this<00:02:08.810> out<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.710> way

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
actually move this out of the way

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.560 
actually move this out of the way
while<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:12.290> fit<00:02:12.530> our<00:02:12.650> new<00:02:12.890> cord<00:02:13.220> inside<00:02:14.210> there

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
while we fit our new cord inside there

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.020 
while we fit our new cord inside there
and<00:02:14.780> then<00:02:15.110> we'll<00:02:15.230> add<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.380> cord<00:02:15.770> clamp<00:02:16.490> on<00:02:16.760> in

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
and then we'll add the cord clamp on in

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.970 
and then we'll add the cord clamp on in
a<00:02:17.150> moment<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:18.230> I'm<00:02:18.320> going<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.500> take<00:02:18.650> off<00:02:18.830> our

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
a moment so I'm going to take off our

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.350 
a moment so I'm going to take off our
blue<00:02:19.220> side<00:02:21.100> first<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.700> way<00:02:22.820> we<00:02:23.030> won't<00:02:23.180> make

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
blue side first that way we won't make

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.630 
blue side first that way we won't make
any<00:02:23.630> mistakes<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:25.070> side<00:02:25.580> comes<00:02:25.880> out<00:02:26.090> and

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
any mistakes so that side comes out and

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.540 
any mistakes so that side comes out and
this<00:02:28.640> one<00:02:28.910> goes<00:02:29.120> in<00:02:29.890> look<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.130> little<00:02:31.460> bit

too<00:02:31.730> long<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.570> cut<00:02:33.140> those<00:02:34.540> string<00:02:35.540> them

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
too long so just cut those string them

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:43.070 
too long so just cut those string them
up<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.870> little<00:02:37.270> that's<00:02:38.270> perfect

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080

vacuuming the same way and what they'll
find<00:03:20.870> is<00:03:21.380> that<00:03:22.390> without<00:03:23.390> meaning<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:24.050> push
