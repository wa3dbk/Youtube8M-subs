I<00:00:09.170> make<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> lot<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.500> sea<00:00:10.830> fishing<00:00:11.219> weights<00:00:11.570> here

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
I make a lot of sea fishing weights here

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.499 
I make a lot of sea fishing weights here
are<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.870> two<00:00:13.080> most<00:00:13.349> popular<00:00:13.650> designs<00:00:14.509> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
are the two most popular designs the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.849 
are the two most popular designs the
bell<00:00:15.750> or<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.289> cone<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.670> sphere<00:00:18.029> or<00:00:18.060> ball

bell or the cone and the sphere or ball

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.519 
bell or the cone and the sphere or ball
they're<00:00:19.859> made<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.340> two-part<00:00:20.910> mold<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.689> in

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
they're made in a two-part mold and in

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.099 
they're made in a two-part mold and in
the<00:00:22.619> process<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.220> casting<00:00:23.460> them<00:00:23.850> up<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.240> cast<00:00:24.750> in

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the process of casting them up I cast in

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.730 
the process of casting them up I cast in
stainless<00:00:25.859> steel<00:00:26.359> hoops<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.930> order<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.710> that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
stainless steel hoops in order so that

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.970 
stainless steel hoops in order so that
can<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.010> catched<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> line<00:00:30.289> I'll<00:00:31.289> start

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
can be catched to the line I'll start

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.100 
can be catched to the line I'll start
with<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.870> manufacturer<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.899> these<00:00:34.200> loops

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.510 

over<00:00:40.110> here<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:41.129> small<00:00:41.969> guillotine

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
over here we have a small guillotine

over here we have a small guillotine
very<00:00:44.520> simple<00:00:44.969> device<00:00:45.120> i<00:00:45.739> buy<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.800> wire<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.660> 100

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
very simple device i buy the wire in 100

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.590 
very simple device i buy the wire in 100
metre<00:00:48.870> rolls<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> wires<00:00:50.940> push<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
metre rolls and the wires push for a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.069 
metre rolls and the wires push for a
hole<00:00:51.840> up<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> stop<00:00:53.539> and<00:00:54.539> then<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
hole up to the stop and then that the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.920 
hole up to the stop and then that the
lever<00:00:55.320> push<00:00:55.680> smartly<00:00:56.280> forward<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.510> hopefully

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
lever push smartly forward and hopefully

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.080 
lever push smartly forward and hopefully
it<00:00:58.020> goes<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.500> bucket

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
it goes in the bucket

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.420 
it goes in the bucket
push<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.210> up<00:01:00.270> again<00:01:00.620> let<00:01:01.620> me<00:01:01.710> keep<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:01.920> like

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
push it up again let me keep going like

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.080 
push it up again let me keep going like
this<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.860> see<00:01:05.070> get<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> rhythm

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
this and as you can see get a rhythm

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.630 
this and as you can see get a rhythm
going<00:01:06.290> in<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.409> very<00:01:07.650> short<00:01:07.920> time<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.460> have

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
going in a very short time you can have

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.200 
going in a very short time you can have
several<00:01:08.939> hundred<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:10.610> make<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.820> loops

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
several hundred I make all the loops

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.340 
several hundred I make all the loops
standardized<00:01:12.930> whatever<00:01:13.799> weights<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.340> making

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.870 

there's<00:01:19.350> nothing<00:01:19.650> special<00:01:19.950> about<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.520> still

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
there's nothing special about this still

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.840 
there's nothing special about this still
it's<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.240> hardened<00:01:21.979> it's<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.369> steering

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
it's not hardened it's just a steering

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.090 
it's not hardened it's just a steering
action<00:01:25.580> anyway<00:01:26.580> I'm<00:01:27.180> sure<00:01:27.240> you've<00:01:27.630> got<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
action anyway I'm sure you've got the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:41.060 
action anyway I'm sure you've got the
idea<00:01:29.100> by<00:01:29.610> now<00:01:30.110> pretty<00:01:31.110> simple

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.880 

having<00:01:41.760> cut<00:01:42.030> all<00:01:42.330> our<00:01:42.360> wires<00:01:42.870> to<00:01:43.320> length<00:01:43.530> is

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
having cut all our wires to length is

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.580 
having cut all our wires to length is
now<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> simple<00:01:44.430> matter<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.720> putting<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.140> bend<00:01:46.350> in

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
now a simple matter of putting a bend in

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.760 
now a simple matter of putting a bend in
them<00:01:46.830> because<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.370> small<00:01:47.640> t<00:01:47.880> got<00:01:48.060> made<00:01:48.330> here

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
them because the small t got made here

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.700 
them because the small t got made here
the<00:01:49.770> wire<00:01:50.010> is<00:01:50.160> placed<00:01:50.370> in<00:01:50.730> like<00:01:50.910> so<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:54.710> then

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the wire is placed in like so and then

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.150 
the wire is placed in like so and then
turned<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.430> producer<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.390> loop<00:01:59.510> is<00:02:00.510> our<00:02:00.870> loop

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
turned and producer a loop is our loop

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.650 
turned and producer a loop is our loop
and<00:02:02.160> in<00:02:02.280> order<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.640> doesn't<00:02:03.090> come<00:02:03.360> out<00:02:03.479> of

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
and in order that doesn't come out of

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.340 
and in order that doesn't come out of
the<00:02:03.780> lid<00:02:04.130> was<00:02:05.130> placed<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> holes<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.479> bent

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
the lid was placed in the holes and bent

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.720 
the lid was placed in the holes and bent
over<00:02:07.590> at<00:02:07.860> 90<00:02:08.220> degrees

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:30.140 

do<00:02:11.730> some<00:02:11.940> more

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.330 

making<00:02:31.150> them<00:02:31.300> in<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.510> gig<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:31.990> this<00:02:32.340> means

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
making them in a gig like this means

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.850 
making them in a gig like this means
that<00:02:33.490> they<00:02:33.610> fit<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.000> mold<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:35.590> can't

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
that they fit the mold and you can't

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.270 
that they fit the mold and you can't
fiddle<00:02:36.100> about<00:02:36.430> too<00:02:36.700> much<00:02:36.850> when<00:02:37.120> they're<00:02:37.300> hot

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.410 

this<00:02:42.280> makes<00:02:42.580> life<00:02:42.700> much<00:02:43.060> easier<00:02:45.420> quite

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
this makes life much easier quite

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.120 
this makes life much easier quite
therapeutic<00:02:46.600> really<00:02:49.740> anyway<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:51.550> idea<00:02:51.580> is<00:02:52.000> to

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
therapeutic really anyway the idea is to

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.280 
therapeutic really anyway the idea is to
there's<00:02:54.130> always<00:02:54.340> one<00:02:54.670> isn't<00:02:55.000> there<00:02:55.150> get<00:02:56.140> in

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
there's always one isn't there get in

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.000 
there's always one isn't there get in
there

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:07.620 

do<00:03:00.010> another<00:03:00.220> one<00:03:00.490> very<00:03:06.209> little<00:03:07.209> effort

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
do another one very little effort

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.990 
do another one very little effort
involved

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000
