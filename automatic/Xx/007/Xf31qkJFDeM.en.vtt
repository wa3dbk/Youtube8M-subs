00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.590 

to<00:00:05.140> discuss<00:00:05.560> splitting<00:00:06.399> the<00:00:06.490> wood<00:00:06.640> evenly<00:00:07.390> and

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:07.600 
to discuss splitting the wood evenly and

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.690 
to discuss splitting the wood evenly and
to<00:00:08.170> get<00:00:08.500> our<00:00:08.590> parts<00:00:08.830> out<00:00:09.010> of<00:00:09.040> the<00:00:09.219> log<00:00:09.400> with

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
to get our parts out of the log with

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.369 
to get our parts out of the log with
some<00:00:09.850> sort<00:00:10.090> of<00:00:10.150> control<00:00:10.510> there's<00:00:11.110> really<00:00:11.290> a

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:11.379 
some sort of control there's really a

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:12.840 
some sort of control there's really a
basic<00:00:11.740> concept<00:00:12.400> that<00:00:12.520> you<00:00:12.610> need<00:00:12.760> to

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:12.850 
basic concept that you need to

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.459 
basic concept that you need to
understand<00:00:13.270> and<00:00:13.449> that<00:00:13.570> concept<00:00:14.139> is<00:00:14.320> about

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
understand and that concept is about

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.890 
understand and that concept is about
deflection<00:00:15.299> Dave<00:00:16.299> Sawyer<00:00:16.570> help<00:00:16.810> me

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
deflection Dave Sawyer help me

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.540 
deflection Dave Sawyer help me
understand<00:00:17.380> this<00:00:17.500> basically<00:00:18.070> what<00:00:18.310> it<00:00:18.400> comes

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
understand this basically what it comes

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.900 
understand this basically what it comes
down<00:00:18.670> to<00:00:18.789> is<00:00:19.090> this<00:00:19.270> this<00:00:20.230> this<00:00:20.470> piece<00:00:20.710> here<00:00:21.040> if

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
down to is this this this piece here if

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.340 
down to is this this this piece here if
we<00:00:22.090> were<00:00:22.210> trying<00:00:22.390> to<00:00:22.510> split<00:00:22.720> off<00:00:22.900> this<00:00:23.080> little

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
we were trying to split off this little

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.830 
we were trying to split off this little
part<00:00:23.800> right<00:00:24.040> here<00:00:24.370> on<00:00:24.520> the<00:00:24.580> side<00:00:24.850> well<00:00:25.690> it's

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
part right here on the side well it's

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.480 
part right here on the side well it's
quite<00:00:26.020> obvious<00:00:26.230> that<00:00:26.620> as<00:00:26.710> I<00:00:26.830> pull<00:00:27.130> on<00:00:27.160> this

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
quite obvious that as I pull on this

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.100 
quite obvious that as I pull on this
it's<00:00:27.700> going<00:00:27.820> to<00:00:27.880> break<00:00:28.210> and<00:00:28.480> it's<00:00:28.870> going<00:00:29.050> to

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
it's going to break and it's going to

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.920 
it's going to break and it's going to
break<00:00:29.260> outward<00:00:29.770> in<00:00:29.920> that<00:00:30.039> direction<00:00:30.270> okay<00:00:31.300> but

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
break outward in that direction okay but

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.600 
break outward in that direction okay but
the<00:00:32.320> real<00:00:32.500> thing<00:00:32.800> that's<00:00:32.890> happening<00:00:33.280> here<00:00:33.340> is

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
the real thing that's happening here is

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.550 
the real thing that's happening here is
that<00:00:33.940> there's<00:00:34.120> an<00:00:34.239> uneven<00:00:34.960> deflection

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
that there's an uneven deflection

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.040 
that there's an uneven deflection
happening<00:00:36.100> when<00:00:36.700> we<00:00:36.970> do<00:00:37.120> bend<00:00:37.360> it<00:00:37.510> in<00:00:37.960> other

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
happening when we do bend it in other

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.200 
happening when we do bend it in other
words<00:00:38.230> this<00:00:38.560> part<00:00:38.890> even<00:00:39.100> if<00:00:39.640> I<00:00:39.730> pull<00:00:39.940> on<00:00:40.090> it

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
words this part even if I pull on it

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.510 
words this part even if I pull on it
isn't<00:00:40.390> bending<00:00:40.989> or<00:00:41.170> deflecting<00:00:41.739> as<00:00:41.890> much<00:00:42.370> as

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
isn't bending or deflecting as much as

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.900 
isn't bending or deflecting as much as
this

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
this

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.600 
this
therefore<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.840> split<00:00:44.230> will<00:00:44.620> run<00:00:44.890> that<00:00:45.370> way

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
therefore the split will run that way

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.030 
therefore the split will run that way
okay<00:00:46.420> so<00:00:46.480> basically<00:00:47.200> if<00:00:47.500> I<00:00:47.560> pull<00:00:47.800> on<00:00:47.829> them

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
okay so basically if I pull on them

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.010 
okay so basically if I pull on them
evenly<00:00:48.460> it's<00:00:49.149> still<00:00:49.390> going<00:00:49.570> to<00:00:49.630> run<00:00:49.720> out<00:00:49.899> that

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
evenly it's still going to run out that

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.600 
evenly it's still going to run out that
side<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:50.620> you<00:00:50.739> can<00:00:50.860> see<00:00:51.010> this<00:00:51.220> is<00:00:51.370> going<00:00:51.520> to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
side and you can see this is going to

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.880 
side and you can see this is going to
pull<00:00:51.760> right<00:00:51.910> off<00:00:52.120> and<00:00:52.390> that's<00:00:53.290> really<00:00:53.620> what<00:00:53.770> we

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
pull right off and that's really what we

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.459 
pull right off and that's really what we
try<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:54.489> control<00:00:55.149> and<00:00:55.390> affect<00:00:55.719> while<00:00:56.170> doing

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
try and control and affect while doing

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.030 
try and control and affect while doing
our<00:00:56.530> splitting<00:00:56.980> with<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.160> fro<00:00:57.399> in<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:57.730> mall

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
our splitting with the fro in the mall

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.010 
our splitting with the fro in the mall
I've<00:01:00.040> now<00:01:00.309> put<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.820> fro<00:01:01.059> into<00:01:01.510> our<00:01:01.600> workpiece

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
I've now put the fro into our workpiece

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.069 
I've now put the fro into our workpiece
and<00:01:02.370> split<00:01:03.370> it<00:01:03.489> relatively<00:01:03.940> evenly<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.719> I

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
and split it relatively evenly and I

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:06.870 
and split it relatively evenly and I
want<00:01:05.259> to<00:01:05.320> do<00:01:05.409> this<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:05.740> describe<00:01:06.189> exactly<00:01:06.369> what

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
want to do this to describe exactly what

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.270 
want to do this to describe exactly what
the<00:01:07.000> fro<00:01:07.270> does<00:01:07.600> which<00:01:08.170> is<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:08.380> exert<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:08.799> certain

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
the fro does which is to exert a certain

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.399 
the fro does which is to exert a certain
amount<00:01:09.399> of<00:01:09.490> leverage<00:01:09.789> to<00:01:10.450> try<00:01:10.689> and<00:01:10.780> even<00:01:10.959> up

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
amount of leverage to try and even up

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.499 
amount of leverage to try and even up
that<00:01:12.130> deflection<00:01:13.060> that<00:01:13.149> we<00:01:13.270> were<00:01:13.329> talking

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
that deflection that we were talking

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.109 
that deflection that we were talking
about<00:01:13.689> before<00:01:13.929> so<00:01:14.380> you<00:01:14.829> can<00:01:14.979> see<00:01:15.249> if<00:01:15.639> I<00:01:15.819> pull

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
about before so you can see if I pull

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.620 
about before so you can see if I pull
the<00:01:16.240> fro<00:01:16.479> this<00:01:16.899> way<00:01:17.219> notice<00:01:18.219> which<00:01:19.060> part<00:01:19.450> is

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
the fro this way notice which part is

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.690 
the fro this way notice which part is
actually<00:01:20.079> doing<00:01:20.319> the<00:01:20.409> bending<00:01:20.770> which<00:01:21.429> part

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
actually doing the bending which part

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.940 
actually doing the bending which part
deflects<00:01:22.270> it's<00:01:22.479> this<00:01:23.020> part<00:01:23.289> right<00:01:23.409> here<00:01:23.799> and

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
deflects it's this part right here and

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.769 
deflects it's this part right here and
it's<00:01:24.609> a<00:01:24.670> pretty<00:01:24.789> simple<00:01:25.060> reason<00:01:25.509> for<00:01:25.689> that

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:25.779 
it's a pretty simple reason for that

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:28.469 
it's a pretty simple reason for that
that<00:01:26.499> is<00:01:26.740> when<00:01:27.100> I<00:01:27.130> pull<00:01:27.429> this<00:01:27.639> way<00:01:27.909> there's<00:01:28.389> a

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
that is when I pull this way there's a

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.260 
that is when I pull this way there's a
fulcrum<00:01:28.959> right<00:01:29.020> here<00:01:29.499> and<00:01:29.709> that<00:01:30.609> fulcrum<00:01:31.149> is

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
fulcrum right here and that fulcrum is

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.639 
fulcrum right here and that fulcrum is
the<00:01:31.359> only<00:01:31.569> part<00:01:31.810> that's<00:01:31.959> actually<00:01:32.049> touching

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
the only part that's actually touching

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.359 
the only part that's actually touching
this<00:01:32.859> piece<00:01:33.159> now<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.929> fulcrum<00:01:35.590> is<00:01:35.709> here<00:01:36.099> but

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
this piece now the fulcrum is here but

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.459 
this piece now the fulcrum is here but
the<00:01:36.520> lever<00:01:36.759> ends<00:01:37.359> up<00:01:37.450> being<00:01:37.659> way<00:01:37.869> up<00:01:38.109> on<00:01:38.319> this

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
the lever ends up being way up on this

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.440 
the lever ends up being way up on this
piece<00:01:38.740> so<00:01:38.979> that<00:01:39.130> distance<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.819> difference

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
piece so that distance that difference

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.940 
piece so that distance that difference
between<00:01:40.599> this<00:01:41.020> much<00:01:41.229> on<00:01:41.349> this<00:01:41.529> side<00:01:41.709> and

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
between this much on this side and

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.129 
between this much on this side and
nothing<00:01:42.399> on<00:01:42.670> that<00:01:42.789> side<00:01:42.849> is<00:01:43.329> what<00:01:43.810> applies

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:44.139 
nothing on that side is what applies

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:47.609 
nothing on that side is what applies
more<00:01:44.560> force<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.969> the<00:01:46.119> side<00:01:46.389> now<00:01:46.929> if<00:01:47.139> I<00:01:47.259> reverse

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
more force to the side now if I reverse

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.859 
more force to the side now if I reverse
that<00:01:47.889> and<00:01:48.069> I<00:01:48.340> go<00:01:48.459> the<00:01:48.579> other<00:01:48.609> way<00:01:48.880> notice<00:01:49.659> what

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
that and I go the other way notice what

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.260 
that and I go the other way notice what
happens<00:01:50.259> it's<00:01:51.069> the<00:01:51.219> other<00:01:51.399> piece<00:01:51.819> that<00:01:51.849> bends

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
happens it's the other piece that bends

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.469 
happens it's the other piece that bends
the<00:01:53.020> other<00:01:53.200> side<00:01:53.529> of<00:01:53.679> the<00:01:53.740> split<00:01:54.069> okay<00:01:54.909> that's

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
the other side of the split okay that's

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.449 
the other side of the split okay that's
really<00:01:55.810> what<00:01:56.109> we<00:01:56.259> can<00:01:56.439> use<00:01:56.649> to<00:01:56.889> help<00:01:56.979> control

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
really what we can use to help control

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.729 
really what we can use to help control
the<00:01:57.639> split<00:01:57.969> because<00:01:58.419> the<00:01:58.749> throw<00:01:59.020> itself<00:01:59.499> has<00:01:59.709> a

00:01:59.729 --> 00:01:59.739 
the split because the throw itself has a

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:03.870 
the split because the throw itself has a
built-in<00:02:00.329> leverage<00:02:01.439> effect<00:02:02.439> now<00:02:03.219> as<00:02:03.549> we<00:02:03.700> can

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
built-in leverage effect now as we can

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.239 
built-in leverage effect now as we can
see<00:02:04.090> looking<00:02:04.419> at<00:02:04.509> this<00:02:04.659> piece<00:02:04.929> this<00:02:05.829> side<00:02:06.099> over

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:06.249 
see looking at this piece this side over

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:07.800 
see looking at this piece this side over
here<00:02:06.639> looks<00:02:06.849> a<00:02:06.909> little<00:02:07.029> bit<00:02:07.209> thinner<00:02:07.509> than

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
here looks a little bit thinner than

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.479 
here looks a little bit thinner than
that<00:02:07.869> side<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.500> we're<00:02:08.649> going<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.860> expect<00:02:09.280> that

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
that side so we're going to expect that

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.339 
that side so we're going to expect that
this<00:02:09.640> is<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.910> weaker<00:02:10.239> side<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.840> split<00:02:11.200> is

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
this is the weaker side and the split is

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.070 
this is the weaker side and the split is
going<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.560> want<00:02:11.710> to<00:02:11.770> run<00:02:11.950> out<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.760> direction

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
going to want to run out that direction

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.810 
going to want to run out that direction
so<00:02:14.080> knowing<00:02:14.620> what<00:02:14.740> we<00:02:14.860> now<00:02:14.980> know<00:02:15.250> about<00:02:15.280> the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
so knowing what we now know about the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.240 
so knowing what we now know about the
left

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250

this<00:02:23.690> direction<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.950> try<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.550> get<00:02:25.700> an<00:02:25.880> even

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
this direction to try and get an even

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.270 
this direction to try and get an even
deflection<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:26.930> want<00:02:27.200> this<00:02:27.320> even<00:02:27.710> curvature

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.340 
deflection so I want this even curvature
coming<00:02:28.610> down<00:02:28.760> if<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.240> curve<00:02:29.600> is<00:02:29.810> even<00:02:30.230> the

way they both go in there that split

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.690

will<00:02:32.240> run<00:02:32.420> completely<00:02:32.900> straight<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:34.610> I'm

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
will run completely straight so I'm

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.470 
will run completely straight so I'm
going<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:34.880> just<00:02:35.240> leave<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.570> this<00:02:35.720> way<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:37.160> we

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
going to just leave it this way and we

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.970 
going to just leave it this way and we
want<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.540> hear<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.690> slight<00:02:39.050> little<00:02:39.290> tinkling

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
want to hear a slight little tinkling

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.550 
want to hear a slight little tinkling
sound<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.780> little<00:02:41.780> bit<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.050> sound<00:02:42.260> there<00:02:42.440> that

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
sound a little bit of a sound there that

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.900 
sound a little bit of a sound there that
doesn't<00:02:42.710> sound<00:02:43.010> like<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.190> branch<00:02:43.400> breaking<00:02:43.730> see

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
doesn't sound like a branch breaking see

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.510 
doesn't sound like a branch breaking see
and<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.150> just<00:02:44.330> sort<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.540> unzips<00:02:45.280> right<00:02:46.280> down

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
and it just sort of unzips right down

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.970 
and it just sort of unzips right down
the<00:02:46.700> line<00:02:46.900> because<00:02:47.900> what's<00:02:48.410> happening<00:02:48.800> is

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
the line because what's happening is

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.100 
the line because what's happening is
once<00:02:49.340> again<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.760> deflection<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.480> even<00:02:50.840> as<00:02:50.990> it

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
once again that deflection is even as it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.290 
once again that deflection is even as it
goes<00:02:51.260> in<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:52.400> this<00:02:52.640> sort<00:02:52.820> of<00:02:52.850> answers<00:02:53.180> the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
goes in so this sort of answers the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.850 
goes in so this sort of answers the
question<00:02:53.660> most<00:02:53.870> folks<00:02:54.140> have<00:02:54.320> trouble<00:02:54.740> with

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
question most folks have trouble with

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.650 
question most folks have trouble with
which<00:02:55.100> is<00:02:55.250> which<00:02:55.430> side<00:02:55.640> should<00:02:55.850> be<00:02:55.970> down<00:02:56.300> in

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
which is which side should be down in

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.390 
which is which side should be down in
the<00:02:56.810> equation<00:02:57.170> which<00:02:57.290> side<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:57.620> pull<00:02:57.890> against

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
the equation which side you pull against

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.310 
the equation which side you pull against
well<00:02:59.090> you're<00:02:59.209> always<00:02:59.450> pulling<00:02:59.870> against<00:03:00.290> the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
well you're always pulling against the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.440 
well you're always pulling against the
heavier<00:03:00.770> side<00:03:01.130> because<00:03:01.910> you're<00:03:02.060> attempting

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
heavier side because you're attempting

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.150 
heavier side because you're attempting
to<00:03:02.480> make<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:02.810> Bend<00:03:03.140> as<00:03:03.380> much<00:03:03.709> as<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.950> lighter

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
to make it Bend as much as the lighter

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.990 
to make it Bend as much as the lighter
side<00:03:05.709> now<00:03:06.709> besides<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.340> leverage<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:07.790> you

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
side now besides the leverage that you

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.150 
side now besides the leverage that you
can<00:03:08.150> exert<00:03:08.420> with<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.750> fro<00:03:08.959> itself<00:03:09.470> there's

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
can exert with the fro itself there's

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.650 
can exert with the fro itself there's
one<00:03:10.400> other<00:03:10.520> way<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:11.030> can<00:03:11.240> actually<00:03:11.360> help

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
one other way that you can actually help

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.780 
one other way that you can actually help
to<00:03:11.840> control<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.350> split<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.950> create<00:03:13.280> that<00:03:13.400> even

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
to control the split to create that even

to control the split to create that even
deflection<00:03:14.270> we're<00:03:14.420> talking<00:03:14.750> about<00:03:14.860> one<00:03:15.860> way

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
deflection we're talking about one way

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.660 
deflection we're talking about one way
would<00:03:16.310> be<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.580> put<00:03:16.700> my<00:03:16.790> hand<00:03:17.030> here<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:17.720> pull

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
would be to put my hand here and pull

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.910 
would be to put my hand here and pull
that's<00:03:19.670> tight<00:03:19.940> enough<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.750> pull<00:03:21.140> against<00:03:21.769> this

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
that's tight enough to pull against this

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.100 
that's tight enough to pull against this
to<00:03:22.160> try<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.459> create<00:03:23.150> more<00:03:23.330> Bend<00:03:23.600> they're<00:03:23.840> just

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
to try and create more Bend they're just

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.040 
to try and create more Bend they're just
using<00:03:24.440> weight<00:03:25.060> okay<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:26.720> can<00:03:26.900> really

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
using weight okay that that can really

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.320 
using weight okay that that can really
help<00:03:27.290> out<00:03:27.560> if<00:03:27.860> things<00:03:28.280> are<00:03:28.430> relatively<00:03:28.970> even

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330

help out if things are relatively even
another<00:03:30.050> method<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.590> I've<00:03:30.800> employed<00:03:31.160> quite

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
another method that I've employed quite

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.790 
another method that I've employed quite
often<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:32.150> find<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.570> be<00:03:32.660> very<00:03:32.690> useful<00:03:32.989> is<00:03:33.470> to

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
often and find to be very useful is to

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.670 
often and find to be very useful is to
actually<00:03:34.100> support<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:35.060> lighter<00:03:35.420> side<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.170> if

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
actually support the lighter side and if

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.650 
actually support the lighter side and if
you<00:03:36.830> can<00:03:37.010> do<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:37.400> what<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.090> does<00:03:38.269> is<00:03:38.510> it

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
you can do this what it does is it

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.900 
you can do this what it does is it
pushes<00:03:39.080> more<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.220> deflection<00:03:40.550> to<00:03:40.820> the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
pushes more of the deflection to the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.610 
pushes more of the deflection to the
heavy<00:03:41.120> side<00:03:41.360> because<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:41.959> light<00:03:42.110> side<00:03:42.320> can't

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
heavy side because the light side can't

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.620 
heavy side because the light side can't
move<00:03:42.800> quite<00:03:43.100> so<00:03:43.310> much<00:03:43.489> here<00:03:44.090> given<00:03:44.420> all<00:03:44.510> that

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
move quite so much here given all that

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.180 
move quite so much here given all that
we've<00:03:44.750> discussed<00:03:45.200> I'm<00:03:45.500> going<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.769> try<00:03:46.010> and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
we've discussed I'm going to try and

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.759 
we've discussed I'm going to try and
split<00:03:46.519> a<00:03:46.820> smaller<00:03:47.510> portion<00:03:47.840> off<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.410> this<00:03:48.560> wide

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
split a smaller portion off of this wide

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.920 
split a smaller portion off of this wide
piece<00:03:49.100> here<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.610> I'm<00:03:50.030> going<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.209> use<00:03:50.450> my<00:03:50.660> fro

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
piece here and I'm going to use my fro

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.780 
piece here and I'm going to use my fro
and<00:03:51.230> some<00:03:51.680> good<00:03:51.830> leverage<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.340> hopefully<00:03:52.370> be

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
and some good leverage and hopefully be

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.820 
and some good leverage and hopefully be
able<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.000> split<00:03:53.299> off<00:03:53.450> let's<00:03:53.720> say<00:03:53.900> one-third<00:03:54.560> of

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
able to split off let's say one-third of

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.650 
able to split off let's say one-third of
this<00:03:55.010> piece<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.549> have<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.209> go<00:03:56.299> right<00:03:56.480> down<00:03:56.600> the

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
this piece and have it go right down the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.789 
this piece and have it go right down the
fiber<00:03:56.959> line<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:58.310> clearly<00:03:58.820> as<00:03:59.269> I<00:03:59.660> Drive<00:03:59.900> this<00:04:00.110> in

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.830 

you<00:04:03.799> can<00:04:03.920> see<00:04:04.160> that<00:04:04.400> it's<00:04:04.790> an<00:04:05.030> uneven<00:04:05.390> mass

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
you can see that it's an uneven mass

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.509 
you can see that it's an uneven mass
here<00:04:06.200> so<00:04:06.500> it's<00:04:06.769> definitely<00:04:07.190> going<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.370> want<00:04:07.489> to

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
here so it's definitely going to want to

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.100 
here so it's definitely going to want to
run<00:04:07.670> out<00:04:07.910> this<00:04:08.150> direction<00:04:08.720> because<00:04:08.840> this

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
run out this direction because this

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.810 
run out this direction because this
little<00:04:09.440> thin<00:04:09.620> piece<00:04:09.650> is<00:04:10.100> going<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.640> deflect

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
little thin piece is going to deflect

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.210 
little thin piece is going to deflect
more<00:04:11.209> but<00:04:11.959> if<00:04:12.049> I<00:04:12.170> can<00:04:12.350> apply<00:04:12.590> some<00:04:12.739> force

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
more but if I can apply some force

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.430 
more but if I can apply some force
supporting<00:04:13.790> it<00:04:13.940> and<00:04:14.150> use<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.930> leverage<00:04:15.290> of

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
supporting it and use the leverage of

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.860 
supporting it and use the leverage of
the<00:04:15.500> fro<00:04:15.799> I<00:04:16.160> can<00:04:16.700> probably<00:04:17.030> get<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:17.660> run

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
the fro I can probably get it to run

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:37.600 
the fro I can probably get it to run
somewhat<00:04:18.320> straighter

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.860 

you'll<00:04:38.610> also<00:04:38.760> notice<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.270> I'm<00:04:39.510> not<00:04:39.660> being

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
you'll also notice that I'm not being

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.960 
you'll also notice that I'm not being
too<00:04:40.050> fast<00:04:40.350> about<00:04:40.680> this<00:04:40.920> because<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:41.700> want<00:04:41.880> the

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
too fast about this because I want the

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.350 
too fast about this because I want the
forces<00:04:42.480> to<00:04:42.720> be<00:04:43.170> able<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.620> be<00:04:44.180> affected<00:04:45.180> by<00:04:45.300> the

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
forces to be able to be affected by the

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.270 
forces to be able to be affected by the
leverage<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.080> not<00:04:46.350> just<00:04:46.590> be<00:04:46.710> blown<00:04:47.040> by

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
leverage and not just be blown by

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:55.760 
leverage and not just be blown by
excessive<00:04:48.180> speed<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.020> force<00:04:49.260> there<00:04:54.770> all

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
excessive speed and force there all

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.410 
excessive speed and force there all
right<00:04:55.950> not<00:04:56.670> too<00:04:56.700> bad

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
right not too bad

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.850 
right not too bad
it<00:04:57.660> may<00:04:57.810> have<00:04:57.930> run<00:04:58.140> just<00:04:58.350> a<00:04:58.470> little<00:04:58.710> bit<00:04:58.800> in

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
it may have run just a little bit in

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.980 
it may have run just a little bit in
that<00:04:58.950> direction<00:04:59.130> but<00:04:59.850> you<00:04:59.910> can<00:05:00.120> see<00:05:00.390> by<00:05:00.930> the

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
that direction but you can see by the

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.570 
that direction but you can see by the
length<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.440> this<00:05:01.620> fiber<00:05:01.890> right<00:05:02.160> here<00:05:02.400> that

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
length of this fiber right here that

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.160 
length of this fiber right here that
that<00:05:02.790> comes<00:05:02.970> down<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.210> middle<00:05:03.360> that<00:05:03.570> indeed<00:05:04.140> I

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
that comes down the middle that indeed I

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.580 
that comes down the middle that indeed I
follow<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.740> fiber<00:05:04.920> line<00:05:05.160> pretty<00:05:05.370> well<00:05:05.640> and

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
follow the fiber line pretty well and

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.780 
follow the fiber line pretty well and
that's<00:05:07.590> really<00:05:07.800> what<00:05:08.010> we're<00:05:08.130> trying<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.400> do<00:05:08.550> is

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
that's really what we're trying to do is

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.370 
that's really what we're trying to do is
follow<00:05:09.000> the<00:05:09.120> fiber<00:05:09.420> line<00:05:09.660> that's<00:05:10.140> going<00:05:10.320> to

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
follow the fiber line that's going to

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.980 
follow the fiber line that's going to
keep<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.620> strength<00:05:10.950> in<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:11.730> tree<00:05:11.970> and<00:05:12.240> that

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
keep the strength in the tree and that

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.750 
keep the strength in the tree and that
way<00:05:13.140> when<00:05:13.290> we<00:05:13.380> go<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.560> bend<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:13.950> or<00:05:14.130> sit<00:05:14.490> in<00:05:14.610> it

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
way when we go to bend it or sit in it

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.070 
way when we go to bend it or sit in it
we<00:05:15.180> don't<00:05:15.270> have<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.510> worry<00:05:15.690> about<00:05:15.810> it<00:05:15.960> breaking

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
we don't have to worry about it breaking

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.020 
we don't have to worry about it breaking
because<00:05:16.680> we've<00:05:16.830> got<00:05:16.950> those<00:05:17.100> nice<00:05:17.280> long<00:05:17.580> fibers

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
because we've got those nice long fibers

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.390 
because we've got those nice long fibers
intact
