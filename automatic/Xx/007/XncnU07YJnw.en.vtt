00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.229 
ball and looked kind of gimmicky to me
and<00:00:43.010> like<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.160> could<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.489> legal<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.940> didn't<00:00:45.149> I

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and like it could be a legal I didn't I

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.670 
and like it could be a legal I didn't I
didn't<00:00:45.420> know<00:00:45.510> if<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.629> deal<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.960> was<00:00:46.110> but

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
didn't know if the deal with it was but

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.380 
didn't know if the deal with it was but
he<00:00:46.860> uses<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.309> that's<00:00:47.460> how<00:00:47.579> he<00:00:47.670> uses<00:00:48.059> his<00:00:48.149> head

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
he uses and that's how he uses his head

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.000 
he uses and that's how he uses his head
so<00:00:49.020> overall<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.500> really<00:00:49.649> liked<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.239> it<00:00:51.239> is

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
other heads it people don't I don't

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.880 
other heads it people don't I don't
really<00:01:00.840> generally<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> lot<00:01:01.859> of

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
really generally like and a lot of

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
really generally like and a lot of
people<00:01:02.129> don't<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.399> most<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.910> them<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.329> think

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
people don't like most of them I think

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.990 
people don't like most of them I think
the<00:01:04.080> vision<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.559> really<00:01:04.799> wide<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the vision is really wide this one is a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.840 
the vision is really wide this one is a
little<00:01:06.330> better<00:01:06.450> pinched<00:01:06.780> still<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.850> expect

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
little better pinched still the expect

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.280 
little better pinched still the expect
the<00:01:08.970> high<00:01:09.119> school<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.479> college<00:01:09.780> ego<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.200> is

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the high school and college ego so it is

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.109 
the high school and college ego so it is
the<00:01:10.409> three<00:01:10.619> inches<00:01:10.830> across<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:11.970> has<00:01:12.090> a

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the three inches across but it has a

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.179 
the three inches across but it has a
nice<00:01:12.360> flare<00:01:12.720> point<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.619> look<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.159> kind

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
nice flare point you look at it it kind

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.710 
nice flare point you look at it it kind
of<00:01:14.430> resembles<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:15.000> surgeon<00:01:16.909> if<00:01:17.909> there<00:01:18.090> was<00:01:18.299> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
of resembles a surgeon if there was a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.649 
of resembles a surgeon if there was a
universal<00:01:19.470> surgeon<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.180> think<00:01:21.180> yes<00:01:21.360> what<00:01:21.540> would

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
universal surgeon I think yes what would

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.060 
universal surgeon I think yes what would
that's<00:01:22.110> what<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.409> would<00:01:22.560> look<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.770> as<00:01:23.040> a

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
that's what this would look like as a

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.640 
that's what this would look like as a
surgeon<00:01:23.460> 10<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.939> narrower<00:01:24.299> up<00:01:24.540> top<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
surgeon 10 is narrower up top so it

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.230 
surgeon 10 is narrower up top so it
looks<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.920> their<00:01:26.040> work<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.970> regular

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
looks in their work and the regular

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.550 
looks in their work and the regular
surgeon<00:01:27.450> was<00:01:27.540> high<00:01:27.659> school<00:01:27.720> legal<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.409> it's

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
surgeon was high school legal so it's

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.140 
surgeon was high school legal so it's
narrow<00:01:28.770> ver<00:01:28.890> down<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.119> a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
narrow ver down here but if it was a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.819 
narrow ver down here but if it was a
surgeon<00:01:30.509> X<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.869> imagine<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.320> look<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.560> lot<00:01:31.680> like

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
surgeon X I imagine it look a lot like

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.069 
surgeon X I imagine it look a lot like
this<00:01:32.040> even<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> sidewall<00:01:33.570> looks<00:01:33.780> kind<00:01:33.990> of

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
this even the sidewall looks kind of

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.980 
this even the sidewall looks kind of
surgeon<00:01:34.500> desk<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.670> got<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.090> diagonal<00:01:36.750> going

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
surgeon desk it's got the diagonal going

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.640 
surgeon desk it's got the diagonal going
across<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.530> surgeon<00:01:37.860> has<00:01:37.979> another<00:01:38.220> one<00:01:39.650> but

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
across the surgeon has another one but

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.010 
across the surgeon has another one but
it's<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.070> pinched<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.270> fine<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.840> works

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
it's it's pinched just fine it works

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.630 
it's it's pinched just fine it works
pretty<00:01:43.200> well<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.680> was<00:01:43.829> relatively<00:01:44.220> easy<00:01:44.399> a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
pretty well it was relatively easy a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.910 
pretty well it was relatively easy a
string<00:01:44.960> it's<00:01:45.960> got<00:01:46.140> all<00:01:46.229> these<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.619> ribs

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
string it's got all these we have ribs

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.880 
string it's got all these we have ribs
in<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.659> you<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.750> these<00:01:48.899> ribs<00:01:49.200> up<00:01:49.470> here<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
in it you know these ribs up here and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.980 
in it you know these ribs up here and
here<00:01:50.130> here<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.420> think<00:01:51.540> they<00:01:51.750> did<00:01:51.960> that

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
here here and so I think they did that

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.840 
here here and so I think they did that
to<00:01:52.259> get<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.560> flex<00:01:52.890> point<00:01:53.189> correct<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.759> was

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
to get the flex point correct so it was

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.550 
to get the flex point correct so it was
nice<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.000> rigid<00:01:54.299> at<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.810> throat<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.470> when

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
nice and rigid at the throat and when

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.080 
nice and rigid at the throat and when
you<00:01:55.619> throw<00:01:55.829> it'll<00:01:56.630> flex<00:01:57.630> up<00:01:57.869> at<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.079> top<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.649> I

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
you throw it'll flex up at the top and I

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.679 
you throw it'll flex up at the top and I
guess<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.119> works

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
guess that works

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.240 
guess that works
I<00:02:00.780> don't<00:02:01.020> know<00:02:01.079> also<00:02:01.200> maybe<00:02:01.439> they've<00:02:02.100> got

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
I don't know also maybe they've got

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.649 
I don't know also maybe they've got
holes<00:02:02.490> up<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:02.670> maybe<00:02:03.030> make<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.360> lighter<00:02:03.570> or

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
holes up here maybe make it lighter or

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.560 
holes up here maybe make it lighter or
better<00:02:03.899> air<00:02:04.079> flow<00:02:04.110> some<00:02:05.149> sales<00:02:06.149> gimmick<00:02:06.329> they

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
better air flow some sales gimmick they

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.770 
better air flow some sales gimmick they
went<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:06.960> there<00:02:07.250> but<00:02:08.250> anyway<00:02:08.780> stringing

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
went with on there but anyway stringing

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.570 
went with on there but anyway stringing
it<00:02:09.840> they<00:02:10.050> wanted<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.379> white<00:02:10.890> triangle<00:02:11.220> top

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
it they wanted a white triangle top

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.730 
it they wanted a white triangle top

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
say is these days you make it head but

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.660 
say is these days you make it head but
not<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.350> many<00:02:22.470> Sabol<00:02:22.980> holes<00:02:23.190> that's<00:02:23.430> just

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
not that many Sabol holes that's just

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.980 
not that many Sabol holes that's just
not<00:02:23.820> great<00:02:24.120> you're<00:02:24.300> gonna<00:02:24.390> catch<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.780> little

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
not great you're gonna catch a little

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
not great you're gonna catch a little
flack<00:02:25.170> for<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.590> that's<00:02:25.710> what<00:02:25.860> they<00:02:25.950> did

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
flack for it and that's what they did

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.250 
flack for it and that's what they did
they<00:02:26.820> went<00:02:26.940> from<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.210> vision<00:02:27.570> which<00:02:27.720> had<00:02:27.900> a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
they went from the vision which had a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.370 
they went from the vision which had a
ton<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.220> correct<00:02:29.520> amount<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:30.660> which<00:02:31.140> has

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
ton the correct amount to this which has

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.560 
ton the correct amount to this which has
I<00:02:31.650> mean<00:02:32.280> more<00:02:32.490> than<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.790> proton<00:02:33.180> powered<00:02:33.360> the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
I mean more than the proton powered the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.490 
I mean more than the proton powered the
Evo<00:02:33.840> X<00:02:33.990> but<00:02:34.230> still<00:02:34.530> not<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.800> ton<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.220> sidewalls

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
Evo X but still not a ton of sidewalls

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.630 
Evo X but still not a ton of sidewalls
so<00:02:37.500> string<00:02:37.740> of<00:02:37.860> will<00:02:37.950> certainly<00:02:38.370> if<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:38.520> know

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
so string of will certainly if you know

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.800 
so string of will certainly if you know
you're<00:02:38.790> doing<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:40.640> they<00:02:41.640> wanted<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.270> pocket<00:02:42.750> a

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
you're doing so they wanted a pocket a

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.860 
you're doing so they wanted a pocket a
lot<00:02:42.960> like<00:02:43.170> my<00:02:43.350> Dakota's<00:02:43.770> pocket<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.460> it's<00:02:44.870> kind

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
lot like my Dakota's pocket so it's kind

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.170 
lot like my Dakota's pocket so it's kind
of<00:02:45.900> mid<00:02:46.140> high<00:02:46.320> with<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.340> nice<00:02:47.670> channel<00:02:48.000> it

of mid high with a nice channel it

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.990 
of mid high with a nice channel it
should<00:02:48.390> break<00:02:48.570> in<00:02:48.780> really<00:02:49.050> really<00:02:49.140> well<00:02:49.470> I

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
should break in really really well I

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.190 
should break in really really well I
have<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.060> little<00:02:51.330> bit<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.540> whip<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> good<00:02:52.080> bit
