 young people have also abandoned on the track 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.520

 andrea broglioni company of the cardan 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.590
 in line 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.270
 meanwhile in first position to do 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.970
 the gait behind him seemed to be of 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.369
 catch a glimpse of the group's alexio 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.680
 mandatory savonesi and also here in the meantime 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.619
 a detail a detail of this 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.439
 particularly in line rotoni skate 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.009
 great in great evolution that there is 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.040
 been in skating to develop 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.180
 ever increasing speed from what 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.950
 until 1992 it was the skate 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.890
 traditional with four wheels 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.710
 while then from 93 the introduction of the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.840
 very fast inline skating again 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.899
 be careful because it is always alessio 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.570
 we will turn to the pace of the group 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.890
 Savona skaters 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:02.039
 then the other athletes are opening up 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.219
 now while we have arrived at 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.940
 moment of the ringing of the bell which 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.549
 last night the athletes who we are now at 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.120
 the last round is here because attention 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:17.970
 there is an athlete who has now taken the art 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.920
 if he will manage to hold the almost 400 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.849
 meters from the moment he launched but 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.150
 from the outside, athletes of the san mauro 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:29.940
 torinese who is taking the lead and is 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.579
 gabriele taricco that you look at is 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.799
 then lengthening the debt athlete 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.660
 haller team leonardo immediately serving 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.470
 behind attention because also in this 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.459
 case is studying the situation first 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.829
 to then be able to go and give the attack yes 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.040
 they widen a lot they widen a lot not 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:53.970
 there is great choice 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.910
 tactic therefore of the baby athlete 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.830
 roller team leonardo servetti that closes 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.540
 therefore also in this first place 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.580
 case you have seen is that draws 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:10.330
 even the public for the applause 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.550
 almost to the consummate sample artist 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.710
 he goes to call the applause and here you see 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:19.720
 that meanwhile there was just the sprint 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:22.710
 the sprint for the other positions really 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.410
 This is also a great race that we are reviewing 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:29.490
 immediately the departure a few meters and 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:34.270
 then immediately the indication with the sign 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.750
 minus 4 at the conclusion and group in 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.640
 this case a little more active than 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:44.130
 at the women's race where the king is playing 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.450
 of the bell the attempt therefore to 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.730
 gabriele taricco who must 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.410
 so please get the medal 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.770
 silver instead the gold medal for 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:00.510
 leonardo serve the race number 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.510
