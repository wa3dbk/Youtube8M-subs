 biju medical group 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.040
 Hi, I'm Dr. Devil, Martin Lever 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.130
 director of the medicine unit 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.570
 aesthetics of the virus clinics today I'm going to 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.970
 talk about thread treatment 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.950
 magical the magic threads are a 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.050
 very novel treatment to treat the 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.329
 flaccidity still being a treatment 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.700
 Novelty is a treatment with a 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.770
 effectiveness more than proven since these 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.780
 threads are made of the same material 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.150
 with which the sutures are made 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.500
 surgical the oksana cop a 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.510
 Absorbable material 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.610
 with this we get an increase in 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.910
 production of collagen in the skin with 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.530
 that a younger and smoother skin the 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.050
 threads is a treatment that is performed 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.360
 the consultation and the patient can take 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.850
 a perfectly normal life when 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.770
 get out of here and they are done in one 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.710
 session and it is not a painful treatment 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.660
 the threads are inserted in a needle and the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.600
 treatment consists of making a mesh 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.310
 creating lines of tension that what 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.220
 will favor will be the production of 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.450
 collagen increasing the tension in the 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.110
 skin 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.860
 these threads according to the patient can be 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.039
 simple threads and tornados oy 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.200
 articulated or serrated with what 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:28.090
 we favor the production of 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.340
 Collagen 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.770
 the result begins begins to be seen 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.619
 around 23 months after the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.240
 treatment and has a maximum effect to 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.880
 the 6 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.740
 lasts about a year the threads 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.780
 are indicated especially for 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.520
 women from the age of 35 when 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.740
 begin to be observed the first 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.439
 signs of placidity although it also 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.490
 they can perform on older patients 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.200
