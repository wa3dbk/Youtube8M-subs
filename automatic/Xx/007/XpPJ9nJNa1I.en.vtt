create a product and kind of acting

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.849 
create a product and kind of acting
which<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.580> end<00:00:14.820> customers<00:00:15.509> reuse<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.830> a

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
which the end customers reuse this is a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.700 
which the end customers reuse this is a
recycled<00:00:17.400> paper<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.449> actually<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.930> recycled

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
recycled paper it is actually a recycled

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.370 
recycled paper it is actually a recycled
table<00:00:20.039> but<00:00:20.609> within<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.539> paper<00:00:21.779> there's<00:00:22.199> two

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
table but within the paper there's two

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.810 
table but within the paper there's two
cutting<00:00:22.680> strings<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.420> banks<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:25.170> become

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
cutting strings so the banks have become

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.839 
cutting strings so the banks have become
reusable<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.750> bag<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.640> impossible<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
reusable so this bag is impossible to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.790 
reusable so this bag is impossible to
tear<00:00:30.119> apart<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.720> kind<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.289> Bank

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
tear apart this kind of Bank

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.180 
tear apart this kind of Bank
we<00:00:32.219> have<00:00:32.489> tried<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.059> develop<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.719> lot<00:00:33.930> of

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
we have tried to develop a lot of

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.360 
we have tried to develop a lot of
materials

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
materials

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.990 
materials
this<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.880> craft<00:00:36.329> paper<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.750> outside<00:00:37.200> and

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
this is craft paper on outside and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000 
this is craft paper on outside and
recycled<00:00:39.000> PP<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:39.510> inside<00:00:39.960> actually<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.829> got

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
recycled PP on inside actually we got

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.280 
recycled PP on inside actually we got
the<00:00:41.190> idea<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.670> saw<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.239> we<00:00:42.570> got<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.930> idea

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the idea we saw that we got the idea

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.100 
the idea we saw that we got the idea
from<00:00:43.710> concrete<00:00:44.430> factories<00:00:45.090> where<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:45.840> put

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
from concrete factories where they put

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.560 
from concrete factories where they put
concrete<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:47.039> these<00:00:47.430> kind<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.820> bags<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.360> said

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
concrete in these kind of bags we said

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.600 
concrete in these kind of bags we said
why<00:00:48.780> not<00:00:49.050> use<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.739> kind<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.190> packaging

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
why not use this as a kind of packaging

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.760 
why not use this as a kind of packaging
from<00:00:51.000> eight<00:00:51.149> years<00:00:51.360> ago<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:52.050> only<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.530> two

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
materials we can use as material for the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.979 
materials we can use as material for the

in fact require recycle materials

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.060 
in fact require recycle materials
nowadays<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:21.420> example<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:22.290> materials<00:01:22.799> we<00:01:22.890> do

some<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> bags<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.290> are<00:01:31.380> doing<00:01:31.650> are<00:01:31.829> made

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
some of the bags we are doing are made

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.609 
some of the bags we are doing are made
of<00:01:32.369> synthetic<00:01:32.579> fibers<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.990> material<00:01:34.530> we

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
of synthetic fibers but the material we

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.490 
of synthetic fibers but the material we
use<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> synthetic<00:01:35.490> fiber<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.420> among<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
use for the synthetic fiber is among the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.710 
use for the synthetic fiber is among the
most<00:01:37.850> environment-friendly<00:01:38.850> plastic<00:01:39.600> you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
most environment-friendly plastic you

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.350 
most environment-friendly plastic you
can<00:01:39.900> get<00:01:40.110> when<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.070> comes<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> natural

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
can get when it comes to the natural

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.109 
can get when it comes to the natural
fibers<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.860> should<00:01:44.070> choose<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.939> most

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
fibers if we should choose the most

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.300 
fibers if we should choose the most
environment-friendly<00:01:45.930> fabric<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.040> choose

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
environment-friendly fabric to choose

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.999 
environment-friendly fabric to choose
from<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:48.060> should<00:01:48.240> choose<00:01:48.509> jute<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
from we should choose jute and the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.880 
from we should choose jute and the
reason<00:01:50.340> for<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:51.030> when<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.840> jute<00:01:52.320> plants

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
reason for that is when the jute plants

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.969 
reason for that is when the jute plants
grow<00:01:53.250> there's<00:01:53.759> no<00:01:54.090> need<00:01:54.329> for<00:01:54.360> pesticides<00:01:54.979> so

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
grow there's no need for pesticides so

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.490 
grow there's no need for pesticides so
because<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.299> very<00:01:57.540> environment

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
because of this it is very environment

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.950 
because of this it is very environment
friendly<00:01:58.710> product<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.090> course<00:02:00.360> also<00:02:00.780> work

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
friendly product we of course also work

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.660 
friendly product we of course also work
