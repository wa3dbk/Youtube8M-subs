menu

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.830 

and<00:03:00.200> there<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.530> go<00:03:02.440> that<00:03:03.440> is<00:03:03.470> my<00:03:04.099> character

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
and there you go that is my character

and there you go that is my character
dad<00:03:07.180> time<00:03:08.180> played<00:03:08.480> seven<00:03:08.959> hours<00:03:09.110> 10<00:03:09.500> minutes

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
dad time played seven hours 10 minutes

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.400 
dad time played seven hours 10 minutes
didn't<00:03:11.060> even<00:03:11.120> make<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.480> through<00:03:11.780> normal<00:03:12.290> mode

didn't even make it through normal mode
so<00:03:15.410> I'm<00:03:15.830> guessing<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.760> if<00:03:16.879> I<00:03:17.000> continue<00:03:17.629> doing

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
so I'm guessing that if I continue doing

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.780 
so I'm guessing that if I continue doing
these<00:03:18.049> videos<00:03:18.110> it's<00:03:18.860> going<00:03:19.129> to<00:03:19.220> take<00:03:19.459> me

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
forever to get to level 60 maybe I

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.910
