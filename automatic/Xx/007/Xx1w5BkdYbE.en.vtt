00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:09.320
 Well then I would like to give a lecture on how to make a short sleeve shirt Yes Chan and Ellie 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.940
 I'm attached 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.240
 Aa short sleeve shirt with rim 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.940
 is 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.580
 Yes, how to fold immediately is 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.770
 First of all 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.010
 Half the size of an ordinary origami 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.890
 I am 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.260
 And this time, this fold is already tight 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.010
 Welcome 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.510
 Made with half paper size 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.000
 That's why one piece is half 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.650
 Cut 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.420
 If you don't have it 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.839
 Is 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:51.239
 You 're right at this fourth grade 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:54.110
 You can use a pair of scissors and cut along the line of the child . 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.240
 If there is no, then 3 like this 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.690
 If I several times but by suppressing To creaking leather 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.880
 Well this 4 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.530
 As we can do it earlier 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.080
 This minimum to the case is if there is no scissors 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.440
 Please use in half 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.640
 Yes 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.900
 So let's halve the key that we halved 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.659
 Fold it in half 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.830
 I can not cut it this time 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.480
 I do not enter, but I am half size 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.980
 Entered was 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.380
 It is like this 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.860
 It further yeah in the middle line was now 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.630
 Half 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.630
 Please drive inside 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:46.530
 The reverse has an upset inside 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:52.300
 Well if you tear it by hand like this , part of the cross section of the pot is slightly 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.950
 I waved, but this time there is nothing wrong with it because it is scooped inside 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.280
 Yes 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.020
 By say 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.930
 I got down to 1/4 hippo like this 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.160
 It is in and turn it over to open once 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.160
 It's upside down 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.830
 That's right, isn't it about 5 mm wide ? 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.440
 5 mm wide 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.210
 Wrap 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.710
 I will turn over and return 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.700
 If you put the white back, it's the opposite of the one you've just put 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.850
 The opposite corner 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.780
 Cat's 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.320
 Check 3 cards in 1/4 condition 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.320
 Cage you 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.430
 It is like this 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.050
 As before, it's 1/4 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.270
 I fold the width inward 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.270
 Subdivide half 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:02.470
 Once it is in become the cat of state 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:08.250
 It was of little while ago this it is better to fold the triangle 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:13.590
 Some I got to weave bag open the bag to technical 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:16.290
 Not wearing a dream I am 8 Well it may be a little difficult because do a free hand in 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.360
 It is this triangular shape 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.610
 Let's start with this triangle part 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.830
 It is a close such a form 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.950
 This 4 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.400
 Once in operation 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:34.210
 Please follow me later here as well 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.710
 This triangle of this triangle same city side 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:40.920
 I feel that tightly cage mate 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:45.080
 Please tighten with this same 8 days 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.340
 In this condition, I firmly tighten the corner 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.660
 This 4 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.410
 Like to beat before 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.190
 To the feeling of defeat before 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.170
 I 'm just 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:03.440
 like this 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:08.410
 In a state in which the card is pointed to normal is this triangle triangle in this way 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.410
 You should have an owl position like this 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.470
 Please be in this state 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.389
 It is in it Once you become in such a state 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.439
 Now it is here in the upper 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.439
 Above this 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.740
 It's like this , I'll go back to the top 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.120
 Oh 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.700
 For those who weaved the bag earlier 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:04.190
 For the other side 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:09.560
 Now it is also of the card above it is the bottom on this 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:12.860
 Slightly angled like this 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.310
 Per place of about 5 mm from the top 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.430
 There guideline 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.030
 In this way 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.449
 Triangle N 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.009
 I will 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.009
 How is 4 legs good 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.870
 It is participation 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.490
 Pattern 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.270
 I will try it one more time 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.270
 It bought the balance 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:46.090
 This vertical line is this width is not so wide or this distance is so long participation is 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.090
 To be as similar as possible 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:57.529
 Yes, it's almost done once you get here 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:01.639
 Because the sound part on this is already part of the collar 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:03.710
 In the form of plugging in nine collars 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:09.200
 I know Omi 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:11.590
 After it is put together a line right in the middle of today is what it like fold also washing 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.590
 In this way 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.870
 Blessed and qualified 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:16.810
 It is when the brackets often have 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.870
 Yes 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.080
 This completes the short sleeve shirt 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.080
 It is called 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:29.670
 Squid and square 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.360
 The point is to make it as if it were ironed 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:35.610
 When it breaks beautifully 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.610
 I think that depends on the Bishitsu 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:43.860
 Well then, it's different colors and hot and various 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:46.560
 There are a lot of variations and it 's just that 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:51.650
 When you pile up laundry like this 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:56.919
 You can play like that, so please follow in various colors 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.919
 Yes the short sleeve shirt is over
