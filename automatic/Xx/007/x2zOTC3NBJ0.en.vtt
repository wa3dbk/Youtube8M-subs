 May is still here 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.199
 but what would progress have no problem with 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.730
 the topic we would give about 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.960
 is the carrier happened this week 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.930
 Referees at News Corporation Corp. are now focusing on the July issue 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.590
 as has been beautified 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.200
 With Christa's card, though, we still have three games to help the Hornets 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.840
 his athleticism especially Chris Breuer the dissatisfied superstar Kaka has the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.480
 you can le-mans-race can press with the accelerator 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.170
 Of course that is very good percent of the AMS comes in the OECD 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.489
 the order numbers are given off their courses and Jens Posey the way off and Gert and 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:52.450
 go 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.100
 Percent would know say XDA stopper 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.100
 the ball was in the nature that is the percent the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.360
 For a long time the wanted one was unsuccessful and finally they have one of their courses 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.090
 that as a book it does a great job as Chris Breuer 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.350
 get hurt 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.380
 definitely my future very good reputation for the Pacers the percent positive 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.240
 actually could use it there were rumors that he is bought from the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.090
 he did not want 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.400
 you have to wait and see what happens next, hopefully not another one 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.460

 Buying a house will not be a dime 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.340
 So he has been eating more so far 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.240
 how it looks like it's going wrong 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.610
 In addition, the New Jersey Nets and the have been part of the traffic part of real 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.640
 Troy Murphy get the Pacers of the Center 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.910

 good shooter Kammerspiel spread 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.180
 But you have to ask questions if they have one of the e-shares 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.620

 Chamber represent the contract more so far way there can be others again 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.410
 To turn surfaces 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.810
 were still involved 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.300
 Aperam, of course, had to get the PROKON Eli from Inez 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:14.319
 a good man on the 2 that as a baker and then thought of Kevin Martin so he 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.519
 as a defensive man from the band must definitely mother 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.150
 And finally, that's what comes next 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.150
 that the 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.949
 I did not cover then 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:28.039

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.769
 the Hornets 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.019
 but carry on 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.359
 second topic 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.890
 Percent likes to get over september then not allowed to speak it 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.209

 on the one hand, it is without commitment and whether it becomes free 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.050
 also in the mixed successful one has got very very far out of the window 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.769
 leaning 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.079
 I'll show you the phone 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.789
 the city very funny picture 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:54.349
 with 3d glasses 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.169
 and 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.409
 I think that scares me 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.459
 then you have in mind what the amount of hits these guys lay 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.499
 For a long time now, as if there were not any men in de 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.269
 and who says 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.370
 Firstly, they are the filth place for a complete Sorger winner 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.570
 72 cars break from the Bulls 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.530
 he says 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.249
 no problem that created the child case 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:19.729
 is already second, he says 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:23.649
 they have a serious chance to win the record 33 games in a row 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:26.649
 Lawsuits filed against the Lakers 71 72 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:29.649
 That's more than a third of the season in a row 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.439
 but it does not stop there, he continued to say 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.059
 and third, if they do not lose two games in a row, so this point 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:40.639
 this is the hammer 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.579
 Back to Back is fine 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.549
 where is Horst Schulze and so they have never played the Stever together 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.449
 and then no game backbeats due to win 33 episode is fierce 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:51.679
 Point 4 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:55.449
