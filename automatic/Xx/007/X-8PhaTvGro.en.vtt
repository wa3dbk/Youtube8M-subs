00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.660
 work is not the preferred activity 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.420
 horses and that's why they often make 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.960
 the simple action of 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.850
 pick them up 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.489
 a thin line between the game the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.940
 spite and laziness shows the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.160
 reactions of our friends and often there 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.680
 they lose patience because 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.860
 an action as simple as going to them 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.489
 take turns into a nightmare of 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.610
 several minutes and it's even worse for us 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.890
 if the animal is inside a 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.990
 group of various horses behind which 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.820
 it can easily hide or even if 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.640
 we are faced with a horse that is 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.140
 it only shows us the back 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.140
 ready to kick 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.509
 we must make him understand that we are not doing it 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.909
 take can become much more 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.039
 annoying that accepting to do 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.209
 tuck the boss in to go to 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:39.130
 work to teach a horse a 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:40.750
 let yourself be taken without causing 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.030
 problems or loss of time 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.959
 we have to do it to work in a fence 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.109
 alone a rod is the most fence 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:51.230
 suitable because it avoids getting caught in 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.660
 corners 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.630
 however to show the technique we have 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.520
 preferred a square fence in which 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.970
 in any case it is possible to work 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.970
 adequately 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.190
 we must walk determinedly towards 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.770
 the animal highlighting the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.620
 our intention to grab it with the 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.770
 whip or at least with furniture or long in 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.110
 hand as soon as he realizes ours 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.290
 intentions will try to escape towards 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.470
 one of the corners as his habit in 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.840
 that moment we must begin 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.750
 chase it in the fence pushing it with 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.190
 the rein or with the whip showing him 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.190
 so our discontent 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.780
 the idea is to clearly show that 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.280
 what he did is wrong and therefore 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.400
 we must push him hard 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.280
 in this case standing in an enclosure 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.459
 square we will simply begin a 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.490
 or treat him walk until 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.240
 does not stop in the corners e 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:02.290
 try to get out of the fence if you 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.819
 fence and bottom if we use too much force 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.630
 we run the risk of the animal jumping 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.310
 off this you can avoid starting 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.020
 to push it gently 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.080
 after making him perform so 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.510
 quiet some laps and if he shows us 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.810
 to keep the cadence moving in 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.300
 circle within the enclosure ci 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.810
 we will position in front of him to do it 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.810
 to brake 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:34.090
 we will try to catch it normally but 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.249
 the animal will escape again to stop 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.829
 in the opposite corner in one position 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:43.319
 uncomfortable and dangerous for us because there 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.319
 offers the hindquarters and hides the head 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.950
 when this happens we have to push it 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.550
 with whip or rein with more force 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.230
 we'll push it for two or three turns as if 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.819
 we were a predator that wanted it 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.830
 hunt until it stops if 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.230
 we stop chasing him he will give some 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.650
 step up and stop in front of 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.440
 us in this position 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.650
 we must remain firm and calm for 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.500
 give him the chance to think when 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.900
 I look at him he doesn't chase but if I stop 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.830
 look at it and run away it starts again 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:26.530
 follow my instinct here 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.780
 conservation will begin to make him understand 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.630
 that it is more convenient to remain calm 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.090
 and look at us rather than run away 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.430
 running away he feels attacked while 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.380
 when it remains still, everything returns to 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.830
 normality 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.990
 the time will come when they will understand 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.880
 perfectly that if they look at us we won't 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.950
 chase 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.730
 we will see then and if we walk 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.970
 they also turn around keeping it 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.850
 look at us 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.100
 now at this point we are ready to do 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.560
 re-enter the other horses of the group 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.370
 in the fence to be able to do this 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.450
 exercise 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.450
 under normal conditions 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.480
 if everything works well when there 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.930
 we stop in front of the horse that is 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.870
 finds among his friends he will turn to 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.470
 of us showing our head and leaving us 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.720
 thread the bus to quietly 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.360
 understood that going to work 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.490
 and better than having to bear a man 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.480
 who chases him like crazy for 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.480
 braccarli
