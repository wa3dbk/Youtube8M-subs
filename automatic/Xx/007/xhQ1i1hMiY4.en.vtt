in 2013 and as you go back here there's
a<00:01:37.230> few<00:01:37.650> outbuildings<00:01:41.390> as<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.750> see<00:01:43.020> when

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
a few outbuildings as you can see when

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.790 
a few outbuildings as you can see when
you<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:43.860> deep<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.550> woods<00:01:45.590> still<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.620> lot<00:01:46.770> of

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
you get deep in the woods still a lot of

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.350 
you get deep in the woods still a lot of
ice<00:01:46.980> on<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> ground<00:01:47.370> so<00:01:47.790> I'm<00:01:47.910> not<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.240> be

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
ice on the ground so I'm not going to be

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.580 
ice on the ground so I'm not going to be
detecting<00:01:48.900> there<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:51.270> then<00:01:51.480> here's<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.170> back

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
detecting there and then here's the back

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.160 
detecting there and then here's the back
of<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> house<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.630> looks<00:01:54.870> like<00:01:55.020> it

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
of the house and this looks like it

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.090 
of the house and this looks like it
might<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.350> been<00:01:55.500> an<00:01:55.650> old<00:01:56.900> shed<00:01:57.900> or<00:01:58.320> barn<00:01:58.350> or

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
might have been an old shed or barn or

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.130 
might have been an old shed or barn or
something<00:01:59.600> where<00:02:00.600> they<00:02:00.690> might<00:02:00.840> have<00:02:00.900> kept

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
something where they might have kept

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.200 
something where they might have kept
tools<00:02:02.360> you<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.510> see<00:02:03.720> that<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.640> then<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:06.030> go

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
tools you can see that and then you go

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.640 
tools you can see that and then you go
back<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.450> little<00:02:06.660> further<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.230> I'm<00:02:07.320> not<00:02:07.470> going

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
back a little further and I'm not going

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.680 
back a little further and I'm not going
to<00:02:07.740> walk<00:02:07.860> back<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.369> there<00:02:08.550> but<00:02:08.819> there's

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
to walk back in there but there's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.960 
to walk back in there but there's
another<00:02:09.929> structure<00:02:10.590> or<00:02:10.830> building<00:02:10.940> back<00:02:11.940> there

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
another structure or building back there

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.089 
another structure or building back there
and<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.500> was<00:02:13.590> probably<00:02:13.739> another

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
and that was probably another

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.360 
and that was probably another
outbuilding<00:02:14.819> so<00:02:15.709> what<00:02:16.709> I'm<00:02:16.799> going<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.010> do<00:02:17.159> is

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
outbuilding so what I'm going to do is

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.180 
outbuilding so what I'm going to do is
go<00:02:17.549> across<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.060> street

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
go across the street

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.670 
go across the street
where<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.060> believe<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.840> fields<00:02:21.230> used<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.560> be

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
where I believe the fields used to be

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.680 
where I believe the fields used to be
and<00:02:21.860> I'm<00:02:21.920> going<00:02:22.070> to<00:02:22.130> hunt<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.400> fields<00:02:22.880> with

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
and I'm going to hunt the fields with

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.510 
and I'm going to hunt the fields with
our<00:02:23.870> woods<00:02:24.110> now<00:02:24.380> we'll<00:02:24.680> see<00:02:24.830> what<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.010> can<00:02:25.130> come
