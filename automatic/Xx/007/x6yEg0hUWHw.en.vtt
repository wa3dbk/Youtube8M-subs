00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.629
 welcome to my channel my name is 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.510
 Thanks for watching me, let's go 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.460
 let's talk about europe courses 4 initially 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.500
 Each side has two merchants who 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.410
 can either collect the profit either 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.970
 transfer trade force to another zone 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.859
 so this number can be increased 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.420
 use national ideas for example 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.430
 if you began to defend go expansion then 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.880
 at the second level you get plus one 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.429
 merchant 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.990
 if you chose a trading idea there 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.020
 the second level get 1 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.649
 on the fifth level 2 and 3 you can get 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.700
 when exploring the whole thread trading idea 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.680
 depending on your culture you also 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.780
 can get a merchant just by opening 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.670
 national idea based on this 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.320
 example portugal may have all 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.510
 merchants when you put a course on collection 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.820
 you increase your profit only 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.770
 10 percent but you don’t need 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.899
 have cups the author of you services is located 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.239
 your capital to get a clip from it 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.030
 we could send to another place and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.630
 cheese would make a profit from this zone 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.299
 for example the capital of portugal is lisbon and he 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.119
 automatically profit trading 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.049
 zone of Seville so it turns out that I leave 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.890
 merchant on the net he increase your profit 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.909
 you drop ten percent sometimes 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.710
 whichever happens 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.770
 trade in the world makes sense to collect 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.530
 profit from other trading sites for example 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.540
 just below from Portugal is 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.860
 british trade hub in this trade 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.840
 node includes just a few countries and 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:41.720
 he doesn’t have much profit though 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.579
 would put the merchant on the collection then we get 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.460
 63 percent profit with trade in this 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.829
 sector as a result, our net profit from 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.540
 all bonuses will be seventy six 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:57.450
 one hundredth ducats as there are not so many 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.310
 combat 50 6 percent trade immediately 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.250
 zones are not connected to your capital for us 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.530
 not so you are scary sending a couple of ships 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.620
 to patrol this zone we could 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.430
 get almost all the income from this 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.870
 sectors on the other hand if we wanted 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.530
 we could supply 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.620
 merchant on the transfer of trading power that gave 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:25.200
 would Seville at a shopping center about 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.510
 plus 5-7 percent of revenue, but if we 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.820
 have had 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.290
 a little more influence on our market 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.060
 the main trade already then it would have 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.640
 sense but since our influence is not 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.860
 so great is your whole power transfer 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.290
 will be sprayed by other countries and you 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.400
 let them get less profit than 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.700
 you collected 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.380
 profit from another trading hub so 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.489
 sometimes it makes sense to remove the merchant with 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.790
 your high school 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.459
 leave it to receive other places 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.650
 with a little trading power on this a cube 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.989
 with all thanks for watching this video 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.350
 subscribe to my channel see you soon 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.350
