00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
the wall but then once you see that

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.949 
the wall but then once you see that
you're<00:03:53.879> getting<00:03:54.030> closer<00:03:54.329> and<00:03:54.450> closer<00:03:54.629> to<00:03:54.780> the

you're getting closer and closer to the

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.479 
you're getting closer and closer to the
wall<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.499> might<00:03:55.650> want<00:03:55.859> to<00:03:55.950> move<00:03:56.129> out<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.370> little

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
wall you might want to move out a little

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.000 
wall you might want to move out a little
bit<00:03:56.790> if<00:03:56.939> you<00:03:57.120> saw<00:03:57.299> me<00:03:57.450> do<00:03:57.599> that<00:03:57.780> great<00:03:58.079> um<00:03:58.680> so
