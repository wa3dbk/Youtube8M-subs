first let's recap them the first big
problem<00:01:09.650> a<00:01:09.890> lot<00:01:10.010> of<00:01:10.190> guys<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:10.580> which<00:01:10.820> are

you're saying is that a lot of guys rely
on<00:01:12.590> bulking<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.369> then<00:01:13.520> cutting<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.299> it<00:01:14.720> works

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
on bulking and then cutting and it works

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.630 
on bulking and then cutting and it works
once<00:01:15.320> or<00:01:15.500> twice<00:01:15.740> but<00:01:15.979> it's<00:01:16.100> not<00:01:16.250> a<00:01:16.280> long-term

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640

final destination so taking good

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.160 
final destination so taking good
principles<00:01:31.429> but<00:01:31.939> they're<00:01:32.119> not<00:01:32.329> personalized

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
principles but they're not personalized

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.219 
principles but they're not personalized
they're<00:01:33.320> just<00:01:33.500> basically<00:01:33.880> generic

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
they're just basically generic

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.139 
they're just basically generic
principles<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:36.439> then<00:01:36.859> the<00:01:37.070> third<00:01:37.369> problem<00:01:37.759> is

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
principles and then the third problem is

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.419 
principles and then the third problem is
a<00:01:38.780> lot<00:01:39.170> of<00:01:39.320> guys<00:01:39.409> are<00:01:39.619> just<00:01:39.710> going<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:39.979> not<00:01:40.219> I

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
a lot of guys are just going to not I

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.219 
a lot of guys are just going to not I

on forms ebooks mags and everything's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:51.399 
on forms ebooks mags and everything's
generic<00:01:50.479> so<00:01:50.630> they're<00:01:50.749> getting<00:01:50.840> generic

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
generic so they're getting generic

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.830 
generic so they're getting generic
results<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:52.850> I<00:01:52.880> wanted<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.329> put<00:01:53.509> you<00:01:53.630> on<00:01:53.749> the

spot you got a couple minutes here and
just<00:01:56.689> ask<00:01:56.869> you<00:01:57.140> what<00:01:57.350> would<00:01:57.439> you<00:01:57.590> say<00:01:57.829> the

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
just ask you what would you say the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.859 
just ask you what would you say the
solutions<00:01:58.850> are<00:01:59.060> do<00:01:59.299> those<00:01:59.420> three<00:01:59.689> big

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
solutions are do those three big

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:00.520 
solutions are do those three big
mistakes

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
mistakes

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.859 
mistakes
okay<00:02:01.069> okay<00:02:01.249> for<00:02:01.579> sure<00:02:01.729> man<00:02:01.909> no<00:02:02.119> problem<00:02:02.509> are

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
okay okay for sure man no problem are

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.849 
okay okay for sure man no problem are
you<00:02:02.990> summed<00:02:03.289> all<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.560> up<00:02:03.710> pretty<00:02:03.859> good<00:02:03.979> man

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
you summed all that up pretty good man

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.919 
you summed all that up pretty good man
now<00:02:06.859> you<00:02:06.920> did<00:02:07.249> I<00:02:07.880> guess<00:02:08.149> when<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.509> comes<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.840> the

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
now you did I guess when it comes to the

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.930 
now you did I guess when it comes to the
solution<00:02:09.500> if<00:02:10.160> there's<00:02:10.460> nothing<00:02:10.759> crazy

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
then I think everybody's probably

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.289 
then I think everybody's probably
wondering<00:03:31.349> so<00:03:31.590> why<00:03:32.310> is<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.549> then<00:03:32.940> if<00:03:33.120> that's

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
wondering so why is it then if that's

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.330 
wondering so why is it then if that's
common<00:03:33.690> knowledge<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:34.349> not<00:03:34.889> everybody<00:03:35.280> has

second<00:03:57.660> thing<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:57.959> it's<00:03:58.169> a<00:03:58.470> space<00:03:59.220> it's<00:03:59.489> not

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
second thing is it's a space it's not

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.270 
second thing is it's a space it's not
affordable<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.200> portal<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:01.709> know<00:04:01.829> everybody

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
affordable a portal you know everybody

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.800 
affordable a portal you know everybody
notable<00:04:02.760> I've<00:04:03.150> been<00:04:03.299> doing<00:04:03.450> this<00:04:03.510> for<00:04:03.690> eight

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
notable I've been doing this for eight

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.360 
notable I've been doing this for eight
years<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.260> this<00:04:04.319> is<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.560> first<00:04:04.769> time<00:04:05.069> I<00:04:05.099> went

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
years and this is the first time I went

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.430 
years and this is the first time I went
that<00:04:05.579> relic<00:04:06.030> so<00:04:06.239> it's<00:04:06.389> absolutely<00:04:06.959> I<00:04:07.109> think

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
that relic so it's absolutely I think

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.599 
that relic so it's absolutely I think
that's<00:04:07.590> probably<00:04:07.739> why<00:04:07.980> there's<00:04:08.220> such<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.370> big

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
that's probably why there's such a big

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.270 
that's probably why there's such a big
gap<00:04:08.819> there<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.630> what<00:04:09.900> people<00:04:10.079> know<00:04:10.440> we're<00:04:11.160> not

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
gap there is what people know we're not

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.890 
gap there is what people know we're not
presenting<00:04:12.150> anything<00:04:12.480> new<00:04:12.660> or

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
presenting anything new or

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.089 
presenting anything new or
groundbreaking<00:04:12.930> here<00:04:13.680> we're<00:04:13.859> basically

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
groundbreaking here we're basically

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.550 
groundbreaking here we're basically
saying<00:04:14.489> that<00:04:15.109> customized<00:04:16.109> solution

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
saying that customized solution

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.440 
saying that customized solution
obviously<00:04:17.070> is<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.519> best<00:04:17.729> route<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:18.090> go

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
obviously is the best route to go

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.659 
obviously is the best route to go
but<00:04:18.660> despite<00:04:19.440> people<00:04:20.010> knowing<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:20.430> there's

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
but despite people knowing that there's

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.460

such<00:04:20.820> as<00:04:20.970> big<00:04:21.180> gap<00:04:21.450> nobody's<00:04:21.900> using<00:04:22.200> a
