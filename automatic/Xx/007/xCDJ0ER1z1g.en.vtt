the<00:00:10.889> circuits<00:00:11.370> special<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.920> have<00:00:13.920> no<00:00:14.160> idea<00:00:14.460> what

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
the circuits special I have no idea what

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.740 
the circuits special I have no idea what
this<00:00:14.820> okay<00:00:15.660> compare<00:00:16.080> okay<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.440> it's<00:00:16.859> like

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
compared to that I wish I could compare

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.920 
compared to that I wish I could compare
easily<00:00:21.890> so<00:00:22.890> they<00:00:23.010> know<00:00:23.160> comparing<00:00:23.930> besides

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
easily so they know comparing besides

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.300 
easily so they know comparing besides
just<00:00:25.109> memorizing<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.800> stats<00:00:28.310> acceleration

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
just memorizing the stats acceleration

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.120 
just memorizing the stats acceleration
sucks<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.859> sure<00:00:31.859> let's<00:00:31.890> try<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.340> why<00:00:32.669> not

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
sucks but sure let's try it why not

handling on that I don't like this thing

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.430 
handling on that I don't like this thing
at<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:55.640> handling<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.790> shit

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
at all handling is shit

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.960 
at all handling is shit
the<00:01:58.440> handling<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.890> like<00:01:59.070> crap<00:01:59.370> on<00:01:59.580> all<00:01:59.790> of

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
the handling is like crap on all of

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.790 
the handling is like crap on all of
these<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.420> most<00:02:00.540> part<00:02:03.320> how<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.380> handling

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
these for the most part how the handling

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.200 
these for the most part how the handling
is<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> lot<00:02:05.070> better<00:02:05.250> ok<00:02:05.580> hold<00:02:05.880> on

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
is a lot better ok hold on

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.750 
is a lot better ok hold on
so<00:02:06.420> let's<00:02:06.860> where's<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.040> circuit<00:02:08.369> special

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
so let's where's the circuit special

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.190 
so let's where's the circuit special
circuit<00:02:09.210> special<00:02:09.540> let's<00:02:09.660> go<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:09.930> wheels

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
circuit special let's go with wheels

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.040 
circuit special let's go with wheels
that<00:02:10.380> give<00:02:10.619> me<00:02:10.710> better<00:02:10.920> handling<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.810> best

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
that give me better handling the best

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.800 
that give me better handling the best
handler<00:02:13.290> I'm<00:02:13.410> gonna<00:02:13.530> get<00:02:13.680> her<00:02:13.770> like<00:02:13.950> these

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
handler I'm gonna get her like these

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.360 
handler I'm gonna get her like these
then<00:02:15.810> my<00:02:15.900> traction<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.500> still<00:02:16.710> craft<00:02:17.010> no<00:02:17.220> you

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
then my traction is still craft no you

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.880 
then my traction is still craft no you
know<00:02:17.460> what<00:02:17.610> screw<00:02:17.820> this<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:21.350> need<00:02:22.350> something<00:02:22.710> I

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
know what screw this I need something I

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.130 
know what screw this I need something I
need<00:02:23.070> something<00:02:23.460> good<00:02:23.640> here<00:02:24.060> I'm<00:02:24.870> gonna<00:02:24.960> stick

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
need something good here I'm gonna stick

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.720 
need something good here I'm gonna stick
with<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.290> sports<00:02:25.500> bike<00:02:25.740> forget<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:28.730> traction

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
with the sports bike forget it traction

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.170 
with the sports bike forget it traction
is<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:30.180> terrible<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:30.990> some<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.260> these<00:02:32.180> maybe
