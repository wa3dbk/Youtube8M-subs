underneath here to push it down flush
and<00:00:19.350> but<00:00:19.529> now<00:00:19.680> go<00:00:19.890> through<00:00:20.130> all<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> way

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
and but now go through all the way

and but now go through all the way
through<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.820> styrofoam<00:00:21.300> but<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
through the styrofoam but this is just a

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.019 
through the styrofoam but this is just a
quick<00:00:22.859> little<00:00:23.070> run-up<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.490> don't<00:00:23.670> have<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
quick little run-up I don't have the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.820 
quick little run-up I don't have the
other<00:00:24.119> speak<00:00:24.510> learner<00:00:24.840> speaker<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.439> parallel

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
other speak learner speaker in parallel

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.919 
other speak learner speaker in parallel
yet<00:00:26.119> but<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.869> quick<00:00:28.260> test<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929

see this one's working and this one's

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.280 
see this one's working and this one's
working<00:00:53.790> down<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.150> can<00:00:54.510> feel<00:00:54.540> it<00:00:54.809> baby<00:00:57.290> I'm

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
working down I can feel it baby I'm

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:25.360 
working down I can feel it baby I'm
gonna<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> real<00:00:58.830> nice<00:00:58.980> for<00:00:59.280> that

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.800 

he's<00:01:26.370> gonna<00:01:26.460> kick<00:01:26.820> by<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> time<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.660> all

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
over with you can see how this is the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.070 
over with you can see how this is the
TBS<00:01:32.250> micro<00:01:32.730> that<00:01:32.940> actually<00:01:33.480> has<00:01:33.660> a<00:01:33.690> sound

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
TBS micro that actually has a sound

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.340 
TBS micro that actually has a sound
stored<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.800> I<00:01:35.180> went<00:01:36.180> ahead<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.480> bought<00:01:37.050> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
stored on it I went ahead and bought the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.530 
stored on it I went ahead and bought the
USB<00:01:37.830> dongle<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.310> plugs<00:01:38.460> into<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.330> can

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
USB dongle that plugs into it so I can

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.160 
USB dongle that plugs into it so I can
programming<00:01:40.050> sound<00:01:40.410> into<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.800> I<00:01:40.830> want<00:01:42.170> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
programming sound into it I want the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.880 
programming sound into it I want the
amplifier<00:01:44.150> there<00:01:45.150> is<00:01:45.300> a<00:01:45.330> small<00:01:45.780> volume<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
amplifier there is a small volume on the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.740 
amplifier there is a small volume on the
amplifier<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.880> turn<00:01:48.120> that<00:01:48.360> changes

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
amplifier that can turn that changes

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.660 
amplifier that can turn that changes
your<00:01:48.900> volume<00:01:49.260> and<00:01:49.380> your<00:01:49.530> speaker's<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.550> got

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
your volume and your speaker's you got

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.980 
your volume and your speaker's you got
to<00:01:50.760> be<00:01:50.850> really<00:01:51.090> careful<00:01:51.510> that<00:01:51.540> when<00:01:51.840> you're

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
to be really careful that when you're

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.660 
to be really careful that when you're
tucking<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.950> testing<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.550> your

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
tucking this up and testing it that your

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.100 
tucking this up and testing it that your
speakers<00:01:53.910> are<00:01:54.180> turned<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:54.660> the<00:01:54.780> way<00:01:54.870> down

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
speakers are turned all the way down

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.670 
speakers are turned all the way down
that<00:01:55.979> way<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.160> don't<00:01:56.340> blow<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> speaker's<00:01:57.680> so

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
that way you don't blow the speaker's so

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.400 
that way you don't blow the speaker's so
anyway<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.370> the<00:01:59.610> volume<00:02:00.000> control<00:02:03.410> sure

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
anyway that's the volume control sure

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.140 
anyway that's the volume control sure
what<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.920> my<00:02:05.490> battery<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.850> getting<00:02:06.030> low

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
what that is my battery is getting low

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.880 
what that is my battery is getting low
so<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.110> anyway<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:07.410> wanted<00:02:07.800> to
