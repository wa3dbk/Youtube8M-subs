00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.000
 a spoon can be 2 cocoa powder 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.980
 you look to taste by color like you 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.900
 do you like if chocolate taste is strong 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:26.030
 can be more mixing process you 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.430
 see here the whole mass carefully 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.220
 mix until smooth consistency 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.680
 so that this dryness was not oil 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.520
 creamy she as it absorbs like this 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.480
 here is a cookie 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.760
 good tasty homogeneous mass 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.770
 I mix further because so here I want 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.770
 what else to add to this recipe 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:57.800
 I said that you need to drink 50 grams of oil 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.840
 further 70 80 here and condensed milk 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.720
 half a can of 400 grams of cookies 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.160
 get more for depend on cookies 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:12.209
 what it needs more condensed milk here 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.030
 I probably left condensed milk a little bit 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.400
 bottom left with me like this for 400 grams 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.570
 cookies because consistency should 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:28.830
 be sticky and have more oil somewhere 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:30.870
 Well, there is a pack, that is, you yourself 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.070
 You will see that this is the consistency 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.530
 was sticky 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.160
 not scattered see form 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.820
 it turns out the sausages are so sticky here 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:46.320
 and then I just added condensed milk there 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:54.800
 and oil so that it does not crumble into 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:54.800
 principle can and so we form 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.790
 when for everything 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.340
 that is, everything is done on 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.370
 on feeling sticky 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.579
 when you cook it yourself 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.579
 I feel you can get a bet 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.780
