00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello friends I do not have friends forgiveness and today 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.010
 I'm going to tell you 10 curiosities about 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.910
 bunny the rabbit of fighting sat phoenix 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.910
 well let's start 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.550
 as done number 10 we will see that 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.710
 Bunny has his red eyes sometimes and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.660
 whites sometimes you'll think it's the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.939
 light but a moment boom and quini light 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.860
 white whenever we illuminate it but in 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.630
 the central aisle when we see him 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.670
 can see that he has red eyes to 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.530
 Despite our white light it also 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.750
 can see in the game menu that without 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.670
 light also has whites what we 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.640
 it gives to think that bunny is one of the most 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.500
 sinister others as done number 9 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.540
 we have that scott did the first to 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.489
 bunny and when I was doing it he saw 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.350
 that boom and it had appeared on his face 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.630
 when he should not be there so 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.820
 he thought he had good material besides in 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.980
 the trailer can be seen as a boom and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.170
 he runs out as if he were fox and but 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.989
 at the last minute decided to change it by foxx 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.059
 and what is interesting and in fact the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.190
 idea of the game came out of when boom and it 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.180
 put him in the face so this is one 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.550
 of the best games created by books 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.620
 in fact number 8 we have to bunny 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.110
 It's Freddy I mean they have the same 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.090
 body only with sheep and with eyebrows that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.740
 also if in the second game boom and 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.780
 had the face of freddy but blue 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.700
 it would be boom and the first game since they are 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.860
 practically the same and that shows 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.690
 that scott with a small change can 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.729
 do awesome things 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.550
 congratulations scott for making these games 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.770
 so cool in the aero 7 boom and in the 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.930
 4 night when it is in the camera more 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.880
 close to the office this one starts at 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.280
 grumir and move the head in a weird way 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.990
 same as girl and it is said that it is the boy 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.180
 who lives in burnley and who is 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.280
 trying to get out of there that reason is 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.690
 unknown but perhaps motivated by the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.729
 animation sounds and cause that 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.229
 appear on the call when the uncle of 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.899
 phone dies and remember what 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.820
 traumatized that are some say 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.280
 which is because of the sound box that has 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.140
 but the truth sounds very human so 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.240
 it is also believed to be the voice of the soul 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.180
 of the child who owned a boom and after 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.910
 have been inside this in the number 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.009
 6 we have to bulnes the animatronic that 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.179
 has been in more hallucinations then in 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.340
 the first game 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.300
 x-men in the scenes of the second game 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.220
 between levels 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.650
 and that's because it 's the one that scares the most 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.450
 as now we will go to my mother how many 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.250
 children must have had nightmares 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.980
 play squash 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.260
 in fact number 5 I will comment that 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.390
 while scott towards the game mentioned 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.220
 that the one who was most afraid would come and that 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.440
 it's mainly because he does not have 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.870
 eyebrows so after having multiple 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.150
 nightmares with him put a screen of 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.130
 the death of bunny but without eyes so 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.310
 despite being the easiest is the one that 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.470
 more fear gives wild in this number 4 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.510
 we have that in the trailer you can see 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.610
 bunny running down the hall instead of 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.560
 fox and maybe it will be because then he changed it 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.290
 also for its artificial intelligence 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.810
 which is very simple, surely that's 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.910
 but it is also said that maybe that was 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.739
 to hide foxy from the public which 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.050
 would make the game more interesting and 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.820
 mysterious equally who never 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.060
 I would have liked a boom and running 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.560
 the hall hahaha in fact number 3 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.540
 we have to boom and it's possibly 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.880
 based on an animatronic or a 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.010
 pizzeria really made kichis based 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.900
 in mons the animatronic or blue that has 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.790
 almost the same body as boom and that 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.100
 It also makes the game something more 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.930
 famous since it seems that in the USA 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.870
 children had their childhoods in that 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.390
 pizzeria lou as fact number 2 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.130
 we have a rumor of the 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.230
 because in the first game on the bass 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.150
 text where the masks are going 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.490
 skeletons boom and has no ears and 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.230
 they think a lot of things about him but 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.180
 actually boom and in the second game 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.410
 he does not have his mask or face and he continues 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.600
 having ears 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.850
 so relaxed lol 2 world like 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.800
 last fact we have that I'm up to the 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.690
 noses that some people are still 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.520
 believing that boom and is small but not the 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.800
 animatronic or not but it is a girl 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.959
 but it really is only because it is 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.450
 purple but if Scott caution already said that 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.250
 I was not a girl I was a boy and it's very obvious 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.040
 so at least or tried but 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.319
 calm nobody will dominate the world 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.879
 Well, here I say goodbye, I hope that I have 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.159
 liked please if you liked 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.140
 subscribe please that would motivate me 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.609
 a lot to keep doing more than I suppose 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.859
 that if you've reached the end you've 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.629
 I know that this is typical but in 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.140
 serious lay that helps so good chau 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.620
 bay 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.620
 right chau
