00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:09.870
 let me show you in part 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:16.170
 solve the problem of this button which 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.900
 we are very uncomfortable for older people 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.630
 generations here it is the input button 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.619
 a signal that is, many encountered 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.480
 the problem is that we press this button and 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:36.000
 let's have two receivers here 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:41.430
 my remote but the exit button and see what 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.800
 we have changed the output now I have to 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.379
 this was the time now running through 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.559
 bells to go back need 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.629
 press the output signal again 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:56.660
 after that our image will come back 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.640
 on with dima 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.489
 plus 3 north these braked and very 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.799
 switches long so here it is only 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.229
 switched now you have to press input 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.320
 signal 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.180
 now on the right is on 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.790
 left 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.830

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.460
 30 seconds reboot image 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.799
 began 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.740
 I often come across the same 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.140
 people a month or two press 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.659
 This button does not know what to do 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.670
 partly out of position 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.900
 using the remote from the old essay 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:38.000
 me there is a receiver 45 2 0 and this is 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.040

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.560

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.689

 that in the rain past us all is connected 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.780
 it works that is the difference in this remote 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.390
 is that if we used it new 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.810

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:18.239
