00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
I think the Dutch Shepherd combined all

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.100 
I think the Dutch Shepherd combined all
the<00:01:32.250> best<00:01:32.610> traits<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> different

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the best traits of all the different

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.969 
the best traits of all the different
styles<00:01:35.509> he<00:01:36.509> hurled<00:01:36.869> himself<00:01:37.049> there<00:01:37.770> for

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
styles he hurled himself there for

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.340 
styles he hurled himself there for
getting<00:01:38.250> momentum<00:01:38.420> he<00:01:39.420> opened<00:01:39.840> his<00:01:39.929> mouth<00:01:40.079> as

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
getting momentum he opened his mouth as

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.080 
getting momentum he opened his mouth as
wide<00:01:40.590> as<00:01:40.799> he<00:01:40.890> could<00:01:41.069> similar<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> Malinois

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
wide as he could similar to the Malinois

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.200 
wide as he could similar to the Malinois
got<00:01:42.929> that<00:01:43.140> good<00:01:43.409> solid<00:01:43.710> bite<00:01:44.159> his<00:01:44.880> weight

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
got that good solid bite his weight
