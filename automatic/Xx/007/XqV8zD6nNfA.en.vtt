but let's get started first off we're
going<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.950> be<00:02:32.100> making<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.940> cutout<00:02:33.420> for<00:02:33.810> the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
going to be making the cutout for the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.960 
going to be making the cutout for the
cup<00:02:34.710> of<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.920> Frappuccino

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
cup of the Frappuccino

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.020 
cup of the Frappuccino
it's<00:02:36.090> basically<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:37.200> shape<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.160> trapezoid<00:02:38.790> I

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
it's basically a shape of a trapezoid I

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.790 
it's basically a shape of a trapezoid I
have<00:02:39.360> measurements<00:02:40.020> here<00:02:40.170> if<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.470> guys<00:02:40.620> are

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
have measurements here if you guys are

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.430 
have measurements here if you guys are
interested<00:02:41.150> but<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.330> just<00:02:42.510> made<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> cutout<00:02:43.080> to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
interested but I just made a cutout to

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.410 
interested but I just made a cutout to
kind<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.830> make<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.340> lot<00:02:44.550> easier<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:45.270> can

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
kind of make it a lot easier you can

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.610 
kind of make it a lot easier you can
also<00:02:45.890> freehand<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.040> on<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.700> fabric<00:02:48.330> and

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
also freehand it on the fabric and

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.930 
also freehand it on the fabric and
you're<00:02:49.620> going<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.950> fold<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.310> fabric<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:50.910> that

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
you're going to fold the fabric so that

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.210 
you're going to fold the fabric so that
the<00:02:51.090> wrong<00:02:51.270> side<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:52.050> facing<00:02:52.590> upwards<00:02:53.010> and

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
the wrong side is facing upwards and

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.699 
the wrong side is facing upwards and
you're<00:02:53.400> going<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.700> trace<00:02:54.000> around<00:02:54.050> your<00:02:55.050> cutout

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
you're going to trace around your cutout

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.430 
you're going to trace around your cutout
and<00:02:55.950> then<00:02:56.280> you're<00:02:56.430> going<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.790> cut<00:02:57.360> out<00:02:57.570> the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
and then you're going to cut out the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.370 
and then you're going to cut out the
shape<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.100> trapezoid<00:02:59.989> next<00:03:00.989> we're<00:03:01.170> going

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
shape of the trapezoid next we're going

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.270 
shape of the trapezoid next we're going
to<00:03:01.470> use<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:02.160> cup<00:03:02.580> cutout<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.470> basically<00:03:04.470> draw

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
to use the cup cutout to basically draw

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.360 
to use the cup cutout to basically draw

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.300 
fold it and glue it like so and then I'm
kind<00:04:11.070> of<00:04:11.280> struggling<00:04:11.670> here<00:04:12.269> but<00:04:12.930> just<00:04:13.769> patting

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
kind of struggling here but just patting

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.300 
kind of struggling here but just patting
it<00:04:14.400> down<00:04:14.430> as<00:04:14.820> I<00:04:14.970> go<00:04:15.150> along<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:15.780> then<00:04:16.350> turning

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
it down as I go along and then turning

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.909 
it down as I go along and then turning
it<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.579> the<00:04:17.729> side<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.329> am<00:04:18.540> going<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:19.109> glue<00:04:19.890> down

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
it to the side I am going to glue down

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.680 
it to the side I am going to glue down
this<00:04:20.489> flap<00:04:20.910> area<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:23.000> make<00:04:24.000> sure<00:04:24.210> you<00:04:24.390> guys

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
this flap area and make sure you guys

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.500 
this flap area and make sure you guys
work<00:04:25.110> quickly<00:04:25.590> because<00:04:26.070> glue<00:04:26.400> dries<00:04:26.820> really

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
work quickly because glue dries really

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.130 
work quickly because glue dries really
really<00:04:28.110> really<00:04:28.410> quick<00:04:28.760> so<00:04:29.760> I'm<00:04:30.180> just<00:04:30.780> going<00:04:31.080> to

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
really really quick so I'm just going to

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.960 
really really quick so I'm just going to
fold<00:04:31.380> it<00:04:31.560> down<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:32.130> make<00:04:32.280> sure<00:04:32.400> that<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.760> glue

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
fold it down and make sure that the glue

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.270 
fold it down and make sure that the glue
you<00:04:33.120> know<00:04:33.570> just<00:04:33.930> basically<00:04:34.500> glue<00:04:34.979> and<00:04:35.220> then

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
you know just basically glue and then

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.060 
you know just basically glue and then
I'm<00:04:35.460> going<00:04:35.669> to<00:04:35.790> roll<00:04:36.330> this<00:04:36.660> section<00:04:37.590> up<00:04:37.830> and

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
I'm going to roll this section up and

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.339 
I'm going to roll this section up and
then<00:04:38.190> once<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:38.820> feel<00:04:39.120> like<00:04:39.180> it's<00:04:39.750> thick

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
then once you feel like it's thick

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.160 
then once you feel like it's thick
enough<00:04:40.380> for<00:04:41.039> a<00:04:41.070> strong

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
enough for a strong

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.080 
enough for a strong
hot<00:04:43.170> glue<00:04:43.440> gun<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.830> down<00:04:44.040> and<00:04:44.370> then<00:04:44.580> you're

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
hot glue gun it down and then you're

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.020 
hot glue gun it down and then you're
going<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.710> basically<00:04:46.710> push<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.490> straw<00:04:47.790> down

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
going to basically push that straw down

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.070 
going to basically push that straw down
and<00:04:48.420> then<00:04:48.570> cut<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.200> excess<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:50.810> then<00:04:51.810> here<00:04:52.020> I

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
and then cut the excess and then here I

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.440 
and then cut the excess and then here I
went<00:04:52.290> back<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:52.740> glue<00:04:53.550> it<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:53.850> basically

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
went back and glue it to basically

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.630 
went back and glue it to basically
secure<00:04:55.080> everything<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.770> that's<00:04:56.280> what<00:04:56.430> it

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
secure everything and that's what it

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.210 
secure everything and that's what it
looks<00:04:56.670> like<00:04:57.090> and<00:04:57.390> then<00:04:58.110> next<00:04:58.350> we're<00:04:58.650> going<00:04:58.950> to

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
looks like and then next we're going to

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.690 
looks like and then next we're going to
basically<00:04:59.610> sandwich<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:01.020> cup<00:05:01.320> in<00:05:01.700> between

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
basically sandwich the cup in between

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.810 
basically sandwich the cup in between
the<00:05:03.180> whipped<00:05:04.140> cream<00:05:04.470> if<00:05:04.710> that<00:05:04.980> makes<00:05:05.190> sense

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
the whipped cream if that makes sense

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.230 
the whipped cream if that makes sense
so<00:05:06.420> this<00:05:06.660> is<00:05:06.870> what<00:05:07.110> I'm<00:05:07.380> doing<00:05:07.890> and<00:05:08.820> putting<00:05:09.060> it

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
so this is what I'm doing and putting it

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.390 
so this is what I'm doing and putting it
down<00:05:09.270> and<00:05:09.750> make<00:05:09.900> sure<00:05:09.930> that<00:05:10.290> it<00:05:10.560> um<00:05:10.830> it's

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
down and make sure that it um it's

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.660 
down and make sure that it um it's
nicely<00:05:12.030> petted<00:05:12.600> down<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.260> then<00:05:13.470> once<00:05:14.370> you're

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
nicely petted down and then once you're

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.190 
nicely petted down and then once you're
happy<00:05:15.120> with<00:05:15.300> that<00:05:15.360> we're<00:05:15.720> going<00:05:15.810> to<00:05:15.870> start

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
happy with that we're going to start

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.720 
happy with that we're going to start
gluing<00:05:16.740> down<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:18.000> flap<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.660> one<00:05:18.840> inch

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
gluing down the the flap the one inch

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.390 
gluing down the the flap the one inch
allowance<00:05:20.730> flap<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:21.510> basically<00:05:22.500> hot<00:05:23.130> glue

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
allowance flap and basically hot glue

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.730 
allowance flap and basically hot glue
gunning<00:05:23.610> everything<00:05:24.180> down<00:05:24.420> and<00:05:24.690> let<00:05:25.140> me<00:05:25.260> kind

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
gunning everything down and let me kind

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.110 
gunning everything down and let me kind
of<00:05:25.860> give<00:05:26.100> you<00:05:26.190> guys<00:05:26.250> a<00:05:26.370> warning<00:05:26.790> it's<00:05:26.910> going<00:05:27.060> to

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
of give you guys a warning it's going to

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.450 
of give you guys a warning it's going to
be<00:05:27.210> a<00:05:27.240> lot<00:05:27.690> of<00:05:27.720> glue<00:05:28.260> I<00:05:28.290> know<00:05:28.470> you're<00:05:29.160> going<00:05:29.370> to

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
be a lot of glue I know you're going to

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.660 
be a lot of glue I know you're going to
use<00:05:29.640> a<00:05:29.850> lot<00:05:30.180> of<00:05:30.210> glue<00:05:30.660> and<00:05:31.020> then<00:05:31.830> we're

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
use a lot of glue and then we're

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.550 
use a lot of glue and then we're
basically<00:05:32.940> going<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.480> secure<00:05:33.930> everything<00:05:34.290> and

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
basically going to secure everything and

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.140 
basically going to secure everything and
make<00:05:34.740> sure<00:05:34.890> that<00:05:35.100> everything<00:05:35.730> is<00:05:35.850> glue

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
make sure that everything is glue

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.260 
make sure that everything is glue
correctly<00:05:36.720> and<00:05:36.960> then<00:05:37.470> we're<00:05:37.620> going<00:05:37.830> to

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
correctly and then we're going to

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.300 
correctly and then we're going to
basically<00:05:39.270> glue<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:40.140> sides<00:05:40.410> down<00:05:41.870> and<00:05:43.310> just

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
basically glue the sides down and just

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.260 
basically glue the sides down and just
you<00:05:44.550> know<00:05:44.940> just<00:05:45.360> continue<00:05:45.510> gluing<00:05:46.200> and<00:05:47.270> you're

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
you know just continue gluing and you're

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.640 
you know just continue gluing and you're
going<00:05:48.390> to<00:05:48.420> have<00:05:48.600> to<00:05:48.720> work<00:05:48.930> quickly<00:05:49.230> because

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
going to have to work quickly because

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.890 
going to have to work quickly because
the<00:05:49.830> glue<00:05:50.040> dries<00:05:50.370> really<00:05:50.910> really<00:05:51.330> fast<00:05:51.570> and

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
the glue dries really really fast and

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.330 
the glue dries really really fast and
then<00:05:52.020> you're<00:05:52.200> going<00:05:52.290> to<00:05:52.350> have<00:05:52.500> to<00:05:52.620> go<00:05:52.770> back<00:05:53.100> and

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
then you're going to have to go back and

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.040 
then you're going to have to go back and
make<00:05:53.520> sure<00:05:53.670> that<00:05:53.910> everything<00:05:54.570> is<00:05:54.720> glue

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
make sure that everything is glue

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.490 
make sure that everything is glue
securely<00:05:56.120> and<00:05:57.120> just<00:05:57.480> making<00:05:57.660> my<00:05:57.900> way<00:05:58.140> to<00:05:58.200> the

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
securely and just making my way to the

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.820 
securely and just making my way to the
whipped<00:05:58.740> cream<00:05:59.160> and<00:06:00.140> patting<00:06:01.140> it<00:06:01.230> down<00:06:01.470> so

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
whipped cream and patting it down so

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.560 
whipped cream and patting it down so
make<00:06:01.980> sure<00:06:02.010> you<00:06:02.490> guys<00:06:02.640> Pat<00:06:02.970> it<00:06:03.090> down<00:06:03.240> as<00:06:03.450> you

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
make sure you guys Pat it down as you

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.810 
make sure you guys Pat it down as you
guys<00:06:03.720> go<00:06:03.960> along<00:06:04.290> and<00:06:04.560> then<00:06:05.100> I<00:06:05.130> left<00:06:05.460> a<00:06:05.610> little

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
guys go along and then I left a little

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.090 
guys go along and then I left a little
opening<00:06:06.390> right<00:06:06.540> here<00:06:06.710> just<00:06:07.710> so<00:06:07.890> I<00:06:07.919> can

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
opening right here just so I can

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.240 
opening right here just so I can
basically<00:06:09.000> put<00:06:09.510> my<00:06:10.110> hand<00:06:10.320> through<00:06:10.650> and<00:06:10.950> then

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
basically put my hand through and then

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.000 
basically put my hand through and then
grab<00:06:12.060> the<00:06:12.090> inside<00:06:12.720> and<00:06:13.050> work<00:06:13.230> enough<00:06:13.530> folded

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
grab the inside and work enough folded

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.360 
grab the inside and work enough folded

that the right the right way is
basically<00:06:21.210> facing<00:06:21.600> out<00:06:22.020> now<00:06:22.260> if<00:06:22.590> that<00:06:22.770> makes

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
basically facing out now if that makes

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.280 
basically facing out now if that makes
sense<00:06:23.180> and<00:06:24.380> you<00:06:25.380> know<00:06:25.560> just<00:06:25.860> until<00:06:27.290> basically
