00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.079
 fracture resolved his depressive 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.829
 the situation that is breaking his arm as if 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:56.340
 paid tribute to oppressing his psyche 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.180
 forces, he kind of calculated that 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.120
 pressure on not 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.510
