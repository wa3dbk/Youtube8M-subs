00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.799
 hello everyone and welcome once more to 

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:08.570
 my channel in today's video I come to 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.070
 teach this look that as you can see is super 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.470
 natural and it's perfect to take it to 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.910
 daily I focused a little bit of input 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.380
 about the tan now that in 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.810
 spring we all want to look more 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.920
 morenito and nothing is super easy so 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.080
 If you want to see how it's done, follow 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.360
 Attentive to the video, let's start with nothing 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.220
 on the skin and we are going to apply a tonic 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.650
 cleaner especially if you have the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.090
 skin a bit greasy with it then 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.500
 let's apply a pse test for everything 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.329
 the face so that our skin is 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.380
 much softer and hydrated and the 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.380
 makeup lasts longer 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.149
 then we will use a concealer a 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.500
 lighter shade than our skin to 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.500
 correct any imperfection 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.010
 and we're going to apply a base for all 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.080
 face I have chosen one of a tone a 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.000
 little darker than my skin because 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.160
 I just want my skin to look like 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.660
 more brunette but if you are already brown 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.660
 you can use one of your color 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.880
 then we correct any 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.900
 imperfection that remains with the same 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.000
 front corrector 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.320
 and we are going to apply for the translucent boss 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.690
 all over the face to fix the 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.700
 makeup like that is also matt and fica 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.170
 We base a little bit because it's that I 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.540
 I used to usually leave a bit of 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.130
 shine you can use a brush more 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.300
 small for more difficult areas of 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.300
 do as under the eye 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.520
 then let's comb the eyebrows 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.480
 We are going to outline it with a pencil 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.480
 eyebrows of our color 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.990
 and we are going to apply a shadow of eyebrows 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.990
 to fill it 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.780
 then we brush it again to 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.460
 remove excess shadows and 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.460
 We fix with an eyebrow fixing gel 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.989
 then we are going to apply a shadow on 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.989
 nude tones all over the mobile eyelid 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.110
 and then another shadow of a brown one 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.260
 little bit darker in the areas of the 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.260
 basin 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.310
 and we are going to blur it with a brush 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.489
 loose 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.709
 to the same brown shadow we are going to 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.959
 delineate the lower part of the eye by 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.590
 under the tabs but only the 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.590
 outside part 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.200
 then we apply a clearer shadow 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.200
 to illuminate the lacrimal area 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.810
 and then with a shade of a very brown 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.030
 dark let's make a small 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.030
 delineated by the external top 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.960
 then let's curl the lashes 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.540
 and we are going to apply a mask of 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.969
 eyelashes to me I love using this 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.469
 to define astor because it gives a 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.510
 super natural result that comes to us 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:25.599
 great for this look 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.599
 to 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.540
 ah 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.590
 ah 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.760
 ah 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.799
 we will proceed to apply the 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.410
 bronzer that the most important thing in this 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.360
 look 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.010
 we apply it all over the face but 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.350
 with special emphasis on the areas 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.570
 where the sun would shine like the cheekbones 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.920
 the forehead the nose or the chin also 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.920
 you can use it to contour 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.800
 and now let's outline with a tone 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.800
 brown below the cheekbones 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.420
 around the front side 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.420
 chin and on the temple 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.970
 let's apply a little rouge 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.920
 in a peach tone 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.390
 also by the forehead the nose and the 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.720
 chin to make it look like it has not 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.720
 Sun 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.140
 ah 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.780
 and then with an illuminator we're going to give a 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.910
 little light below the eyes in the 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.150
 in front of the chin on the cheekbones of the 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.150
 nose 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.590
 and then we're going to apply an illuminator 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.880
 with a little bit of shine on the cheekbones 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.360
 so that our skin looks much more 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.360
 juicy 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.340
 and our fight is over I have 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:12.129
 used a gloss of a very tone 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.430
 natural a little peach to finish 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:14.430
 the look 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.690
 but it also looks beautiful with 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.690
 Red lipstick 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.250
 ah 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.979
