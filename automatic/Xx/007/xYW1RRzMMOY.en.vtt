00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
around the idea in this case it was this

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.600 
around the idea in this case it was this
amazing<00:01:42.960> ship<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.770> was<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.100> first<00:01:44.370> to<00:01:44.490> ever

reach the North Pole course in a few
years<00:01:46.229> from<00:01:46.409> now<00:01:46.560> we'll<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.770> able<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.250> that

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
years from now we'll be able to do that

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.770 
years from now we'll be able to do that
in<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.610> motorboat<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.450> take<00:01:48.600> our

suntan lotion with us but back in the
70s<00:01:50.790> when<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.450> thing<00:01:51.690> broke<00:01:51.930> through<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
70s when this thing broke through the

70s when this thing broke through the
ice<00:01:53.390> this<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.690> know<00:01:54.780> that's<00:01:55.049> what<00:01:55.260> this<00:01:55.380> is

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
ice this you know that's what this is

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.050 
ice this you know that's what this is
nature<00:01:55.950> that's<00:01:56.070> why<00:01:56.220> you<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> anchor

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
nature that's why you see the anchor

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.880 
nature that's why you see the anchor
that's<00:01:57.299> why<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.510> see<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> waves<00:01:58.260> on<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.650> dial

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that's why you see the waves on the dial

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.370 
that's why you see the waves on the dial
and<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.250> forth<00:01:59.549> and<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.760> case<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
and so forth and it is the case the the

and so forth and it is the case the the
bracelet<00:02:04.979> everything<00:02:05.640> was<00:02:05.909> built<00:02:06.240> around

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
bracelet everything was built around

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.300 
bracelet everything was built around
this<00:02:07.619> theme<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:09.810> when<00:02:10.110> when<00:02:10.470> we're<00:02:11.160> talking

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
this theme so when when we're talking

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.920 
this theme so when when we're talking
about<00:02:11.550> things<00:02:11.819> one<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.240> things<00:02:12.480> they<00:02:12.720> not

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
about things one of the things they not

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.150 
about things one of the things they not
all<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.140> speak<00:02:13.319> in<00:02:13.440> general<00:02:13.709> terms<00:02:13.830> at<00:02:14.010> this

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
all to speak in general terms at this

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.840 
all to speak in general terms at this
point<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.700> I

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
point that I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.820 
point that I
admired<00:02:16.180> about<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.570> Russian<00:02:16.840> pieces<00:02:17.170> pretty

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
admired about the Russian pieces pretty

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.740 
admired about the Russian pieces pretty
much<00:02:17.980> since<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.250> first<00:02:18.430> began<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.820> study<00:02:19.420> that

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
much since I first began to study that

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.230 
much since I first began to study that
and<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:20.050> was<00:02:20.170> certainly<00:02:20.470> brought<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.890> bear

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
and it was certainly brought to bear

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
and it was certainly brought to bear
when<00:02:22.240> you<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.600> had<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.810> chance<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.230> visit

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
when you and I had a chance to visit

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.220 
when you and I had a chance to visit
right<00:02:23.950> together<00:02:24.670> we<00:02:24.940> actually<00:02:25.600> started<00:02:26.080> in

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
right together we actually started in

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.280 
right together we actually started in
Moscow<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:26.740> so<00:02:26.950> on<00:02:27.070> is<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:28.360> they<00:02:29.230> do

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
Moscow and so on is that they do

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.230 
Moscow and so on is that they do
something<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:29.980> I'm<00:02:30.100> not<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.550> do<00:02:30.670> with<00:02:31.030> any

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
something that I'm not to do with any

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.680 
something that I'm not to do with any
other<00:02:31.480> concept<00:02:32.290> or<00:02:33.030> culture<00:02:34.030> really<00:02:34.210> doing

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
other concept or culture really doing

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.570 
other concept or culture really doing
whether<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.080> wristwatches<00:02:35.470> whereas<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.370> think

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
whether the wristwatches whereas I think

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.400 
whether the wristwatches whereas I think
most<00:02:37.030> companies<00:02:37.210> build<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.900> watch<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.320> then

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
most companies build a watch and then

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.350 
most companies build a watch and then
they<00:02:38.530> go<00:02:38.560> that's<00:02:38.860> cool<00:02:39.070> is<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.430> name<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.150> thing

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
they go that's cool is a name the thing

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.240 
they go that's cool is a name the thing
right<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.230> Russians<00:02:41.590> do<00:02:41.680> exactly<00:02:41.980> the

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
right and the Russians do exactly the

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.830 
right and the Russians do exactly the
opposite<00:02:42.670> they<00:02:42.880> have<00:02:43.000> their<00:02:43.120> inspiration<00:02:43.690> in

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
opposite they have their inspiration in

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.900 
opposite they have their inspiration in
this<00:02:43.960> case<00:02:44.140> it's<00:02:44.500> going<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.800> be<00:02:44.920> the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
this case it's going to be the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.480 
this case it's going to be the
or<00:02:46.450> have<00:02:46.600> your<00:02:46.750> rocket<00:02:47.500> or<00:02:47.590> whatever<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.040> then

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
or have your rocket or whatever and then

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.980 
or have your rocket or whatever and then
they<00:02:48.580> go<00:02:48.610> let's<00:02:49.150> build<00:02:49.510> something<00:02:49.810> that

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
they go let's build something that

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.260 
they go let's build something that
honors<00:02:50.470> but<00:02:50.920> honors<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.460> object<00:02:51.850> right<00:02:52.060> and

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
honors but honors the object right and

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.360 
honors but honors the object right and
they<00:02:52.390> they<00:02:52.780> they<00:02:52.930> start<00:02:53.560> with<00:02:53.710> the<00:02:53.800> idea<00:02:54.130> and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
they they they start with the idea and

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.160 
they they they start with the idea and
then<00:02:54.520> they<00:02:54.700> completely<00:02:55.240> design<00:02:55.690> around<00:02:55.990> it

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
then they completely design around it

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.470 
then they completely design around it
and<00:02:56.380> again<00:02:57.010> every<00:02:57.490> component<00:02:57.910> you're<00:02:58.180> looking

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
and again every component you're looking

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.090 
and again every component you're looking
at<00:02:58.600> there's<00:02:58.780> nothing<00:02:59.170> here<00:02:59.440> that's<00:02:59.650> off<00:02:59.890> the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
at there's nothing here that's off the

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.770 
at there's nothing here that's off the
shelf<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.910> know<00:03:01.030> they<00:03:01.150> don't<00:03:01.270> they<00:03:01.390> don't<00:03:01.510> go

shelf you know they don't they don't go

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.270 
shelf you know they don't they don't go
