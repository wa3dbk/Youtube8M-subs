00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
hard time with this one yeah this is an

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.300 
hard time with this one yeah this is an
enthusiast<00:00:25.109> system<00:00:25.529> that's<00:00:25.680> built<00:00:25.830> am<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
enthusiast system that's built am I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.890 
enthusiast system that's built am I
firmware<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:26.760> kind<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.029> an<00:00:27.150> extreme<00:00:27.449> system

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
firmware it's kind of an extreme system

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.720 
firmware it's kind of an extreme system
but<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.260> last<00:00:28.500> time<00:00:28.740> i<00:00:28.800> did<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.039> boot<00:00:29.279> demo<00:00:29.519> was

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
but the last time i did a boot demo was

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.849 
but the last time i did a boot demo was
when<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:29.970> launched<00:00:30.269> windows<00:00:30.539> 7<00:00:30.929> we<00:00:31.529> had<00:00:31.710> an

when we launched windows 7 we had an

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.819 
when we launched windows 7 we had an

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
acer that booted in 15 votes it's almost

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.500 
acer that booted in 15 votes it's almost
faster<00:00:35.430> than<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.610> monitor<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.149> turn<00:00:36.329> on

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510

graphics<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.640> love<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.910> thing<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.210> is

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.599 
graphics that I love this thing this is
great<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.079> ice<00:00:58.260> over<00:00:58.559> here<00:00:58.739> it's

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
great this is like ice over here it's

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.700 
great this is like ice over here it's
not<00:00:59.879> like<00:01:00.059> Isis<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.629> lava<00:01:01.050> actually<00:01:01.680> I

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
not like Isis like lava actually I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.680 
not like Isis like lava actually I
thought<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.460> what<00:01:02.609> i<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.059> i<00:01:03.149> am<00:01:03.270> 3

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
graphics but what's really important

Windows<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:33.020> because<00:02:33.680> DX<00:02:34.040> hardware<00:02:34.459> so

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
Windows a is because DX hardware so

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.180 
Windows a is because DX hardware so
prevalent<00:02:34.910> in<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.209> entire<00:02:35.870> ecosystem<00:02:36.770> we

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
prevalent in the entire ecosystem we

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.280 
prevalent in the entire ecosystem we
built<00:02:37.459> all<00:02:37.610> of<00:02:37.670> windows<00:02:38.360> 8<00:02:38.540> on<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.780> hardware

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
built all of windows 8 on a hardware

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.229 
built all of windows 8 on a hardware
accelerated<00:02:39.769> graphics<00:02:40.010> platform<00:02:40.400> so<00:02:41.120> the

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
accelerated graphics platform so the

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.240 
accelerated graphics platform so the
reason<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.810> UI<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.170> fast<00:02:42.590> across<00:02:42.980> this

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
reason that the UI is fast across this

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.040 
reason that the UI is fast across this
whole<00:02:43.489> line<00:02:43.670> is<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:44.000> everything<00:02:44.420> has

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
whole line is that everything has

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.990 
whole line is that everything has
hardware<00:02:45.440> accelerated<00:02:45.920> graphics<00:02:46.190> including

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
hardware accelerated graphics including

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.150 
hardware accelerated graphics including
the<00:02:47.090> apps<00:02:47.269> so<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.019> write<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.260> metro<00:02:48.620> style<00:02:48.860> app

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
the apps so you write a metro style app

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.610 
the apps so you write a metro style app
it's<00:02:49.700> got<00:02:49.970> graphic<00:02:50.690> by<00:02:50.840> all<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.170> transitions

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
it's got graphic by all the transitions

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.289 
it's got graphic by all the transitions
all<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.130> graphics<00:02:52.340> all<00:02:52.670> hardware<00:02:53.060> it's<00:02:53.150> utter

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
all the graphics all hardware it's utter

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.479 
all the graphics all hardware it's utter
yet<00:02:53.630> which<00:02:53.750> we<00:02:53.870> started<00:02:54.080> in<00:02:54.410> ie9<00:02:54.650> yeah<00:02:55.310> and

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
yet which we started in ie9 yeah and

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.550 
yet which we started in ie9 yeah and
really<00:02:55.760> baking<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.330> into<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.750> platform<00:02:57.410> at

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
really baking that into the platform at

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.289 
really baking that into the platform at
the<00:02:57.950> native<00:02:58.310> poet<00:02:58.610> I<00:02:58.700> think<00:02:58.880> they<00:02:58.940> like<00:02:59.090> that

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
the native poet I think they like that

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.479 
the native poet I think they like that
sounds<00:03:00.019> good<00:03:00.170> hardware<00:03:01.069> accelerated

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
sounds good hardware accelerated

the things you might notice across all

the things you might notice across all
of<00:03:17.540> these<00:03:17.690> displays<00:03:18.260> is<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.980> they've<00:03:19.130> got
