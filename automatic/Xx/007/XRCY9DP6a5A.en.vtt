here and as I mentioned earlier I'm not
really<00:02:27.010> too<00:02:27.280> fussed<00:02:27.580> whether<00:02:27.849> or<00:02:28.030> not<00:02:28.209> we<00:02:28.330> have

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
really too fussed whether or not we have

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.970 
really too fussed whether or not we have
the<00:02:28.540> option<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.110> play<00:02:29.290> as<00:02:29.319> a<00:02:29.440> female<00:02:29.709> character

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
but at the same time I think it would

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.479 
but at the same time I think it would
have<00:02:32.260> been<00:02:32.379> pretty<00:02:32.560> cool<00:02:32.709> as<00:02:33.010> well<00:02:33.220> but<00:02:33.400> of

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
have been pretty cool as well but of

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.430 
have been pretty cool as well but of
course<00:02:33.670> this<00:02:33.879> is<00:02:34.030> just<00:02:34.060> my<00:02:34.269> opinion<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:35.019> love<00:02:35.319> to
