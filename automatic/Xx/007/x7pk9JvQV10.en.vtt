00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.849
 madonna sting and i 'm a jack of hearts e 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.500
 welcome this new video we are here 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.689
 today with a video analysis like any 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.460
 Tuesday and today we will talk about the half rics 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.259
 that other weapon we had made 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.329
 choose the old survey and that 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.849
 alas for one vote was not 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.099
 elected as a weapon of the old survey 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.320
 okay it's not important anyway how 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.360
 always up to date on our page 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.610
 facebook because from there we will put them 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.170
 declared surveys for new videos na 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.240
 there that as I had already said in the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.380
 previous video will change slightly 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.850
 so we will no longer deal with a weapon 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.980
 single but we will deal with the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.260
 weapons in two or three trying to understand 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.970
 immediately which are the strongest weapons and 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.200
 how to use them said this not 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.239
 let us dwell too long 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.160
 pissed off and we talk about this am tariq 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.530
 soft as the description says should 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.970
 be a submachine gun that 's nearby 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.920
 to the characteristics of a rifle 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.460
 of assault when it is not for nothing 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.439
 true 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.790
 apart from the charger that does not get tired 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.659
 never in fact the animation is made the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.040
 fucking dog 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.679
 so much so that they can't see it right 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.819
 to emphasize the things that are here 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:14.369
 could be fine 

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:16.649
 the air mentalix boys to damage and one 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.270
 scope less than the network and how 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.609
 we always repeat it is the machine gun 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.009
 stronger than the game 's 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:25.139
 medallions from stronger and therefore the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.280
 description is essentially bullshit 

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:28.570
 the damage is less 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.369
 the network is therefore a good one 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.560
 give the 40 and 25 the second proven 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.510
 category but the scope is even more 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.710
 low of the vector so guys is one 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.509
 machine gun you are not reading the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.850
 registrations because we know so much that 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.670
 inscriptions are made by I don't know of 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.140
 drunk monkeys are coming anyway 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.030
 get the fuck so there's no home 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.380
 look at them then give good but the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.290
 according to the category and does not have one 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.750
 reach as large as evening to 1.5 is 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.670
 very good here to kill with 34 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.350
 so guys the normality of 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.759
 fire them 800 by 5 points which is a lot 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.710
 good and nick fire when they had 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.420
 opposed close to cool it without 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.950
 pity a little less as it would be for 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.259
 as for the short distance in 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.739
 how well to see x and machine gun the 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.570
 recoil is a little strange there is more guys 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.150
 light compared to other constraints of the 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.100
 category, however, has its own vice 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.380
 be decentralized to the right then the 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.620
 roma will always tend to recoil a little 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.800
 right however we say that it is enough 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.360
 controllable 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.370
 sure the player maybe an expert for 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.019
 have some problems but let's say that 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.790
 could be a plus point 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.069
 point not favor I see a little like that 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.989
 however, as you wish it is a bit 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.150
 strange as 12 hearts in care a little 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.600
 right a normal road the category a 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.730
 dsm 6,000 category reloads slightly 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.079
 read in fact having this charger 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.970
 this situation made by a boy of 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.290
 charging room with three second and two 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.000
 for a normal charge and three seconds 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.739
 almost four seconds there was almost in 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.930
 light Italy for what concerns 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.599
 the charger completely empty the 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.760
 charger is very large for 28 turns 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.200
 really really big what to say 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.209
 finally of this weapon then boys 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.450
 certainly half of a very good one 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.250
 weapon like k7 for example a tree 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.409
 fitch moans and use the matrix anymore 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.909
 easy to use is definitely not the 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.069
 top of the range how could it be a 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:13.400
 however, vector is a good weapon 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.500
 with the classes then we will go to see how 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.000
 use it to the best certainly a 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.590
 sleight of hand to use always 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.079
 as the recharge is really one 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.670
 breaking of boxes and certainly need 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.889
 be careful they are in care for the 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.230
 there is no rest will become of boys is 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.239
 really really complete we could 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.069
 say state on the point of view good damage 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.299
 good rate and lots of shots then 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.159
 fundamental as far as comfortable 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.629
 close opponent and must be safe 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.700
 what a wife for the next updates 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.139
 as far as weapon analysts are concerned 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.060
 sensitive on the facebook page 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.590
 because from there we will give you all the 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.659
 information regarding 9 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.220
 weapon analysis and c1 soon with a neighbor 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.220
