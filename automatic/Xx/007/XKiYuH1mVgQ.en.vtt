00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.590
 the beaten and transparent waters 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.389
 they allow the sun to penetrate what 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.029
 enough to give the 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.480
 miracle on which life is based the 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.480
 photosynthesis 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.250
 brown algae are authentic 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.500
 forests growing from the bottom in 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.500
 search for the luminosity of the surface 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.559
 up there where the schedules and 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.629
 mouths feel so safe from the 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.780
 sharks are about to establish 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:47.559
 your breeding colonies 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.899
 and this whole life is the fruit of a great 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.640
 trip that the waters of the 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.890
 thaw from the Antarctic continent 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.690
 up australia 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.269
 a trip traveling the ocean floor 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.269
 that can last a million years 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.610
 the process begins with the end of 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.440
 Antarctic winter the hours of light will 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.410
 they are doing longer to occupy 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.360
 all day so the in early 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.880
 giant blocks of ice are going 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.240
 melting gradually because of the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.240
 insolation 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.840
 then the surface of the water will 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.940
 warms up causing the movement of 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.210
 currents that make water reappear 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.250
 cold of the bottom charged with minerals this 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.190
 icy stream and rich in nutrients 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.600
 it reaches the coast of australia like 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.600
 a gift from South Pole 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.099
 its regenerative force produces 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:15.459
 immediate an appreciable effect to simple 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.459
 view 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.610
 are large masses of brown seaweed that 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.720
 proliferate over hundreds of 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.720
 kilometers of coastline 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.620
 under his wing animal life flourishes and 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.110
 first vegetable in the form of algae 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.390
 microscopic and later as 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.390
 zooplankton that feeds on them 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.720
 like real jungles that are algae 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.909
 they give shelter to millions of creatures that 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.569
 they trust to go unnoticed between 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.569
 its fronds 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.980
 the forests of kehl like these are 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.650
 inhabited by such a number of species that 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.270
 its faunal variety is up to 20 times 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.530
 higher than that of the tropical seas 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.530
 of warm waters 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.430
 this center has cultivated its own 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.040
 garden on top of his head in order to 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.290
 go unnoticed but the effect is very 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.290
 different when you have to move 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.240
 and the brown algae are fixed to the substrate 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.730
 by strong support in the form of 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.860
 claw whose function is exclusively the 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.980
 make an anchor against the force of 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.530
 storms and currents do not absorb anything 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.150
 nor do they share any other similarity with 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.150
 the roots of higher plants 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.850
 its rooting force is huge what 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.980
 enough to withstand the push 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.010
 of the rest of the plant whose obligation 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.180
 biological is to float to get closer to the 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.180
 surface light 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.990
 the invertebrates that share rock with 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.479
 they also know that here you have to 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.169
 hold on tight if you do not want to be 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.169
 dragged 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:59.400
 It's a world of washed colors and shapes 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.680
 soft 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.320
 the turbid water of life together with the 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.570
 strong hangover make the polyps not 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.490
 develop here neither hard nor 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.940
 designs full of color as in the 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.250
 tropical coral reefs 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.710
 they try to capture their share of plankton 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.320
 in this place where the food passes 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:23.030
 ahead of everyone where the only thing 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.030
 what you have to do is take it 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.010
 herbivorous fish like these graze 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.920
 as in any meadow next to a 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.070
 forest they are responsible for giving 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.440
 one more step in the ecological pyramid 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.720
 transforming the algae into meat its 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.180
 chromatic pattern is the same as that of 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.520
 the zebras the most striking thing that can 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:02.120
 to be in this ecosystem of beings 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.120
 discreet ocher brown and turbidity
