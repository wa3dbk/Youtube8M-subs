and<00:00:40.590> say<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:42.500> there's<00:00:43.500> no<00:00:43.770> easy<00:00:44.190> way<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.969> have

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
and say this there's no easy way to have

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.569 
and say this there's no easy way to have
a<00:00:45.390> list<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.260> what<00:00:46.800> you're<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.219> need<00:00:47.399> your
