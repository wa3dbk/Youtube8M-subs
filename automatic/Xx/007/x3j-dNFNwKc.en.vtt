00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello to you dmitry admin sadia 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 timelapse or dot com 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.080
 many of you have probably heard of such 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.599
 interesting as the reception phone is chaet 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.910
 interesting style of photo or video 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.699
 at which object or place 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.949
 shot full size but looks 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.410
 as a miniature model that is created 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.359
 miniature effect was originally such 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.830
 the effect could be achieved in with 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.390
 special lenses or adapters 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.309
 the only problem is the price 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.070
 equipment 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.600
 even if you have a reflex camera 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.079
 tilt-shift lens will cost you order 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.760
 1000 1500 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.850
 US dollars for such expenses 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.879
 for the sake of one effect of the finished photo 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.640
 far from all of us in this 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.070
 I will show the article how to use the program 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.110
 adobe after effect can create effect 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.239
 miniature without resorting to 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.660
 use of expensive lenses 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.760
 before you start creating 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.290
 effect of elf slope offset namely 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.560
 so translated from English 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.030
 you need to shoot perry and what 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.310
 shooting will be better 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.860
 the effect will look more reliable 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.290
 miniatures here are some tips 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.830
 as we used to look at models and 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.360
 miniature top top tass consciousness 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.480
 it will be easier to cheat with 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.330
 photos in which perspective 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.000
 pointing down and not up or in front or 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.020
 forward on eye level so set 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.310
 camera at an angle between the object and the ground 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.160
 use her suitable place for 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.920
 shooting for example an observation deck 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.229
 the roof of a multistory building if it's in 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.720
 city ​​or hulu natural elevation 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.759
 outside the city shoot in daylight 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.770
 time since models tend to 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.540
 illuminated with light bulbs for 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.259
 vertex effect works well 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.570
 photos of cities railways 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.250
 driving streets after you 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.560
 made an interval survey 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.990
 you need to create from the resulting images 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.630
 time of timelapse video proceed to 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.450
 create the effect of rear shift import 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.060
 timeout program adobe after effect 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.950
 she is already open to me 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.440
 to create a sense of artificiality 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.799
 we will increase the intensity of colors a little 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.390
 for this we call the color menu 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.480
 corrector color correction 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.269
 he is in the section and fit color 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.790
 correction in the right dialog box we 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.310
 find the hills it women color 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.350
 tone saturation 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.500
 open a new dialog now 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:43.180
 move the slider to the right and increase 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.489
 value i will leave somewhere at 55 you 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.769
 put specifically under your project before 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.280
 go to editing tonal 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.850
 cool 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.220
 also go to the effect color section 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.590
 correction 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.209
 corvis tonal curves with this 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.870
 By setting we will be able to adjust 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.950
 the contrast and volume of the entire time-lapse 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.480
 adjust contrast or tone 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:11.350
 a separate part of the timelapse 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.630
 adjust the correct light when 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.460
 right here so you can play around with 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.190
 settings that is specifically 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.020
 configure for your project after 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.420
 how we after we did 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.940
 color correction duplicate our layer 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:30.420
 timelaps we select found mayor layer 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.340
 go edit and click on the word 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.130
 public begin to change the depth 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.620
 the sharpness for this must be highlighted 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.370
 a place for the half at all where it will be created 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.520
 miniature 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.650
 here I am somewhere around here in this 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.290
 I will have a thumbnail in the area 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.610
 that is, as if represents a point 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.140
 lens focusing 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:56.860
 focal point and blur our back 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.810
 plan, that is, these houses will be with us 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.930
 blurred thereby we will 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.590
 create depth of field open 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.390
 fireworks in the effects section are looking for 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.660
 blur blue 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.030
 and look for camera lens blur 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.800
 It was after we activated 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.190
 filter camera lens blur 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.330
 we need to increase the radius value 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:25.840
 the default is 5 we set our dreams 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.000
 for example i will put on 16 if you 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.090
 it seemed that this is not enough you can 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.920
 increase the value of nato which you 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.400
 necessary under not specific under your 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.750
 project 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.430
 Next, create a mask with a little theory 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.560
 masking is highlighting and hiding 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.300
 parts of the image hiding part 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.880
 images we will be able to work with 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.970
 the remaining part is thus masking 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.430
 it is a way to apply some 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.140
 the animation effect is not on the whole image 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.300
 entirely but only to the selected 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:59.080
 masking participation proceed to 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.500
 working with the mask from the tool palette 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.910
 select tool and rectangle tool 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.350
 press and hold rectangle until 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.690
 right click until you see 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.300
 drop-down list of tools click 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.610
 on the river dingle holding the left button 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.560
 mouse scroll a rectangle in that place 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.700
 where do you think should be created 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.900
 miniature I will be here 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.000
 in the middle now to us on 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.800
 yes change focus area and 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.889
 blur go in our layer and in Moscow 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.570
 then activate opposite 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:45.259
 the inverted column that is, flip 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:50.060
 put a tick we see that our zone 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:52.820
 blur and focus areas have changed 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.669
 in some places then we need to smooth out the boundaries 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.680
 if you take a look at our 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:02.000
 the image clearly shows the boundaries between 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:05.150
 blur and boundaries between zones 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.729
 focusing so we need these boundaries 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.690
 and smooth for this we go again in 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:14.889
 our mask layer and then we need moscow 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:18.440
 so click the right mouse button edit 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:21.199
 remove the tick of servants it is necessary in order 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.990
 so that we can individually change 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:27.220
 value vertically and horizontally and by 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:32.500
 vertical set for example 250 pixels 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.500
 click ok now we can look 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:41.930
 see the boundaries between the blur area and 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:44.260
 focus area smoothed out now you 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:48.320
 can preview the waste 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:52.580
 time lapse that we created with effect 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:56.650
 body shift is already about as interesting 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:58.789
 get up turned out cool 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.710
 if you are satisfied with the received 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:03.349
 you can save the result 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.449
 resulting tells of timelapse when 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:07.310
 help different code zack codecs 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:10.909
 which are available in the adobe after program 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.510
 effect but that so far everything was with you 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:13.849
 Dmitriy

 admin site timelaps or dot com 

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:19.550
 come to our site there is a print 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.740
 version of this lesson and there are many others 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.110
 interesting topics on 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.139
 timelapse subject and good to you
