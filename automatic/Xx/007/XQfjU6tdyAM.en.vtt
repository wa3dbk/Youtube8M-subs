00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
how we do it

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.380

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
stage and we form up around him and we

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.179 
stage and we form up around him and we
use<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> benchmark<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.830> whole<00:01:20.070> of

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
use that as the benchmark the whole of

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:56.160 
use that as the benchmark the whole of
our<00:01:20.280> performance

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.940 

tip<00:01:57.170> -<00:01:57.670> don't<00:01:58.670> stand<00:01:59.000> too<00:01:59.180> far<00:01:59.570> apart<00:01:59.950> another

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
tip - don't stand too far apart another

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.500 
tip - don't stand too far apart another
quiet<00:02:01.250> seem<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.640> think<00:02:01.730> it<00:02:01.910> looks<00:02:02.090> really<00:02:02.270> nice

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
quiet seem to think it looks really nice

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.150 
quiet seem to think it looks really nice
to<00:02:02.690> have<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.810> gap<00:02:03.050> between<00:02:03.170> each<00:02:03.470> singer<00:02:03.950> but

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
to have a gap between each singer but

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.800 
to have a gap between each singer but
actually<00:02:04.670> we<00:02:04.850> think<00:02:05.120> it's<00:02:05.240> better<00:02:05.480> to<00:02:05.660> have

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
actually we think it's better to have

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.859 
actually we think it's better to have
one<00:02:06.230> homogenous<00:02:07.100> unit<00:02:07.520> onstage<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.450> the

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
one homogenous unit onstage and the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.900 
one homogenous unit onstage and the
closer<00:02:09.110> you<00:02:09.229> are<00:02:09.320> together<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:10.160> easier<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.880> is

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
closer you are together the easier it is

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:20.640 
closer you are together the easier it is
to<00:02:11.030> hear<00:02:11.270> what<00:02:11.450> everyone<00:02:11.630> else<00:02:11.870> is<00:02:12.080> singing

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.070 

tip<00:02:21.650> 3<00:02:22.209> really<00:02:23.209> think<00:02:23.540> about<00:02:23.600> where<00:02:23.900> each

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
tip 3 really think about where each

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.170 
tip 3 really think about where each
voice<00:02:24.500> part<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:25.010> your<00:02:25.160> song<00:02:25.490> will<00:02:25.700> stands<00:02:26.090> on

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
voice part in your song will stands on

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.150 
voice part in your song will stands on

stage because you want to make sure that
you<00:02:28.280> achieve<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.880> best<00:02:29.180> balance<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.050> blend

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
you achieve the best balance and blend

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.000 
you achieve the best balance and blend
with<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.130> resources<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.850> have<00:02:33.010> sometimes

either side it doesn't matter there is
no<00:02:41.209> best<00:02:41.630> answer<00:02:42.140> there<00:02:42.320> was<00:02:42.410> no<00:02:42.590> right<00:02:42.800> answer

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
no best answer there was no right answer

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.680 
no best answer there was no right answer
but<00:02:43.280> there<00:02:43.430> will<00:02:43.580> be<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.820> best<00:02:44.150> solution<00:02:44.300> for

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
but there will be a best solution for

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.150 
but there will be a best solution for
your<00:02:44.780> own<00:02:44.959> circle<00:02:45.410> so<00:02:45.590> make<00:02:45.800> sure<00:02:45.830> that<00:02:46.040> you

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
your own circle so make sure that you

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.320 
your own circle so make sure that you
really<00:02:46.340> think<00:02:46.580> about<00:02:46.700> where<00:02:46.970> everyone's

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
really think about where everyone's

00:02:47.330 --> 00:03:03.200 
really think about where everyone's
standing<00:02:47.750> for<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.530> best<00:02:48.739> visual

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.080 

finally<00:03:04.210> tip<00:03:05.080> four<00:03:05.380> think<00:03:06.310> about<00:03:06.550> standing<00:03:06.910> in

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
finally tip four think about standing in

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.600 
finally tip four think about standing in
a<00:03:07.180> semicircle<00:03:07.930> on<00:03:07.990> stage<00:03:08.290> now<00:03:09.040> we<00:03:09.100> think<00:03:09.460> there

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
a semicircle on stage now we think there

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.790 
a semicircle on stage now we think there
are<00:03:09.640> two<00:03:10.000> huge<00:03:10.570> benefits<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.200> standing<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:11.710> a

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
are two huge benefits to standing in a

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.100 
are two huge benefits to standing in a
semicircle<00:03:12.460> the<00:03:13.240> first<00:03:13.510> has<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.720> do<00:03:13.900> with<00:03:13.990> the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
semicircle the first has to do with the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.250 
semicircle the first has to do with the
music<00:03:14.500> if<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.490> stand<00:03:15.760> in<00:03:15.850> a<00:03:15.970> semicircle<00:03:16.690> it

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
music if you stand in a semicircle it

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.660 
music if you stand in a semicircle it
means<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.740> can<00:03:17.890> hear<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.250> other

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
means that you can hear the other

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.400 
means that you can hear the other
singers<00:03:19.120> in<00:03:19.240> your<00:03:19.360> ensemble<00:03:19.810> better<00:03:20.020> because

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
singers in your ensemble better because

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.290 
singers in your ensemble better because
you're<00:03:20.530> facing<00:03:20.800> them<00:03:21.160> more<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.550> with<00:03:22.150> being

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
you're facing them more and with being

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.300 
you're facing them more and with being
able<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.540> hear<00:03:22.660> them<00:03:22.930> better<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.950> sense<00:03:24.220> of

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
able to hear them better the sense of

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.180 
able to hear them better the sense of
Ensemble<00:03:24.760> will<00:03:24.850> be<00:03:24.970> better<00:03:25.710> now<00:03:26.710> the<00:03:26.770> second

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
Ensemble will be better now the second
