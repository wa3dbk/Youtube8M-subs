00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.150 

in<00:00:03.750> this<00:00:03.929> video<00:00:04.110> we're<00:00:04.380> just<00:00:04.410> going<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.710> take<00:00:04.920> a

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
in this video we're just going to take a

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.820 
in this video we're just going to take a
look<00:00:05.490> at<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.970> physical<00:00:06.299> size<00:00:07.020> comparisons

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
look at the physical size comparisons

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.250 
look at the physical size comparisons
with<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.490> sony<00:00:08.820> xperia<00:00:09.450> z<00:00:09.690> against<00:00:10.080> some

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
with the sony xperia z against some

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.009 
with the sony xperia z against some
other<00:00:10.429> mobile<00:00:11.429> devices<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:12.420> why<00:00:12.570> not<00:00:12.719> let's

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
other mobile devices so why not let's

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.930 
other mobile devices so why not let's
start<00:00:13.380> with<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.950> Xperia<00:00:14.730> T<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:16.940> previous

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
start with the Xperia T the previous

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.170 
start with the Xperia T the previous
device<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.050> Z<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.800> one<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.609> zed<00:00:21.150> is

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
device to the Z the one that the zed is

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.710 
device to the Z the one that the zed is
essentially<00:00:21.980> replacing<00:00:23.269> so<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.330> can<00:00:24.539> see

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
essentially replacing so you can see

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.410 
essentially replacing so you can see
that<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.019> physical<00:00:25.500> size<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.699> different<00:00:26.970> mean

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
that the physical size is different mean

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.929 
that the physical size is different mean
the<00:00:27.570> screen<00:00:27.869> size<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.170> different<00:00:28.710> for<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.519> start

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
the screen size is different for a start

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.080 
the screen size is different for a start
you've<00:00:30.119> got<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> extra<00:00:30.869> height<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.700> little

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
you've got the extra height and a little

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.139 
you've got the extra height and a little
bit<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.270> extra<00:00:33.390> width<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.649> set<00:00:35.149> thickness

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
bit of extra width on the set thickness

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.810 
bit of extra width on the set thickness
wise<00:00:36.390> though<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:37.140> see<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.829> Z<00:00:38.489> is

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
wise though you can see the Z is

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.150 
wise though you can see the Z is
probably<00:00:39.239> thinner<00:00:39.570> although<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.440> t's<00:00:40.829> got<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
probably thinner although the t's got a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.549 
probably thinner although the t's got a
bit<00:00:41.399> more<00:00:41.610> curvature<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:45.440> footprint<00:00:46.440> on

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
bit more curvature to it footprint on

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.790 
bit more curvature to it footprint on
the<00:00:46.590> back<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.160> belly<00:00:48.260> same<00:00:49.260> as<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> sort<00:00:49.739> of

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the back here belly same as the sort of

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.450 
the back here belly same as the sort of
front<00:00:50.070> their<00:00:50.280> weight<00:00:51.210> wise<00:00:52.160> fairly<00:00:53.160> similar

front their weight wise fairly similar

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.240 
front their weight wise fairly similar
the<00:00:53.579> Zed's<00:00:53.820> probably<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> little<00:00:54.420> bit<00:00:54.629> heavier

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
the Zed's probably a little bit heavier

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.340 
the Zed's probably a little bit heavier
you<00:00:56.250> know<00:00:56.340> feeling<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> hand<00:00:57.120> than<00:00:58.079> the

tea<00:00:58.770> let's<00:00:59.760> bring<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.359> very<00:01:00.629> popular

tea let's bring in the very popular

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.219 
tea let's bring in the very popular
samsung<00:01:01.649> galaxy<00:01:02.100> s3<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.600> has<00:01:03.629> got<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.930> bit<00:01:04.140> of

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
samsung galaxy s3 so it has got a bit of

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.450 
samsung galaxy s3 so it has got a bit of
a<00:01:04.260> bigger<00:01:04.470> screen<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:06.170> zette<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:08.189> overall

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
a bigger screen on zette the overall

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.060 
a bigger screen on zette the overall
width<00:01:08.790> though<00:01:09.500> hardly<00:01:10.500> anything<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.970> it

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
width though hardly anything in it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.120 
width though hardly anything in it
length<00:01:14.330> fractions<00:01:15.619> there<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:16.799> really

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
length fractions there there really

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.499 
length fractions there there really
isn't<00:01:17.400> much<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.759> don't<00:01:17.939> know<00:01:18.000> how<00:01:18.090> much<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.390> can

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
isn't much I don't know how much you can

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.870 
isn't much I don't know how much you can
sort<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:18.930> they're<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.250> fraction<00:01:20.250> taller

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
sort of see they're just fraction taller

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.370 
sort of see they're just fraction taller
of<00:01:21.060> course<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.450> big<00:01:21.630> difference<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
of course the big difference is on the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.460 
of course the big difference is on the
corners<00:01:22.770> much<00:01:23.640> sharper<00:01:24.000> corners<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.229> Z

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
corners much sharper corners on the Z

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.890 
corners much sharper corners on the Z
much<00:01:26.340> more<00:01:26.640> square<00:01:27.799> when<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> laid<00:01:29.070> down<00:01:29.250> flat

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
much more square when the laid down flat

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.120 
much more square when the laid down flat
it's<00:01:30.900> hardly<00:01:31.140> any<00:01:31.320> difference<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:32.040> Z<00:01:33.829> is<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
it's hardly any difference the Z is the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.010 
it's hardly any difference the Z is the
slightly<00:01:35.460> thinner<00:01:35.820> device<00:01:38.090> weight-wise<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
slightly thinner device weight-wise the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.800 
slightly thinner device weight-wise the
Z<00:01:40.829> feels<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:42.030> little<00:01:42.869> bit<00:01:43.110> heavier<00:01:44.630> we've<00:01:45.630> got

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
Z feels a little bit heavier we've got

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.600 
Z feels a little bit heavier we've got
the<00:01:46.079> one<00:01:46.409> x+<00:01:46.799> from<00:01:47.369> HTC<00:01:50.570> again<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.750> Z<00:01:52.250> is<00:01:53.250> that

the one x+ from HTC again the Z is that

difference now that you know it's

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.440 
difference now that you know it's
fractions<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.430> millimetres<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.329> we're

a lot in it fact the the Z is pretty
well<00:02:24.690> balanced<00:02:25.170> overall<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.400> then<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.270> got

well balanced overall and then we got

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.630 
well balanced overall and then we got
