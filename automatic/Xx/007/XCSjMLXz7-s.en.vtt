00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:11.139
 hello everyone welcome to development 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:14.440
 Andrew today as the first video the most 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:17.410
 what motivated me to do this video is 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.800
 yesterday getting unfairly flashing the 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.119
 recovery for me to finish the chinese is 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.720
 9500 that I could not find anywhere 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.579
 I was not able to flash it because I 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.369
 they give a white screen a brick a clip 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.610
 of the recovery and how it really locked me 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:37.390
 nowhere did I decide to do one myself 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.110
 I put with a tool and we've 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.260
 got 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.750
 ok I will teach them how to download it 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.130
 install it and in a next video 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.990
 I will present to 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.810
 to be your own recovery for 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.160
 your mobile in case this is yours 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.740
 Chinese terminal that you do not have 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.900
 recovery and what you need for what 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.460
 be it then I will teach to do it that is 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.710
 very simple and anyone can 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.309
 do so let's proceed to 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.130
 download the download from here and what 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.900
 you will have the root explorer or in the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.910
 application that you have by default for 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.140
 my files will appear the folder of 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.140
 speak you have to move 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.680
 the root of the s here I have it is 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.240
 a file and an image emerges you already have 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.970
 to give a particular application 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.230
 I'll leave the link in the description of 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.140
 google play 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.590
 a tolls clip is mobile whenever it does not 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.590
 I find it 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.369
 mobile is a clip tools you open it 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.070
 he wants to be fed up legation this is very 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.950
 simple you just have to do it is this 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.750
 prayer has many features 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.360
 for mediatek processors of the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.810
 Chinese mobile phones and I recommend that you 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.079
 try if you get a little bit with it and 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.179
 the doctor is how you are doing because I 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.789
 it seems quite useful you are going to change 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.250
 recovery and this file will appear 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.780
 that is going to look for another native to 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.269
 move but you do not know why not 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.340
 they will work and possibly briquet 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.640
 one post recovery 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.160
 here this file will only appear 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.290
 if you do not have the headquarters root, if not 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.290
 it appears to you because you have not 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.330
 downloaded or two that you have in the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.300
 classroom folder still or somewhere else that 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.629
 it is not the root of the sd that then we 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.580
 will appear you give him here hospitais and 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.500
 will use such a file that I'm sure that 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.200
 is sure you want to access flash 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.910
 clear recovery accept my sentence for 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.060
 start offering when picking up does not take 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.060
 nothing 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.700
 is already blocked tells you that if they want 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.659
 and you recovery we did not see again how it is 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.659
 the recovery because 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.010
 immediately start lower mode is that not 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.010
 there is more 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.340
 It will not be very good but what is 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.970
 here you have to install types of scholarships 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.020
 to do the wire those things do not have 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.180
 a complexity that a command the sea will 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.180
 manage using the volume buttons 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.640
 and cheap in one in one option instead of 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.150
 give home button you have to hit the button 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.240
 physical power off and on as this 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.760
 that's it 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.940
 with this recovery I use it to paraphrase 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.620
 a mini rom for this terminal that in 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.540
 reality is pretty good at Rome 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.700
 it's very well optimized that ya 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.820
 I will teach how to install it and how to do it 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.710
 all right not to have a brick or anything 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.650
 and thank you very much for watching the video 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.950
 subscribe like and have spent the 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.950
 next
