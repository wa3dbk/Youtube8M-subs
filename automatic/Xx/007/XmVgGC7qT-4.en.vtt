00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
just put them mix it up and eat a plane

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.580 
just put them mix it up and eat a plane
right<00:03:34.950> well<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:38.780> lasted<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.870> couple<00:03:40.019> days

Bilderback group and all these

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.290 
Bilderback group and all these
conspiracies<00:04:29.550> I'm<00:04:30.210> trying<00:04:30.479> to<00:04:30.539> thin<00:04:30.750> out<00:04:30.900> the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
conspiracies I'm trying to thin out the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.820 
conspiracies I'm trying to thin out the
raise<00:04:31.569> follow<00:04:31.960> these<00:04:32.110> preservatives<00:04:32.710> and

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
food and sweetener kind of came up as a

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.360 
food and sweetener kind of came up as a
key<00:04:36.180> artificial<00:04:37.259> food<00:04:38.259> product<00:04:38.770> that<00:04:38.830> is

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
key artificial food product that is

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.860 
key artificial food product that is
going<00:04:39.520> to<00:04:39.580> lead<00:04:39.699> to<00:04:39.729> cancer<00:04:40.330> high<00:04:40.539> incidence

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
going to lead to cancer high incidence

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.540 
going to lead to cancer high incidence
of<00:04:40.990> cancer<00:04:41.289> and<00:04:41.379> so<00:04:41.500> forth<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:41.979> that's<00:04:42.460> the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
of cancer and so forth and that's the

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.350 
of cancer and so forth and that's the
way<00:04:42.639> we're<00:04:42.789> kind<00:04:42.940> of<00:04:42.970> going<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.180> thin<00:04:43.330> our

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
way we're kind of going to thin our

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.420 
way we're kind of going to thin our
ranks<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:44.830> there<00:04:44.949> have<00:04:45.069> been<00:04:45.099> many<00:04:45.220> studies

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
ranks so there have been many studies

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.399 
ranks so there have been many studies
about<00:04:46.270> sweeteners<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:46.990> they're<00:04:47.080> linked<00:04:47.289> to

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409 
about sweeteners and they're linked to

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.350 
about sweeteners and they're linked to
cancer<00:04:47.830> so<00:04:48.310> whether<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.699> believe<00:04:49.030> them<00:04:49.090> or

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
cancer so whether you believe them or

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.360 
cancer so whether you believe them or
not<00:04:49.419> that<00:04:50.020> will<00:04:50.289> drive<00:04:50.560> your<00:04:50.740> decision<00:04:51.190> on

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
not that will drive your decision on

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.589 
not that will drive your decision on
whether<00:04:51.699> you<00:04:51.819> want<00:04:51.970> to<00:04:52.030> use<00:04:52.060> sweeteners<00:04:52.569> in

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
whether you want to use sweeteners in

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.629 
whether you want to use sweeteners in
your<00:04:52.870> own<00:04:52.960> wheel<00:04:53.139> I<00:04:53.440> chose<00:04:54.009> to<00:04:54.190> kind<00:04:54.340> of<00:04:54.430> pass

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
your own wheel I chose to kind of pass

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.629 
your own wheel I chose to kind of pass
them<00:04:54.879> by<00:04:55.470> so<00:04:56.470> now<00:04:56.590> what<00:04:57.220> I've<00:04:57.340> kind<00:04:57.550> of

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
them by so now what I've kind of

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.330 
them by so now what I've kind of
migrated<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.240> now<00:04:58.449> is<00:04:58.780> just<00:04:59.379> fresh<00:04:59.620> fruit<00:04:59.889> how

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
migrated to now is just fresh fruit how

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.050 
migrated to now is just fresh fruit how
simple<00:05:00.729> is<00:05:00.819> that

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
simple is that

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.379 
simple is that
right<00:05:01.240> so<00:05:02.340> people<00:05:03.340> add<00:05:03.400> berries<00:05:03.639> high<00:05:04.330> in
