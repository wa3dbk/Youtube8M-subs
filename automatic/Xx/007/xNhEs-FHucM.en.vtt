and what we've done is we've taken our

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.660 
and what we've done is we've taken our
tryouts<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.380> tied<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:57.740> piece<00:01:57.829> of<00:01:57.979> wire<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.549> them

30 seconds to get them good warm and
which<00:02:13.910> trend<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.239> gonna<00:02:14.450> pull<00:02:14.630> them<00:02:14.720> back

through the wax coating on the top and

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.110 
through the wax coating on the top and
it<00:02:17.480> should<00:02:17.510> give<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:18.590> good<00:02:18.950> thin<00:02:19.579> coating<00:02:20.030> to

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
it should give a good thin coating to

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.180 
it should give a good thin coating to
wax<00:02:20.360> on<00:02:20.690> it

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.690 

in<00:02:32.830> this<00:02:33.069> over<00:02:34.019> then<00:02:35.019> we<00:02:35.140> can<00:02:35.319> wait<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:36.430> then

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
in this over then we can wait and then

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.670 
in this over then we can wait and then
we<00:02:36.849> should<00:02:37.060> be<00:02:37.209> able<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.540> pull<00:02:38.140> them<00:02:38.260> out<00:02:38.379> and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
we should be able to pull them out and

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.399 
we should be able to pull them out and
pull<00:02:39.010> them<00:02:39.099> through<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.310> wax<00:02:39.549> and<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:41.170> get<00:02:41.379> a

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
pull them through the wax and I so get a

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.679 
pull them through the wax and I so get a
good<00:02:41.620> coating<00:02:41.799> of<00:02:41.980> wax<00:02:42.189> on<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:45.659> alright<00:02:46.659> that

good coating of wax on it alright that
should<00:02:46.870> be<00:02:47.079> long<00:02:47.349> enough<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.769> we're<00:02:47.890> going<00:02:48.010> to

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
should be long enough and we're going to

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.229 
should be long enough and we're going to
pull<00:02:48.250> our<00:02:48.310> traps<00:02:48.640> out<00:02:50.760> slowly<00:02:51.760> pull<00:02:52.120> it

through<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:54.310> wax<00:02:54.900> we<00:02:55.900> should<00:02:56.079> have<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.290> good

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
through the wax we should have a good

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.140 
through the wax we should have a good
coating<00:02:56.769> of<00:02:56.920> wax<00:02:57.159> on<00:02:57.370> them<00:02:57.579> at<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.849> point

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
coating of wax on them at that point

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.580 
coating of wax on them at that point
we'll<00:02:58.420> let<00:02:58.540> them<00:02:58.629> dry<00:02:58.870> off<00:02:59.079> and<00:02:59.349> then<00:02:59.470> we'll

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
we'll let them dry off and then we'll

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.080 
we'll let them dry off and then we'll
place<00:02:59.859> them<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.159> a<00:03:00.190> container<00:03:00.579> I<00:03:00.760> generally

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
place them in a container I generally

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.740 
place them in a container I generally
put<00:03:01.239> some<00:03:01.420> leaves<00:03:01.629> in<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:03.540> set<00:03:04.540> them<00:03:04.659> in

put some leaves in it and set them in
there<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:04.989> then<00:03:05.079> we<00:03:05.170> should<00:03:05.230> be<00:03:05.530> ready<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.370> go

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
there and then we should be ready to go

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.440 
there and then we should be ready to go
the<00:03:09.040> purpose<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.549> using<00:03:09.849> the<00:03:09.940> double<00:03:10.269> boiler

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
the purpose of using the double boiler

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.509 
the purpose of using the double boiler
method<00:03:10.569> is<00:03:11.349> to<00:03:11.680> prevent<00:03:11.950> your<00:03:12.129> wax<00:03:12.340> from

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
method is to prevent your wax from

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.849 
method is to prevent your wax from
catching<00:03:12.760> fire<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.840> doing<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:14.319> what<00:03:14.500> we<00:03:14.620> do<00:03:14.769> is

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
catching fire and doing so what we do is

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.349 
catching fire and doing so what we do is
we<00:03:14.980> take<00:03:15.129> the<00:03:15.280> bottom<00:03:15.549> pot<00:03:15.730> fill<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.120> up<00:03:16.209> in

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
we take the bottom pot fill it up in

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.780 
we take the bottom pot fill it up in
water<00:03:16.540> then<00:03:17.260> we<00:03:17.349> take<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.560> metal<00:03:17.889> spacer<00:03:18.340> and

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
water then we take a metal spacer and

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.819 
water then we take a metal spacer and
put<00:03:18.970> on<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.150> bottle<00:03:19.480> we<00:03:20.109> take<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.379> top<00:03:20.560> pot

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
put on the bottle we take the top pot

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.830 
put on the bottle we take the top pot
put<00:03:21.220> our<00:03:21.340> wax<00:03:21.579> in<00:03:21.879> it<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.180> place<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.450> inside

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
put our wax in it and place it inside

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.470 
put our wax in it and place it inside
the<00:03:23.170> bottom<00:03:23.799> pot<00:03:23.980> what<00:03:24.609> this<00:03:24.790> does<00:03:25.060> is<00:03:25.269> it

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
the bottom pot what this does is it

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.690 
the bottom pot what this does is it
prevents<00:03:25.840> your<00:03:26.590> wax<00:03:26.889> from<00:03:27.069> catching<00:03:27.280> on<00:03:27.489> fire

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
prevents your wax from catching on fire

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
wax has a very low flash point and you

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.729 
wax has a very low flash point and you
do<00:03:30.129> run<00:03:30.879> into<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.329> if<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.599> do<00:03:31.780> just<00:03:32.230> one<00:03:32.500> pipe

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
do run into that if you do just one pipe

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.800 
do run into that if you do just one pipe
method<00:03:33.220> this<00:03:33.760> way<00:03:34.000> your<00:03:34.269> water<00:03:34.480> is<00:03:34.629> going<00:03:34.720> to

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
method this way your water is going to

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.349 
method this way your water is going to
bowl<00:03:34.989> only<00:03:35.470> at<00:03:35.560> 212<00:03:36.310> degrees<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.090> know

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
bowl only at 212 degrees so you know

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.300 
bowl only at 212 degrees so you know
that<00:03:37.540> your<00:03:37.720> wax<00:03:38.349> is<00:03:38.590> not<00:03:38.739> going<00:03:38.919> to<00:03:38.980> get<00:03:39.129> hot

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
that your wax is not going to get hot

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.640 
that your wax is not going to get hot
enough<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.579> catch<00:03:39.910> fire<00:03:40.260> this<00:03:41.260> is<00:03:41.440> an

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
enough to catch fire this is an

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.670
