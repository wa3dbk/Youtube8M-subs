00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.150
 to cover 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.900
 as the plant grows the same collar of the plant itself

 of adventitious roots in fact the pepper plant a 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.120
 to this we shall see later it is certain a plant with which there is text ray 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.650
 because it has a particularly poorly developed root system 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.730
 if we are talking about the plant that has a radical approach to taproot then 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.520
 with a radical band larger than the others you leave 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.340
 vertically downwards, but growth has been canceled. stops 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.300
 hey remains superficial to dream this 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.530
 full beam instructions can be carried out 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.400
 many 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.780
 and various materials 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.780
 a plant picket may be used 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.810
 pardon apologized for the delay 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.610
 cakes 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.150
 the appropriate wooden plastic supports 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.960
 or we can otherwise adopt courage that works well instead 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.960
 on the row crops of plants I hope

 second parish we put it at about 2 and a half million distance from the first 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.820
 to make sure that the structure that animals are allowed is the challenge 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.000
 strong enough to maintain the weight of the plants 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.750
 ok 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.430
 at this point 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.910
 we're going to pull 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.950
 at different heights, growth is always very high 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.680
 of the children of both sides of the 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.960
 italy 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.340
 I imagine that then as you think about it as they fuck and change inside 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.090
 Of these 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.570
 wifi arranged at the same height but 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.569
 night at lampedusa cartina 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.620
 the way these finite can perform a supporting function of the

 alimony 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.249
 beautiful love 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:25.379
 at the first height of about 10 cents on the ground on both sides 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.179
 supports to see 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:31.179
 this morning 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:37.559
 we see another at a higher height and then we will take care in the course of the fish 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:39.889
 seedlings to continue this work 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.949
 in the case of planting them 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:46.499
 low compared to the first level realized we should take care during 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.719
 the growth of accompanying the plants inside manually 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.969
 beautiful the support of 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:03:00.629
 another method to ensure support for pepper plants and to defend them 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.119
 a cable 

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:03.209
 what are you doing 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.829
 at a greater height from the plants always thinking to throw myself to fall for 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.939
 land and then makes you get off this cable 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.659
 souvenirs that can be nylon string white pages 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.399
 in correspondence of the seedlings we bring down a thread 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:23.449
 which then 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:27.659
 for now we leave quite loosely woven around the earth 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:33.549
 then that grows the plant we're going to improve for the position of copper and le

 Germany to take all the exams that will gradually grow 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.819
 we have practically finished 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.849
 support work 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.159
 facebook recapitulating support we have worked both on 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.459
 pepper seedlings

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.659
 similarly with regard to cultivation treatments

 support system that uses the ratio different and only tastes 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.429
 to illustrate two different methods that can be chosen but the substance is the 

00:04:25.429 --> 00:04:27.400
 the same to ensure 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.440
 a growth
