to<00:03:57.960> it<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.140> know<00:03:58.200> when<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.380> get<00:03:58.500> off<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.830> gas

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
to it you know when you get off the gas

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.250 
to it you know when you get off the gas
do<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.460> about<00:03:59.610> 65<00:04:00.090> 70<00:04:00.120> do<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:00.930> notice<00:04:01.080> that

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
do it about 65 70 do you notice that

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.590 
do it about 65 70 do you notice that
that's<00:04:01.950> because<00:04:02.370> for<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.670> first<00:04:02.910> time<00:04:03.180> this

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
that's because for the first time this

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.430 
that's because for the first time this
has<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.770> new<00:04:04.920> 6.4<00:04:05.820> liter<00:04:06.090> Hemi<00:04:07.080> this<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.350> the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
has the new 6.4 liter Hemi this is the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.190 
has the new 6.4 liter Hemi this is the
big<00:04:07.710> a<00:04:07.740> me<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.790> has<00:04:09.000> fuel<00:04:09.360> saver<00:04:09.870> technology

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
big a me that has fuel saver technology

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.310 
big a me that has fuel saver technology
first<00:04:11.040> time<00:04:11.280> 22<00:04:11.760> mpg<00:04:12.210> on<00:04:12.240> the<00:04:12.360> highway<00:04:12.450> so<00:04:13.170> when

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
first time 22 mpg on the highway so when

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.410 
first time 22 mpg on the highway so when
you<00:04:13.470> lift<00:04:13.740> you're<00:04:14.160> gonna<00:04:14.280> hear<00:04:14.670> like<00:04:15.090> back

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
you lift you're gonna hear like back

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.320 
you lift you're gonna hear like back
pressure<00:04:15.720> sound<00:04:16.170> good<00:04:16.530> deep<00:04:16.980> gutsy<00:04:17.519> sound<00:04:17.790> but

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
pressure sound good deep gutsy sound but

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
pressure sound good deep gutsy sound but

from that 6.1 liter v8 to the 6.4 they

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.590 
from that 6.1 liter v8 to the 6.4 they
470<00:04:38.010> horsepower<00:04:38.160> now<00:04:38.669> 20<00:04:39.060> horsepower<00:04:39.300> more

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
470 horsepower now 20 horsepower more

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.090 
470 horsepower now 20 horsepower more
than

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
than

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.240 
than
here<00:04:40.280> in<00:04:41.170> 470<00:04:42.170> foot-pounds<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:42.920> torque<00:04:42.980> and

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
here in 470 foot-pounds of torque and

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.280 
here in 470 foot-pounds of torque and
that's<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.490> huge<00:04:43.760> jump<00:04:44.150> in<00:04:44.300> torque<00:04:44.660> and<00:04:45.110> it's

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
that's a huge jump in torque and it's

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.600 
that's a huge jump in torque and it's
down<00:04:45.560> to<00:04:45.740> about<00:04:46.120> 4200<00:04:47.120> rpm<00:04:47.860> 4250<00:04:48.860> so<00:04:49.370> when<00:04:49.520> you

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
down to about 4200 rpm 4250 so when you

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.820 
down to about 4200 rpm 4250 so when you

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
get on the gas this thing moves like it

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.230 
get on the gas this thing moves like it
never<00:04:52.130> moved<00:04:52.400> in<00:04:52.670> the<00:04:52.760> past

never moved in the past
you<00:04:53.660> can<00:04:53.840> brake<00:04:54.470> you<00:04:54.800> can<00:04:54.980> spin<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.250> tires<00:04:55.610> you

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
you can brake you can spin the tires you

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.210 
you can brake you can spin the tires you
know<00:04:56.330> so<00:04:56.720> it's<00:04:56.930> talking<00:04:57.590> it<00:04:57.710> does<00:04:57.920> feel<00:04:58.190> like

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
that well it's going back to cubic

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.660 
that well it's going back to cubic

inch<00:05:38.030> v8<00:05:38.440> so<00:05:39.440> how<00:05:39.590> many<00:05:39.740> liters<00:05:40.040> is<00:05:40.160> that

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
inch v8 so how many liters is that

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.240 
inch v8 so how many liters is that
that's<00:05:40.820> six<00:05:41.210> six<00:05:42.140> point<00:05:42.650> seven

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
that's six six point seven

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.490 
that's six six point seven
well<00:05:43.460> six<00:05:43.700> point<00:05:43.910> say<00:05:44.180> for<00:05:44.420> now<00:05:44.810> six<00:05:45.290> point

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
well six point say for now six point

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.830 
well six point say for now six point
four<00:05:45.650> and<00:05:45.830> so<00:05:46.040> you<00:05:46.670> know<00:05:46.820> the<00:05:46.940> transition<00:05:47.360> back

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
four and so you know the transition back

this car downshift turning the wheels
you<00:06:08.840> hit<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.080> brake<00:06:09.290> you<00:06:09.860> get<00:06:10.010> a<00:06:10.040> downshift<00:06:10.310> so

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 
you hit the brake you get a downshift so

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.610 
you hit the brake you get a downshift so
you're<00:06:10.880> using<00:06:11.090> engine<00:06:11.780> braking<00:06:12.080> it's<00:06:12.320> very

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
you're using engine braking it's very
