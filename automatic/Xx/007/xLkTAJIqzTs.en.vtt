00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
contemporary art project like this and

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.189 
contemporary art project like this and

vice versa

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.590 
vice versa
and<00:00:50.100> how<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.610> bring<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.030> two<00:00:51.210> disciplines

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
and how do you bring the two disciplines

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.280 
and how do you bring the two disciplines
together<00:00:52.140> without<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.769> essence<00:00:53.480> losing<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
together without in essence losing the

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.320 
together without in essence losing the
language<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.040> these<00:00:56.220> two<00:00:56.549> disappear

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
language that these two disappear

their practice and I think Jorge has

their practice and I think Jorge has
managed<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.970> do<00:01:03.150> that<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.720> perfectly

tourists a kind of aesthetic taste very

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.360 
tourists a kind of aesthetic taste very
aggressive<00:01:39.080> cleaning<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.070> what<00:01:40.220> I<00:01:40.250> did

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
aggressive cleaning and so what I did

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.510 
aggressive cleaning and so what I did
was<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.820> paint<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:41.330> last<00:01:41.660> wall<00:01:42.440> with<00:01:43.040> latex

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
was to paint that last wall with latex

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.430 
was to paint that last wall with latex
it's<00:01:43.790> a<00:01:43.880> very<00:01:44.119> cutting<00:01:44.600> edge<00:01:44.720> cleaning

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
it's a very cutting edge cleaning

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.990 
it's a very cutting edge cleaning
technique<00:01:47.290> and<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:48.680> latex<00:01:49.040> dries<00:01:49.430> it

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
technique and the latex dries it

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.270 
technique and the latex dries it
transfers<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.600> pollution<00:01:51.259> onto<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:51.950> latex

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
transfers the pollution onto the latex

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.490 
transfers the pollution onto the latex
from<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.640> stone<00:01:52.910> cleans<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.600> wall<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.050> then

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
from the stone cleans the wall and then

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.560 
from the stone cleans the wall and then
what<00:01:54.649> you<00:01:54.740> have<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.070> an<00:01:55.220> impression<00:01:55.580> a<00:01:55.850> cast<00:01:56.149> of

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
what you have is an impression a cast of

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.930 
what you have is an impression a cast of
pollution<00:01:57.250> pollution<00:01:58.250> is<00:01:58.640> our<00:01:58.759> most

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
pollution pollution is our most

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.999 
pollution pollution is our most
important<00:01:59.600> product<00:02:00.170> there's<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.410> modern

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
important product there's a modern

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.550 
important product there's a modern
civilization<00:02:01.729> mr.<00:02:02.030> changed<00:02:02.420> our<00:02:02.990> environment

exchange our understanding of our place

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.270 
exchange our understanding of our place
in<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.660> world<00:02:08.690> but<00:02:09.590> we<00:02:09.739> don't<00:02:09.920> have<00:02:10.040> a<00:02:10.070> history

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
in the world but we don't have a history

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.880 
in the world but we don't have a history
of<00:02:10.550> pollution<00:02:11.090> we<00:02:11.330> don't<00:02:11.630> really<00:02:12.020> know<00:02:12.320> what

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
of pollution we don't really know what

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.890 
of pollution we don't really know what
we've<00:02:13.040> been<00:02:13.250> doing<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.269> this<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.720> as<00:02:14.870> much

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
we've been doing and so this is as much

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.370 
we've been doing and so this is as much
really<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.920> work<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.400> documentation<00:02:17.060> as<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.660> work

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
really a work of documentation as a work

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:30.170 
really a work of documentation as a work
of<00:02:18.620> art

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.929 

I<00:02:30.260> think<00:02:31.260> people<00:02:31.620> walk<00:02:31.829> past<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.579> see<00:02:32.760> this

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
I think people walk past and see this

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.780 
I think people walk past and see this
beautiful<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:34.049> seems<00:02:34.409> like<00:02:34.799> gold<00:02:35.159> leaf<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
beautiful it seems like gold leaf the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.910 
beautiful it seems like gold leaf the
latex<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.420> there's<00:02:36.629> this<00:02:36.870> dirt<00:02:37.560> which

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
latex and there's this dirt which

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.399 
latex and there's this dirt which
suddenly<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.579> transformed<00:02:39.269> into<00:02:39.480> what<00:02:40.200> looks

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
suddenly is transformed into what looks

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.890 
suddenly is transformed into what looks
like<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.709> bejeweled<00:02:41.280> as<00:02:41.819> a<00:02:41.879> jeweled<00:02:42.329> surface

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
like a bejeweled as a jeweled surface

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.649 
like a bejeweled as a jeweled surface
nearly<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:44.280> your<00:02:44.640> eyes<00:02:44.879> are<00:02:44.909> caught<00:02:45.420> up

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
nearly and you your eyes are caught up

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.440

reasons one we're both interested in a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.630 
reasons one we're both interested in a

from<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.180> past<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:30.080> I<00:03:30.950> guess<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.280> argument

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
from the past and I guess the argument

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.460 
from the past and I guess the argument
we<00:03:31.790> will<00:03:31.940> make<00:03:32.150> is<00:03:32.420> that<00:03:32.810> actually<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.290> most

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
we will make is that actually the most

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.010 
we will make is that actually the most
radical<00:03:33.710> art<00:03:34.160> today<00:03:34.490> is<00:03:34.850> not<00:03:35.210> an<00:03:35.630> out<00:03:35.780> that

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
radical art today is not an out that

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.440 
radical art today is not an out that
rejects<00:03:36.650> history<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.340> rejects<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.150> kind<00:03:38.360> of

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
rejects history and rejects the kind of

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.780 
rejects history and rejects the kind of
layers<00:03:38.870> of<00:03:39.020> history<00:03:39.560> but<00:03:40.190> actually<00:03:40.460> the<00:03:40.550> most

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
layers of history but actually the most

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.150 
layers of history but actually the most
radical<00:03:41.060> art<00:03:41.450> is<00:03:41.660> about<00:03:41.960> preservation<00:03:42.500> and

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
radical art is about preservation and

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.860 
radical art is about preservation and
actually<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.850> most<00:03:43.970> shocking<00:03:44.420> thing<00:03:44.570> you<00:03:44.690> can

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
actually the most shocking thing you can

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.680 
actually the most shocking thing you can
do<00:03:44.990> today<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.190> protect<00:03:46.610> something<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:47.450> think

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
do today is to protect something I think

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.970 
do today is to protect something I think

about aesthetics for instance and I

about aesthetics for instance and I
think<00:04:53.200> that<00:04:53.380> it<00:04:53.500> contributes<00:04:54.010> both<00:04:54.310> ways<00:04:54.640> it

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
think that it contributes both ways it

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.270 
think that it contributes both ways it
is<00:04:55.480> a<00:04:55.510> work<00:04:55.780> that<00:04:55.990> that<00:04:56.290> resides<00:04:56.800> somewhere<00:04:57.190> in

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
is a work that that resides somewhere in

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.460 
is a work that that resides somewhere in
the<00:04:57.370> middle<00:04:57.610> between<00:04:57.730> heritage<00:04:58.360> and<00:04:58.660> art<00:04:58.930> what

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
to make pollution it's just a residue

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.950 
to make pollution it's just a residue
however<00:05:09.610> it<00:05:09.970> is<00:05:10.090> our<00:05:10.240> most<00:05:10.420> important

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
however it is our most important

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.730 
however it is our most important
cultural<00:05:11.350> product<00:05:11.800> it<00:05:12.130> is<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.970> thing<00:05:13.240> that

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
cultural product it is the thing that

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.470 
cultural product it is the thing that
will<00:05:14.740> be<00:05:14.920> around<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.460> longest<00:05:15.730> it<00:05:16.090> will<00:05:16.210> last

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
will be around the longest it will last

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.480 
will be around the longest it will last
longer<00:05:16.870> than<00:05:17.200> all<00:05:17.350> those<00:05:17.530> monuments<00:05:18.100> but<00:05:18.280> we

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
longer than all those monuments but we

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.920 
longer than all those monuments but we
can't<00:05:18.730> get<00:05:18.880> rid<00:05:19.030> of<00:05:19.150> it<00:05:19.240> so<00:05:19.450> my<00:05:19.690> work<00:05:20.380> tries<00:05:20.980> to

can't get rid of it so my work tries to

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.770 
can't get rid of it so my work tries to
raise<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.760> possibility<00:05:24.760> that<00:05:24.790> that<00:05:25.420> we<00:05:25.630> might

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
raise the possibility that that we might

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.900 
raise the possibility that that we might
consider<00:05:26.020> pollution<00:05:26.740> as<00:05:26.920> our<00:05:27.130> world<00:05:27.340> heritage

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
consider pollution as our world heritage

pollution this is not the what you see

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.910 
pollution this is not the what you see
is<00:05:54.130> not<00:05:54.430> my<00:05:55.030> work<00:05:55.330> and<00:05:55.600> as<00:05:56.080> you<00:05:56.530> know<00:05:56.620> as<00:05:56.740> much

is not my work and as you know as much

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.170 
is not my work and as you know as much
as<00:05:56.980> the<00:05:57.190> work<00:05:57.340> of<00:05:57.490> time

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
as the work of time

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.080 
as the work of time
this<00:05:59.780> is<00:05:59.930> the<00:06:00.080> originals<00:06:00.699> so<00:06:01.699> what<00:06:01.910> you're

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
this is the originals so what you're

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.730 
this is the originals so what you're
looking<00:06:02.419> at<00:06:02.509> here<00:06:02.570> this<00:06:02.960> is<00:06:03.199> this<00:06:03.530> is<00:06:03.710> a

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
looking at here this is this is a

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:13.700 
looking at here this is this is a
hundred<00:06:04.160> fifty<00:06:04.550> years<00:06:04.580> of<00:06:04.910> pollution

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.439 

and<00:06:14.220> I<00:06:14.280> think<00:06:14.340> the<00:06:14.520> future<00:06:14.820> of<00:06:14.880> this<00:06:14.970> project

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
and I think the future of this project

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.560 
and I think the future of this project
is<00:06:15.600> to<00:06:15.630> help<00:06:16.500> us<00:06:16.650> see<00:06:17.039> our<00:06:17.520> buildings<00:06:18.090> in<00:06:18.300> a<00:06:18.389> new

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
is to help us see our buildings in a new

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.810 
is to help us see our buildings in a new
way<00:06:18.810> and<00:06:19.110> therefore<00:06:19.530> maybe<00:06:19.710> see<00:06:20.009> our<00:06:20.130> lives<00:06:20.430> in

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
way and therefore maybe see our lives in

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.879 
way and therefore maybe see our lives in
a<00:06:21.539> new<00:06:21.720> way<00:06:21.900> and<00:06:22.440> this<00:06:22.590> is<00:06:22.740> something

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
a new way and this is something

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:24.110 
a new way and this is something
pretentious<00:06:23.460> to<00:06:23.610> say<00:06:23.759> but<00:06:23.970> I<00:06:24.000> think

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
pretentious to say but I think

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.379 
pretentious to say but I think
pretension<00:06:24.720> is<00:06:24.840> a<00:06:25.430> important<00:06:26.430> you<00:06:26.910> know<00:06:27.060> maybe

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
pretension is a important you know maybe

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:31.039 
pretension is a important you know maybe
you<00:06:27.479> could<00:06:27.600> say<00:06:27.780> its<00:06:27.930> ambition<00:06:28.440> also
