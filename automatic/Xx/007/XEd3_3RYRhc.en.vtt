that way I can understand why Hasbro
wanted<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.870> go<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> Marvel<00:01:01.379> Universe<00:01:01.410> route

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.860 
wanted to go the Marvel Universe route
just<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.149> fact<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.719> make

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
just because of the fact that they make

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.359 
just because of the fact that they make
so<00:01:03.989> much<00:01:04.110> more<00:01:04.260> profit<00:01:04.769> off<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.920> selling<00:01:05.189> those

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
is you know very expensive if you if you

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.499 
is you know very expensive if you if you
factor<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.830> all<00:01:25.950> those<00:01:26.130> things<00:01:26.509> Marvel

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
perspective for them to do that and then

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.859 
perspective for them to do that and then
to<00:02:04.500> go<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.920> route<00:02:05.210> but<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.390> think<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.659> they

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
to go that route but I think that they

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.350 
to go that route but I think that they
got<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.229> see<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.280> fans<00:02:08.580> want<00:02:08.879> 6<00:02:09.179> inch

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.120 
think they make from some of those
figures<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.870> retailer<00:03:07.290> gets<00:03:07.560> what<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.800> dollar

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
figures the retailer gets what a dollar

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.490 
figures the retailer gets what a dollar
maybe<00:03:08.460> two<00:03:08.700> dollars<00:03:09.090> toys<00:03:09.780> r<00:03:09.930> us<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.350> walmart

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
maybe two dollars toys r us and walmart

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.490 
maybe two dollars toys r us and walmart
gets<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.980> couple<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.280> bucks<00:03:11.460> and<00:03:11.930> then<00:03:12.930> hasbro

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
gets a couple of bucks and then hasbro

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.840 
gets a couple of bucks and then hasbro
makes<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.920> figures<00:03:14.190> for<00:03:14.220> what<00:03:14.580> do<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.700> think

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
makes the figures for what do you think

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.120 
makes the figures for what do you think
it<00:03:14.970> costs<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:16.140> produce<00:03:16.320> them<00:03:16.710> after<00:03:17.010> they're

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
it costs to produce them after they're

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.290 
it costs to produce them after they're
designed<00:03:17.490> anything<00:03:17.820> like<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.210> they're

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
designed anything like that and they're

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.390 
designed anything like that and they're
tools<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.750> everything<00:03:18.890> they<00:03:19.890> probably<00:03:20.130> cost

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
tools and everything they probably cost

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.340 
tools and everything they probably cost
like<00:03:20.520> twenty<00:03:21.000> cents<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.450> figure<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.960> make<00:03:22.140> those

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
like twenty cents a figure to make those

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.960 
like twenty cents a figure to make those
serious<00:03:23.190> like<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.430> plastic<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.910> everything

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
serious like the plastic and everything

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.240 
serious like the plastic and everything
that's<00:03:24.600> probably<00:03:24.960> like<00:03:25.110> twenty<00:03:25.440> cents<00:03:25.860> really

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
that's probably like twenty cents really

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.910 
that's probably like twenty cents really
and<00:03:26.840> they<00:03:27.840> sell<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.200> things<00:03:28.410> for<00:03:28.590> eleven

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
and they sell the things for eleven

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.070 
and they sell the things for eleven
dollars<00:03:29.090> okay<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:30.150> they're<00:03:30.420> making<00:03:30.750> like<00:03:30.900> ten

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
dollars okay so they're making like ten

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.350 
dollars okay so they're making like ten
dollars<00:03:31.350> profit<00:03:31.590> on<00:03:31.890> every<00:03:32.310> single<00:03:32.910> one<00:03:33.330> they

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
dollars profit on every single one they

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.760 
dollars profit on every single one they
sell<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.020> shipping<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.410> everything<00:03:34.500> like

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
sell the shipping and everything like

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.710 
sell the shipping and everything like
that<00:03:34.830> okay<00:03:35.550> let's<00:03:35.730> let's<00:03:36.090> round<00:03:36.240> up<00:03:36.360> let's<00:03:36.570> say

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
that okay let's let's round up let's say

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.990 
that okay let's let's round up let's say
it's<00:03:36.840> 50<00:03:37.140> cents<00:03:37.380> per<00:03:38.040> figure<00:03:38.400> by<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.550> time<00:03:38.670> it

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
it's 50 cents per figure by the time it

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.330 
it's 50 cents per figure by the time it
hits<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.270> stores<00:03:39.510> at<00:03:39.750> cost<00:03:39.930> hasbro<00:03:40.410> then<00:03:41.190> they

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
hits the stores at cost hasbro then they

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.230 
hits the stores at cost hasbro then they
sell<00:03:41.580> for<00:03:41.730> eleven<00:03:42.060> dollars

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
sell for eleven dollars

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.070 
sell for eleven dollars

figures in the smaller figures which is

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.910 
figures in the smaller figures which is
no<00:04:12.570> doubt<00:04:12.720> why<00:04:12.900> they<00:04:13.050> went<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.380> route<00:04:13.620> for

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
no doubt why they went that route for

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.950 
no doubt why they went that route for
sure<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.340> also<00:04:14.910> they<00:04:15.150> can<00:04:15.180> use<00:04:15.480> molds<00:04:15.750> from

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
sure and also they can use molds from

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.700 
sure and also they can use molds from
other<00:04:16.200> lines<00:04:16.530> like<00:04:17.299> Star<00:04:18.299> Wars<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:18.960> you<00:04:19.620> know

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:19.710 
other lines like Star Wars and you know

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.320 
other lines like Star Wars and you know
GI<00:04:19.920> Joe<00:04:20.130> have<00:04:20.280> always<00:04:20.520> been<00:04:20.670> that<00:04:20.820> size<00:04:21.030> and

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
GI Joe have always been that size and

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.300 
GI Joe have always been that size and
stuff<00:04:21.450> like<00:04:21.570> that<00:04:21.630> they<00:04:22.320> can<00:04:22.500> use<00:04:22.530> what<00:04:23.220> they

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
stuff like that they can use what they

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.190 
stuff like that they can use what they
know<00:04:23.520> from<00:04:23.760> that<00:04:23.790> to<00:04:24.600> make<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.930> universe

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
know from that to make the universe

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.540 
know from that to make the universe
figure<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:25.620> it<00:04:25.680> makes<00:04:25.860> sense

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
figure so it makes sense

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.040 
figure so it makes sense
but<00:04:26.639> I<00:04:26.699> think<00:04:26.940> they<00:04:27.060> really<00:04:27.360> got<00:04:27.539> to<00:04:27.659> see<00:04:27.840> that

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
but I think they really got to see that

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.559 
but I think they really got to see that
the<00:04:28.139> fans<00:04:28.409> want<00:04:28.800> six<00:04:29.129> inch<00:04:29.340> figures<00:04:29.759> when<00:04:30.419> they
