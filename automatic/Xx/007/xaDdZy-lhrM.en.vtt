creed black flag hands on video that was

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.030 
creed black flag hands on video that was
a<00:00:12.059> mouthful<00:00:12.509> that's<00:00:12.960> what<00:00:13.170> she<00:00:13.349> said<00:00:13.620> but

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
a mouthful that's what she said but

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.770 
a mouthful that's what she said but
let's<00:00:14.219> get<00:00:14.370> into<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.360> first<00:00:15.570> thing<00:00:15.630> I

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
let's get into it so the first thing I

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.570 
let's get into it so the first thing I
noticed<00:00:16.109> obviously<00:00:16.650> was<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.920> level<00:00:17.490> of

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
noticed obviously was the level of

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.330 
noticed obviously was the level of
graphics<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.210> was<00:00:18.330> playing<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> ps4<00:00:19.340> i'm

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
graphics it was playing on the ps4 i'm

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.950 
graphics it was playing on the ps4 i'm
not<00:00:20.520> sure<00:00:20.580> if<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:20.939> was<00:00:21.000> an<00:00:21.150> actual<00:00:21.300> piece<00:00:21.600> for<00:00:21.930> a

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
not sure if it was an actual piece for a

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.689 
not sure if it was an actual piece for a
dev<00:00:22.289> kit<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.769> really<00:00:23.039> doesn't<00:00:23.340> matter<00:00:23.430> at<00:00:23.640> this

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
dev kit it really doesn't matter at this

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.460 
dev kit it really doesn't matter at this
point<00:00:23.850> because<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.510> representing<00:00:25.230> what

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
point because it is representing what

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.099 
point because it is representing what
you<00:00:25.650> will<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:26.070> when<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.490> buy<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.730> game<00:00:27.109> when

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
you will get when you buy the game when

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.859 
you will get when you buy the game when
it<00:00:28.230> releases<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.300> this<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> thing<00:00:30.750> i

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
it releases and this is the thing i

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.479 
it releases and this is the thing i
noticed<00:00:31.199> about<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.500> game<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.830> most<00:00:32.070> would<00:00:32.340> be

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
noticed about the game the most would be

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.400 
noticed about the game the most would be
that<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.910> level<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.329> detail<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.809> they<00:00:34.170> put

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
that the level of detail that they put

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.470 
that the level of detail that they put
into<00:00:34.649> not<00:00:35.070> only<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.550> water<00:00:35.790> effects<00:00:36.270> because

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
into not only the water effects because

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.700 
into not only the water effects because
those<00:00:36.630> are<00:00:36.750> very<00:00:36.840> important<00:00:37.380> because<00:00:37.440> i<00:00:37.649> think

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
those are very important because i think

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.650 
those are very important because i think
you're<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:38.820> spending<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.210> shit<00:00:39.239> ton

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
you're going to be spending a shit ton

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.490 
you're going to be spending a shit ton
of<00:00:39.809> time<00:00:40.020> i<00:00:40.290> would<00:00:40.620> at<00:00:40.920> sea<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.820> ship<00:00:42.120> and

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
of time i would at sea on your ship and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.920 
of time i would at sea on your ship and
the<00:00:43.500> thing<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.890> noticed<00:00:44.340> about<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:45.510> level

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the thing that I noticed about the level

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.770 
the thing that I noticed about the level
design<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.860> time<00:00:47.129> around<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.940> they've

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
design this time around is that they've

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.900 
design this time around is that they've
really<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:49.710> really<00:00:49.980> paid<00:00:50.370> attention<00:00:50.399> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
really really really paid attention to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.290 
really really really paid attention to
how<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.360> ship<00:00:51.809> interacts<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.460> land<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
how the ship interacts with the land and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.020 
how the ship interacts with the land and
have<00:00:54.390> land<00:00:54.750> interacts<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> ship<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
have land interacts with the ship and

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
have land interacts with the ship and
it's<00:00:57.030> exciting<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.690> see<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.379> not<00:00:58.590> just

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it's exciting to see that it's not just

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.099 
it's exciting to see that it's not just
you<00:00:59.160> running<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.670> buildings<00:01:00.149> essentially

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
you running up buildings essentially

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.130 
you running up buildings essentially
it's<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.920> running<00:01:02.340> from<00:01:02.579> your<00:01:03.090> ship<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.930> land

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
it's you running from your ship to land

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.870 
it's you running from your ship to land
and<00:01:04.439> back<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.979> forth<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.460> not<00:01:05.640> only<00:01:05.729> that

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
and back and forth and not only that

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.480 
and back and forth and not only that
ship<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.600> ship<00:01:06.659> as<00:01:07.020> well<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:08.040> was

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
ship to ship as well and that was

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.429 
ship to ship as well and that was
probably<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.299> most<00:01:09.479> exciting<00:01:09.630> part<00:01:10.229> about

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
probably the most exciting part about

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.620 
probably the most exciting part about
the<00:01:10.799> game<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:11.729> got<00:01:12.030> me<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> thought

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the game that really got me I thought

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.730 
the game that really got me I thought
you<00:01:13.439> know<00:01:13.560> I'm<00:01:13.740> not<00:01:13.920> necessarily<00:01:14.700> huge<00:01:15.090> huge

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
you know I'm not necessarily huge huge

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.530 
you know I'm not necessarily huge huge
Assassin's<00:01:16.740> Creed<00:01:16.979> fan<00:01:17.369> I'm<00:01:17.880> not<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> huge<00:01:18.420> fan

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
Assassin's Creed fan I'm not a huge fan

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.020 
Assassin's Creed fan I'm not a huge fan
of<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.189> admit<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.430> when<00:01:20.880> at

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
of it but I have to admit that when at

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.090 
of it but I have to admit that when at
when<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> played<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.780> demo<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.380> thought<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
when I played the demo I thought that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.620 
when I played the demo I thought that
this<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.369> something<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.060> even<00:01:24.119> seen<00:01:24.479> in

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
this is something and we even seen in

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.840 
this is something and we even seen in
the<00:01:24.720> series<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.290> something<00:01:25.590> new<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.100> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the series is something new and it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.670 
the series is something new and it
actually<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.330> working<00:01:27.689> quite<00:01:28.020> well<00:01:28.170> so

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
actually is working quite well so

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.230 
actually is working quite well so
another<00:01:29.100> thing<00:01:29.189> I've<00:01:29.430> noticed<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.030> game

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
another thing I've noticed in this game

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.569 
another thing I've noticed in this game
would<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> character<00:01:31.229> designs<00:01:31.619> I've<00:01:32.130> seen

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
would be the character designs I've seen

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.490 
would be the character designs I've seen
you<00:01:33.540> know<00:01:33.630> stuff<00:01:33.869> I'm<00:01:34.020> not<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.320> mention

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
you know stuff I'm not going to mention

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.200 
you know stuff I'm not going to mention
on<00:01:34.799> another<00:01:35.189> game<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.460> I'm<00:01:35.790> not<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.150> to

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
on another game that I'm not going to

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.690 
on another game that I'm not going to
cover<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.720> any<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.049> these<00:01:37.170> videos<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.070> saw

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
cover in any of these videos but I saw

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.940 
cover in any of these videos but I saw
something<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.659> another<00:01:39.780> game<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.409> i<00:01:40.439> truly

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
something in another game and i truly

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.499 
something in another game and i truly
felt<00:01:41.310> like<00:01:41.549> that's<00:01:42.150> not<00:01:43.369> next-gen<00:01:44.369> what<00:01:45.299> I

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
felt like that's not next-gen what I

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.910 
felt like that's not next-gen what I
don't<00:01:45.780> know<00:01:45.840> what<00:01:45.990> happened<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.710> in

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
don't know what happened there but in

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
with the ship and not only that when

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.339 
with the ship and not only that when
other<00:02:43.160> ships<00:02:43.489> approach<00:02:43.940> your<00:02:44.209> ship<00:02:44.510> if

was very impressive to me that you could
do<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:07.730> now<00:03:08.090> in<00:03:08.360> this<00:03:08.799> essentially<00:03:09.799> open

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
do that now in this essentially open

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.699 
do that now in this essentially open
world<00:03:10.459> feeling<00:03:10.849> game<00:03:11.299> that<00:03:12.230> was<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.590> other

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
world feeling game that was the other

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.949 
world feeling game that was the other
aspect<00:03:13.099> of<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:13.489> game<00:03:13.700> that<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.910> truly<00:03:14.510> enjoyed

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
aspect of this game that I truly enjoyed

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.430 
aspect of this game that I truly enjoyed
was<00:03:15.519> when<00:03:16.519> you're<00:03:16.700> on<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:16.850> ship<00:03:17.290> versus<00:03:18.290> when

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
was when you're on the ship versus when

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.890 
was when you're on the ship versus when
you're<00:03:18.590> on<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.709> land<00:03:19.209> these<00:03:20.209> two<00:03:20.450> things<00:03:20.660> are

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
you're on the land these two things are

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.110 
you're on the land these two things are
seamless<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.650> it's<00:03:21.920> not<00:03:22.100> like<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.310> loading

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
seamless and it's not like a loading

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.819 
seamless and it's not like a loading
thing<00:03:23.389> these<00:03:23.630> are<00:03:23.900> happening<00:03:24.530> in<00:03:24.590> real<00:03:24.769> time

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
thing these are happening in real time

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.520 
thing these are happening in real time
and<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.430> can<00:03:25.609> literally<00:03:26.359> crash<00:03:27.019> your<00:03:27.290> ship

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
and you can literally crash your ship

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.220 
and you can literally crash your ship
into<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:27.859> shore<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:28.430> jump<00:03:28.790> off<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.359> you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
into the shore and jump off of it you

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.809 
into the shore and jump off of it you
can<00:03:30.380> crash<00:03:30.560> your<00:03:30.799> ship<00:03:30.980> into<00:03:31.250> another<00:03:31.549> ship

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
can crash your ship into another ship

stuff and that's what I got what I
didn't<00:04:32.450> expect<00:04:32.810> was<00:04:32.990> how<00:04:33.700> smooth<00:04:34.870> transition

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870

would<00:04:36.080> be<00:04:36.260> now<00:04:36.500> between<00:04:37.490> like<00:04:37.760> jumping<00:04:38.090> up<00:04:38.180> and

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.190 
see essentially what's happening you
can't<00:05:16.130> see<00:05:16.310> in<00:05:16.490> a<00:05:16.580> storm<00:05:16.940> like<00:05:17.030> it's<00:05:17.540> it's<00:05:17.900> it's

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
can't see in a storm like it's it's it's

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.250 
can't see in a storm like it's it's it's
it's<00:05:18.830> exciting<00:05:19.550> experience<00:05:20.390> so<00:05:20.990> my<00:05:21.140> overall

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
it's exciting experience so my overall

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.470 
it's exciting experience so my overall
thought<00:05:21.770> on<00:05:22.010> a<00:05:22.040> secure<00:05:22.610> Black<00:05:22.850> Flag<00:05:23.120> would<00:05:23.360> be

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
thought on a secure Black Flag would be

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.260 
thought on a secure Black Flag would be
that<00:05:23.720> the<00:05:24.290> ship<00:05:24.560> portions<00:05:25.460> of<00:05:25.640> the<00:05:25.760> game<00:05:25.970> and

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
that the ship portions of the game and

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.690 
that the ship portions of the game and
I'm<00:05:26.510> saying<00:05:26.870> portions<00:05:27.500> lightly<00:05:28.280> because<00:05:28.460> i'm

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
I'm saying portions lightly because i'm

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.940 
I'm saying portions lightly because i'm
pretty<00:05:28.880> sure<00:05:29.210> that<00:05:29.240> a<00:05:29.690> lot<00:05:29.960> of<00:05:30.290> the<00:05:30.500> game<00:05:30.680> if

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
pretty sure that a lot of the game if

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.060 
pretty sure that a lot of the game if
not<00:05:31.250> all<00:05:31.520> of<00:05:31.550> it<00:05:31.790> takes<00:05:32.060> place<00:05:32.450> on<00:05:32.660> a<00:05:32.690> ship<00:05:33.070> and

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
not all of it takes place on a ship and

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.190 
not all of it takes place on a ship and
and<00:05:34.520> that's<00:05:34.700> probably<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.480> most<00:05:35.660> important

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
and that's probably the most important

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.350 
and that's probably the most important
part<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.590> the<00:05:36.890> assassins<00:05:37.430> creed<00:05:37.640> series<00:05:38.030> now

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
part of the assassins creed series now

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.110 
part of the assassins creed series now
and<00:05:39.230> that<00:05:39.470> would<00:05:39.620> be<00:05:39.650> that<00:05:39.800> they<00:05:40.580> need<00:05:41.090> to

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
and that would be that they need to

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.000 
and that would be that they need to
change<00:05:41.900> it<00:05:42.080> up<00:05:42.200> it<00:05:42.410> needs<00:05:42.590> to<00:05:42.680> be<00:05:42.800> something

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
change it up it needs to be something

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.340 
change it up it needs to be something
else<00:05:43.310> it<00:05:43.669> means<00:05:44.030> to<00:05:44.270> not<00:05:44.300> be<00:05:44.690> climbing<00:05:45.230> up

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
else it means to not be climbing up

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.110 
else it means to not be climbing up
buildings<00:05:45.740> and<00:05:45.919> jumping<00:05:46.250> into<00:05:46.370> haystacks<00:05:46.880> and

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
buildings and jumping into haystacks and

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.420 
buildings and jumping into haystacks and
and<00:05:47.810> that<00:05:47.990> definitely<00:05:48.350> is<00:05:48.680> not<00:05:48.890> what<00:05:49.130> the<00:05:49.250> game

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
and that definitely is not what the game

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.790 
and that definitely is not what the game
is<00:05:49.460> about<00:05:49.610> is<00:05:50.060> that<00:05:50.660> in<00:05:50.840> the<00:05:50.960> game<00:05:51.140> still<00:05:51.470> yes

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
is about is that in the game still yes

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.370 
is about is that in the game still yes
it<00:05:51.950> is<00:05:52.070> in<00:05:52.160> the<00:05:52.250> game<00:05:52.460> so<00:05:52.700> you'll<00:05:52.880> be<00:05:53.030> very<00:05:53.380> used

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
it is in the game so you'll be very used

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.830 
it is in the game so you'll be very used
to<00:05:54.470> those<00:05:54.710> parts<00:05:55.400> of<00:05:55.520> the<00:05:55.610> missions<00:05:55.970> but<00:05:56.240> in

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
to those parts of the missions but in

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.200 
to those parts of the missions but in
terms<00:05:57.169> of<00:05:57.380> the<00:05:57.680> actual<00:05:58.070> gameplay<00:05:58.460> I<00:05:58.700> can<00:05:58.910> sense

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
terms of the actual gameplay I can sense

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.050 
terms of the actual gameplay I can sense
that<00:05:59.450> that<00:05:59.720> how<00:06:00.530> important<00:06:01.100> it<00:06:01.250> is<00:06:01.280> that<00:06:01.669> you

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
that that how important it is that you

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.390 
that that how important it is that you
stay<00:06:02.540> on<00:06:02.570> your<00:06:02.690> ship<00:06:03.050> versus<00:06:03.680> how<00:06:03.860> you<00:06:03.919> stay<00:06:04.370> on

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
stay on your ship versus how you stay on

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.210 
stay on your ship versus how you stay on
land<00:06:04.730> and<00:06:05.060> vice<00:06:05.720> versa<00:06:06.050> how<00:06:06.620> important<00:06:07.040> it<00:06:07.190> is

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
land and vice versa how important it is

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.220 
land and vice versa how important it is
that<00:06:07.310> you<00:06:07.490> go<00:06:07.850> back<00:06:07.880> and<00:06:08.240> forth<00:06:08.570> between<00:06:08.840> these

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
that you go back and forth between these

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.290 
that you go back and forth between these
things<00:06:09.530> and<00:06:09.800> collect<00:06:10.160> goods<00:06:10.490> and<00:06:10.820> items<00:06:11.120> and

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.909 
things and collect goods and items and
bring<00:06:11.510> them<00:06:11.630> back<00:06:11.660> to<00:06:11.930> the<00:06:12.050> ship<00:06:12.260> that's

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
bring them back to the ship that's

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:14.650 
bring them back to the ship that's
what's<00:06:13.280> exciting<00:06:13.460> about<00:06:13.820> the<00:06:14.150> demo<00:06:14.390> and

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
what's exciting about the demo and

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.000 
what's exciting about the demo and
that's<00:06:14.780> what<00:06:14.990> I<00:06:15.020> think<00:06:15.530> is<00:06:15.650> going<00:06:15.830> to<00:06:15.950> be

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
that's what I think is going to be

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.350 
that's what I think is going to be
exciting<00:06:16.310> about<00:06:16.520> the<00:06:16.730> game<00:06:16.910> when<00:06:17.090> it<00:06:17.180> comes

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
exciting about the game when it comes

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.140 
exciting about the game when it comes
out<00:06:17.510> later<00:06:18.200> this<00:06:18.470> year<00:06:18.530> so<00:06:19.100> that's<00:06:19.910> what<00:06:20.120> I

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
out later this year so that's what I

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.750 
out later this year so that's what I
think<00:06:20.390> about<00:06:20.450> assassins<00:06:21.020> creed<00:06:21.169> 4<00:06:21.340> there's<00:06:22.340> a

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
think about assassins creed 4 there's a

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.909 
think about assassins creed 4 there's a

that they've taken in directions that

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.320 
that they've taken in directions that
