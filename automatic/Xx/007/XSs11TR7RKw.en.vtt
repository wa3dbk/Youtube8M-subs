00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:12.400
I am speaking with Ms. Iwamuro of Nippon Naporitan Gakkai to learn how to cook delicious Napolitan.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.280
The chewiness of the spaghetti is important, for sure!

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.580
And you cook it well with...

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.180
[sniff, sniff] Smells nice!

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.380
And finally...

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.780
Oops, I forgot!

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.020
Please let us know about Nippon Naporitan Gakkai!

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.960
Cooking Napolitan in Napoli.  Really impressive!

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.320
May Napolitan become widely spread in the world!

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.600
One restaurant works together with Nippon Naporitan Gakkai to spread Napolitan throughout the world.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.020
Today, I am going to sneak into the factory!

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.240
To our surprise, Minoya Arare Seizohompo makes Napolitan-flavored cubic rice crackers!

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.620
They are dried with a machine in the end.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.060
The colors look great with green peas inside!

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.320
Does everybody know kaki no tane?

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.020
Finally, I will enjoy Napolitan at a restaurant!

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.940
We are visiting Center Grill.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.540
They are the first restaurant to be certified by Nippon Naporitan Gakkai.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.460
I am sure my mouth is going to be all red with ketchup, because...

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.820
The former owner of Center Grill worked as a chef for Center Hotel,

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.740
which was run by the first master chef of the Hotel [New] Grand, Saly Weil.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.780
High-grade tomatoes were used at the hotel.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.380
Center Grill opened as a Western-food restaurant for townspeople and makes Napolitan using ketchup.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.740
I understand you can visit, even if you can't speak Japanese!

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.340
Oh, I am full. ❤

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.560
I must go now; Chef is waiting for me.
