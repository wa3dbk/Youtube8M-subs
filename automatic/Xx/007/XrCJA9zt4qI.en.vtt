00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.729
Hello friends! Today we will make a main course

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:14.649
a breaded chicken

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:20.300
which is one of the preparations that can give us some kind of difficulty by the breaded

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.920
so, we started to look for recipes and found this, which we loved.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.339
We made some adjustments

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.289
and the result, the truth that fascinated us

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.750
This is one of our favorite dishes, so I want to share with you

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.560
So I invite you to see the ingredients and then the directions.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.570
The ingredients are: this is a chicken breast

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.260
we bone it, we removed all the skin and fat

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.790
and roughly cut into thin slices

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.180
and gave practically about 11 sheets

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.500
here we have oregano, which is roughly 1 teaspoonful

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.450
1 teaspoon red pepper

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.160
and 1 teaspoon curry

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.660
here is 1 tablespoon toasted sesame

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.720
Salt is as you  like, 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.270
This is peppercorns, which will grind in the minute

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.230
here are about 4 tablespoons cornstarch

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.570
this is 3/4 cup chopped parsley

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.920
There is here about 10 tablespoons chuchoca 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.090
and 1 large egg

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.180
Friends, the preparation is as follows

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.890
in the bowl where we had chuchoca, place the chopped parsley, which must be dry

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.990
and sesame, and species.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.990
Salt and pepper.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.320
In another bowl, we will place the egg

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.210
and another dish we will place the cornstarch

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.710
and we will join the chuchoca well with parsley and spices

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.959
in the bowl where we had the egg, we'll beat

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.519
and it's time to put salt and pepper to taste

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.639
and the procedure is as follows:

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:34.229
We will pass the chicken breast into  the cornstarch

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.369
then we will go through the beaten egg

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:43.649
&nbsp;and finally, we will end where is the chuchoca with parsley and spices

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:46.649
and we will cover either piece of chicken

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.479
and we will leave on a plate

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.420
and once you're done with all the pieces of chicken breast

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:59.809
we will leave in the refrigerator, hopefully for 1/2 hour or 1 hour

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.069
[A little before removing the chicken from the refrigerator] Let's heat a skillet

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.739
we will place vegetable oil

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.759
and we will wait for the oil to warm

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:17.379
generally test a bit chicken  to see if you have the proper temperature

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.629
let's go slowly frying

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.379
Once browned, we will place on both sides

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.459
we will put on a plate with paper towels

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:35.739
and our proposal is served with salad. In this case, as you will see on the plate

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.719
has avocado [avocado], potatoes and cherry tomatoes with a little chives

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.479
and enjoy it

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:50.319
Friends, I hope you liked this proposal for a main course

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.679
generally, we can offer some kind of difficulty in the issue of breaded

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:59.579

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.159
