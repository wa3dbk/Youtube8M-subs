fast song then you have to listen a
whole<00:00:46.469> bunch<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.829> plans<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.460> take<00:00:48.149> your<00:00:48.270> time

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329

whole bunch of plans so take your time
and<00:00:48.710> save<00:00:49.710> after<00:00:50.690> about<00:00:51.690> five<00:00:52.050> markers<00:00:52.879> okay

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
and save after about five markers okay

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.139 
and save after about five markers okay
so<00:00:55.110> i<00:00:55.140> already<00:00:55.590> prepared<00:00:55.860> he<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.730> something

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
so i already prepared he is something

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.360 
so i already prepared he is something
and<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.699> first<00:01:00.000> job<00:01:00.270> should<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:00.930> done<00:01:01.289> in

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
and so the first job should be done in

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.719 
and so the first job should be done in
normal<00:01:02.370> normal<00:01:03.300> time<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.189> when<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.339> got<00:01:05.549> that

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
normal normal time and when we got that

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.760 
normal normal time and when we got that
shot<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.479> make<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> right<00:01:06.960> click<00:01:07.080> inside<00:01:07.619> an

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
shot we make a right click inside an

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.640 
shot we make a right click inside an
envelope<00:01:08.180> incident<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.630> move<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.140> willow<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
envelope incident we move and willow and

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.460 
envelope incident we move and willow and
then<00:01:11.010> velocity<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.770> way<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
then velocity so it's the way it's the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.640 
then velocity so it's the way it's the
it<00:01:16.740> comes<00:01:17.130> right<00:01:17.610> before<00:01:18.890> event<00:01:19.890> events<00:01:21.650> right

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it comes right before event events right

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.310 
it comes right before event events right
after<00:01:23.040> okay<00:01:25.610> so<00:01:26.610> um<00:01:27.030> make<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> right<00:01:27.720> click<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
after okay so um make a right click and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.480 
after okay so um make a right click and
then<00:01:28.470> add<00:01:28.770> point<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.310> then<00:01:30.090> put<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.510> to<00:01:30.900> whoops

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
then add point and then put it to whoops

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.820 
then add point and then put it to whoops
put<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.030> first<00:01:33.360> point<00:01:33.630> set<00:01:34.620> it<00:01:34.710> on

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
put it to the first point set it on

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.870 
put it to the first point set it on
normal<00:01:35.070> velocity<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:37.070> right<00:01:38.070> after<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.460> one

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
normal velocity and right after that one

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.980 
normal velocity and right after that one
keyframe<00:01:39.180> make<00:01:39.900> another<00:01:40.260> point<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.810> drag<00:01:42.810> it

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
keyframe make another point and drag it

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.219 
keyframe make another point and drag it
up<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:44.450> 300<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.380> clip<00:01:46.760> so<00:01:47.760> we<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.479> we

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
up to 300 for this clip so we can we

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.270 
up to 300 for this clip so we can we
have<00:01:49.440> at<00:01:49.800> our<00:01:49.860> second<00:01:50.490> marker<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.000> kill<00:01:51.300> again

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
have at our second marker a kill again

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.160 
have at our second marker a kill again
ok<00:01:53.280> now<00:01:53.820> let's<00:01:55.190> watch<00:01:56.190> our<00:01:56.610> clip<00:01:57.150> ok<00:01:57.690> so<00:01:57.750> that's

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
too fast so we go on offered at a point

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.270 
too fast so we go on offered at a point

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
50 make a keyframe a

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.920 
50 make a keyframe a
point<00:03:34.920> sorry<00:03:35.489> for<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:35.970> one<00:03:36.750> frame

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
point sorry for that and one frame

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.960 
point sorry for that and one frame
behind<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.590> i'll<00:03:37.769> make<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:37.980> level<00:03:38.310> point<00:03:38.670> and

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
behind it i'll make it level point and

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.420 
behind it i'll make it level point and
then<00:03:39.120> i<00:03:39.239> put<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.989> 25<00:03:40.470> because<00:03:40.650> this<00:03:40.980> my<00:03:41.190> slow

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
then i put it to 25 because this my slow

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.940 
then i put it to 25 because this my slow
motion<00:03:41.849> or<00:03:42.599> velocity<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:44.569> you<00:03:45.569> can<00:03:45.840> do<00:03:46.769> this

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
motion or velocity and you can do this

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.339 
motion or velocity and you can do this
by<00:03:47.280> making<00:03:47.670> right<00:03:48.360> click<00:03:48.599> on<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.750> point<00:03:49.049> and

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
by making right click on a point and

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.800 
by making right click on a point and
then<00:03:49.530> set<00:03:49.830> to<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.519> then<00:03:51.180> just<00:03:51.510> give<00:03:51.690> him

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
then set to and then just give him

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.920 
then set to and then just give him
twenty<00:03:52.170> five<00:03:52.319> percent<00:03:52.349> as<00:03:53.129> an<00:03:53.370> example<00:03:53.930> okay

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
twenty five percent as an example okay

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.850 
twenty five percent as an example okay
so<00:03:55.830> now<00:03:56.040> we<00:03:56.099> got<00:03:56.459> that<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:57.230> click<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.440> drag<00:03:58.680> it

so now we got that and click and drag it

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.500 
so now we got that and click and drag it
in<00:03:59.129> here<00:03:59.430> so<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.180> looks<00:04:00.629> pretty<00:04:00.810> nice<00:04:01.079> and<00:04:02.510> now
