00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.640 
like those rights to Trump and I picked
my<00:00:08.820> branches<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.660> granite<00:00:09.870> now<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.410> mean<00:00:10.559> you

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
my branches and granite now I mean you

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.230 
my branches and granite now I mean you
can<00:00:10.800> see<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.040> Big<00:00:11.309> Pun<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:11.700> was<00:00:11.820> original<00:00:12.179> I

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
can see the Big Pun that was original I

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.570 
can see the Big Pun that was original I
know<00:00:12.990> these<00:00:13.440> branches<00:00:13.980> have<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.250> cut<00:00:14.429> off

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
know these branches have to cut off

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.529 
know these branches have to cut off
again<00:00:14.969> right<00:00:15.360> back<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.170> regrow<00:00:16.710> but<00:00:17.420> you<00:00:18.420> know

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
again right back and regrow but you know

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.929 
again right back and regrow but you know
I<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.439> just<00:00:19.680> got<00:00:19.859> such<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> great<00:00:20.460> all

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
I have it's just got such a great all

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.050 
I have it's just got such a great all
right<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.270> now<00:00:22.310> what<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.430> said<00:00:23.670> before<00:00:23.820> about

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
right and now what you said before about

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.259 
right and now what you said before about
cutting<00:00:24.840> roots<00:00:25.230> off<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.920> pruning<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:27.150> it

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
cutting roots off and pruning I just it

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.169 
cutting roots off and pruning I just it
went<00:00:27.570> everything<00:00:28.260> contrary<00:00:28.769> until<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.429> place

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
went everything contrary until I place

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:53.600 
went everything contrary until I place
the<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:31.790> doesn't<00:00:33.410> slow<00:00:34.410> because<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:52.579> and<00:00:53.579> you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the it doesn't slow because it's and you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.330 
the it doesn't slow because it's and you
have<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.480> chop<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.930> line<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.920> know<00:00:59.039> tree

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
have to chop it to line you know tree

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.260 
have to chop it to line you know tree
aligned<00:01:02.090> with<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.769> yeah<00:01:04.769> yeah<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.970> would<00:01:06.150> be

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
aligned with this yeah yeah it would be

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.539 
aligned with this yeah yeah it would be
ideal<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.930> winter<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.890> granted<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.460> would

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
ideal to winter and granted it would

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.120 
ideal to winter and granted it would
probably<00:01:09.390> be<00:01:09.540> best<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.140> all<00:01:10.260> day<00:01:10.560> workshop

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
probably be best is it all day workshop

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.460 
probably be best is it all day workshop
yeah<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.210> told<00:01:12.510> Michael<00:01:12.960> paper<00:01:13.200> back<00:01:13.439> to

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
yeah but I told Michael paper back to

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.679 
yeah but I told Michael paper back to
these<00:01:13.799> prep<00:01:14.549> them<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.450> he

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
because he said you know maybe have you

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:27.859 
because he said you know maybe have you
back<00:01:25.610> yeah<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:27.479> great

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
back yeah it's great

back yeah it's great
yeah<00:01:28.200> great<00:01:28.560> they<00:01:28.680> go<00:01:28.799> along<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> specimen

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
yeah great they go along with a specimen

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.690 
yeah great they go along with a specimen
trees<00:01:29.850> right<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.780> side<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.700> because

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
trees right in one side right because

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.969 
trees right in one side right because
this<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.500> what<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.710> okay<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.590> just

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
this is what I do okay so it's it's just

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.080 
this is what I do okay so it's it's just
one<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.159> those<00:01:41.280> things<00:01:41.490> that's<00:01:41.579> hard<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.939> get

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
one of those things that's hard to get

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.850 
one of those things that's hard to get
over<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.540> New<00:01:42.659> England<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.710> has

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
over in New England is you know this has

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.469 
over in New England is you know this has
been<00:01:43.890> basically<00:01:44.340> two<00:01:44.579> years<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.060> last<00:01:45.180> year<00:01:45.360> I

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
been basically two years and last year I

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.330 
been basically two years and last year I
just<00:01:45.540> sheared<00:01:46.049> right<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.009> keep<00:01:47.159> it

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
just sheared right just to keep it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.420 
just sheared right just to keep it
exactly<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.180> let<00:01:48.540> branches<00:01:49.020> grow<00:01:49.430> because

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
exactly and let branches grow because

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.929 
exactly and let branches grow because
now<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.450> thin<00:01:51.750> out<00:01:52.009> again<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.520> big<00:01:53.700> heavy

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
now it's thin out again the big heavy

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.910 
now it's thin out again the big heavy
ones<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.479> cut<00:01:54.659> back<00:01:54.899> right<00:01:55.409> pull<00:01:55.740> out

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
ones have to be cut back right pull out

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.639 
ones have to be cut back right pull out
a<00:01:55.950> new<00:01:56.280> shoot<00:01:57.030> right<00:01:57.570> now<00:01:57.960> when<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.229> take<00:01:58.439> off

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
a new shoot right now when you take off

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.670 
a new shoot right now when you take off
a<00:01:58.680> big<00:01:58.950> branch<00:01:59.250> I'm<00:01:59.850> more<00:02:00.090> apt<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.509> leave<00:02:00.750> like

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
a big branch I'm more apt to leave like

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.920 
a big branch I'm more apt to leave like
a<00:02:01.710> stub<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.399> then<00:02:02.820> pull<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> branch<00:02:03.450> off<00:02:03.689> that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
a stub and then pull a branch off that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.440 
a stub and then pull a branch off that
then<00:02:04.170> trim<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.560> down<00:02:04.680> would<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:06.149> cut

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
then trim it down would you just cut

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.389 
then trim it down would you just cut
right<00:02:06.750> back<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> trunk<00:02:07.500> leave<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.099> collar

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
right back to the trunk leave the collar

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.339 
right back to the trunk leave the collar
a<00:02:08.550> little<00:02:08.879> bit<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.239> let<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.780> was<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.170> a

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
a little bit and let it I was on a

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.619 
a little bit and let it I was on a
one-year<00:02:10.830> plan<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.430> cut<00:02:11.849> right<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.330> trunk

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
one-year plan I cut right to the trunk

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.500 
one-year plan I cut right to the trunk
okay<00:02:12.989> if<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.379> was<00:02:13.590> gonna<00:02:13.770> prep<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.430> for<00:02:14.849> eight

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
okay if I was gonna prep this for eight

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.119 
okay if I was gonna prep this for eight
months<00:02:15.780> from<00:02:16.080> now<00:02:16.230> six<00:02:16.260> months<00:02:16.650> from<00:02:16.950> now

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
months from now six months from now

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.479 
months from now six months from now
stuff<00:02:17.550> I'd<00:02:17.760> leave<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.150> stuff<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.620> say<00:02:20.220> cut

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
stuff I'd leave this stuff and I say cut

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.760 
stuff I'd leave this stuff and I say cut
right<00:02:20.670> back<00:02:20.849> down<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.450> lower<00:02:21.720> ones<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.470> might

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
right back down the lower ones I might

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.770 
right back down the lower ones I might
leave<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.069> stub<00:02:23.489> more<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.120> because<00:02:24.330> then<00:02:24.629> you

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
leave a stub more so because then you

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.839 
leave a stub more so because then you
have<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:24.989> transition<00:02:25.709> right<00:02:26.129> you<00:02:26.400> larger

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
have a transition right you larger

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.670 
have a transition right you larger
branches<00:02:27.360> yeah<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:28.349> below<00:02:28.620> taper<00:02:29.180> yeah

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
branches yeah you can below taper yeah

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.009 
branches yeah you can below taper yeah
this<00:02:31.680> like<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.069> we'd<00:02:32.670> leave<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.269> yeah<00:02:33.720> and

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
this like this we'd leave this yeah and

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.199 
this like this we'd leave this yeah and
then<00:02:34.200> trim<00:02:34.500> these<00:02:34.650> right<00:02:35.069> here<00:02:35.459> honey<00:02:35.910> have

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
then trim these right here honey have

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.360 
then trim these right here honey have
the<00:02:36.390> larger<00:02:36.780> branches<00:02:36.930> all<00:02:37.709> or<00:02:37.890> bottom<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
the larger branches all or bottom and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.250 
the larger branches all or bottom and
then<00:02:38.550> at<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:38.970> stage<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.569> get<00:02:39.780> some<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.230> that

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
then at this stage you get some of that

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.740 
then at this stage you get some of that
onion<00:02:40.920> ating<00:02:41.420> characteristic<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
onion ating characteristic of the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.199 
onion ating characteristic of the
Taiwanese<00:02:43.140> ripeness<00:02:43.650> right<00:02:44.220> but<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.150> is

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
Taiwanese ripeness right but this is

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.559 
Taiwanese ripeness right but this is
this<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:46.080> ideal<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.910> whenever<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.120> try<00:02:48.420> and

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
this is ideal and whenever I try and

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.740 
this is ideal and whenever I try and
prep<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.050> material<00:02:49.620> like<00:02:49.830> they're<00:02:50.370> coming

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
prep the material like they're coming

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.420 
prep the material like they're coming

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
week they'll pull this up and that's

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.050 
week they'll pull this up and that's
exactly<00:02:57.020> what<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.650> do<00:02:57.770> and<00:02:58.010> I<00:02:58.100> hold<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.550> for<00:02:58.790> a

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
exactly what I do and I hold it for a

exactly what I do and I hold it for a
year<00:02:59.240> to<00:02:59.390> try<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.780> give<00:03:00.080> them<00:03:00.260> something<00:03:00.620> so

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
year to try and give them something so

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.070 
year to try and give them something so
the<00:03:01.430> people<00:03:01.610> don't<00:03:01.850> leave<00:03:02.120> with<00:03:02.390> stumps<00:03:02.870> right

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
the people don't leave with stumps right

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.840 
the people don't leave with stumps right
because<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:04.100> know<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.430> I'd<00:03:04.610> much<00:03:04.790> rather

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
because I you know it I'd much rather

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.050 
because I you know it I'd much rather
work<00:03:05.420> with<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.950> student<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.100> have<00:03:07.550> them<00:03:07.790> leave

work with a student and have them leave

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.630 
work with a student and have them leave
with<00:03:08.390> like<00:03:08.810> you<00:03:08.990> said<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.230> finished<00:03:09.800> tree<00:03:10.220> right

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
with like you said a finished tree right

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.970 
with like you said a finished tree right
maybe<00:03:11.090> not<00:03:11.360> finished<00:03:11.840> in<00:03:12.050> somebody's<00:03:12.680> major

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
maybe not finished in somebody's major

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.060 
maybe not finished in somebody's major
styling<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.260> silhouette<00:03:15.260> right<00:03:15.620> that's<00:03:15.860> why

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
styling and silhouette right that's why

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.960 
styling and silhouette right that's why
not<00:03:16.850> just<00:03:17.150> branches<00:03:17.690> right<00:03:18.500> so<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:19.250> but

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
not just branches right so and but

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.130 
not just branches right so and but
you're<00:03:20.150> right<00:03:20.360> you<00:03:20.600> know<00:03:20.720> like<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:21.080> said

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
you're right you know like I said

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.440 
you're right you know like I said
plating<00:03:21.890> them<00:03:22.040> at<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.280> same<00:03:22.490> time<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:23.090> mean

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
plating them at the same time I mean

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.870 
plating them at the same time I mean
obviously<00:03:23.660> this<00:03:24.170> stood<00:03:24.470> fine<00:03:24.770> in<00:03:25.040> here<00:03:25.340> but<00:03:25.640> I

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
obviously this stood fine in here but I

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.510 
obviously this stood fine in here but I
think<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.390> get<00:03:26.690> even<00:03:27.200> more<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:28.250> you'd

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
think you get even more and you'd

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.630 
think you get even more and you'd
improve<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.180> route<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.600> you<00:03:29.840> have<00:03:30.170> less<00:03:30.640> then

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
improve the route and you have less then

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.310 
improve the route and you have less then
the<00:03:31.790> nursery<00:03:32.300> of<00:03:32.570> people<00:03:32.989> are<00:03:33.110> more

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
the nursery of people are more

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.930 
the nursery of people are more
comfortable<00:03:33.620> if<00:03:34.400> you<00:03:34.580> try<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:34.910> mark<00:03:35.330> oh<00:03:35.480> yes

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
comfortable if you try and mark oh yes

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.880 
comfortable if you try and mark oh yes
I<00:03:37.940> don't<00:03:38.270> want<00:03:38.420> but<00:03:38.870> if<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.140> market<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.680> and

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
I don't want but if you market it and

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.860 
I don't want but if you market it and
then<00:03:40.040> if<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.310> clean<00:03:40.730> in<00:03:40.910> like<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.090> 12-inch<00:03:41.600> both

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
then if you clean in like a 12-inch both

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.050 
then if you clean in like a 12-inch both
man<00:03:42.140> yeah<00:03:42.380> then<00:03:42.770> you<00:03:43.310> don't<00:03:43.489> have<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:43.730> push

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
man yeah then you don't have to push

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.910 
man yeah then you don't have to push
necessarily<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:44.900> repotting<00:03:45.500> at<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.709> same

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
necessarily to repotting at the same

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.710 
necessarily to repotting at the same
time<00:03:46.190> either<00:03:46.400> because<00:03:46.730> it's<00:03:46.910> manageable<00:03:47.480> to

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
time either because it's manageable to

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.309 
time either because it's manageable to
take<00:03:47.930> home<00:03:48.170> right<00:03:48.410> so<00:03:48.950> I<00:03:49.280> agree<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:50.120> yes

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
take home right so I agree in yes

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.099 
take home right so I agree in yes
I'm<00:03:51.890> trying<00:03:52.219> to<00:03:52.280> get<00:03:52.430> ideas<00:03:52.579> for<00:03:52.900> speakers<00:03:53.900> at
