 our way of working new choreographies we know 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.030

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.030
 % all to safi to enriches to 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.970
 his own inspiration 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.010
 there is a real kindness politeness to get exasperated on the part of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.150
 what we do especially precisely the fans we have a great admiration a big 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.370
 respect 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.370
 it's pretty touching pretty impressive 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.520
 we know that we are better and recently it always makes me the same 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.630
 effect this mercato in France we are a farmer of dance also a 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.050
 tradition and all that but there is little not such a craze and that it exceeds 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.300
 not the few 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.930
 philippe muller a few audience worse of subscribers who is well 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.659
 often see the shows at this news turf one of them dancers 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.880
 so the tours a little difficult 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.970
 at the opera game the show is announced in the autumn 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.610
 but especially here to a lot of things that happen and the launch of the DVD 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.359
 it's on the opera we also come back on tour with the jda the cinderella 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.620
 one of those who have nothing more to an advanced match is more time finally 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.410
 in the opportunity to debate meetings exchanges ben is true 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.900
 that this festival was one of the dreams that I could have as 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.900
 that dancer is more about continuity on 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
 that precisely a precise element 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.080
 I was delighted to be a japan and become a member dancing here 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.899
 I was delighted with the welcome I could have and percent and I hope that 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.309
 these are we who could attend the festival that they liked and then 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:18.719
 the one that makes them discover the artists the lists of the latifi 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.199
 horrors will be interested and inquire to come see again 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.379
 finally you come to discover the dance is a 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.709
 and things do not work
