00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.549
 another small addition video from 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.460
 your regiment dreary today it is time 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.590
 around the map cyber stone and it will 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.809
 oh yes, that's what they are 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.910
 quite a very valuable card 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.850
 Yes 5000 dollars will cost on various 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.010
 described pages and this card has 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.570
 one at that time on an English tournament 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.590
 won and this card is only there 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.650
 seven times 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.810
 that may well be true and I give 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.890
 you are quite right first time to the map 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.600
 even two stars has a lot 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.079
 that's why it's overpowered as well 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.940
 banned namely you can live 5000 live 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.190
 pay points and then a merger 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.890
 monster from the extra dick on the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.530
 playing field in attack position special 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.270
 So that's the whole broken now 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.739
 I only look again here on ebay 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.910
 I sometimes pass by a bit too 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.879
 surreptitious advertising for ebay 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.789
 but no matter and there I see at once 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.300
 this card cyber stone with the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.070
 Heading ultra rarely gets here 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.470
 this card is not as often as it gives 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.780
 It's only seven times in the world like that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.850
 card then has in effect at one 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.970
 price of 100 euros ended 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.700
 and then I have fun on ebay 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.049
 looked at other cyber stones like 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.159
 It's so beautiful here in English 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:24.450
 devil franken definitely i have 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.710
 there themselves stones for 15 euros for some 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.479
 seen four euros 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.979
 and then I have these cards 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.530
 compared with each other then I have 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.369
 seen a card for five euros 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.420
 this picture with the map for 100 euros 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.740
 compared and unfortunately it is not me 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.930
 right difference noticed 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.479
 That's why I want you with this video 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.840
 were makes you this error and buys 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.079
 give you this card in the hope that it will 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.509
 this original tournament card is this 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.810
 win tournament because this chance is 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.759
 relatively low and I am very 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.590
 sure that many will take advantage of this 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.750
 ignorance of some players 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.790
 that's why this short video i hope so 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.090
 liked you and see you next 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.090
 times
