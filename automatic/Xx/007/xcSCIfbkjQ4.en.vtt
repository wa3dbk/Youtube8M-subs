00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 Now we are from our popular 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.670
 mostly by tread first 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.530
 you can do that too 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.160
 to take the tearful that is not 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.320
 problem 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.630
 cut me rudi fischer as 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.080
 exclude sheds and do me many 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.830
 case cut the little door and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.090
 to be quiet in it 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.720
 because I do not need them out 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.279
 to do 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.230
 they will be long if I go through the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.929
 meat grinder will turn the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.989
 shredding more active so this 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:39.030
 fish fillets onion nutmeg pepper salt 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.670
 breadcrumbs and some milk or cream 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.670
 Of course I can also use the panel 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.039
 me for two rolls in the way before 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.070
 Submit as I express and then 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.510
 instead of being able to make pretty much 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.870
 just a lot in liquids 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.039
 that has the advantage that I am better off 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.039
 got meat grinder 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:11.479
 okay I washed the parsley 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.479
 comes free from many 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.340
 even a little bit because the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.400
 petershäger I let through with the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.520
 meat grinder 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.299
 here I have the fish is the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.850
 Onion and parsley seasoning 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.250
 I will leave this afterwards 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.780
 Run twice through the Meat Grinder 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.659
 through the fine slice 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.549
 that has the advantage that then 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.609
 they are still in the muscles 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.799
 are completely smaller 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:48.340
 and they did not eat for weeks 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.340
 be played 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.380
 [Music] 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.369
 [Applause] 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.759
 Now we have our fish mass 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.049
 let through 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:16.980
 and now i do and the spices 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:19.180
 add salt 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.390
 of course, after that 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.300
 has to taste because one thing is important 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.390
 They can be the most beautiful refugees 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.549
 if he is not spicy and well seasoned 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:36.330
 the vaart tastes good now we are working 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.330
 through this game 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.999
 [Applause] 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.909
 [Applause] 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.950
 and of course they have to taste yes 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.250
 to be a little more than already says 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.210
 not worse than when a fish is not 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.210
 well seasoned 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:51.769
 so it might if I sometimes 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.829
 personally like to do that is that 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:58.030
 I'm here in the crowd as well 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.469
 spices only something of domains bouillon 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.569
 jurisdiction to give something synonymous 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:05.930
 very good unknown flattered 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.010
 but thats a thing for me and for them 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.379
 I especially like 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.439
 and everyone should do that for themselves 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.629
 decide so our fair is ready 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.940
 we can now meat here 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:24.139
 roast and that's the thing 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:26.360
 done so after the preparation of the 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.389
 because of having shown in each one yourself 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.300
 taste like the fish tastes sick 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.610
 shown as self- proof fish and 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.270
 the fish are not a problem 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.009
 great delicacy and will become 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.620
 that you are now comfortable 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.699
 swing over it, of course, win 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.699
 to cook on wish 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.870
 hello dear reader the markus and me 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:09.080
 want now from the last wanted 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:13.300
 so you smoke today ask 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:17.680
 dried well in front of a pack of wood 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.940
 small divorces break it now 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.660
 or you can also go along well with others 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.140
 church and also rich incense 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.150
 where I prefer easy 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.170
 The taste is simply the best wood 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.540
 we have the fish in the night 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.720
 salmon pickled on ten liters of water 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.650
 We take about 500 grams of salt 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.120
 it is still important that one before the 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.680
 The teams of the fish smoke 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.930
 removed because leaking blood can 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.480
 give ugly spots before the fish 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.310
 Of course, they have to come in the oven 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:51.860
 to be dried, that is, to come out 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:54.550
 then the salt solution out with küchenkrepp 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.550
 dry 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.820
 [Music] 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.800
 on the roi hook and then somewhere 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.919
 Dry either on the clothesline 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.650
 or in any device for it 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.030
 the fish remain hanging up 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.590
 you can touch them 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.650
 and there really feels that the skin 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.539
 dry is so reucher hook there is 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.470
 different to hang up 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:34.890
 These simply prefer this through the 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:36.710
 introduce mouth and then comes this one 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:41.210
 [Music] 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:45.320
 evil around the spine 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.320
 there you can see it very well 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:59.370
 and so the fish depends firmly on the hook 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.800
 You should now separate the fish 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.570
 sorted by type or everything 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.130
 together 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.870
 not necessarily sorted but already 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.120
 the trout or use similar 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.100
 fischer in front of the eyes respectively 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.850
 also in front of the world because this yes 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.160
 see slow 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.930
 the longer they depend and so dry 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.280
 that in the under can be essential 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.990
 better faster and easier in 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.770
 Germany is so important that the 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:24.000
 Dry fish are very important and important 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.890
 then it probably still has something to do with it 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.230
 the temperature to do that the smaller ones 

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.630
 he gas and the longer ones 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:33.210
 or longer need thicker 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.950
 That's what it looks like when we're here now 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:39.200
 first the trout and the matter 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.200
 and then all and that
