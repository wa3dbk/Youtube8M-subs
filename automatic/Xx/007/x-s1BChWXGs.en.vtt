it<00:02:13.769> would<00:02:14.519> be<00:02:14.900> this<00:02:15.900> guy<00:02:16.140> here<00:02:16.379> gear<00:02:16.769> indicator

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
it would be this guy here gear indicator

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.210 
it would be this guy here gear indicator
this<00:02:18.090> gear<00:02:18.360> indicator<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:19.079> good<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.739> concept

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
this gear indicator is good in concept

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.100 
this gear indicator is good in concept
but<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:21.269> actual<00:02:21.629> practice<00:02:21.659> it<00:02:22.620> sucks<00:02:23.489> so<00:02:23.790> bad

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
but in actual practice it sucks so bad

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.830 
but in actual practice it sucks so bad
sometimes<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.129> get<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.280> magical<00:02:26.700> 8th<00:02:26.879> gear<00:02:27.209> this

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
sometimes I get a magical 8th gear this

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.319 
sometimes I get a magical 8th gear this
bike<00:02:28.200> has<00:02:28.379> six<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:29.010> mean<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.489> IQ<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.209> know

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
bike has six I mean the IQ is you know

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.030 
bike has six I mean the IQ is you know
really<00:02:30.720> good<00:02:30.840> for<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.049> highway<00:02:31.409> mileage<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.950> all

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
really good for a highway mileage in all

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.580 
really good for a highway mileage in all
but<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.459> don't<00:02:32.879> think<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:33.359> that<00:02:33.420> necessary<00:02:34.019> so

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
but I don't think it's that necessary so

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.080 
but I don't think it's that necessary so
I'm<00:02:35.099> gonna<00:02:35.189> have<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.400> try<00:02:35.579> fix<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:36.000> or

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
I'm gonna have to try fix it or

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.140 
I'm gonna have to try fix it or
something<00:02:36.390> because<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.319> is<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.970> is

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
something because this is a this is

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.569 
something because this is a this is
where<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:40.530> previous<00:02:40.920> owner<00:02:41.129> kind<00:02:41.489> of

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
where the previous owner kind of

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.809 
where the previous owner kind of
attached<00:02:41.909> it<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:43.230> as<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.439> can<00:02:43.500> see<00:02:43.819> this

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
attached it and as you can see this

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.410 
attached it and as you can see this
little<00:02:45.000> pedal<00:02:45.540> he<00:02:45.920> kind<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.040> flops<00:02:47.730> around<00:02:47.879> and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
little pedal he kind of flops around and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.569 
little pedal he kind of flops around and
that's<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.379> those<00:02:49.650> are<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:49.889> sensors<00:02:50.250> he<00:02:50.400> want

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
that's the those are the sensors he want

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.539 
that's the those are the sensors he want
to<00:02:50.639> neither<00:02:50.790> side<00:02:51.090> which<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:52.019> you<00:02:52.590> know<00:02:52.709> it's

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
to neither side which is you know it's

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.680 
to neither side which is you know it's
not<00:02:53.639> too<00:02:53.760> bad<00:02:53.909> but<00:02:54.870> yeah<00:02:55.079> I<00:02:56.239> have<00:02:57.239> traveled
