car<00:00:01.589> dolly<00:00:01.800> project<00:00:02.429> I<00:00:02.720> had<00:00:03.720> this<00:00:03.990> axle

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
car dolly project I had this axle

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.980 
car dolly project I had this axle
sitting<00:00:05.430> around<00:00:05.670> said<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.750> an<00:00:06.870> old<00:00:07.200> Sierra

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
sitting around said of an old Sierra

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.570 
sitting around said of an old Sierra
it's<00:00:09.990> actually<00:00:10.410> perfect<00:00:10.920> because<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.309> drops

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
it's actually perfect because it drops

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.939 
it's actually perfect because it drops
down<00:00:11.870> it's<00:00:12.870> nice<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.349> low<00:00:13.880> and<00:00:14.880> it's<00:00:15.030> straight

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
down it's nice and low and it's straight

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.490 
down it's nice and low and it's straight
so<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:16.980> cut<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.640> half<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.990> joined<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.470> to

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
so I cut it in half and I joined it to

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.609 
so I cut it in half and I joined it to
some<00:00:19.890> angle<00:00:20.279> iron<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.760> had<00:00:21.600> leftover<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.500> a

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
some angle iron I had leftover from a

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.689 
some angle iron I had leftover from a
job<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.449> did<00:00:24.470> raising<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.590> an<00:00:25.859> addition<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:26.670> a

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.100 
job I did raising in an addition on a
house<00:00:28.160> and<00:00:29.750> I've<00:00:30.750> tack<00:00:31.380> welded<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:33.110> just

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
house and I've tack welded it just

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.270 
house and I've tack welded it just
temporarily<00:00:34.760> and<00:00:36.500> threw<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.710> couple<00:00:37.739> bolts

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
leftover a plate and some pipe so I've

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.410 
leftover a plate and some pipe so I've
also<00:00:56.940> used<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:58.460> I'm<00:00:59.460> going<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.820> weld<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.270> in

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
also used that I'm going to weld it in

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.920 
also used that I'm going to weld it in
here<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:03.739> weld<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.119> to<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.299> plate<00:01:06.600> and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
here and weld it in to this plate and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.020 
here and weld it in to this plate and
then<00:01:07.140> I'm<00:01:07.229> gonna<00:01:07.320> add<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.830> some<00:01:07.860> cross<00:01:08.700> bracing

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
then I'm gonna add in some cross bracing

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.490 
then I'm gonna add in some cross bracing
make<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.180> nice<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.420> rigid<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:15.080> also<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
make it nice and rigid I also have to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.330 
make it nice and rigid I also have to
put<00:01:16.590> some<00:01:16.799> deck<00:01:17.040> steel<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.610> top<00:01:18.320> and<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:20.100> tires

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
put some deck steel on top and the tires

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.760 
put some deck steel on top and the tires
of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.610> car<00:01:20.850> will<00:01:20.970> sit<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:22.290> between

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
of the car will sit just in between

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.370 
of the car will sit just in between
these<00:01:23.070> two<00:01:23.430> pieces<00:01:23.670> angle<00:01:24.150> iron<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.600> it'll

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
these two pieces angle iron so it'll

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.550 
these two pieces angle iron so it'll
give<00:01:25.530> me<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> little<00:01:25.920> tongue<00:01:26.250> weight<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.560> it'll

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
give me a little tongue weight and it'll

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.289 
give me a little tongue weight and it'll
put<00:01:28.770> most<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.909> weight<00:01:30.000> onto<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.600> axle

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
put most of the weight onto the axle

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.880 
put most of the weight onto the axle
the<00:01:33.299> tires<00:01:33.600> are<00:01:33.930> 14-inch<00:01:34.590> tires<00:01:36.560> they<00:01:37.560> take

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the tires are 14-inch tires they take

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.789 
the tires are 14-inch tires they take
about<00:01:38.189> their<00:01:39.000> load<00:01:39.270> range<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.900> about<00:01:40.079> 1,400

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
about their load range is about 1,400

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.539 
about their load range is about 1,400
pounds<00:01:41.100> each<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:42.090> should<00:01:42.270> give<00:01:42.420> me<00:01:43.549> perfect

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
pounds each so it should give me perfect

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:53.980 
pounds each so it should give me perfect
amount<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:49.369> weight<00:01:50.369> for<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> front<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.479> car

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.270 

well<00:01:54.990> that's<00:01:55.439> my<00:01:56.719> car<00:01:57.719> dolly<00:01:57.899> project<00:01:58.469> my<00:01:58.979> next

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
well that's my car dolly project my next

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.969 
well that's my car dolly project my next
video<00:01:59.520> I'm<00:01:59.729> hoping<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:00.960> all<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.590> cross

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
video I'm hoping to have all the cross

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.359 
video I'm hoping to have all the cross
bracing<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.570> deck<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:05.189> might

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
bracing in and the deck on and I might

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.290 
bracing in and the deck on and I might
even<00:02:05.399> give<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.119> try

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.360
