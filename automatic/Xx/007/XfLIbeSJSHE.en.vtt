00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello with you again feel of 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.490
 alexander 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.470
 if you do not see on the screens now 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.370
 your computers means you are watching 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.950
 channel vector 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.590
 today I would like to talk about what 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.880
 tell about such an important and interesting 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.439
 the moment how to install furniture facade 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.449
 any furniture maker knows what it is 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.820
 rather unpleasant thing disgusting 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.920
 and not always get the desired 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.519
 result 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.400
 there are so many ways 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.949
 I tried to install these facades 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.770
 very much but chose 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.829
 one that i use this way 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.270
 For many years now, I have been successfully considered one 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.980
 of the most simple and reliable and now I 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:51.420
 demonstrate how it all looks 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:54.140
 you can see well yes hail set 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.140
 1 facade 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.550
 I will work my normal working 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.800
 pace not to accelerate and slow down to 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:20.320
 you felt that way on the very 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:29.170
 Deal is very simple and does not take much 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:32.399
 time 1 set the facade fix at 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.399
 help screws 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.910
 first facade ready 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.910
 what do we do next insert box 2 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.800
 box set take 2 facade further I 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:22.230
 very important point i use 2 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:28.260
 ruble coins to determine the exact 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:35.810
 call stacked on them facade from above 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.810
 put our next passed and so on 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.799
 we clamp 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:17.200
 old facade 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.200
 set the following box from go 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.060
 again and our way of life 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.060
 to monica 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.990
 in general it would be right for us to include 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:22.130
 any 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:24.980
 Timer to detect for the sake of interest Well yes on 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:29.200
 this we will not get hung up that he 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.200
 next we exit the finish line 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:41.089
 4 coin box 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:44.350
 we put the top platform that us 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:59.690
 started getting in the way now we can deliver 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:06:04.880
 to the place that's all friends agree 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:07.880
 somehow so much to spend 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.410
 don't pay much attention to the clearance when 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.240
 using this method 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.710
 the gap between the facades will always be 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.360
 perfect will always be up to standard 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.390
 can use smaller 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.980
 spacer but I think that 2 ruble 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.570
 coin 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.090
 considered the best why we 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.370
 use a thicker gap will 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.550
 very big ugly use more 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.830
 a thin guide with time will give 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.780
 shrinkage and facades when opening will be 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.930
 hurt each other himself optima im 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.850
 optimal 2 ruble coins 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.980
 I hope this video will help as an experience on 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.290
 furniture makers and novice someone 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.800
 learn something interesting from this 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.290
 of the way 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.950
 with you was lexa filatov selling meetings 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.950
 until
