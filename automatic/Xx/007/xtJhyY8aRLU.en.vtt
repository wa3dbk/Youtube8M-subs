00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.249 

so<00:00:01.380> here<00:00:01.560> we've<00:00:01.680> got<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:02.179> cross-sectional

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:03.259 
so here we've got a cross-sectional

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.380 
so here we've got a cross-sectional
cutaway<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.950> typical<00:00:05.370> frame<00:00:05.730> house<00:00:05.970> it's

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
cutaway of a typical frame house it's

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.490 
cutaway of a typical frame house it's
got<00:00:06.540> 2<00:00:06.720> by<00:00:06.870> 4<00:00:07.109> walls<00:00:07.460> 2<00:00:08.460> by<00:00:08.490> 8<00:00:08.790> rafters<00:00:09.269> but<00:00:09.960> the

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
got 2 by 4 walls 2 by 8 rafters but the

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.810 
got 2 by 4 walls 2 by 8 rafters but the
part<00:00:10.740> we're<00:00:10.889> very<00:00:11.070> interested<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.639> is

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
part we're very interested in is

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.299 
part we're very interested in is
actually<00:00:12.000> down<00:00:12.389> here<00:00:12.809> under<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.410> floor<00:00:13.679> and

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
actually down here under the floor and

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.400 
actually down here under the floor and
this<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.730> crawlspace<00:00:15.000> area<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.960> granted

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
this is the crawlspace area and granted

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.900 
this is the crawlspace area and granted
it's<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.680> scale<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.279> it's<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.580> little<00:00:17.789> bit

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
it's to scale so it's a little bit

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.240 
it's to scale so it's a little bit
smaller<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:19.050> it's<00:00:19.230> all<00:00:19.380> got<00:00:19.740> all<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.039> parts

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
smaller but it's all got all the parts

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.759 
smaller but it's all got all the parts
of<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.550> typical<00:00:20.850> crawlspace<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:22.529> case

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
of a typical crawlspace in this case

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.140 
of a typical crawlspace in this case
we've<00:00:23.010> got<00:00:23.220> 2<00:00:23.400> different<00:00:23.550> types<00:00:23.970> of

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
we've got 2 different types of

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.700 
we've got 2 different types of
foundation<00:00:24.689> wall<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.170> there's<00:00:25.320> lots<00:00:25.560> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
foundation wall and there's lots of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.019 
foundation wall and there's lots of
different<00:00:26.010> ones<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.490> out<00:00:26.519> there<00:00:26.880> but

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
different ones that are out there but

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.390 
different ones that are out there but
these<00:00:27.210> are<00:00:27.359> two<00:00:27.510> very<00:00:27.539> common<00:00:28.080> systems<00:00:28.710> this

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
these are two very common systems this

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.209 
these are two very common systems this
is<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.670> concrete<00:00:30.449> block<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.859> over<00:00:32.189> here

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
is a concrete block and this over here

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.340 
is a concrete block and this over here
is<00:00:32.460> an<00:00:32.640> insulated<00:00:33.180> concrete<00:00:33.390> form<00:00:33.899> system

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
is an insulated concrete form system

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.920 
is an insulated concrete form system
where<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.520> foam<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.000> actually<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> formwork

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
where the foam is actually the formwork

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.020 
where the foam is actually the formwork
the<00:00:37.590> concrete<00:00:38.010> gets<00:00:38.160> poured<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.640> once<00:00:38.820> those

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the concrete gets poured in once those

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.790 
the concrete gets poured in once those
forms<00:00:39.420> are<00:00:39.570> set<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.960> everything<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.440> bonded

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
forms are set and everything is bonded

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.010 
forms are set and everything is bonded
together<00:00:40.920> as<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.550> piece<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.809> great

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
together as one piece it's a great

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.560 
together as one piece it's a great
system<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.710> air<00:00:43.920> seals<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.489> insulates<00:00:44.969> it

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
system it air seals it insulates it

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.330 
system it air seals it insulates it
works<00:00:45.809> very<00:00:46.020> well<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.800> more<00:00:47.190> and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
works very well you see that more and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.700 
works very well you see that more and
more<00:00:47.520> nowadays<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:48.180> new<00:00:48.360> construction<00:00:48.710> but

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
more nowadays on new construction but

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.520 
more nowadays on new construction but
this<00:00:49.890> here<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.460> more<00:00:51.180> typical<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.870> retrofit

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
this here is more typical to retrofit

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.990 
this here is more typical to retrofit
construction<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.370> some<00:00:53.579> parts<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
construction and in some parts of the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.869 
construction and in some parts of the
country<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:54.570> still<00:00:54.750> very<00:00:54.960> common<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.469> use

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
country it's still very common to use

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.029 
country it's still very common to use
concrete<00:00:56.879> block<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.440> an<00:00:58.559> older<00:00:58.890> house

the insulation in most cases the safest

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.160 
the insulation in most cases the safest
approach<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:24.060> going<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.540> insulate<00:01:24.930> from

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
approach is going to be to insulate from

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.560 
approach is going to be to insulate from

it<00:01:51.840> will<00:01:51.930> be<00:01:52.020> ventilated<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.280> block

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
it will be ventilated and this block

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.219 
it will be ventilated and this block
will<00:01:53.820> stay<00:01:54.060> warm<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> won't<00:01:54.930> attract

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
will stay warm so it won't attract

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.590 
will stay warm so it won't attract
condensation<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.850> new<00:01:57.119> construction

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600

you've<00:01:58.320> got<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> foundation<00:01:58.770> already<00:01:59.369> dug

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
you've got the foundation already dug

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.370 
you've got the foundation already dug
out<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.210> pretty<00:02:00.360> easy<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.780> put<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.110> foam

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
out it's pretty easy to put that foam

board on there but in a retrofit it can
be<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> lot<00:02:04.320> more<00:02:04.350> difficult<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.159> may<00:02:05.310> have

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
be a lot more difficult you may have

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.029 
be a lot more difficult you may have
sidewalks<00:02:06.149> parking<00:02:07.079> lots<00:02:07.259> things<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:07.799> that

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
sidewalks parking lots things like that

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.169 
sidewalks parking lots things like that
that<00:02:08.250> prevents<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.640> from<00:02:08.700> putting<00:02:09.000> that

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
that prevents you from putting that

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.529 
that prevents you from putting that
insulation<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.929> from<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> out

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
dig it all up at that point you can

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.899 
dig it all up at that point you can
insulate<00:02:16.299> the<00:02:16.420> crawlspace<00:02:16.689> from<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.319> inside

insulate the crawlspace from the inside

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.789 
insulate the crawlspace from the inside
use<00:02:18.909> the<00:02:19.060> same<00:02:19.269> types<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.750> insulation<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.620> can

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
use the same types of insulation you can

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.860 
use the same types of insulation you can
use<00:02:20.920> also<00:02:21.129> use<00:02:21.430> an<00:02:21.579> encapsulated<00:02:22.180> fiberglass

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
use also use an encapsulated fiberglass

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.959 
use also use an encapsulated fiberglass
which<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.319> fiberglass<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.189> factory<00:02:24.609> sealed

there's any insulation in here it might
be<00:03:32.440> some<00:03:32.620> fiberglass<00:03:33.010> that's<00:03:33.430> kind<00:03:33.639> of

be some fiberglass that's kind of

be some fiberglass that's kind of
stuffed<00:03:33.970> in<00:03:34.180> here<00:03:34.359> like<00:03:34.540> this<00:03:34.900> sometimes

there's<00:03:35.799> actually<00:03:36.010> some<00:03:36.430> in<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.639> floor<00:03:36.909> too

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
there's actually some in the floor too

there's actually some in the floor too
this<00:03:38.560> is<00:03:38.739> all<00:03:38.889> well<00:03:39.129> and<00:03:39.340> good<00:03:39.400> if<00:03:39.729> things<00:03:40.000> stay

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
this is all well and good if things stay

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.210 
this is all well and good if things stay
dry<00:03:40.569> but<00:03:40.930> if<00:03:41.019> you've<00:03:41.169> got<00:03:41.379> a<00:03:41.409> moisture<00:03:41.829> problem

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
dry but if you've got a moisture problem

dry but if you've got a moisture problem
in<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.459> crawlspace<00:03:42.750> what<00:03:43.750> happens<00:03:44.109> is<00:03:44.319> this

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
in the crawlspace what happens is this

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.830 
in the crawlspace what happens is this
will<00:03:44.859> be<00:03:44.979> very<00:03:45.129> cold<00:03:45.489> and<00:03:45.819> air<00:03:46.269> travels<00:03:46.690> right

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
will be very cold and air travels right

through this fiberglass and so all of a
sudden<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:49.629> air<00:03:49.870> reaches<00:03:50.260> all<00:03:50.409> the<00:03:50.440> way<00:03:50.650> to

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
sudden that air reaches all the way to

sudden that air reaches all the way to
the<00:03:50.859> back<00:03:51.040> here<00:03:51.340> wood<00:03:51.519> hits<00:03:51.699> that<00:03:51.879> cold

in that air starts to condense on this
plywood<00:03:56.199> a<00:03:56.409> lot<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:57.129> times<00:03:57.370> this<00:03:57.609> area<00:03:57.939> doesn't

there<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:00.939> you<00:04:01.000> have<00:04:01.150> problems<00:04:01.629> with<00:04:01.750> mold
