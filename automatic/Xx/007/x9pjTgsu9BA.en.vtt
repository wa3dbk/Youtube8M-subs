00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
get a little more okay we're here at the

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.219 
get a little more okay we're here at the
top<00:01:01.990> of<00:01:02.020> the<00:01:02.170> ladder<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:03.340> so<00:01:03.520> we<00:01:03.640> look<00:01:03.820> in

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
top of the ladder and so we look in

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.650 
top of the ladder and so we look in
that's<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.470> ceiling<00:01:05.680> up<00:01:05.980> there<00:01:06.010> or<00:01:06.370> the

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
that's the ceiling up there or the

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.380 
that's the ceiling up there or the
decking<00:01:07.680> underneath<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.770> shingles<00:01:09.160> and<00:01:09.390> now

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
decking underneath the shingles and now

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.790 
decking underneath the shingles and now
we'll<00:01:10.570> just<00:01:10.600> flip<00:01:10.930> over<00:01:11.230> the<00:01:11.370> edge<00:01:12.370> here<00:01:13.800> take

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
we'll just flip over the edge here take

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.160 
we'll just flip over the edge here take
a<00:01:14.830> look<00:01:15.040> and<00:01:16.030> we<00:01:16.180> can't<00:01:16.360> see<00:01:16.570> much<00:01:16.750> but<00:01:17.020> this

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
a look and we can't see much but this

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.580 
a look and we can't see much but this
this<00:01:17.800> extends<00:01:18.220> back<00:01:18.990> probably<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.140> couple<00:01:20.320> feet

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
this extends back probably a couple feet

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.560 
this extends back probably a couple feet
you<00:01:20.830> still<00:01:21.130> here<00:01:21.340> bees<00:01:21.550> that<00:01:21.580> in<00:01:22.030> on<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.330> comb

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
you still here bees that in on the comb

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.870 
you still here bees that in on the comb
and<00:01:24.060> you'll<00:01:25.060> probably<00:01:25.270> end<00:01:25.450> up<00:01:25.630> with<00:01:26.460> 30<00:01:27.460> 40

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
and you'll probably end up with 30 40

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.910 
and you'll probably end up with 30 40
pounds<00:01:28.330> I'll<00:01:28.450> estimate<00:01:28.930> come<00:01:29.500> over<00:01:29.650> here<00:01:29.710> to

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
pounds I'll estimate come over here to

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.370 
pounds I'll estimate come over here to
the<00:01:30.010> left<00:01:30.330> you<00:01:31.330> can<00:01:31.450> see<00:01:31.480> brood<00:01:31.870> comb<00:01:32.110> right

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
comb right there and they're actually

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.570

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
filling it with nectar there must be a

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.180 
filling it with nectar there must be a
really<00:02:55.790> good<00:02:55.940> nectar<00:02:56.470> flow<00:02:57.470> going<00:02:57.740> on<00:02:57.950> right

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
really good nectar flow going on right

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.370 
really good nectar flow going on right
now<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.530> we've<00:03:00.650> got<00:03:02.020> plenty<00:03:03.020> of<00:03:03.170> it's

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
now and so we've got plenty of it's

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.140 
now and so we've got plenty of it's
still<00:03:03.590> coming<00:03:03.770> out<00:03:04.040> we've<00:03:04.340> got<00:03:04.520> a<00:03:04.550> bag<00:03:04.820> full<00:03:04.850> of

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150
