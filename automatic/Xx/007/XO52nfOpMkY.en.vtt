00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.259
 There is a lot of low-cost digital on the market 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.630
 cameras they are compact and convenient but with them 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.000
 I canâ€™t remove both the portrait and the macro and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.160
 the panorama is not so universal 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.060
 it's time to go to the superzoom 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.939
 for example samsung wb100 10 with this camera 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.400
 ultra wide 20 six-fold 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.890
 lens and quite attractive price 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.350
 large camera with ergonomic 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.680
 the handle is covered with a rubber pad 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.980
 the device weighs without batteries 385 UAH 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.960
 and the full equipment is almost half a kilo 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.440
 so comfortable that not even a day 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.899
 tired wb100 10 assembled very well 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.329
 nothing creaks or backlash 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.270
 most of the body is made of 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.399
 plastic rough painting lens 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.399
 edged with a dotted metal ring 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.570
 there is a lamp next to the lens 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.850
 autofocus backlight top descent 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.740
 shutter with zoom lever button 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.619
 include and video 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.140
 as well as a mechanical selector corresponding 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.450
 for shooting modes and camera settings 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.100
 Above the lens is a built-in 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.460
 effective range flash 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.220
 lighting up to 6 meters 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.460
 The camera is equipped with a 3-inch display with 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.979
 resolution 460 1 thousand points 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.170
 pixelation of course noticeable angles 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.720
 review is not enough but unlike more 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.270
 expensive cameras with the same screen here 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.490
 this is forgivable near the screen is 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.280
 navigation stick menu button 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.040
 return viewing and deleting snapshots 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.040
 no disks yes they are not needed because 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.290
 the camera has no such manual modes 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.810
 there is a speaker slot and 2 ports 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.759
 blood hut and mini hdmi 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.250
 the apparatus is powered by four elements 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.759
 Aa type batteries are bundled with 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.039
 camera 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.259
 but the batteries and charger 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.300
 sold separately from fingertips 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.729
 rechargeable batteries have many advantages 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.190
 They are relatively inexpensive and available in 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.190
 any outlet in the world of elements 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.860
 capacity of 2600 milliamps hours enough 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.260
 about 500 shots almost doubled 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.260
 more than can do similar 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.150
 ice-cold cameras 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.370
 need for travel lovers 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.970
 the camera is equipped with a diagonal sensor 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.700
 7.7 millimeters and impressive for your 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.070
 20 megapixel resolution 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.170
 the photos taken during the day are wonderful 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.019
 look on monitor with full resolution 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.010
 hd and even with an increase do not lose 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.010
 attractiveness 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.019
 but in low light situation 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.360
 fundamentally changing due to high density 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.330
 pixels starts to work aggressively 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.860
 built-in noise reduction system 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.989
 which, along with noise, removes and 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.090
 some details of the pictures quality 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.810
 snapshots are significantly reduced when iso 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.030
 400 and above therefore for indoor shooting 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.060
 and evening this camera is not very 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.519
 Fits the most important part of super zoom. 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.680
 Of course, engineers are objectively 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.250
 samsung decided to move away from standards and 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.750
 equipped wb100 10 super wide 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.859
 lens with minimal focal 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.099
 a distance of 22.3 millimeters 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:25.410
 compared with 28 and even 24 millimeter 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.970
 optics such a lens gives more 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.250
 wide viewing angle 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.470
 perfect for landscapes and 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.420
 panoramas and if on the horizon you are a friend 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.700
 interested some object zoom in 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.700
 it with 26x zoom 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.200
 optical stabilization system is not 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.419
 always copes with hand shake on 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.329
 long focal lengths therefore 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.829
 when shooting for example a rare bird is not 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.169
 be lazy to take a few frames 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.480
 so you can choose the most 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.470
 clear mode can also be used 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.200
 dual 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.299
 oh with optical and digital mode 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.519
 stabilization in some cases he 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.410
 allows you to achieve better sharpness 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.410
 but slows down the saving of the snapshot 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.910
 deserves special attention 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.400
 macro wb100 10 has as many as three 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.620
 we will cut and for shooting of small objects 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.750
 macro and of the macro allow 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.680
 focus on objects no closer than 10 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.700
 centimeters but allow the use of zoom 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.980
 they differ only as much as possible 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.050
 allowable focusing distance in 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.640
 super macro mode to use zoom 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.860
 but the minimum distance 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.200
 focusing reduced to one 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.780
 centimeter so even 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.150
 small objects will be in the picture just 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.460
 huge camera is pretty low 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.650
 continuous shooting speed at full 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.080
 resolution less than a frame per second 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.240
 dynamics in good quality capture 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.070
 very difficult if you still need 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.200
 fix some quick object 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.390
 you can turn on the speed mode 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.820
 True resolution at the pictures will be 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.820
 funny 640 by 480 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.479
 the camera is not different and the speed of work 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.819
 In general, the interface responds to actions 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.810
 not instantly focusing is not rare 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.509
 thinks about 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.430
 but if this is not reportage photography then this 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:17.860
 not a problem despite pretty 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.990
 serious appearance the camera takes off 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.479
 exceptional automatic modes 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.400
 if you know what you will shoot is worth 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.500
 choose one of the stage programs 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.050
 making the right choice will make shooting easier and 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.550
 will allow you to get the desired result for 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.190
 those who are a little versed in 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.599
 photo equipment is available in program mode 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.030
 you can change some of it 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:39.569
 Parameters such as white balance 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.009
 sensitivity or type of focus 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.669
 separately on the selector mode 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.190
 panoramas 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:49.080
 he allows a simple movement to create 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.080
 wide-angle shots 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.460
 the camera has a large abundance of extra 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.680
 functions there is a magic frame and 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.380
 photo divider to create 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.150
 interesting collage set of 7 digital 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.610
 filters will allow to decorate pictures 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.030
 fun effects for elementary 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.740
 processing even the computer is not needed 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:14.290
 rotate image correct color and 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:19.000
 brightness can be directly in the built-in camera 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:21.760
 video editor is recorded in already under 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.870
 obsolete hd format with a frequency of 30 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.750
 frames per second 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.120
 Detail picture does not shine if you 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.550
 confuses the buzz of the zoom drive 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.830
 you can record sound while zooming 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.670
 disable some digital effects 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:38.440
 also apply to videos 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:41.110
 such an expensive camera can not be 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.430
 perfect but in at least two things 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:47.560
 she surpassed many competitors this 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.540
 autonomy and versatility with you
