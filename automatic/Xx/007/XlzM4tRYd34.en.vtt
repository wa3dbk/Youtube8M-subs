item<00:05:00.169> this<00:05:01.169> changes<00:05:01.769> to<00:05:02.039> separate<00:05:02.429> ingot<00:05:03.360> and

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
item this changes to separate ingot and

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:11.570 
item this changes to separate ingot and
this<00:05:04.830> change<00:05:05.189> in<00:05:05.999> get<00:05:07.129> safe<00:05:08.509> and<00:05:10.309> there<00:05:11.309> we<00:05:11.399> go

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
this change in get safe and there we go

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:20.540 
this change in get safe and there we go
so<00:05:12.050> let's<00:05:13.050> run<00:05:13.919> this<00:05:18.050> and<00:05:19.159> remember<00:05:20.159> you<00:05:20.339> want
