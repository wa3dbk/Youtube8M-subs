thought that if I killed the mouth of
Sauron<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:56.299> would<00:01:56.390> end<00:01:56.630> because<00:01:57.380> this

what i did i just like target all my
units<00:02:12.070> and<00:02:13.070> here<00:02:13.220> was<00:02:13.370> quite<00:02:13.549> scary<00:02:13.910> i<00:02:14.000> thought

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
units and here was quite scary i thought

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.600 
units and here was quite scary i thought
they<00:02:14.299> were<00:02:14.360> gonna<00:02:14.480> kill<00:02:14.570> him<00:02:15.049> but<00:02:16.010> what<00:02:16.400> was

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
they were gonna kill him but what was

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.729 
they were gonna kill him but what was
really<00:02:16.640> good<00:02:17.090> as<00:02:17.209> i<00:02:17.299> have<00:02:17.480> this<00:02:17.660> ability<00:02:18.320> and

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
really good as i have this ability and

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.009 
really good as i have this ability and
other<00:02:18.830> ability<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:20.000> heal<00:02:20.209> structures<00:02:20.870> at

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
other ability to heal structures at

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.220 
other ability to heal structures at
least<00:02:21.200> someone<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.860> that's<00:02:21.980> what<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.160> did<00:02:23.230> and

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
least someone and that's what I did and

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.930 
least someone and that's what I did and
right<00:02:24.500> now<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.680> just<00:02:24.769> distracted<00:02:25.549> them<00:02:25.640> from

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
right now I just distracted them from

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.850 
right now I just distracted them from
the<00:02:26.150> Thor<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.780> think<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.440> killed<00:02:27.500> them<00:02:27.739> off

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
the Thor and I think I killed them off

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.600 
the Thor and I think I killed them off
of<00:02:27.890> Sauron<00:02:28.430> somewhere<00:02:28.850> here

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.310 

now<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.640> don't<00:02:33.850> know<00:02:34.270> my<00:02:34.540> structure<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:35.080> didn't

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
now I don't know my structure I didn't

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.020 
now I don't know my structure I didn't
have<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.560> healing<00:02:35.920> ability<00:02:36.430> which<00:02:36.580> pissed<00:02:36.910> me

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
have the healing ability which pissed me

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.140 
have the healing ability which pissed me
off<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.600> still<00:02:38.080> have<00:02:38.200> Tom<00:02:38.730> I'm<00:02:39.730> up<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.090> about

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
off I still have Tom I'm up and about

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.850 
off I still have Tom I'm up and about
here<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:40.900> these<00:02:41.170> are<00:02:41.290> actually<00:02:41.530> my<00:02:41.620> own

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
here and so these are actually my own

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.070 
here and so these are actually my own
units<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.400> realized<00:02:43.120> I'm<00:02:43.240> like<00:02:43.390> oh<00:02:43.540> man<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:43.960> my

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
units I realized I'm like oh man is my

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.280 
units I realized I'm like oh man is my
only<00:02:44.290> units<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.690> what's<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:46.930> funny<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.200> that

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
only units and what's so funny is that

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.930 
only units and what's so funny is that
there's<00:02:47.500> actually<00:02:47.650> Mirkwood<00:02:48.220> elves<00:02:48.670> over

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
there's actually Mirkwood elves over

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.670 
there's actually Mirkwood elves over
here<00:02:49.120> over<00:02:49.240> there<00:02:49.450> by<00:02:49.570> my<00:02:49.690> archery<00:02:50.110> range<00:02:50.380> that

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
here over there by my archery range that

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.510 
here over there by my archery range that
I<00:02:50.710> really<00:02:51.010> don't<00:02:51.160> notice<00:02:53.040> also<00:02:54.040> there's<00:02:54.370> some

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
I really don't notice also there's some

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.670 
I really don't notice also there's some
catapults<00:02:55.210> out<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.540> was<00:02:56.050> wondering<00:02:56.230> where<00:02:56.500> like

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
catapults out I was wondering where like

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.710 
catapults out I was wondering where like
these<00:02:56.800> big<00:02:57.070> fireball<00:02:57.430> things<00:02:58.390> were<00:02:58.600> like

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
these big fireball things were like

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.640 
these big fireball things were like
going<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:01.690> all<00:03:01.840> these<00:03:01.959> trolls<00:03:02.230> are<00:03:02.410> like<00:03:02.530> I'm

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
going so all these trolls are like I'm

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.990 
going so all these trolls are like I'm
low<00:03:02.800> health<00:03:03.070> so<00:03:03.250> I'll<00:03:03.340> be<00:03:03.459> able<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.730> destroy

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
low health so I'll be able to destroy

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.920 
low health so I'll be able to destroy
them<00:03:04.180> with<00:03:04.240> my<00:03:04.420> failings<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:10.720> can<00:03:10.810> see

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
them with my failings so you can see

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.600 
them with my failings so you can see
here<00:03:11.140> are<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.290> catapult<00:03:11.830> I<00:03:11.980> thought<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.459> was

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
here are the catapult I thought that was

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.640 
here are the catapult I thought that was
really<00:03:12.790> cheap<00:03:13.209> because<00:03:13.720> catapults<00:03:14.440> have<00:03:14.530> a

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
really cheap because catapults have a

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.330 
really cheap because catapults have a
skirmish<00:03:15.190> mode<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:17.470> where<00:03:17.620> they<00:03:17.739> run<00:03:17.950> away<00:03:18.070> if

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
skirmish mode to where they run away if

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.090 
skirmish mode to where they run away if
you<00:03:18.459> get<00:03:18.610> too<00:03:18.760> close<00:03:18.940> yeah<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:19.660> know<00:03:19.750> right<00:03:20.100> yeah

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
you get too close yeah I know right yeah

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.500 
you get too close yeah I know right yeah
but<00:03:21.489> they<00:03:21.580> run<00:03:21.700> away<00:03:21.790> kind<00:03:22.030> of<00:03:22.120> slow<00:03:22.300> so<00:03:22.450> you

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
but they run away kind of slow so you

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.370 
but they run away kind of slow so you
can<00:03:22.570> catch<00:03:22.780> up<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:23.110> them<00:03:24.989> I'm<00:03:25.989> looking<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.260> see

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
can catch up to them I'm looking to see

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.070 
can catch up to them I'm looking to see
if<00:03:26.440> there's<00:03:26.590> any<00:03:26.709> more<00:03:27.630> units<00:03:28.630> or<00:03:28.780> whatever

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
if there's any more units or whatever

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.740 
if there's any more units or whatever
anything<00:03:29.680> i'm<00:03:29.830> going<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.070> use<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.750> the

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
anything i'm going to use a the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.270 
anything i'm going to use a the
