i am playing from the 6th fret above
this<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.680> 0<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:03.329> 6<00:01:03.750> Fred<00:01:04.080> buff<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.890> would

this is 0 this is 6 Fred buff I would

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.800 
this is 0 this is 6 Fred buff I would
rather<00:01:05.489> show<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:06.030> half<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.510> bass

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
rather show you this half of the bass

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.100 
rather show you this half of the bass
guitar<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.950> see<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.369> more<00:01:08.610> closely

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
guitar so you can see it more closely

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.170 
guitar so you can see it more closely
the<00:01:10.110> verse<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.619> same<00:01:10.979> as<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> chorus<00:01:11.580> it

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
the verse is same as the chorus it

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:32.140 
the verse is same as the chorus it
sounds<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:12.960> I'll<00:01:13.650> plate

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.200 

so<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:34.370> 10th<00:01:35.450> fret<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.870> a<00:01:37.290> string<00:01:38.210> 11

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
so it's the 10th fret on the a string 11

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.760 
so it's the 10th fret on the a string 11
fret<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:40.050> the<00:01:40.140> E<00:01:40.470> string<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:42.140> 6th<00:01:43.140> fret<00:01:43.440> on<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
fret on the E string and 6th fret on the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.690 
fret on the E string and 6th fret on the
E<00:01:44.100> string<00:01:45.860> only<00:01:47.960> changing<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.170> little<00:01:49.440> bit<00:01:49.700> so

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
E string only changing a little bit so

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:13.310 
E string only changing a little bit so
once<00:01:50.910> again<00:01:51.090> it's<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:12.420> when<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.750> play<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.050> in

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
once again it's and when you play it in

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.960 
once again it's and when you play it in
the<00:02:13.350> chorus<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.010> can<00:02:14.190> for<00:02:14.430> example<00:02:14.489> play

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
the chorus you can for example play

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:24.590 
the chorus you can for example play
octaves<00:02:15.209> or<00:02:15.810> some<00:02:16.470> different<00:02:18.650> nodes<00:02:23.600> octaves

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
octaves or some different nodes octaves

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.220 
octaves or some different nodes octaves
are<00:02:25.760> two<00:02:26.760> strings<00:02:27.090> higher<00:02:27.300> two<00:02:27.750> frets<00:02:28.050> higher

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
are two strings higher two frets higher

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:42.740 
are two strings higher two frets higher
