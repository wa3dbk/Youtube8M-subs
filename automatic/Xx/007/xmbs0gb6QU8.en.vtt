00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 So there was a job in Kassel 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.420
 Again, there is chaos today 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:18.720
 crystal cave of this reaches you over 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:23.010
 the area at the waypoint old peck ruin 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.980
 and on the move with me already 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.390
 waypoint, there are tree stumps where 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.009
 you jump down and watch medium 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.079
 partially the tree stumps are so 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.690
 that should jump really center here 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.059
 so that you get infected with stone here somewhere 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:47.600
 Otherwise stockman 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.600
 then it goes down here direction 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.300
 and back up 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.760
 Now I'm doing a cut with it 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.270
 then as perfect as possible 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.270
 can pull 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.049
 the tricky thing is that there is 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:25.020
 knock an opponent down here 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:27.850
 on the other hand also funny expresses 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.649
 the different things with the 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.319
 make a mark go so far 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:37.730
 smaller larger or the need to 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:47.000
 fix camera position and that can 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:52.160
 to really get in the eye now can 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:58.480
 eg minarik, that is the shitty one 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.480
 imagine can as I said small 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.660
 in itself that's what she can do about it 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.030
 you are relatively heavy 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:13.390
 you just always have to get away from it as much as possible 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.390
 edge far jump then that goes too 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:31.450
 now I have such far view that is 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.489
 just a complete change because you 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.760
 what really can often be found here 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.760
 google 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.010
 The whole area is 50 60 level area 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.970
 and also the tour 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.420
 accordingly 50 becomes 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.230
 now, of course, is extreme 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.230
 counterproductive 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.040
 no matter what you are not right now 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.870
 you will see that the chest already 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.569
 up here and where is the capital for 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.780
 version has never tested so 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.209
 may fit the camping that the 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.200
 crystal cave and I will contact you with the 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.200
 next the next years
