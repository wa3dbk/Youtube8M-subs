00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.920
 it is sometimes amazing what will have in the raw food everything where you 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.920
 as a normal person does not think about it for example drinking chocolate 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:16.340
 For this we need twosome ingredients once cocoa beans 20 came sesame 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.569
 unpeeled 20 grams and 40 grams of green-red 7 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.659
 All ingredients must have raw food quality 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.689
 if we then want to take each course 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.899
 That means none of the ingredients gave over 40 to 43 degrees to be heated 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.000
 cocoa beans 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.350
 They should also be organic quality, we have this raw food quality 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.520
 so that we can process it like that 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.920
 I put the room in place because like everyone else everything was too much 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.580
 is annoying and did not have any bad experiences with it first of all 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.710
 So I have the cocoa beans 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.260
 from the insiders out of nowhere 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.590
 Mahlich to say the unusually bright to See 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.640
 then both will be fine if I mark the drinks FH 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.460
 in these small quantities is also a small mixer same day as 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.460
 Appetizers big or even a thermomix 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.090
 those who like them say I can not replace that with anything 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.210
 and who the green raisins I have the normal raisins or dates 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.810
 every time my little percent gets variants 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.580
 with new taste nuances that's quite interesting 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.330
 it tastes already chocolaty 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.260
 that's just how it is 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.890
 This extra bit of what again drinking chocolate does not have 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.130
 Now I want them together in mixed mode 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.250
 Then tour the green raisin bomber 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.250
 just ignore that with each other 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.510
 I suggest that my grandson shines and drinks west but wants to have warmer 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.890
 it can warm up to 40 degrees that is still quite 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.480
 Colonel IG 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.550
 against the terror meters 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.430
 what is certain is that the brothers I can do that the thermomix of 7 to 30 degrees 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.730
 Indicates and that is when you have not lived longer Baroque 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.570
 but amazing 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.410
 how incoming goods and 40 degrees occurs No since I have the ball 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.999
 Measure the amount of water measured for the cash register 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.199
 of course 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:15.359
 water tap 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.359
 for this reason, with effective microorganisms 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.349
 I do not go right now everything he added but only a part 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.229
 Third to a half with 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.629
 so that's the really good next to just where they are not yet 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.019
 smashed 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.169
 Damage that otherwise only in the column does not take too much better 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.790
 Reserve on the Ruckus quality no value you put on the shelf needs 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.530
 then also meant the raw food Pauli culprit ingredients not 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.880
 9b said to be picky when the cocoa beans bother when the cup 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.859
 she can do Gernhardt 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.139
 It's supposed to work a little better 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.269
 I find out 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.469
 really delicious 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.469
 and the whole thing is very filling 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:13.759
 and that he has his beautiful cause that is beneficial for all for the fire department 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:14.679
 Lahr 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:18.109
 for the Ruckus loud and for the league took 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.229
 after an hour in the fridge that is a bit hinted 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.909
 very tasty and really enjoyable 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:24.449
 Enjoy your meal
