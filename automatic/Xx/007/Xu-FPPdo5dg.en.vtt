00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:28.580
 We are going on the boat beckstein to is what 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:32.300
 rio de janeiro in camera tremble 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.620
 BrasÃ­lia with validity until a hole looks 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.620
 which has an iron bar 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:52.970
 with the hatchback I was going to try to make a 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:59.210
 comparative with the outback side states 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:02.780
 United has already had it there but one does not 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.070
 no video that can compare water one 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.860
 The island is going to give me the first 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:12.170
 O difference here in chance 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:17.500
 parking is payable if the size 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:20.810
 the size of the store until it is 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:26.930
 large is legal quite similar almost 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:30.910
 there probably will not be a vacancy too 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.910
 parking here that the Tibet 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.910
 specifically 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:49.520
 is and is relatively large like 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.520
 with the ones out there 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.700
 ae 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.940
 but the fact of being paid what is different 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:07.850
 Let's see how it gets there. Probably home. 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:11.720
 crowded good law continuing size is good 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.700
 She's good, but it's not for 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.300
 You'll see when we went there. 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.110
 inside, it's not because of that, I just 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.540
 charging the difference I said out there 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.490
 there on the street side 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.140
 the entrance of another condominium 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.670
 where car is that the people who do not 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.210
 Do you want to pay for parking? 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:40.560
 although a sign there time should 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:45.900
 this would have prohibited parking as it may 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.180
 take but how absurd it is 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.700
 heavy restaurant parking 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.860
 Personal aspect for which it was also now 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.990
 I discovered that there is no more 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:05.160
 Parking entry and exit 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:07.530
 trucks and buses almost betrays them 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.900
 would not leave the entrance and exit now 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.900
 It makes a lot more sense for this 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.060
 parking is also prohibited because this 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.910
 street does not get you anywhere but by force 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.950
 Sunday 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.820
 then that's it 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:29.130
 it's crowded there people leaving the thief 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:33.560
 We got the request to save our time. 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.709
 Mrs. Boss here on the porch waiting. 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.709
 over there 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.370
 A kiss, bye, bye, come on and do it. 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.500
 the famous links 11 vacancies for counselor 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:57.599
 smoke black eye of anger that the barbie 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:04.980
 47 and 50 agents to pick up the other team 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:09.260
 finally 2 who is also famous at 36 junior 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.260
 mx junior 31 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:24.780
 So let's get the rhythm of the 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:29.090
 Felipe Mass Racing that was installed 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.070
 premium port and naughty bear that fury 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.850
 32 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.850
 very well 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:47.189
 I remember I heard the cry not 

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:52.820
 spiral not take it in 

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:57.590
 cut off this motive 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:02.890
 no it was not like a gift to this here 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:06.709
 the difference is that while the problem 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:10.429
 what this hole 

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:10.429
 roberto suspense 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.450
 47min runs what reads 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:36.710
 okay 10 dollars for this deal 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.060
 Look, look, I do not know. 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:43.570
 pillar is a strong but not military force. 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.570
 can have something better 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.810
 I liked that wind tower 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:06.040
 it's fact 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.040
 It is that here is a dinho example was 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.670
 sung 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.519
 ae 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.519
 all at home 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.090
 to refrigerants convention 7 and 95 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:32.669
 the fuji mask two pet bottles 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:38.900
 liter and a half each 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:38.900
 the decisive set was there in sequence
