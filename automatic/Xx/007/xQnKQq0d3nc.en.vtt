00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
throughout the whole 20 weeks we just

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.740 
throughout the whole 20 weeks we just
integrate<00:02:07.069> injury<00:02:07.640> prevention<00:02:08.000> exercises

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
integrate injury prevention exercises

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.419 
integrate injury prevention exercises
the<00:02:08.869> core<00:02:09.170> work<00:02:09.410> working<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.920> shoulders

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
the core work working the shoulders

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.259 
the core work working the shoulders
working<00:02:11.120> your<00:02:11.360> hand<00:02:11.510> cause<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:12.470> make<00:02:12.650> sure

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
working your hand cause to make sure

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.030 
working your hand cause to make sure
that<00:02:14.269> we<00:02:14.359> do<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.570> best<00:02:14.720> we<00:02:14.870> can<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.620> minimize

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
that we do the best we can to minimize

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.420 
that we do the best we can to minimize
the<00:02:16.220> risk<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.459> your<00:02:16.670> injury

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.229 

okay<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:28.799> next<00:02:29.010> question<00:02:29.219> is<00:02:29.700> how<00:02:30.030> do<00:02:30.090> we

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
okay so next question is how do we

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.330 
okay so next question is how do we
actually<00:02:30.359> assess<00:02:30.840> if<00:02:31.469> you've<00:02:31.680> improved<00:02:32.010> over

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
actually assess if you've improved over

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.089 
actually assess if you've improved over
the<00:02:32.400> 20<00:02:32.730> weeks<00:02:32.939> while<00:02:33.780> we<00:02:33.900> do<00:02:34.079> fitness<00:02:34.739> tests

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
the 20 weeks while we do fitness tests

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.220 
the 20 weeks while we do fitness tests
and<00:02:35.310> these<00:02:35.489> fitness<00:02:35.819> tests<00:02:36.180> largely<00:02:36.629> based<00:02:36.900> on

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
and these fitness tests largely based on

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.869 
and these fitness tests largely based on
the<00:02:37.439> standardized<00:02:37.950> protocol<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.609> state

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
the standardized protocol that state

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.020 
the standardized protocol that state
teams<00:02:39.150> use<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.719> cricket<00:02:40.260> australia<00:02:40.650> use<00:02:41.030> the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
teams use a cricket australia use the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.220 
teams use a cricket australia use the
first<00:02:42.150> thing<00:02:42.269> we<00:02:42.359> do<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.599> we<00:02:42.780> look<00:02:43.049> at<00:02:43.140> your

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
first thing we do is we look at your

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.920 
first thing we do is we look at your
sprint<00:02:43.500> times<00:02:43.709> using<00:02:44.040> timing<00:02:44.519> gates<00:02:44.730> over<00:02:45.359> 20

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
sprint times using timing gates over 20

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.800 
sprint times using timing gates over 20
meters<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.849> look<00:02:47.849> at<00:02:47.939> the<00:02:48.000> split<00:02:48.299> times<00:02:48.540> as

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
meters and look at the split times as

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.410 
meters and look at the split times as
well<00:02:49.129> we<00:02:50.129> also<00:02:50.159> look<00:02:50.519> at<00:02:50.609> your<00:02:50.730> jump<00:02:50.969> height<00:02:51.150> so

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
well we also look at your jump height so

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.059 
well we also look at your jump height so
look<00:02:51.569> at<00:02:51.659> your<00:02:51.689> leg<00:02:51.900> power<00:02:52.139> throughout<00:02:52.920> the

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
look at your leg power throughout the

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.459 
look at your leg power throughout the
program<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:54.079> course<00:02:55.079> we<00:02:55.170> look<00:02:55.319> at<00:02:55.409> the

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:55.469 
program of course we look at the

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.319 
program of course we look at the
endurance<00:02:55.950> now<00:02:56.099> in<00:02:56.189> the<00:02:56.280> endurance<00:02:56.730> run<00:02:56.909> we

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
endurance now in the endurance run we

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.670 
endurance now in the endurance run we
use<00:02:57.480> something<00:02:57.810> slightly<00:02:58.079> different<00:02:58.230> and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
use something slightly different and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.610 
use something slightly different and
then<00:02:59.069> we<00:02:59.159> use<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.870> maximum<00:03:00.870> aerobic<00:03:01.319> speed

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
then we use the maximum aerobic speed

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.670 
then we use the maximum aerobic speed
test<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.849> this<00:03:02.970> enables<00:03:03.329> us<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.930> your<00:03:04.500> heart

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
test so this enables us to your heart

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.009 
test so this enables us to your heart
rates<00:03:04.889> as<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.129> go<00:03:05.280> along<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:06.000> also<00:03:06.389> get<00:03:06.569> you<00:03:06.780> a

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
rates as you go along and also get you a

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.710 
rates as you go along and also get you a
specific<00:03:07.319> training<00:03:08.220> threshold<00:03:08.849> but<00:03:09.480> when<00:03:09.629> we

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
specific training threshold but when we

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.449 
specific training threshold but when we
do<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.959> interval<00:03:10.349> running<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:11.040> your<00:03:11.189> speeds

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
do the interval running so your speeds

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.920 
do the interval running so your speeds
are<00:03:11.700> based<00:03:11.879> on<00:03:12.060> your<00:03:12.090> individual<00:03:12.659> times

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
are based on your individual times

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.629 
are based on your individual times
there's<00:03:13.169> no<00:03:13.260> need<00:03:13.439> to<00:03:13.560> worry<00:03:13.769> about<00:03:14.219> trying<00:03:14.549> to

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
there's no need to worry about trying to

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.720 
there's no need to worry about trying to
keep<00:03:14.790> up<00:03:15.000> with<00:03:15.650> top<00:03:16.650> gun<00:03:16.889> in<00:03:17.010> there<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.639> the

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
keep up with top gun in there in the

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.059 
keep up with top gun in there in the
group<00:03:17.969> or<00:03:18.269> it's<00:03:18.810> all<00:03:18.989> engaged<00:03:19.469> at<00:03:19.859> your

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
group or it's all engaged at your

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.449 
group or it's all engaged at your
specific<00:03:20.519> level<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.209> fitness<00:03:22.159> finally<00:03:23.159> we'll

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
specific level of fitness finally we'll

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.860 
specific level of fitness finally we'll
look<00:03:23.519> at<00:03:23.700> as<00:03:23.790> well<00:03:23.939> as<00:03:24.060> body<00:03:24.209> composition<00:03:24.599> so

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
look at as well as body composition so

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.089 
look at as well as body composition so
we<00:03:24.930> don't<00:03:25.109> just<00:03:25.230> take<00:03:25.349> your<00:03:25.500> weight<00:03:25.709> we<00:03:25.950> do<00:03:26.069> a

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
we don't just take your weight we do a

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.539 
we don't just take your weight we do a
full<00:03:27.169> body<00:03:28.169> assessment<00:03:28.769> by<00:03:29.010> looking<00:03:29.340> at<00:03:29.430> your

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
full body assessment by looking at your

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.300 
full body assessment by looking at your
skin<00:03:29.700> folds<00:03:30.269> so<00:03:31.200> over<00:03:31.409> the<00:03:31.500> season<00:03:31.859> we<00:03:31.979> can<00:03:32.129> see

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
skin folds so over the season we can see

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.159 
skin folds so over the season we can see
and<00:03:32.459> typically<00:03:32.760> we<00:03:33.000> see<00:03:33.030> guys<00:03:33.359> come<00:03:33.720> here<00:03:33.930> and

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
and typically we see guys come here and

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.839 
and typically we see guys come here and
throw<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.739> throughout<00:03:34.949> the<00:03:35.069> season<00:03:35.430> they<00:03:35.579> drop

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
throw it throughout the season they drop

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.189 
throw it throughout the season they drop
off<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.180> their<00:03:36.329> skin<00:03:36.479> fraud<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:36.870> it's<00:03:37.019> good

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
off on their skin fraud so it's good

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.009 
off on their skin fraud so it's good
suggest<00:03:38.069> a<00:03:38.159> lowering<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.579> body<00:03:38.819> fat<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.840> those

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
suggest a lowering of body fat so those

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.449 
suggest a lowering of body fat so those
are<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:40.169> key<00:03:40.379> some<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:40.859> key<00:03:41.040> areas<00:03:41.430> of

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
are the key some of the key areas of

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.239 
are the key some of the key areas of
