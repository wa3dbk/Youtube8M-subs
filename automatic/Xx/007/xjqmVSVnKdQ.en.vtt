00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
all right so here is a more advanced

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.999 
all right so here is a more advanced
version<00:00:03.120> of<00:00:03.750> my<00:00:03.959> reign<00:00:04.170> tutorial<00:00:04.650> that<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:04.770> made

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
version of my reign tutorial that I made

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.849 
version of my reign tutorial that I made
some<00:00:05.250> months<00:00:05.490> ago<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:06.350> I'm<00:00:07.350> just<00:00:07.500> going<00:00:07.710> to

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
some months ago and I'm just going to

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.419 
some months ago and I'm just going to
combine<00:00:08.480> the<00:00:09.480> very<00:00:09.690> basic<00:00:10.200> principles<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.219> I

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
combine the very basic principles that I

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.419 
combine the very basic principles that I
gave<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.790> back<00:00:12.389> then<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.960> I've<00:00:13.950> added<00:00:14.190> a

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
gave you back then and I've added a

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.420 
gave you back then and I've added a
bunch<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:15.440> more<00:00:16.440> advanced<00:00:16.800> features<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.310> to

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
bunch of more advanced features just to

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.400 
bunch of more advanced features just to
kind<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.670> show<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.880> what's<00:00:18.210> possible<00:00:18.410> when

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
kind of show you what's possible when

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.750 
kind of show you what's possible when
you<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:19.650> build<00:00:19.890> up<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.189> what<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.580> already

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
you just build up on what you already

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.570 
you just build up on what you already
had<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.840> here's<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.010> short<00:00:23.250> matinee

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
had so here's a just a short matinee

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.880 
had so here's a just a short matinee
sequence<00:00:23.930> kind<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.050> showcasing<00:00:25.619> what<00:00:25.769> I've

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
sequence kind of showcasing what I've

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.640 
sequence kind of showcasing what I've
made<00:00:26.099> here<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:27.390> kind<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.630> threw<00:00:27.900> together

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
made here I just kind of threw together

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.869 
made here I just kind of threw together
possible<00:00:31.570> using<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:32.689> silica<00:00:33.309> so<00:00:34.309> I'm<00:00:34.670> going

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
possible using the silica so I'm going

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.310 
possible using the silica so I'm going
to<00:00:34.910> go<00:00:35.059> through<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:35.300> twice<00:00:35.540> years<00:00:35.809> but<00:00:36.050> I<00:00:36.079> can

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
to go through the twice years but I can

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:45.920 
to go through the twice years but I can
kind<00:00:36.470> of<00:00:36.559> show<00:00:36.770> you

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.750 

all<00:00:48.530> right<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.950> see<00:00:50.130> these<00:00:50.520> are<00:00:50.730> all

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
all right so you can see these are all

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.140 
all right so you can see these are all
just<00:00:51.030> rain<00:00:51.330> plans<00:00:52.460> but<00:00:53.460> adding<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
just rain plans but adding the

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.380 
just rain plans but adding the
combination<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.290> from<00:00:55.590> particle<00:00:56.520> effects<00:00:56.940> for

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
combination of from particle effects for

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.830 
combination of from particle effects for
the<00:00:58.020> drizzling<00:00:58.440> rain<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.040> the<00:00:59.100> squashes<00:00:59.840> plus

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the drizzling rain and the squashes plus

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.240 
the drizzling rain and the squashes plus
rough<00:01:01.170> grain<00:01:01.500> running<00:01:01.770> down<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.010> rope<00:01:02.220> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
rough grain running down the rope and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.830 
rough grain running down the rope and
you<00:01:02.610> can<00:01:02.760> see<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:08.270> you<00:01:09.270> can<00:01:09.420> hear<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.660> course

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you can see here you can hear of course

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.660 
you can see here you can hear of course
all<00:01:10.050> the<00:01:10.140> sound<00:01:10.350> effects<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> Thunder

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
all the sound effects for the Thunder

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.030 
all the sound effects for the Thunder
and<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.850> falling<00:01:12.150> rain<00:01:12.300> and<00:01:12.450> everything<00:01:13.040> so

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
and the falling rain and everything so

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.150 
and the falling rain and everything so
there<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.700> it

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
there you have it

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.840 
there you have it
alright<00:01:17.160> so<00:01:17.310> I'm<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.430> going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.820> through

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
alright so I'm just going to go through

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.630 
alright so I'm just going to go through
a<00:01:18.090> real<00:01:18.750> brief<00:01:18.990> description<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.770> what<00:01:20.610> each

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
a real brief description of what each

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.639 
a real brief description of what each
effect<00:01:21.300> is<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.720> how<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.050> got<00:01:22.320> it

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
effect is and how I got it

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.859 
effect is and how I got it
so<00:01:23.460> we'll<00:01:23.759> start<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.570> rain<00:01:24.690> falling

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
so we'll start with the rain falling

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.389 
so we'll start with the rain falling
again<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.259> know<00:01:25.440> I<00:01:25.530> went<00:01:25.770> over<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.100> very

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
again I know I went over this very

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.180 
again I know I went over this very
briefly<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.119> last<00:01:27.390> tutorial<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:29.100> I'm

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
briefly in the last tutorial so I'm

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.370 
briefly in the last tutorial so I'm
going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.399> trade<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.759> again<00:01:30.060> though<00:01:30.380> all

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
going to trade this again though all

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.639 
going to trade this again though all
that<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.830> is<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.300> rain<00:01:34.020> texture<00:01:34.440> that

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
that it is is it's a a rain texture that

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.940 
that it is is it's a a rain texture that
pants<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.670> pans<00:01:35.850> downward<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.960> that's

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
pants it just pans downward and that's

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.820 
pants it just pans downward and that's
just<00:01:38.160> all<00:01:38.280> there<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.090> set<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.390> to

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
just all there is to it you set it to

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.620 
just all there is to it you set it to
translucent<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:40.979> unlit<00:01:41.399> and<00:01:41.580> make<00:01:42.360> sure<00:01:42.509> you

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
translucent and unlit and make sure you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.180 
translucent and unlit and make sure you
select<00:01:42.840> two-sided<00:01:43.440> if<00:01:43.590> you're<00:01:43.710> gonna<00:01:43.800> apply

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
select two-sided if you're gonna apply

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.450 
select two-sided if you're gonna apply
it<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> plane<00:01:44.789> and<00:01:45.080> then<00:01:46.080> you<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.770> affect

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
it to a plane and then you can affect

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.450 
it to a plane and then you can affect
the<00:01:48.330> pan<00:01:48.570> speed<00:01:48.960> depending<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.770> how<00:01:50.040> fast<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the pan speed depending on how fast you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.960 
the pan speed depending on how fast you
wanted<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.790> go<00:01:50.940> and<00:01:51.470> I<00:01:52.470> also<00:01:52.860> did<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.190> texture

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
wanted to go and I also did a texture

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.260 
wanted to go and I also did a texture
coordinates<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:55.110> affect<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.610> tiling<00:01:57.090> of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
coordinates to affect like the tiling of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.920 
coordinates to affect like the tiling of
the<00:01:57.869> texture<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.790> if<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.090> didn't<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.420> those<00:02:00.659> I

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the texture so if I didn't have those I

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.420 
the texture so if I didn't have those I
would<00:02:01.260> have<00:02:01.409> huge<00:02:01.590> rain<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.100> pretty<00:02:02.280> much

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
would have huge rain it's pretty much

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.550 
would have huge rain it's pretty much
how<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.900> all<00:02:03.900> right<00:02:04.020> what<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.200> wanted<00:02:04.439> to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
how it is all right what I wanted to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.410 
how it is all right what I wanted to
show<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.770> next<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.310> how<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.670> got<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.030> effect

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
show you next is how I got this effect

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.180 
show you next is how I got this effect
over<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.320> rain<00:02:07.500> dripping<00:02:07.830> off<00:02:08.010> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
over here of the rain dripping off the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.020 
over here of the rain dripping off the
roof<00:02:08.369> now<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.540> particle<00:02:09.869> effect<00:02:10.290> and

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
roof now it's a particle effect and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.750 
roof now it's a particle effect and
literally<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.570> is<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.900> bunch<00:02:13.410> of

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
literally all that it is is a bunch of

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.000 
literally all that it is is a bunch of
very<00:02:14.760> long<00:02:15.000> rain<00:02:15.780> particles<00:02:16.290> falling<00:02:16.590> down

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.920 

you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.190> see<00:02:20.340> it's<00:02:20.489> if<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.150> set<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.510> way<00:02:21.690> well

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
you can see it's if I set this way well

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.840 
you can see it's if I set this way well
you<00:02:22.049> can<00:02:22.200> see<00:02:22.350> very<00:02:22.709> well<00:02:22.769> how<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:25.850> it's

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
you can see very well how it is it's

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.210 
you can see very well how it is it's
just<00:02:27.180> it's<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.600> particle<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> spawns<00:02:28.890> and

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
just it's a particle of the spawns and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.210 
just it's a particle of the spawns and
then<00:02:29.310> comes<00:02:29.610> down<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.170> drips<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.829> looks<00:02:32.010> like

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
then comes down and drips it looks like

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.590 
then comes down and drips it looks like
but<00:02:32.430> then<00:02:32.549> when<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:32.820> a<00:02:32.880> lot<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.120> them<00:02:33.360> it

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
but then when you have a lot of them it

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.210 
but then when you have a lot of them it
it<00:02:33.870> looks<00:02:34.079> a<00:02:34.170> lot<00:02:34.290> better<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.980> thing<00:02:38.190> that

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
it looks a lot better so the thing that

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.960 
it looks a lot better so the thing that
got<00:02:38.489> me<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.910> most<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.780> was<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.459> set<00:02:41.459> PSA

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
got me the most on this was to set PSA

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.690 
got me the most on this was to set PSA
to<00:02:42.030> velocity<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:43.530> way<00:02:43.799> when<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.610> look

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
to velocity that way when you look

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.720 
to velocity that way when you look
around<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.959> stays<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:47.340> right<00:02:47.519> size

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
around it it stays the right size

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.930 
around it it stays the right size
relative<00:02:48.329> to<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.780> world<00:02:49.579> all<00:02:50.579> right<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.820> next

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
relative to the world all right the next

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.220 
relative to the world all right the next
thing<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.239> wanted<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.510> show<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.780> quick<00:02:51.989> is

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
thing I wanted to show you a quick is

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.560 
thing I wanted to show you a quick is
just<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.850> particle<00:02:53.850> effect<00:02:54.060> down<00:02:54.209> here<00:02:54.419> from

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
just this particle effect down here from

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.470 
just this particle effect down here from
the<00:02:54.660> splash<00:02:55.579> it's<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.730> separate<00:02:57.120> particle

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
the splash it's a separate particle

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.400 
the splash it's a separate particle
effect<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.870> I

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
effect that I

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.790 
effect that I
put<00:02:59.650> together<00:02:59.800> here<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:01.440> although<00:03:02.440> this<00:03:02.620> one

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
put together here and although this one

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.390 
put together here and although this one
is<00:03:02.830> is<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:04.140> simple<00:03:05.140> it's<00:03:05.530> almost<00:03:05.830> like<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.070> smoke

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
is is a simple it's almost like a smoke

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.870 
is is a simple it's almost like a smoke
effect<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:08.110> then<00:03:08.470> water<00:03:09.070> splashing<00:03:09.610> up<00:03:09.760> on

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
effect and then water splashing up on

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.300 
effect and then water splashing up on
top<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.210> that<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:11.350> that<00:03:11.380> one's<00:03:11.680> pretty<00:03:12.100> simple

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
top of that so that one's pretty simple

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.960 
top of that so that one's pretty simple
overall<00:03:14.160> alright<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:15.340> then<00:03:15.520> this<00:03:15.670> longer

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
overall alright so then this longer

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.110 
overall alright so then this longer
particle<00:03:16.540> effect<00:03:16.870> is<00:03:17.340> largely<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.580> same<00:03:18.610> it's

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
particle effect is largely the same it's

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.410 
particle effect is largely the same it's
just<00:03:19.240> the<00:03:19.570> same<00:03:19.810> thing<00:03:20.020> almost<00:03:20.710> exactly

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
just the same thing almost exactly

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.380 
just the same thing almost exactly
except<00:03:22.420> it's<00:03:22.630> got<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.140> longer<00:03:23.470> spawn<00:03:23.770> point<00:03:24.100> and

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
except it's got a longer spawn point and

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.060 
except it's got a longer spawn point and
it<00:03:25.390> doesn't<00:03:25.660> have<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.780> smoke<00:03:26.050> effect<00:03:26.380> alright

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
it doesn't have the smoke effect alright

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.860 
it doesn't have the smoke effect alright
and<00:03:27.280> then<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:27.700> next<00:03:28.030> thing<00:03:28.150> here<00:03:28.420> is<00:03:28.570> this

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
and then the next thing here is this

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.460 
and then the next thing here is this
rainfall<00:03:29.500> coming<00:03:30.370> down<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.090> roof<00:03:31.470> that's

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
rainfall coming down the roof that's

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.490 
rainfall coming down the roof that's
actually<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:32.980> decal<00:03:33.640> that<00:03:33.820> I<00:03:33.940> made<00:03:34.380> or<00:03:35.380> it's

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
actually a decal that I made or it's

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.790 
actually a decal that I made or it's
just<00:03:36.280> panning<00:03:36.730> again<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.360> lot<00:03:37.720> like<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.230> grain

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
just panning again a lot like the grain

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.030 
just panning again a lot like the grain
where<00:03:39.700> it's<00:03:39.850> translucent<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.780> Hong<00:03:41.590> shading

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
where it's translucent and Hong shading

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.750 
where it's translucent and Hong shading
in<00:03:42.160> my<00:03:42.850> case<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.270> added<00:03:43.540> them<00:03:43.690> as<00:03:43.930> decals<00:03:44.440> but<00:03:44.800> a

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
in my case I added them as decals but a

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.930 
in my case I added them as decals but a
smart<00:03:46.570> designer<00:03:46.980> would<00:03:47.980> go<00:03:48.400> and<00:03:48.550> add<00:03:48.730> them

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
smart designer would go and add them

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.250 
smart designer would go and add them
instead<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:49.630> their<00:03:50.520> original<00:03:52.140> material<00:03:53.140> that

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
instead to their original material that

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.890 
instead to their original material that
they<00:03:53.350> use<00:03:53.470> on<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.680> mesh<00:03:53.890> if<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:55.240> UVs<00:03:55.600> are<00:03:55.690> laid

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
they use on the mesh if the UVs are laid

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.410 
they use on the mesh if the UVs are laid
out<00:03:56.050> properly<00:03:56.290> on<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.770> mesh<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.970> works<00:03:58.210> out<00:03:58.390> a

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
out properly on the mesh it works out a

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.480 
out properly on the mesh it works out a
lot<00:03:58.600> better<00:03:58.810> but<00:03:59.260> because<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.740> just<00:04:00.190> used<00:04:00.400> the

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
lot better but because I just used the

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.630 
lot better but because I just used the
mesh<00:04:00.700> that<00:04:00.910> was<00:04:01.030> already<00:04:01.270> in<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.900> UDK<00:04:02.140> I

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
mesh that was already in the UDK I

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.040 
mesh that was already in the UDK I
couldn't<00:04:03.640> do<00:04:03.910> that<00:04:04.120> like<00:04:04.480> it<00:04:04.600> just<00:04:04.780> wouldn't

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
couldn't do that like it just wouldn't

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.780 
couldn't do that like it just wouldn't
work<00:04:05.170> with<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.650> way<00:04:05.830> that<00:04:05.950> I<00:04:05.980> wanted<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.370> to<00:04:06.520> so

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
work with the way that I wanted it to so

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.730 
work with the way that I wanted it to so
you<00:04:07.330> can<00:04:07.450> see<00:04:07.600> this<00:04:07.750> particle<00:04:08.170> effect<00:04:08.470> here

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
you can see this particle effect here

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.430 
you can see this particle effect here
all<00:04:09.400> that<00:04:09.730> it<00:04:09.820> is<00:04:10.000> if<00:04:10.360> you<00:04:10.720> go<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:10.930> take<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.170> look

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
all that it is if you go and take a look

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.010 
all that it is if you go and take a look
at<00:04:11.530> it<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.890> have<00:04:12.580> this<00:04:12.820> mesh<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.240> I<00:04:13.330> made<00:04:13.540> where

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
at it I have this mesh that I made where

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.770 
at it I have this mesh that I made where
it's<00:04:14.230> basically<00:04:14.950> just<00:04:15.070> a<00:04:15.640> cone<00:04:16.210> with<00:04:16.480> the<00:04:16.600> ends

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
it's basically just a cone with the ends

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.470 
it's basically just a cone with the ends
cut<00:04:16.960> off<00:04:17.140> and<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:17.799> applied<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.460> extra<00:04:19.210> to<00:04:19.299> that

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
cut off and I applied a extra to that

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.840 
cut off and I applied a extra to that
and<00:04:19.720> then<00:04:20.020> basically<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:20.890> spawn<00:04:21.430> it<00:04:21.580> in<00:04:21.700> you

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
and then basically you spawn it in you

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.760 
and then basically you spawn it in you
make<00:04:22.000> it<00:04:22.150> bigger<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.660> make<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.170> fade<00:04:23.350> out<00:04:23.500> the

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
make it bigger you make it fade out the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.100 
make it bigger you make it fade out the
end<00:04:23.920> and<00:04:24.130> then<00:04:24.670> you<00:04:24.730> do<00:04:24.850> it<00:04:24.880> over<00:04:25.330> a<00:04:25.360> large<00:04:25.900> area

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
end and then you do it over a large area

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.490 
end and then you do it over a large area
and<00:04:26.350> you<00:04:26.440> make<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.740> go<00:04:26.890> very<00:04:27.070> quickly<00:04:28.110> alright

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
and you make it go very quickly alright

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.440 
and you make it go very quickly alright
and<00:04:30.100> of<00:04:30.190> course<00:04:30.460> another<00:04:30.700> very<00:04:31.000> important

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
up with some ways to use these effects

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.720 
up with some ways to use these effects
