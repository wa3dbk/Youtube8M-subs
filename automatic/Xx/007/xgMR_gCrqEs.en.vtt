I<00:00:00.149> get<00:00:00.480> a<00:00:00.510> lot<00:00:00.630> of<00:00:00.690> questions<00:00:00.960> about<00:00:01.319> uh<00:00:01.439> Chuck

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
I get a lot of questions about uh Chuck

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.300 
I get a lot of questions about uh Chuck
adjusting<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.669> linkage<00:00:03.060> and<00:00:03.330> really<00:00:04.310> what

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
adjusting the linkage and really what

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.619 
adjusting the linkage and really what
we're<00:00:05.430> doing<00:00:05.460> is<00:00:05.700> setting<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.270> linkage

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
we're doing is setting the linkage

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.810 
we're doing is setting the linkage
there's<00:00:07.290> not<00:00:07.560> much<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.069> way<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.280> adjust<00:00:08.460> a

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
there's not much of a way to adjust a

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.850 
there's not much of a way to adjust a
linkage<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.330> kicks<00:00:09.630> in<00:00:09.870> right<00:00:10.110> at<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.530> end<00:00:10.679> of

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
linkage it kicks in right at the end of

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.190 
linkage it kicks in right at the end of
the<00:00:10.980> throttle<00:00:11.550> travel<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.870> can<00:00:13.019> drive

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
the throttle travel so you can drive

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.079 
the throttle travel so you can drive
down<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.530> road<00:00:13.559> 80<00:00:14.219> miles<00:00:14.490> an<00:00:14.670> hour<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:15.000> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
rear it goes on the inside I see a lot

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.330 
rear it goes on the inside I see a lot
of<00:00:38.820> people<00:00:39.180> run<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.629> outside<00:00:40.129> that's<00:00:41.129> not

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
of people run on the outside that's not

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.069 
of people run on the outside that's not
right<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:41.969> doesn't<00:00:42.660> hurt<00:00:42.780> anything<00:00:42.989> but

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
right you can doesn't hurt anything but

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.779 
right you can doesn't hurt anything but
it's<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.710> little<00:00:43.920> cleaner<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.340> run<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
it's a little cleaner to run on the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.100 
it's a little cleaner to run on the
inside<00:00:46.100> what<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.190> look<00:00:47.399> at<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.690> throttle

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
inside what I look at is the throttle

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.729 
inside what I look at is the throttle
stops<00:00:50.510> there<00:00:51.510> right<00:00:51.750> here<00:00:53.180> you<00:00:54.180> know

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
stops there right here you know

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.000 
stops there right here you know
carburetor<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.980> open<00:00:56.340> wide<00:00:56.520> open<00:00:56.850> throttle

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
carburetor is open wide open throttle

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.290 
carburetor is open wide open throttle
that's<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.219> stops<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.760> right<00:00:59.789> there<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that's what stops it right there and you

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.100 
that's what stops it right there and you
can<00:01:00.539> see<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:02.219> center<00:01:02.579> one<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.030> right<00:01:03.239> open<00:01:03.570> see

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
can see the center one is right open see

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.830 
can see the center one is right open see
that<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> stop<00:01:05.369> here<00:01:05.689> let's<00:01:06.689> hit

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
that you can see the stop here let's hit

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.370 
that you can see the stop here let's hit
the<00:01:06.990> stop<00:01:07.580> but<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> rear<00:01:08.880> one<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.210> not<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the stop but the rear one is not so the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.219 
the stop but the rear one is not so the
way<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.530> do<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.340> elongate<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> run

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
way to do that is the elongate the run

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.929 
way to do that is the elongate the run
to<00:01:13.229> make<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> rear<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.860> longer<00:01:14.100> make<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.790> red

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
to make the rear one longer make the red

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.109 
to make the rear one longer make the red
one<00:01:15.090> open<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.400> basically<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.909> matter

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
one open so basically it's just a matter

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.690 
one open so basically it's just a matter
of<00:01:18.210> getting<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.780> right<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.220> all<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
of getting that right so that all the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.570 
of getting that right so that all the
throttle<00:01:21.060> stops<00:01:21.650> hit<00:01:22.650> at<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> same<00:01:23.220> time

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
throttle stops hit at the same time

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.779 
throttle stops hit at the same time
still<00:01:24.210> not<00:01:24.360> quite<00:01:24.540> open

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.069 

there<00:01:31.789> you<00:01:31.880> go<00:01:31.969> so<00:01:32.210> that's<00:01:32.420> that's<00:01:32.659> how<00:01:32.899> you'd

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
there you go so that's that's how you'd

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.920 
there you go so that's that's how you'd
said<00:01:33.259> it<00:01:33.289> you'd<00:01:33.500> put<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.770> counter<00:01:34.039> you<00:01:34.490> would

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
said it you'd put the counter you would

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.249 
said it you'd put the counter you would
tighten<00:01:35.930> this<00:01:36.250> that<00:01:37.250> up<00:01:37.520> against<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.539> fitting

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
tighten this that up against the fitting

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.880 
tighten this that up against the fitting
there<00:01:39.409> something<00:01:39.799> to<00:01:40.039> keep<00:01:40.189> moving<00:01:41.890> comes

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
there something to keep moving comes

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.950 
there something to keep moving comes
pretty<00:01:43.130> close<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.789> ride<00:01:44.060> here<00:01:44.420> but<00:01:44.840> it

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
pretty close to the ride here but it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.529 
pretty close to the ride here but it
shouldn't<00:01:45.289> hit<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:46.640> accelerator<00:01:47.270> pump

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
shouldn't hit to this accelerator pump

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.929 
shouldn't hit to this accelerator pump
ride<00:01:47.780> if<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.590> does<00:01:48.829> hit<00:01:49.130> you've<00:01:49.429> got<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.640> couple

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
ride if it does hit you've got a couple

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.490 
ride if it does hit you've got a couple
of<00:01:50.179> things<00:01:50.990> you<00:01:51.140> can<00:01:51.170> do<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:52.250> can<00:01:52.630> put<00:01:53.630> this

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
of things you can do you can put this

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.649 
of things you can do you can put this
arm<00:01:54.860> in<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.189> vise<00:01:55.399> and<00:01:55.700> just<00:01:56.179> spend<00:01:56.390> it<00:01:56.539> out

arm in a vise and just spend it out
slightly<00:01:57.049> you<00:01:57.289> don't<00:01:57.439> do<00:01:57.619> it<00:01:57.710> while<00:01:57.860> it's<00:01:57.979> on

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
slightly you don't do it while it's on

arm<00:02:00.649> it's<00:02:00.860> how<00:02:01.069> long<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.490> screw<00:02:01.789> of<00:02:01.909> the

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
arm it's how long the screw of the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.870 
arm it's how long the screw of the
original<00:02:02.479> is<00:02:02.630> pinned<00:02:02.929> on<00:02:03.110> but<00:02:03.349> in<00:02:03.439> any<00:02:03.530> case

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
original is pinned on but in any case

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.179 
original is pinned on but in any case
you<00:02:04.880> don't<00:02:05.060> want<00:02:05.179> to<00:02:05.240> pull<00:02:05.420> on<00:02:05.539> that<00:02:05.569> rod<00:02:06.189> with

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
you don't want to pull on that rod with

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.620 
you don't want to pull on that rod with
it<00:02:07.310> on<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:07.520> carburetor<00:02:07.939> if<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.179> clamp<00:02:08.450> this

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
it on the carburetor if you clamp this

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.539 
it on the carburetor if you clamp this
into<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:08.959> vise<00:02:09.200> even<00:02:09.590> on<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.830> carburetor<00:02:10.220> you

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
into a vise even on the carburetor you

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.039 
into a vise even on the carburetor you
can<00:02:10.700> do<00:02:10.849> that<00:02:10.970> take<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.269> carburetor<00:02:11.569> off<00:02:11.720> but

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
can do that take the carburetor off but

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.500 
can do that take the carburetor off but
in<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.230> vise<00:02:12.410> pull<00:02:13.040> on<00:02:13.190> this<00:02:13.549> the<00:02:14.150> other<00:02:14.330> thing

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
in the vise pull on this the other thing

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.270 
in the vise pull on this the other thing
you<00:02:14.660> can<00:02:14.840> do<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.260> haven't<00:02:15.590> had<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:15.980> do<00:02:16.130> this

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
you can do and I haven't had to do this

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.339 
you can do and I haven't had to do this
actually<00:02:16.549> there's<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.390> small<00:02:17.720> space<00:02:18.080> up<00:02:18.319> here

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
actually there's a small space up here

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.039 
actually there's a small space up here
between<00:02:19.190> this<00:02:19.370> J<00:02:19.670> bar<00:02:19.910> linkage<00:02:20.299> and<00:02:20.750> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
throttle linkage on the carburetors just

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.550 
throttle linkage on the carburetors just
a<00:02:22.549> washer<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.200> pre<00:02:24.200> fit<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.610> was<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:27.410> was

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
a washer I pre fit this and I was it was

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.569 
a washer I pre fit this and I was it was
too<00:02:27.739> close

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
too close

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.039 
too close
peg<00:02:28.940> heater<00:02:29.209> was<00:02:29.450> hitting<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.930> accelerator

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
peg heater was hitting the accelerator

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.530 
peg heater was hitting the accelerator
pump<00:02:30.700> so<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.730> put<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:33.700> another<00:02:34.700> way<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:34.940> avoid

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
pump so I put a another way to avoid

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.940 
pump so I put a another way to avoid
that<00:02:35.750> would<00:02:35.930> have<00:02:36.049> been<00:02:36.200> about<00:02:36.380> this<00:02:36.560> device

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
that would have been about this device

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.000 
that would have been about this device
and<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.880> this<00:02:38.239> outward<00:02:38.600> it<00:02:39.350> really<00:02:39.650> wasn't

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
and and this outward it really wasn't

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.309 
and and this outward it really wasn't
bad<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.760> just<00:02:41.299> a<00:02:41.450> difference<00:02:41.870> does<00:02:42.049> you<00:02:42.140> got<00:02:42.290> a

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
bad so just a difference does you got a

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.680 
bad so just a difference does you got a
lot<00:02:42.440> of<00:02:42.470> reproduction<00:02:43.160> here<00:02:43.790> just

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
lot of reproduction here just

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.930 
lot of reproduction here just
differences<00:02:45.200> between<00:02:45.920> one<00:02:46.370> carburetor<00:02:46.850> and

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
differences between one carburetor and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.270 
differences between one carburetor and
another<00:02:50.019> passenger<00:02:51.019> side<00:02:51.410> basically<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
another passenger side basically the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.400 
another passenger side basically the
very<00:02:52.910> simple<00:02:53.329> long<00:02:53.540> rod<00:02:53.840> that<00:02:54.049> hooks<00:02:54.230> the

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
very simple long rod that hooks the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.289 
very simple long rod that hooks the
front<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.739> back<00:02:54.859> carburetors<00:02:55.519> couple<00:02:56.090> things

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
front and back carburetors couple things

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.629 
front and back carburetors couple things
to<00:02:56.450> look<00:02:56.480> at<00:02:56.780> here<00:02:57.019> these<00:02:57.680> levers<00:02:58.040> from<00:02:58.400> front

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
to look at here these levers from front

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.599 
to look at here these levers from front
to<00:02:58.700> back<00:02:58.819> are<00:02:59.150> different<00:03:00.040> if<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.190> look<00:03:01.340> at<00:03:01.489> the

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
to back are different if you look at the

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.870 
to back are different if you look at the
hole<00:03:01.850> in<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.389> rear<00:03:02.569> carburetor<00:03:03.220> linkage<00:03:04.220> it's

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
hole in the rear carburetor linkage it's

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.960 
hole in the rear carburetor linkage it's
just<00:03:05.150> big<00:03:05.359> enough<00:03:05.389> to<00:03:05.750> fit<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.709> rod<00:03:06.920> in<00:03:07.220> the

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
just big enough to fit the rod in the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:08.590 
just big enough to fit the rod in the
front<00:03:08.239> window

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
front window

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.360 
front window
it's<00:03:08.900> an<00:03:09.049> oval<00:03:09.319> shaped<00:03:09.590> hole<00:03:09.829> it<00:03:10.010> should<00:03:10.040> be

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
it's an oval shaped hole it should be

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.250 
it's an oval shaped hole it should be
and<00:03:10.639> that's<00:03:11.269> so<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:11.720> they'll<00:03:11.900> be<00:03:12.049> a<00:03:12.079> little

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
and that's so that they'll be a little

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.610 
and that's so that they'll be a little
playing<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.920> rod<00:03:13.100> won't<00:03:13.370> get<00:03:13.579> hung<00:03:13.790> up<00:03:14.049> I<00:03:15.049> have

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
playing the rod won't get hung up I have

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.580 
playing the rod won't get hung up I have
that<00:03:15.889> the<00:03:16.370> grasshopper<00:03:16.910> Clips<00:03:17.150> off<00:03:17.359> this<00:03:17.660> for

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
that the grasshopper Clips off this for

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.990 
that the grasshopper Clips off this for
pre<00:03:18.980> fitting<00:03:21.100> so<00:03:22.100> you<00:03:22.220> put<00:03:22.430> in<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.579> back<00:03:22.760> one

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
pre fitting so you put in the back one

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.300 
pre fitting so you put in the back one
it<00:03:23.209> should<00:03:23.480> be<00:03:23.660> right<00:03:23.870> in<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.109> middle<00:03:24.290> of<00:03:24.889> the

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
it should be right in the middle of the

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.490 
it should be right in the middle of the
center<00:03:25.609> of<00:03:25.849> this<00:03:26.060> front<00:03:26.930> one<00:03:27.079> so<00:03:27.260> there's<00:03:27.440> a

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
center of this front one so there's a

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.470 
center of this front one so there's a
little<00:03:27.680> wiggle<00:03:27.920> room<00:03:28.280> here<00:03:28.310> when<00:03:28.639> you<00:03:28.760> step<00:03:29.299> on

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
little wiggle room here when you step on

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.740 
little wiggle room here when you step on
it<00:03:30.040> so<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.190> there<00:03:31.340> won't<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:32.150> that's<00:03:32.389> how<00:03:32.660> it

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
it so that there won't and that's how it

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.059 
it so that there won't and that's how it
should<00:03:32.810> be<00:03:32.989> so<00:03:33.319> that<00:03:33.470> it<00:03:33.590> won't<00:03:33.739> hang<00:03:33.980> out

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
should be so that it won't hang out

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.479 
should be so that it won't hang out
the<00:03:35.790> rod<00:03:36.000> has<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.330> bend<00:03:36.659> in<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.900> middle<00:03:37.140> here

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
the rod has a bend in the middle here

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.190 
the rod has a bend in the middle here
and<00:03:38.489> that's<00:03:38.849> how<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.090> adjust<00:03:39.269> it<00:03:39.689> so<00:03:39.959> if<00:03:40.049> it's

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
and that's how to adjust it so if it's

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.500 
and that's how to adjust it so if it's
it's<00:03:40.769> not<00:03:41.010> right<00:03:41.909> in<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.060> middle<00:03:42.239> of<00:03:42.329> this

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
it's not right in the middle of this

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.559 
it's not right in the middle of this
oval<00:03:42.900> hole<00:03:43.079> in<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.319> front<00:03:43.560> then<00:03:44.459> bend<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.420> rod

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
oval hole in the front then bend the rod

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.990 
oval hole in the front then bend the rod
so<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.140> will<00:03:46.260> be<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:47.189> the<00:03:47.340> grasshopper

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
so that it will be and the grasshopper

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.940 
so that it will be and the grasshopper
clips<00:03:48.239> of<00:03:48.450> course<00:03:48.659> that's<00:03:49.290> what<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.500> call<00:03:49.799> them

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
clips of course that's what I call them

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.119 
clips of course that's what I call them
the<00:03:50.069> little<00:03:50.340> grasshopper<00:03:50.970> like<00:03:51.860> easy<00:03:52.860> to

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
the little grasshopper like easy to

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.300 
the little grasshopper like easy to
install<00:03:54.290> front<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.379> rear<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.069> you're

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
install front and rear and and you're

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.690 
install front and rear and and you're
done

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
done

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.170 
done
so<00:03:57.180> it's<00:03:57.390> to<00:03:57.540> place<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.170> linkage<00:03:59.180> remember

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
so it's to place the linkage remember

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.240 
so it's to place the linkage remember
you<00:04:00.299> don't<00:04:00.450> really<00:04:00.599> adjust<00:04:01.049> it<00:04:01.230> set<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.159> over

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
you don't really adjust it set it over

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.849 
you don't really adjust it set it over
on<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.640> driver's<00:04:03.599> side<00:04:03.629> so<00:04:04.349> that<00:04:04.500> all<00:04:04.650> three

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
on the driver's side so that all three

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.619 
on the driver's side so that all three
carburetors<00:04:05.189> are<00:04:05.609> open<00:04:05.939> at<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.120> same<00:04:06.329> time

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
carburetors are open at the same time

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.140 
carburetors are open at the same time
and<00:04:07.170> then<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.129> set<00:04:08.370> it<00:04:08.459> on<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.670> passenger

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
and then you set it on the passenger

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.119 
and then you set it on the passenger
side<00:04:09.329> so<00:04:09.390> that<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:10.019> long<00:04:10.349> rod<00:04:10.590> is<00:04:10.859> right<00:04:11.040> in

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
side so that the long rod is right in

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.559 
side so that the long rod is right in
the<00:04:11.190> center<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.640> oval<00:04:11.790> hole<00:04:12.090> which<00:04:12.299> is<00:04:12.329> in

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
the center of the oval hole which is in

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.449 
the center of the oval hole which is in
the<00:04:12.659> front<00:04:12.810> pro-grade<00:04:13.319> or<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:13.560> want<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.769> put

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
the front pro-grade or you want to put

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.349 
the front pro-grade or you want to put
the<00:04:15.530> lever<00:04:16.530> with<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.799> round<00:04:17.190> hole<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:17.699> the

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
the lever with the round hole in the

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.539 
the lever with the round hole in the
back
