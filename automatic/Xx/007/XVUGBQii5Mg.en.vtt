00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.260
 essence and respected listeners continues 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:13.080
 cycle of various useful kitchen tips 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.410
 because for those who want something 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.480
 find out and who will ever do 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:25.580
 imagine the kitchen today I will focus on 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:31.109
 gas panels of the so-called stoves 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:33.710
 old fashioned talk and they are still called 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:39.960
 gas surfaces 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:42.320
 Well, not in principle, there are different here 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.539
 you see on in the stainless steel 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.660
 they are also still in enamel such 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.180
 Well, there are more modern designs 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.620
 the design does not happen in glass that is 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.449
 there is a flat glass and on it basically 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.520
 there are burners 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:04.260
 well, what is the difference in principle 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.840
 significant difference is the lattice 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.320
 that's which you see here that is 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.770
 here is a cast - iron grate 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.920
 it is very convenient in principle it is very 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.890
 massive does not bend and and wash well and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.610
 so on, that is, from where to the lattice 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.090
 it is believed that it is more advanced 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.090
 more prestigious 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.000
 gas panels are therefore desirable to 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.020
 if you will take 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.970
 preferably take with a cast iron grill 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.430
 there are inexpensive in principle this you see 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.710
 firms vento 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.880
 it is not expensive firm well, a good movie 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:52.170
 she also releases and releases videos 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.800
 hood pure moment and so plates too 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.560
 excellent means that there is generally in the plates 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.280
 In principle, there are 2 plates like you 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.790
 options 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.870
 that is, it is electrical ignition and gas control 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.640
 what is this tell 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:17.070
 electrical ignition is all clear here we are 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:21.600
 we press the button of any ring and goes 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:26.010
 here the spark the spark goes this and I will hide 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:32.670
 gas is ignited gas control is this 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:35.900
 function when the gas is running it is damped by 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.900
 for any reason and 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.220
 gas is cut off by a special sensor 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.540
 there is it is also very convenient especially this 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.950
 mommies who love milk 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.040
 boil well and then basically any 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.130
 pan there if she escaped gas goes out 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.040
 can not type 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.480
 a lot of gas so to speak but in such stoves 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.350
 if there is gas control 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.790
 that is, it can be said impossible and 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:11.880
 very good option which 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:15.810
 may save someone's health or 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.020
 life that is everything happens very 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.020
 simply 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.599
 burner principle should warm up 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:34.970
 handouts will work and in principle already 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:38.060
 you can remove the hand that is, if if 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.380
 speed burner may not have time yet 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:45.560
 warm up and give as it were not lit 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.560
 it's not scary that is, see here all 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.590
 sensor turned on now you can arm 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.069
 let go and then already goes like 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.099
 some kind of adjustment is a turbo burner 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.709
 the so -called it is less it is ordinary 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:05.470
 rear 2 burners 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:08.750
 principle how important and everything I told you 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:12.610
 You make a decision when buying a Well 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:18.169
 still wanted to say on the stainless steel of course 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:20.900
 all fat points are not very visible there 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.520
 blemishes ie a mediator nose if u 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.000
 you there will be glass glass 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.680
 the surface is especially black then you are very 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.660
 strongly instantly literally after each 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.600
 cooking absolutely any dish 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.310
 although even boil eggs that is all 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.080
 equal you will have different points the 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.660
 easier speaking to keep in 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.320
 perfect clean black glass 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.740
 surface 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:50.330
 instead this is not the same thing you have to 3 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.580
 4 5 6 1 day I wash who does not often 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.039
 enjoys but on principle beautiful but 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:05:01.090
 black she is always usually brand and therefore 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:04.880
 buy already think what you need and 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.789
 buy yourself the necessary and call 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.490
 surface thank you all for your attention
