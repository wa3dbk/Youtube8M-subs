00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.330
 let's make a chocolate is very 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.080
 easy that you can prepare at home very 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.120
 simple 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.570
 what are you going to need liquid cream for 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.570
 mount 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 White 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.310
 and also 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:40.880
 the 100 grams until good as 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.880
 we have said we boil the cream 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.140
 Let's go stirring with a spoon 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.850
 also from time to time while 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.080
 heat while boiling let's cut it 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.430
 the chocolate 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.780
 I will use as I told you this one 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.340
 what is dark chocolate what can you do 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.340
 with white or with milk chocolate 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.020
 good that you do not miss that you pass 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.250
 neither with what grass is enough 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.430
 let it boil a little bit and I will add 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.550
 cinnamon which is totally optional a 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.020
 teaspoon if you want less the truth 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.670
 is that then in the end the taste with so much 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.110
 cinnamon I did not like it too much so I 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.700
 would remove a little 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.820
 well, little by little, we are going to go 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.040
 adding the chocolate to melt it already 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.390
 putting out the fire and if you see necessary what 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.220
 you understand a little you put it very 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.520
 short so that the chocolate melts 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.520
 inside 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.200
 I put it at a very low temperature 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.820
 in 3 more or less from 1 to 10 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.800
 depending on how your plate is 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.070
 induction plates and good goes from 1 to 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.070
 10 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.330
 well with the spoon 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.710
 so what you have on hand is going to go 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.740
 stirring well so that the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.750
 chocolate 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.439
 add the best bit by bit so that the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.439
 cream absorb it 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.620
 in the supermarkets they sell a chocolate 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.480
 which is to make chocolate to the cup 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.430
 desserts and so on, that's the one 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.960
 you have to buy the normal tablets 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.500
 that are to eat directly the 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.270
 waves 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.270
 to colate kitchen to call it that 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.569
 good as you see left with a sauce 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.950
 very thick chocolate 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.269
 and now that I have it totally 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.269
 melted I've passed it to a bowl 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.129
 and I finish melting what are not left 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.170
 lumps that are as fine as possible 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.150
 now with the cream the cream already mounted 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.439
 sweet of these pastry that serve 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.970
 for desserts for example for 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:36.140
 strawberries or the pies as we add 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.010
 the amounts I remind you that the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.010
 you have in the link below 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.540
 and we incorporate it has to absorb it 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.459
 also and totally merge with the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.659
 chocolate let it cool a little 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.620
 first in chilies when 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.620
 totally hot 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.240
 it does not have to be cold at all 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.510
 but it is not too hot 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.879
 and with the spatula today stirring 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.220
 this takes a little while seems here fast 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.870
 I put it to fast camera but the truth 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.260
 is that I was a good time incorporating 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.260
 cream 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.400
 this is going to make me take the consistency 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.220
 of mousse is that you see that it is a recipe 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.840
 very very easy and very fast the mousse of 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.520
 chocolate there are other recipes that are 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.740
 very rich too but they are more 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.540
 complicated to do this is a little thing 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.960
 quick you can prepare in a moment 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.590
 and now puts it well in about balls and 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.590
 I'm going to put in the fridge 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.920
 I put it well until it hardens up 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.709
 that has a consistency and adur and is 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.030
 minimum 2 hours are going to be and now I'm going to 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.069
 quickly make the white chocolate 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.720
 so you can see how the process is 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.459
 exactly the same 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.740
 I add the cream the yerba and I will cut 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.850
 the white chocolate in this case 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.850
 fastest lake 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.790
 and founded the chocolate inside 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.790
 at very low heat or off 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.120
 these go likes in white chocolate 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.990
 it is also very rich I like more the 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.970
 of milk chocolate 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.550
 Well, here I have my creampie 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.260
 chocolate 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.540
 tempera a little here in the bowl the 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.010
 I let cool slightly before 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.330
 add the cream as you see it has been 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.670
 burned a little bit down you're careful 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.670
 a mistake and good gets too much 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.990
 the whipped cream we are incorporating the 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.400
 and to the extent 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.350
 ah 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.759
 and here I have and as you see someone me 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.780
 has stuck his finger before he read the 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.580
 photo and we try them 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.110
 let's see here I have the guys that 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.820
 they're going to get from the sand camp to a 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.740
 and I'm going to give you the mousse 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.810

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.940
 finish 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.850
 we do not advance 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.850
 Well, see how it is 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.310
