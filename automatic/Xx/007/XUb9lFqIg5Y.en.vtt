00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
the 1915 but that's something else so I

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.050 
the 1915 but that's something else so I
was<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:49.619> wondering<00:01:50.100> if<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.490> was<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> real

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
was just wondering if this was a real

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.399 
was just wondering if this was a real
first<00:01:51.390> edition<00:01:52.399> because<00:01:53.399> if<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.409> think

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
first edition because if it is I think

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.639 
first edition because if it is I think
that's<00:01:55.619> pretty<00:01:55.860> good<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.329> think<00:01:57.409> that<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.439> have

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
that's pretty good I think that I have

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.789 
that's pretty good I think that I have
to<00:01:58.680> pay<00:01:58.890> for<00:01:58.920> shaping<00:01:59.520> from<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.939> UK<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
to pay for shaping from the UK and I

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.330 
to pay for shaping from the UK and I
probably<00:02:01.979> would<00:02:02.219> have<00:02:02.250> spent<00:02:02.399> more<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:04.130> an<00:02:05.130> on

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
probably would have spent more on an on

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.429 
probably would have spent more on an on
first<00:02:05.670> edition<00:02:06.060> than<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> first<00:02:06.930> edition

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
first edition than the first edition

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.900 
first edition than the first edition
this<00:02:08.369> one

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
this one

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.360 
this one
so<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:10.940> was<00:02:11.270> just<00:02:11.890> wondering<00:02:12.890> you<00:02:12.920> know<00:02:13.100> if<00:02:13.220> you

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370
