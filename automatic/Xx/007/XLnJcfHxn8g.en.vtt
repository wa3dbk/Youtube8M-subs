00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 and hello to you all 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.400
 minecraft gave him again bored 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.170
 expensive but out of wisdom occurred 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.460
 unforeseen unforeseen occurred 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.060
 circumstances i got sick and forcibly 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.609
 a mouth of a palette I say now and itâ€™s like 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.550
 through the power we can say yes and no, you can 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.460
 say so it is that beforehand 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.539
 I apologize for being a small series 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.430
 Of course I do and wait, but she still 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.500
 plus new year's fuss too 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.840
 enough time 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.710
 now the reason why few rollers is 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.809
 exactly what I burned now like 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.780
 it was a little easier going to write battles 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.850
 maycroft in minecraft need a lot 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.559
 talk and now we both say 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.449
 reluctant to cast just run 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.680
 shoot here is what else has all 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.250
 happy new year 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.680
 all just and more also expect 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.890
 will cake congratulations from us Yaroslav 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.380
 and a cube and a couple more people, probably ours 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.799
 so let's say the team that helped us 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.720
 throughout this year has been known 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.250
 many understood about whom and even if not 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.580
 understood by now very soon now 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.119
 everything goes very well on our channels with 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.759
 on a cube on my jaroslav 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.000
 thank god thank you for that very much 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.650
 nice to stay with us of course and 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 there are disappointment 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:44.490
 but you see, but they are not as common as those 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.060
 the very same powerless dodavili moment 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.290
 which happens with us 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.159
 have happened with you and me 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.619
 this half year 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.909
 if you count Yaroslav then one and a half 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.590
 years somewhere sticks year 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.600
 but again it all depends on how from 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:07.959
 who is here like who is long 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.520
 about our with our our channels what else 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:12.530
 like all congratulated the battlefield 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.690
 I will release more often as you understand 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:20.290
 now because again there is talk 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:23.510
 really should not be here what else what else 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.530
 so it seems to have something to say but it 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.190
 you can say and surprise but if we say not 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:37.580
 know how no really not kidding 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:39.489
 now we cook in calm lamas and what but 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.950
 new adventures await us 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.930
 maynkavt will be in this all will be 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.360
 new passages will be passing cards 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.400
 don't you think we throw cards 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.739
 we just put them off 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.540
 indefinite period on the example to old 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:58.459
 craft already think we abandoned though 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.739
 would not be but about three about 5 4 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.970
 days it's all due to the fact that we are with 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.750
 Yaroslav stumbled 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.320
 and now we are busy with something else but 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:13.010
 I personally play toys in Orsk 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.780
 busy here what else we like on this 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.430
 so all the more nothing to say because 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.760
 I do not know here I am now gone some 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.530
 fashion about our subscribers well and grew 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.690
 more of course but I also have that 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.870
 congratulate happy new year that is not with 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.000
 happy new year 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.320
 strange of course oh well anyway 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.989
 thank you very nice 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.989
 especially those who can not just not 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.660
 like for example battlefield but come 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.519
 purely even watch the video so that 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.269
 say thank you for our hard work we 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.329
 really appreciate 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.100
 we don't like it very very very much 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.680
 how to tell us very nice yes to us 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.769
 very nice because but I understand that 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.300
 you work for a reason that you work for 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.920
 someone on this I think everything 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.080
 because much of the birth mallet 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.970
