 passive skills that is it kinda 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.480
 and there is a choice class is interesting is that in 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.030

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.710
 but the truth is such an action will be worth you 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.390
 a certain amount of game currency 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.850
 the whole game world defiance projects 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.920

 if so you can say the development 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.210
 character first is to 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.830
