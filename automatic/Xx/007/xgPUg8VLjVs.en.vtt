00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.160
 green apple salmon endive salad and 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.470
 fresh goat so I have here a splendid 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.690
 salmon pavé bred in the waters 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.760
 cold and pure fjords of norway 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.570
 I will first check that there are no longer 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.390
 late is it's good it stays skin so 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.400
 we will remove it small in size 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.730
 I run along the skin for the 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.550
 remove 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.989
 I will make cubes we are 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.530
 clearly on a recipe while 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.210
 lightness 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.239
 so we say that this salmon is a 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.379
 fish there but as nenni 120 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.800
 calories for 100 grams 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.150
 so it's really a great fish 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.949
 I'm trying to make good cubes 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.739
 regular game alone and I could but 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.530
 cube on all their faces 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:04.159
 I have a steamed so my last and 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.620
 now I'm putting it down steaming 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.659
 cooked are ultra fast so I have them 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.170
 put I can even now cut the 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.940
 but now you will see how it goes 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.850
 do it all during this time 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.299
 there we will take care of our endives 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.799
 it's very simple I 'm going to cut the base 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.950
 remove the first leaves and 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.250
 now I will recover the others 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.229
 I will finely cut remains I add 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.280
 so in this room hadj also of 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:38.509
 fresh goat that's all stupid 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.549
 I'm just going to crumble it here are the people 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.280
 deposit a little in each sheet 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.990
 endive there may be toddlers 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.549
 Donkey tip a little bigger than a 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.869
 importance so I'm going to look at my 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.909
 Salmon I get my salmon cubes 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.710
 I'm going to have for the base of my 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.740
 salad you even see having cut 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.350
 my ass fear I have a salmon that is 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.960
 perfectly cooked absolutely not dry 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.960
 Steam cooking requires 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.070
 in this little hole it's perfect so 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.110
 now we will bring a little bit 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.470
 of acidity to all this is going to be the apple 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.720
 green 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.220
 I have a nice lime also 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.580
 my apple I wash them and I go out my 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.990

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.360

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.880
 these apple slices to avoid 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.730
 that it does not oxidize one wanted to cut a 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.610
 little bit and we will add 2 here and there 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.320
