matter you barely feel it if you mess up
something<00:01:47.729> versus<00:01:48.540> messing<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.860> speed<00:01:50.189> on

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
something versus messing up the speed on

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.190 
something versus messing up the speed on
the<00:01:50.460> 25<00:01:50.939> foot<00:01:51.119> jump<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.540> knuckling<00:01:51.750> really

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the 25 foot jump and knuckling really

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.310 
the 25 foot jump and knuckling really
hard<00:01:52.409> you're<00:01:53.070> going<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.280> feel<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> difference

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
hard you're going to feel the difference

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.920 
hard you're going to feel the difference
so<00:01:55.490> yeah<00:01:56.490> what<00:01:56.969> else<00:01:57.090> about<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.479> begin<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.780> pack

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
so yeah what else about to begin a pack

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.770 
so yeah what else about to begin a pack
oh<00:01:58.079> ok<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.619> one<00:01:59.340> thing<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.909> speed<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
oh ok so one thing is the speed in the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.709 
oh ok so one thing is the speed in the
begin<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.110> ha<00:02:01.790> watch<00:02:02.790> where<00:02:03.119> everyone<00:02:03.420> else<00:02:03.540> is

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
begin of ha watch where everyone else is

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.709 
begin of ha watch where everyone else is
dropping<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.979> you're<00:02:05.310> hitting<00:02:05.850> small

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
dropping in and if you're hitting small

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.779 
dropping in and if you're hitting small
features<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.740> snowboarders<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.670> are

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
features the snowboarders that are

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.580 
features the snowboarders that are
riding<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.330> park<00:02:09.539> with<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.840> aren't<00:02:10.349> going

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
riding in a park with you aren't going

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.949 
riding in a park with you aren't going
to<00:02:10.709> be<00:02:10.920> as<00:02:10.950> an<00:02:11.459> experienced<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.180> average<00:02:12.780> at

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
to be as an experienced on average at

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.580 
to be as an experienced on average at
least

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
least

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.890 
least
so<00:02:14.069> pay<00:02:14.640> attention<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:15.269> where<00:02:15.480> people<00:02:15.660> are

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
so pay attention to where people are

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.540 
so pay attention to where people are
dropping<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:16.560> make<00:02:17.160> sure<00:02:17.190> they're

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
dropping in and make sure they're

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.070 
dropping in and make sure they're
dropping<00:02:17.879> in<00:02:18.000> at<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.209> right<00:02:18.330> spot<00:02:18.599> don't<00:02:18.870> just

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
dropping in at the right spot don't just

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.470 
dropping in at the right spot don't just
assume<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.650> dropping<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.099> in<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.250> right<00:02:20.370> spot

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
assume to dropping it in the right spot

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.820 
assume to dropping it in the right spot
so<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.540> see<00:02:21.810> earlier<00:02:22.410> nav<00:02:22.739> speed<00:02:23.340> check<00:02:23.610> down

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
so you see earlier nav speed check down

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.650 
so you see earlier nav speed check down
side<00:02:25.830> slipping<00:02:26.190> down<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.670> then<00:02:27.060> he<00:02:27.239> sent<00:02:27.510> it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
side slipping down and then he sent it

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.540 
side slipping down and then he sent it
towards<00:02:28.019> debt<00:02:28.170> rail<00:02:28.379> he's<00:02:29.190> doing<00:02:29.430> this

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
towards debt rail he's doing this

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.369 
towards debt rail he's doing this
because<00:02:29.730> we're<00:02:30.480> we're<00:02:30.660> stuck<00:02:30.870> now<00:02:31.019> is<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
because we're we're stuck now is the

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.960 
because we're we're stuck now is the
wrong<00:02:31.590> spot<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.129> be<00:02:32.220> dropping<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.580> we<00:02:32.730> don't

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
wrong spot to be dropping in we don't

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.970 
wrong spot to be dropping in we don't
need<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.360> drop<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.660> from<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:33.959> high<00:02:34.140> we've<00:02:34.769> got

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
need to drop in from this high we've got

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.320 
need to drop in from this high we've got
way<00:02:35.160> too<00:02:35.220> much<00:02:35.459> speed<00:02:35.700> if<00:02:35.849> we<00:02:35.940> just<00:02:36.090> straight

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
way too much speed if we just straight

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.500 
way too much speed if we just straight
line<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.690> right<00:02:36.870> now<00:02:37.049> so<00:02:38.360> just<00:02:39.360> because

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
line it right now so just because

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.750 
line it right now so just because
everyone<00:02:40.230> else<00:02:40.349> has<00:02:40.470> stopped<00:02:41.069> at<00:02:41.250> some<00:02:41.489> spot

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
everyone else has stopped at some spot

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.610 
everyone else has stopped at some spot
don't<00:02:42.180> assume<00:02:42.360> that's<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.840> red<00:02:43.049> spot<00:02:43.319> for<00:02:43.530> the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
don't assume that's a red spot for the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.770 
don't assume that's a red spot for the
speed<00:02:43.890> make<00:02:44.640> sure<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.970> watch<00:02:45.180> them<00:02:45.450> are<00:02:45.660> they

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
speed make sure you watch them are they

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.210 
speed make sure you watch them are they
getting<00:02:45.989> enough<00:02:46.200> speed<00:02:46.440> are<00:02:46.590> they<00:02:46.680> doing<00:02:46.890> 50

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
getting enough speed are they doing 50

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.449 
getting enough speed are they doing 50
speed<00:02:47.459> checks<00:02:47.730> for<00:02:47.880> no<00:02:48.000> reason<00:02:49.069> okay<00:02:50.069> so

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
speed checks for no reason okay so

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.390 
speed checks for no reason okay so
here's<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.390> good<00:02:51.630> examples<00:02:52.200> see<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.040> guy<00:02:53.160> I

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
here's a good examples see the guy I

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.069 
here's a good examples see the guy I
wanted<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.819> hit<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> jump<00:02:54.390> coming<00:02:54.660> up<00:02:54.780> but<00:02:54.959> the

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
wanted to hit the jump coming up but the

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.190 
wanted to hit the jump coming up but the
guy<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:55.349> front<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.709> me<00:02:55.829> is<00:02:56.220> doing<00:02:57.209> like<00:02:57.360> random

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
guy in front of me is doing like random

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.979 
guy in front of me is doing like random
speed<00:02:59.069> checks<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.760> carving<00:03:00.360> side<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.810> side

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
speed checks and carving side to side

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.110 
speed checks and carving side to side
and<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.739> know<00:03:01.860> he's<00:03:02.190> not<00:03:02.340> going<00:03:02.879> to<00:03:02.940> have<00:03:03.090> enough

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and I know he's not going to have enough

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.690 
and I know he's not going to have enough
speed<00:03:03.510> for<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.810> jump<00:03:04.019> ahead<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.190> start<00:03:05.519> I'm

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
speed for the jump ahead so I start I'm

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.660 
speed for the jump ahead so I start I'm
climbing<00:03:06.329> back<00:03:06.480> up<00:03:06.599> now<00:03:06.810> but<00:03:07.310> yeah<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:08.519> that's

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
climbing back up now but yeah so that's

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.240 
climbing back up now but yeah so that's
a<00:03:08.790> prime<00:03:09.120> example<00:03:09.560> people<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:10.950> beginner

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
a prime example people in the beginner

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.039 
a prime example people in the beginner
park<00:03:11.459> aren't<00:03:11.970> going<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.329> get<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.569> speed<00:03:12.810> right

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
park aren't going to get the speed right

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.199 
park aren't going to get the speed right
most<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.829> time<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.340> don't<00:03:14.640> just<00:03:15.060> assume

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
most of the time so don't just assume

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.330 
most of the time so don't just assume
that<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.079> person<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.590> front<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:17.069> got

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
that the person in front of you is got

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.009 
that the person in front of you is got
the<00:03:17.430> speed<00:03:17.670> right<00:03:17.880> because<00:03:18.329> a<00:03:18.480> lot<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.720> time

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
the speed right because a lot of time

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.400 
the speed right because a lot of time
they<00:03:19.170> don't<00:03:19.380> they<00:03:20.040> just<00:03:20.069> don't<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.569> lot<00:03:22.200> of

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
they don't they just don't so a lot of

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.289 
they don't they just don't so a lot of
snowboarding<00:03:23.069> honestly<00:03:23.489> is<00:03:23.639> getting<00:03:24.180> the

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
snowboarding honestly is getting the

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.559 
snowboarding honestly is getting the
speed<00:03:24.510> right<00:03:24.780> that's<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.680> difficulty<00:03:26.220> for

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
speed right that's the difficulty for

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.809 
speed right that's the difficulty for
nine<00:03:27.569> out<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:27.930> ten<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.650> tricks<00:03:29.489> well<00:03:29.730> at

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
to be able to do the trick but the speed

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.300 
to be able to do the trick but the speed
is<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:34.769> crucial<00:03:35.299> so<00:03:36.299> so<00:03:36.599> crucial<00:03:37.079> like<00:03:37.980> you've

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
is so crucial so so crucial like you've

is so crucial so so crucial like you've
sought<00:03:38.549> at<00:03:38.670> 360<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.299> end<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.510> little<00:03:39.660> early<00:03:39.780> if<00:03:40.170> I

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
sought at 360 to end a little early if I

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.360 
sought at 360 to end a little early if I
got<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.530> speed<00:03:40.739> right<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.069> would<00:03:41.190> have<00:03:41.280> been

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
got the speed right it would have been

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.110 
got the speed right it would have been
fine<00:03:41.639> perfect<00:03:42.510> three<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.260> didn't<00:03:43.859> so

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
fine perfect three but I didn't so

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.050 
fine perfect three but I didn't so
that's<00:03:45.120> what<00:03:45.299> yet<00:03:46.040> okay<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:47.099> notice<00:03:47.639> the<00:03:47.760> flow

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
that's what yet okay so notice the flow

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.650 
that's what yet okay so notice the flow
of<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.569> paki<00:03:49.489> once<00:03:50.489> you<00:03:50.669> stop<00:03:50.970> you're<00:03:51.000> kind<00:03:51.480> of

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
of the paki once you stop you're kind of

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.420 
of the paki once you stop you're kind of
screwed<00:03:52.410> you're<00:03:52.709> just<00:03:52.950> sitting<00:03:53.400> there

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
screwed you're just sitting there

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.339 
screwed you're just sitting there
waiting<00:03:53.730> for<00:03:53.880> people<00:03:54.299> clear<00:03:54.660> out<00:03:54.690> because

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
waiting for people clear out because

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.409 
waiting for people clear out because
people<00:03:55.859> are<00:03:55.950> dropping<00:03:56.250> in<00:03:56.609> look<00:03:57.090> at<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:57.299> guy

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
people are dropping in look at this guy

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.680 
people are dropping in look at this guy
in<00:03:57.720> front<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.019> me<00:03:58.109> he's<00:03:58.470> way<00:03:58.950> too<00:03:58.980> low<00:03:59.669> way<00:04:00.660> too

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
in front of me he's way too low way too

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.750 
in front of me he's way too low way too
low<00:04:00.900> but<00:04:01.590> he's<00:04:01.799> probably<00:04:02.010> going<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.400> drop<00:04:02.549> in

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
low but he's probably going to drop in

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.460 
low but he's probably going to drop in
and<00:04:02.940> hit<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.209> jump<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.750> not<00:04:04.049> get<00:04:04.230> enough

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
and hit that jump and not get enough

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.960 
and hit that jump and not get enough
speed<00:04:04.620> he'll<00:04:04.829> probably<00:04:05.040> knuckle<00:04:05.489> but

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
speed he'll probably knuckle but

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.610 
speed he'll probably knuckle but
everyone<00:04:06.359> else<00:04:06.690> behind<00:04:06.900> him<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.349> going<00:04:07.560> to

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
everyone else behind him is going to

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.470 
everyone else behind him is going to
come<00:04:07.769> up<00:04:07.919> and<00:04:08.069> stop<00:04:08.370> where<00:04:08.579> he<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.120> assume

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
come up and stop where he is and assume

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.839 
come up and stop where he is and assume
that's<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.810> right<00:04:09.989> spot<00:04:10.260> to<00:04:10.290> drop<00:04:10.530> in<00:04:10.849> totally

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
that's the right spot to drop in totally

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:12.949 
that's the right spot to drop in totally
wrong<00:04:12.060> these<00:04:12.329> guys<00:04:12.510> are<00:04:12.630> just<00:04:12.750> going<00:04:12.930> to

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
wrong these guys are just going to

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.379 
wrong these guys are just going to
knuckle<00:04:13.260> unless<00:04:14.069> he's<00:04:14.370> really<00:04:14.940> really<00:04:15.209> good

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
knuckle unless he's really really good

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:20.900 
knuckle unless he's really really good
and<00:04:15.540> pop<00:04:15.840> super<00:04:16.289> hot<00:04:16.440> but<00:04:17.370> probably<00:04:18.060> not<00:04:19.910> okay

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
and pop super hot but probably not okay

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.690 
and pop super hot but probably not okay
so<00:04:20.970> i<00:04:21.209> think<00:04:21.450> i'm<00:04:22.169> gonna<00:04:22.380> drop<00:04:22.740> in<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.099> a<00:04:23.219> second

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
so i think i'm gonna drop in in a second

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.000 
so i think i'm gonna drop in in a second
