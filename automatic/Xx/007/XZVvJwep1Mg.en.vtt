 hello friends today she will say 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:05.100
 procrastination 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.680
 Immediately proceed to install 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.809
 get acquainted with its settings 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.559
 at the construction site of the display 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.860
 here we can enable or 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.860
 turn off the status bar 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:17.890
 ticking 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.510
 enable or disable settings 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.169
 applications resize the screen 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.659
 for example 5 to 5 at the same time 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.079
 on the icons fit more on one 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.119
 the screen 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.269
 further enable and disable scrolling 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.149
 both circular will become privately connected 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.650
 everything will be visible 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.880
 can change if peasants are working 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.490
 tables myself 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.780
 and go here a lot 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.260
 and choose randomly what appear immediately 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.900
 change speed with tanya the more we 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.650
 make meanings 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.090
 the topic is naskovets paging faster but 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.140
 in my mind such thirty 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.520
 optimal 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.250
 so that everything is smooth 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.670
 there are also power points and particulars in 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.810
 this item 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.460
 I have the maximum 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.950
 value of what 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.060
 so turning over the working cranes 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.200
 smoothly 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.700
 then you can turn off the indicators 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.700
 taps and athos hide from this very 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.350
 crane indicators which us 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.110
 shows 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.110
 what desktop are we on 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.830
 panel settings 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.160
 here in these settings panel 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.180
 can change style 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.230

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.230
 dialers sms and other things 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.710
 I already have the so-called downloaded 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.880
 up pair 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.720
 you can put any 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.710
 choose this 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.130
 so live save 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.329
 You can change the number of the panel and 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.810
 stand circular we will not be here apparently this 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.150
 the bottom panel we have help 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.370
 in a restaurant 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.370
 the cycle of MSK from the last basic I you 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.730
 he never stopped nasa 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.680
 as for the transition desktops see 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.549
 different transitions 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.329
 quite interesting elastic we won't do 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.319
 but sometimes for some reason the brakes appear 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.920
 that how to leave not entirely pleasant 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.529
 impressions 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:20.139
 also for convenience you can 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.539
 this is the movement for workers to gather 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:23.779
 heap tables 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.779
 and choose the one that interests us 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:29.620
 we go further 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.180
 here we have a menu setting item 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.099
 applications 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.290
 here we can 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.979
 choose 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.249
 fund this very menu or make 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:42.049
 transparent as it is now with me 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.109
 married titus governing 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.119
 this very picture that stands on 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:48.089
 background 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.419
 ejection again grid size 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.639
 you can select and scroll and here are three 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.079
 congressman floor 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.049
 and 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.959
 here you can get out of the sect and 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.309
 tyson scroll them very much 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:00.639
 so choose 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.639
 random to see everything at once 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:08.389
 Further we see that it is possible 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.789
 publicist lectures 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.819
 we which will appear the same 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.099
 the sweetest of all here are two these are the mills and 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.729
 increase 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.439
 often they change 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.389
 can also block 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.780
 some applications by selecting the list and and 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:25.779
 by ticking 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:30.899
 Further action setting item 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:32.989
 here you can turn on and off the car 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.179
 screen rotation 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.819
 surrender home button value 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.819
 What do you care about it? 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.819
 invasion of six places can also be customized 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.339
 live houses feed on the main screen 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.889
 go to the application menu 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:55.059
 these are the transitions that are 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:56.279
 not by chance 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:59.279
 such a transition 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.149
 how everyone is satisfied peculiar 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:05.149
 interesting transitions 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:12.999
 but there are more difficult for which 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:15.949
 sometimes there are brakes 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.199
 Now we immediately from this menu as we see 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.999
 got into customization 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:21.469
 in the application menu 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.469
 Dmitry will allow such 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.770
 then you can select the appearance list 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.389
 tsukuba treatment 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.759
 then 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.180
 here it appears 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.809
 This mini applications 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:47.329
 as we see chimkent a little 

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:48.949
 slow down does not work very well 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.949
 smoothly 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.919
 such a transition 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.449
 newcomer let's see let's say 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.020
 well, he is rather peculiar 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.379
 interesting transition 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:09.379
 Well, how to work smoothly through time 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.009
 but here in this list you can choose 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.729
 all kinds of transition me 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.729
 meet let's say plus start transition 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:24.029
 slow down the least 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:26.779
 not too easy 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.659
 desktops 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:29.629
 same 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.860
 but also to applications 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.699
 there is 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.779
 few items this recent here we are 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:37.710
 see the whole story where we went for 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.849
 lately what applications can 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.120
 clear this very story 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.400
 and the whole story is empty 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.229
 we are open and right here 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.099
 we see the most important advantage 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.099
 this in general in front of others that he has 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.899
 master the built-in task manager 

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:56.990
 Task Manager 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.750
 so how can we close everything 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.870
 applications pan 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.750
 two clinics will close remain 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.229
 only those 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.509
 and only system 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.119
 and here you can also see what shows how much 

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:09.809
 so much RAM 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:12.719
 free often we have 188 megabytes of 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:15.719
 three hundred 50 three 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.169
 usa lexus closes comfortably very 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.810
 I for example do not use any 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.400
 task manager mid though 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.960
 to close 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.960
 killing processes that are news 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.169
 and so on, let's go through the installation and see 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.189
 point to gain other settings 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:38.909
 here they are basically those system all 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:40.289
 these settings 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:41.760
 can be placed in the system 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.389
 In this general rub improve quality 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.479
 transition desktops from which too 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:50.430
 appear braking change jaw 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.809
 but you need fonts 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:54.210
 add more 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.789
 then you can 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:57.789
 make it appear 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:06:59.300
 icon appeared 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.300
 unread and myself with not read mail 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.399
 missed calls over the icons themselves 

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:07.969
 here in this here in the lower don pair 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.469
 there they will not only in this article 

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:11.119
 notifications appear 

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:13.749
 but also here it was 

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:15.879
 Pave him his opinion 

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:17.759
 good 

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:20.849
 which is very convenient and has 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:22.789
 advantage over all vouchers 

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:23.939
 thanks to 

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:25.529
 the manager 

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:26.669
 processes 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:29.639
 which are happening now on the phone 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:31.090
 and would also like 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.939
 I remind you that there is 

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:35.229
 auto screen rotation 

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:36.740
 Well, I do not know in principle 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.620
 he probably he 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.229
 It will be convenient to those who 

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:41.319
 secured 

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:43.759
 vehicle apparatus 

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:46.050
 in a convenient favor of the composition of the position 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.360
 also use plays navigator 

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.099
 and so on as well as in everyday life 

00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:52.849
 life is probably all the same 

00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:55.429
 as if not absolutely necessary, but this is again only 

00:07:55.429 --> 00:07:57.179
 purely my opinion 

00:07:57.179 --> 00:07:58.809
 thank you all for watching
