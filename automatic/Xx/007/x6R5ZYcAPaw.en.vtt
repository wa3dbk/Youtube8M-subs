00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 I'm writing down the same sketch 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.150
 which you have already seen I have it for an hour 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.360
 did not start recording anything therefore 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.960
 I decided to record something like that from the camera set 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.269
 platforms 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.219
 how it goes 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.180
 now look and see at the same time 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.189
 from here the recording is simultaneously a video to me 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.090
 recorded here kicks which already 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.250
 probably saw 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.630
 oh don't press the buttons don't press 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.029
 buttons until kicks that's why now we 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.300
 we will write such a sketch which 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.120
 came up when I got up from the couch I get up with 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.040
 sofa bed in the morning they have no time 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.160
 dawned just hopefully there will be a bomb 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.270
 it seems to me that ideas are a bomb if the day is not 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.360
 the bomb then I don't take off seems to me a mess 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:55.800
 it seems to me that the idea of â€‹â€‹a bomb will therefore be 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:59.190
 Interesting this crap and turn off maybe 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.289
 There will be interesting records that with 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.399
 hell from the set can be 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.280
 someone will be interested in everything 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.000
 I will probably be filming 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.400
 somewhere after posting this video 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.010
 it may take a couple of days 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.930
 And will drag such a distance 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.790
 Celsus is the idea I took from that channel 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.979
 which takes on the songs 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.140
 probably saw a song about armor where they 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.729
 there I will throw off the link in the description drove 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.740
 so here everything is built that is everything is there 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.729
 I build hemorrhoids on Vovku 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.720
 white balance 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.460
 the quality is not very good but you can clearly see it yes 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.939
 go 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.909
 the point is that I'm here I want something 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.390
 plug in a computer what kind of flash drive 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.289
 falls backs drops some kicks 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.179
 should definitely on the back idea because 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.969
 our kick will be like panda 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.429
 which you saw should be octavia on 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:03.789
 the place is this kicks but must 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.789
 crash kicks because there is no point and 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:16.900
 know quite problematic 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.640
 hurt her so that she is realistic 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.920
 It crashed that it was not willfully 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.930
 so as if although it seems to me 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.140
 The likelihood that a little kick will fall 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:35.290
 octavia will fall 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:37.970
 bolin give them octavia we will remove here and 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.010
 long-mouth banged it should be pulled 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.400
 we must load on the back then saw 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.090
 this kick as if to say so 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.829
 blame us for it kicks 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.940
 kicks misses a shot pipets okay 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:58.250
 just 15 seconds but preparing to hell 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.200
 she flatshery with Bronikon and described 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.419
 video through a web-camera and here 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.109
 recorded sound through computer in 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:10.880
 Generally some kind of nonsense, she went put 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:16.209
 so the camera I do not know I do not know how it is like me 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.209
 I see you went there I'm sitting at the computer 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:25.349
 as if nothing had happened to the ball and no 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:30.900
 passed out amazingly 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.900
 returned no over watercress
