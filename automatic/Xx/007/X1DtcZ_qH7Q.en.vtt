addition tricks addition is one of the
first<00:00:09.269> skills<00:00:09.630> we<00:00:09.870> learned<00:00:10.170> as<00:00:10.469> students<00:00:11.040> back

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
first skills we learned as students back

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.669 
first skills we learned as students back
then<00:00:11.880> they<00:00:12.420> taught<00:00:12.660> us<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.870> memorize<00:00:13.440> our

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
then they taught us to memorize our

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.919 
then they taught us to memorize our
addition<00:00:14.190> facts<00:00:14.460> such<00:00:14.880> as<00:00:15.120> two<00:00:15.420> plus<00:00:15.690> two

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
addition facts such as two plus two

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.320 
addition facts such as two plus two
equals<00:00:16.289> four<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.800> four<00:00:17.670> plus<00:00:17.970> eight<00:00:18.150> equals

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
equals four and four plus eight equals

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.250 
equals four and four plus eight equals
twelve

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
twelve

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.529

today<00:00:19.680> teachers<00:00:20.189> not<00:00:20.430> only<00:00:20.460> want<00:00:21.029> students<00:00:21.420> to

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
today teachers not only want students to

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.269 
today teachers not only want students to
memorize<00:00:21.810> their<00:00:22.289> addition<00:00:22.680> facts<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.250> they

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
memorize their addition facts so they

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.580 
memorize their addition facts so they
can<00:00:23.580> add<00:00:23.820> quickly<00:00:24.359> but<00:00:24.750> they<00:00:24.869> also<00:00:25.050> want<00:00:25.439> them

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
can add quickly but they also want them

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.160 
can add quickly but they also want them
to<00:00:25.619> show<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> thorough<00:00:26.550> understanding<00:00:26.840> of<00:00:27.840> what

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
to show a thorough understanding of what

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.140 
to show a thorough understanding of what
those<00:00:28.320> addition<00:00:28.800> facts<00:00:29.070> mean<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.609> great

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
those addition facts mean a great

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.530 
those addition facts mean a great
example<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.470> addition<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.540> two-digit

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
example of this is addition of two-digit

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.470 
example of this is addition of two-digit
numbers<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:35.130> old<00:00:35.309> way<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.550> adding<00:00:35.910> includes

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
numbers the old way of adding includes

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.869 
numbers the old way of adding includes
carrying<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.200> regrouping<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:38.010> example

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
carrying and regrouping for example

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.010 
carrying and regrouping for example
let's<00:00:39.360> take<00:00:39.600> 33<00:00:40.469> plus<00:00:40.950> 49<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:42.300> learn<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.840> line

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
let's take 33 plus 49 we learn to line

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.500 
let's take 33 plus 49 we learn to line
up<00:00:43.200> our<00:00:43.320> numbers<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:45.180> begin

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
up our numbers like this and we begin

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.720 
up our numbers like this and we begin
with<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> right<00:00:45.989> column<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.950> add<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.399> three

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
with the right column we add the three

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.299 
with the right column we add the three
plus<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.120> nine<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.840> 12<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:49.950> write<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
plus the nine to get 12 so we write the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.970 
plus the nine to get 12 so we write the
two<00:00:50.520> down<00:00:50.730> here<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.360> carry<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.780> 1<00:00:51.989> now<00:00:52.920> we

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
two down here and carry the 1 now we

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.330 
two down here and carry the 1 now we
total<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> left<00:00:53.879> column<00:00:54.090> 3<00:00:55.050> plus<00:00:55.320> 4<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.620> 7<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
total the left column 3 plus 4 is 7 and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.990 
total the left column 3 plus 4 is 7 and
then<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:56.789> add<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> carried<00:00:57.840> 1<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.500> 8<00:00:58.739> so

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
then we add on the carried 1 to get 8 so

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.740 
then we add on the carried 1 to get 8 so
33<00:01:00.000> plus<00:01:00.329> 49<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.199> 82<00:01:01.770> now<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.120> correct<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
33 plus 49 is 82 now this is correct and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.299 
33 plus 49 is 82 now this is correct and
it's<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.080> fairly<00:01:04.320> efficient<00:01:04.830> way<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.010> add

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it's a fairly efficient way to add

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.370 
it's a fairly efficient way to add
two-digit<00:01:05.850> numbers<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.780> there<00:01:06.990> are<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> few

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
two-digit numbers but there are a few

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.100 
two-digit numbers but there are a few
difficulties<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.610> method<00:01:09.000> first<00:01:09.840> it

difficulties with this method first it
is<00:01:10.290> hard<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.650> many<00:01:10.979> people<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.490> add<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.090> this

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
is hard for many people to add like this

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.120 
is hard for many people to add like this
in<00:01:12.479> their<00:01:12.630> head<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> remember<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
in their head you have to remember the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.100 
in their head you have to remember the
ones<00:01:14.369> value<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.150> wrote<00:01:15.360> down<00:01:15.570> first<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
ones value that you wrote down first and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.719 
ones value that you wrote down first and
then<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.860> remember<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.369> number<00:01:17.610> you

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
then you have to remember the number you

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.609 
then you have to remember the number you
carried<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.080> put<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> all

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
carried then you have to put it all

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.649 
carried then you have to put it all
together<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.400> your<00:01:20.520> answer<00:01:20.880> another

difficulty<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.950> method<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.549> not

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
difficulty is that this method is not

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.830 
like this to add 33 plus 49 we grouped
together<00:02:01.350> all<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.040> tens<00:02:02.310> first<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.479> gives

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
together all the tens first that gives

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.029 
together all the tens first that gives
us<00:02:04.079> 7<00:02:04.710> tens<00:02:05.100> or<00:02:05.490> 70<00:02:06.270> now<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:06.899> can<00:02:07.290> put<00:02:07.500> all<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
us 7 tens or 70 now we can put all the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.850 
us 7 tens or 70 now we can put all the
ones<00:02:08.340> together<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.270> make<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> total<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.080> 12<00:02:10.470> ones

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
ones together to make a total of 12 ones

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.470 
ones together to make a total of 12 ones
we<00:02:11.640> know<00:02:11.849> that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
we know that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.710 
we know that
once<00:02:12.810> make<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> 10<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.670> let's<00:02:14.700> replace<00:02:15.360> that

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
once make a 10 so let's replace that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.680 
once make a 10 so let's replace that
which<00:02:16.470> gives<00:02:16.709> us<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.160> grand<00:02:17.550> total<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.180> eight

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
which gives us a grand total of eight

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.479 
which gives us a grand total of eight
tens<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.560> two<00:02:20.220> ones<00:02:20.959> 82<00:02:21.959> now<00:02:22.890> if<00:02:23.040> we<00:02:23.190> try<00:02:23.400> this

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
tens and two ones 82 now if we try this

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.910 
tens and two ones 82 now if we try this
method<00:02:23.879> without<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.810> unit<00:02:25.140> cubes<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.739> will

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
method without the unit cubes you will

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.430 
method without the unit cubes you will
see<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.519> concept<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.239> very<00:02:27.360> similar<00:02:27.930> to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
see that the concept is very similar to

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.430 
see that the concept is very similar to
add<00:02:28.590> 33<00:02:29.069> plus<00:02:29.640> 49<00:02:30.209> let's<00:02:30.660> start<00:02:30.959> with<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.200> tens

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
add 33 plus 49 let's start with the tens

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.199 
add 33 plus 49 let's start with the tens
column<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:32.099> time<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.880> 30<00:02:33.269> plus<00:02:33.930> 40<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.700> 70<00:02:35.700> now

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
column this time so 30 plus 40 is 70 now

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.449 
column this time so 30 plus 40 is 70 now
add<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.660> ones<00:02:36.870> 3<00:02:37.800> plus<00:02:38.310> 9<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:39.030> 12<00:02:39.690> from<00:02:40.500> here<00:02:40.980> we

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
add the ones 3 plus 9 is 12 from here we

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.800 
add the ones 3 plus 9 is 12 from here we
know<00:02:41.700> 70<00:02:42.480> plus<00:02:42.930> 12<00:02:43.319> is<00:02:43.590> 82<00:02:44.400> let's<00:02:45.360> try<00:02:45.630> another

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
know 70 plus 12 is 82 let's try another

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.589 
know 70 plus 12 is 82 let's try another
one<00:02:45.959> with<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.980> one<00:02:47.280> try<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.180> your<00:02:48.360> head

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
one with this one try it in your head

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.789 
one with this one try it in your head
first<00:02:48.989> then<00:02:49.709> we<00:02:49.950> will<00:02:50.099> write<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.430> out<00:02:50.610> try<00:02:51.799> 27

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
first then we will write it out try 27

00:02:52.799 --> 00:03:00.110 
first then we will write it out try 27
plus<00:02:53.450> 46<00:02:58.370> okay<00:02:59.370> let's<00:02:59.640> try<00:02:59.849> it

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
plus 46 okay let's try it

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.280 
plus 46 okay let's try it
add<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.900> tens<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.560> get<00:03:01.739> 20<00:03:02.250> plus<00:03:02.459> 40<00:03:02.880> equals<00:03:03.420> 60

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
add the tens to get 20 plus 40 equals 60

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.729 
add the tens to get 20 plus 40 equals 60
now<00:03:04.950> add<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.430> ones<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:06.030> get<00:03:06.120> 7<00:03:06.630> plus<00:03:06.900> 6<00:03:07.140> equals

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
now add the ones to get 7 plus 6 equals

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.120 
now add the ones to get 7 plus 6 equals
13<00:03:08.340> when<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.329> put<00:03:09.540> together<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.079> 60<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.739> the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
13 when you put together the 60 and the

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.229 
13 when you put together the 60 and the
13<00:03:11.640> we<00:03:12.180> get<00:03:12.450> 73<00:03:13.430> remember<00:03:14.430> with<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.819> old<00:03:14.970> way

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
13 we get 73 remember with the old way

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.349 
13 we get 73 remember with the old way
we<00:03:15.810> would<00:03:16.019> add<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.500> ones<00:03:16.769> column<00:03:17.160> first<00:03:17.639> carry

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
we would add the ones column first carry

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.660 
we would add the ones column first carry
a<00:03:18.480> 1<00:03:18.690> which<00:03:19.049> is<00:03:19.230> really<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.500> 10<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.010> then<00:03:20.459> add

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
a 1 which is really a 10 and then add

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.400 
a 1 which is really a 10 and then add
the<00:03:20.819> tens<00:03:21.060> column<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.600> get<00:03:21.690> your<00:03:21.900> answer<00:03:22.170> if

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
the tens column to get your answer if

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.379 
the tens column to get your answer if
you<00:03:22.889> try<00:03:23.160> each<00:03:23.400> way<00:03:23.639> in<00:03:23.790> your<00:03:23.940> head<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.359> think

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
you try each way in your head I think

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.930 
you try each way in your head I think
you<00:03:24.810> will<00:03:24.959> find<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.739> easier<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.459> group<00:03:26.700> the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
you will find it is easier to group the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.599 
you will find it is easier to group the
tens<00:03:27.209> first<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:28.410> is<00:03:28.470> how<00:03:28.769> kids<00:03:29.040> learn<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.459> add

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
tens first this is how kids learn to add

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.690 
tens first this is how kids learn to add
early<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.359> now<00:03:31.040> eventually<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:32.160> school<00:03:32.519> they

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
early on now eventually in school they

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.340 
early on now eventually in school they
will<00:03:32.880> learn<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.480> carry<00:03:33.780> with<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.079> better

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
will learn to carry with a better

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.170 
will learn to carry with a better
understanding<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:35.370> what<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:35.730> actually

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
understanding of what that actually

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.800 
understanding of what that actually
means<00:03:37.280> another<00:03:38.280> mental<00:03:38.730> math<00:03:39.030> trick<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.630> can

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
means another mental math trick you can

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.170 
means another mental math trick you can
teach<00:03:40.079> your<00:03:40.290> student<00:03:40.799> is<00:03:40.920> group<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.910> tens

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
teach your student is group the tens

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.990 
teach your student is group the tens
with<00:03:43.109> this<00:03:43.319> method<00:03:43.799> students<00:03:44.459> can<00:03:44.670> learn<00:03:44.819> to

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
with this method students can learn to

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.090 
with this method students can learn to
add<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.420> long<00:03:45.780> string<00:03:46.380> of<00:03:46.500> numbers<00:03:46.560> more

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
add a long string of numbers more

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.370 
add a long string of numbers more

quickly and accurately simply show the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.259 
quickly and accurately simply show the
student<00:03:49.769> how<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.010> look<00:03:50.400> for<00:03:50.639> numbers<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:50.970> add

student how to look for numbers that add
up<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.600> 10<00:03:51.840> let's<00:03:52.410> look<00:03:52.620> at<00:03:52.769> an<00:03:52.920> example<00:03:53.310> let's

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
up to 10 let's look at an example let's

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.920 
up to 10 let's look at an example let's
say<00:03:54.480> we<00:03:54.660> have<00:03:54.840> 3<00:03:55.230> plus<00:03:55.650> 4<00:03:55.950> plus<00:03:56.340> 2<00:03:56.700> plus<00:03:57.000> 7<00:03:57.480> plus

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
say we have 3 plus 4 plus 2 plus 7 plus

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.729 
say we have 3 plus 4 plus 2 plus 7 plus
8<00:03:58.370> rather<00:03:59.370> than<00:03:59.639> adding<00:03:59.880> left<00:04:00.389> to<00:04:00.810> right<00:04:01.049> one

number<00:04:01.950> at<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.250> time<00:04:02.370> teach<00:04:03.269> your<00:04:03.480> student<00:04:03.840> to

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
number at a time teach your student to

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.530 
number at a time teach your student to
look<00:04:04.260> for<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.560> numbers<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.099> add<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.549> 10<00:04:05.790> like

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
look for the numbers that add to 10 like

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.530 
look for the numbers that add to 10 like
3<00:04:07.049> plus<00:04:07.260> 7<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.769> 2<00:04:08.310> plus<00:04:08.549> e<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:08.940> is<00:04:09.269> much<00:04:09.510> easier

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
3 plus 7 and 2 plus e it is much easier

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.009 
3 plus 7 and 2 plus e it is much easier
to<00:04:10.049> add<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.530> 10<00:04:10.799> plus<00:04:11.220> 10<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.669> get<00:04:11.790> 20<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.480> then

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
to add the 10 plus 10 to get 20 and then

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.159 
to add the 10 plus 10 to get 20 and then
add<00:04:13.440> on<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.859> last<00:04:14.069> 4<00:04:14.489> to<00:04:14.880> get<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.180> total<00:04:15.419> of<00:04:15.630> 24

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
add on the last 4 to get a total of 24
