that<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:14.150> can<00:02:14.330> use<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.480> connect<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:15.020> dog<00:02:15.230> so

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
that you can use to connect to a dog so

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.820 
that you can use to connect to a dog so
let's<00:02:16.370> see<00:02:16.640> how<00:02:16.940> these<00:02:17.209> pins<00:02:17.930> can<00:02:18.260> connect<00:02:18.590> to

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
let's see how these pins can connect to

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.400 
let's see how these pins can connect to
the<00:02:18.980> tablet<00:02:19.340> as<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.540> can<00:02:20.720> see<00:02:20.900> we<00:02:21.050> have<00:02:21.080> right

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
the tablet as you can see we have right

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.770 
the tablet as you can see we have right
here<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.739> corresponding<00:02:22.459> metallic<00:02:23.330> pins

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
here the corresponding metallic pins

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.640 
here the corresponding metallic pins
that<00:02:24.470> connect<00:02:24.800> this<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:27.170> should<00:02:27.440> go

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
that connect this and it should go

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.920 
that connect this and it should go
something<00:02:28.130> like<00:02:28.160> this<00:02:30.760> or<00:02:31.760> maybe<00:02:32.000> they're<00:02:32.750> on

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.560 
port so this is the full USB port right
here<00:04:24.530> this<00:04:25.130> is<00:04:25.250> one<00:04:25.430> of<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.669> speakers<00:04:26.060> right

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
here this is one of the speakers right

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.520 
here this is one of the speakers right
here

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
here

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.420 
here
and<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:28.700> other<00:04:28.850> one<00:04:29.120> here<00:04:29.510> next<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.430> audio

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
and the other one here next to the audio

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.550 
and the other one here next to the audio
jack<00:04:31.730> so<00:04:31.970> speaker<00:04:32.330> here<00:04:32.630> audio<00:04:32.930> jack<00:04:33.170> volume

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
jack so speaker here audio jack volume

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.700 
jack so speaker here audio jack volume
buttons<00:04:34.270> let's<00:04:35.270> see<00:04:35.420> what<00:04:35.600> else<00:04:35.630> from<00:04:36.560> what<00:04:36.680> I

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
buttons let's see what else from what I

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.909 
buttons let's see what else from what I
know<00:04:36.980> there<00:04:37.639> should<00:04:37.880> be<00:04:37.910> a<00:04:38.139> HD<00:04:39.139> port<00:04:39.440> around

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
know there should be a HD port around

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.670 
know there should be a HD port around
here<00:04:40.220> so<00:04:41.090> since<00:04:41.450> this<00:04:41.540> is<00:04:41.720> USB<00:04:41.990> port<00:04:42.320> i<00:04:42.440> guess

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
here so since this is USB port i guess

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.460 
here so since this is USB port i guess
that<00:04:42.889> this<00:04:43.070> may<00:04:43.310> be<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.669> HD<00:04:44.150> port<00:04:44.419> and<00:04:44.660> let's

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
that this may be the HD port and let's

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.110 
that this may be the HD port and let's
see<00:04:45.710> what's<00:04:45.919> under<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.310> kickstand<00:04:46.790> scenes

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
see what's under the kickstand scenes

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.230 
see what's under the kickstand scenes
from<00:04:47.270> what<00:04:47.480> I<00:04:47.510> understood<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:49.160> micro<00:04:49.760> SD<00:04:50.000> card

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
from what I understood the micro SD card

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.540 
from what I understood the micro SD card
slot<00:04:50.300> should<00:04:50.690> be<00:04:50.780> hidden<00:04:51.050> here<00:04:51.350> so<00:04:52.130> as<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.400> can

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
slot should be hidden here so as you can

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.300 
slot should be hidden here so as you can
see<00:04:52.820> I<00:04:53.060> hope<00:04:53.510> you<00:04:53.630> can<00:04:53.810> see<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.770> version<00:04:55.010> of

know Windows RT from our other reviews
and<00:05:53.330> we'll<00:05:53.750> connect<00:05:54.020> the<00:05:54.110> tablet<00:05:54.440> the<00:05:54.650> net

seems to be moving quite well I wasn't

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.170 
seems to be moving quite well I wasn't
happy<00:06:03.650> with<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:04.070> way<00:06:04.220> some<00:06:04.460> of<00:06:04.580> the<00:06:04.700> apps<00:06:04.850> were

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
happy with the way some of the apps were

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.510 
happy with the way some of the apps were

tablet<00:06:08.060> i<00:06:08.150> tested<00:06:08.539> they<00:06:08.840> took<00:06:09.050> a<00:06:09.200> long<00:06:09.410> while

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590

to<00:06:09.650> open<00:06:09.860> up<00:06:10.190> and<00:06:10.550> i<00:06:11.419> guess<00:06:11.630> that<00:06:12.110> this<00:06:12.289> is

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
to open up and i guess that this is

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.200 
to open up and i guess that this is
happening<00:06:12.710> yet<00:06:13.100> again<00:06:13.370> but<00:06:13.700> we'll<00:06:13.850> see<00:06:14.030> in<00:06:14.120> the
