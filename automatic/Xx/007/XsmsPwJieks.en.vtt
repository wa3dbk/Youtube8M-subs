why<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> person<00:00:42.210> would<00:00:42.390> use<00:00:42.629> capture<00:00:42.960> card<00:00:43.170> at

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
why a person would use capture card at

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.889 
why a person would use capture card at
all<00:00:43.850> what<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.570> going<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
all what it's going to do is going to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.549 
all what it's going to do is going to
take<00:00:46.170> away<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:47.690> added<00:00:48.690> stress<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.079> streaming

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
take away the added stress of streaming

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.610 
take away the added stress of streaming
and<00:00:49.920> uploading<00:00:50.760> video<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.480> capturing<00:00:52.379> that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
and uploading video and capturing that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.779 
and uploading video and capturing that
video<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.699> cpu<00:00:54.239> would<00:00:54.420> normally<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:55.789> you

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
video that a cpu would normally be you

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.889 
video that a cpu would normally be you
know<00:00:56.879> whose<00:00:57.090> job<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.510> would<00:00:57.600> normally<00:00:57.690> be

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
know whose job that would normally be

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.680 
know whose job that would normally be
and<00:00:58.340> this<00:00:59.340> guy<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.640> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.300> instead

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
and this guy is going to do that instead

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.200 
and this guy is going to do that instead
so<00:01:01.109> when<00:01:01.920> i<00:01:01.949> stream<00:01:02.340> i'll<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.789> able<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.180> it

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
so when i stream i'll be able to do it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.170 
so when i stream i'll be able to do it
at<00:01:03.420> higher<00:01:03.719> quality<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.409> also<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.640> less<00:01:05.909> leg

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
at higher quality and also have less leg

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.630 
at higher quality and also have less leg
and<00:01:06.510> more<00:01:06.780> frames<00:01:06.990> per<00:01:07.170> second<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.770> all<00:01:08.280> around

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and more frames per second so all around

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.340 
and more frames per second so all around
it's<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.970> great<00:01:09.210> thing<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.630> even<00:01:10.229> if

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350

Chris hi Chris if you're watching and

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.260 
Chris hi Chris if you're watching and
this<00:02:39.040> was<00:02:39.250> me<00:02:39.400> okay<00:02:39.610> but<00:02:39.850> let<00:02:39.970> me<00:02:40.000> tell<00:02:40.180> you

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
this was me okay but let me tell you

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.250 
this was me okay but let me tell you
something<00:02:40.570> about<00:02:40.690> how<00:02:41.410> I<00:02:41.440> play<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:43.120> pinky<00:02:43.600> is

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
something about how I play this pinky is

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.830 
something about how I play this pinky is
just<00:02:44.890> about<00:02:45.070> as<00:02:45.130> useless<00:02:45.520> as<00:02:45.670> digits<00:02:46.450> can<00:02:46.660> be

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
just about as useless as digits can be

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.300 
just about as useless as digits can be
so<00:02:47.590> when<00:02:47.770> I<00:02:47.800> play<00:02:48.600> he's<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:49.840> weak<00:02:50.140> it's<00:02:50.440> like<00:02:50.620> it

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
so when I play he's so weak it's like it

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.940 
so when I play he's so weak it's like it
takes<00:02:51.730> extra<00:02:52.180> mental<00:02:52.959> strength<00:02:53.500> for<00:02:53.739> me<00:02:53.830> to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
takes extra mental strength for me to

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.400 
takes extra mental strength for me to
remember<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.670> push<00:02:54.850> this<00:02:55.120> pinky<00:02:55.390> down<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:56.050> i

bit fancier with this eventually gets

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.490 
bit fancier with this eventually gets
installed<00:04:45.390> into<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:45.960> computer<00:04:50.690> so<00:04:51.690> first<00:04:52.350> of

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
installed into the computer so first of

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.300 
installed into the computer so first of
all<00:04:52.620> we<00:04:53.420> have<00:04:54.420> this<00:04:54.600> card<00:04:54.870> so<00:04:55.200> he's<00:04:55.440> pretty

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
all we have this card so he's pretty

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.080 
all we have this card so he's pretty
little<00:04:56.670> baby<00:04:56.810> little<00:04:58.190> and<00:04:59.190> he's<00:04:59.760> going<00:04:59.880> to<00:04:59.940> go

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
little baby little and he's going to go

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.290 
little baby little and he's going to go
right<00:05:00.540> into<00:05:01.170> the<00:05:01.320> computer<00:05:02.000> just<00:05:03.000> like<00:05:03.090> this

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
right into the computer just like this

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.030 
right into the computer just like this
so<00:05:03.900> this<00:05:04.020> is<00:05:04.050> how<00:05:04.230> like<00:05:04.410> my<00:05:04.440> computer<00:05:04.710> is<00:05:04.860> set

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
so this is how like my computer is set

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.370 
so this is how like my computer is set
up<00:05:05.160> so<00:05:05.190> my<00:05:06.060> graphics<00:05:06.570> cards<00:05:06.810> right<00:05:06.960> here<00:05:07.140> and

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
up so my graphics cards right here and

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.230 
up so my graphics cards right here and
he's<00:05:07.470> going<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.710> go<00:05:07.800> right<00:05:07.830> above<00:05:08.280> he's<00:05:09.060> going

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
he's going to go right above he's going

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.420 
he's going to go right above he's going
to<00:05:09.300> come<00:05:09.570> out<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.810> back<00:05:10.020> so<00:05:10.620> i'm<00:05:10.980> not<00:05:11.100> sure<00:05:11.310> if

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
to come out the back so i'm not sure if

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.550 
to come out the back so i'm not sure if
you'll<00:05:11.580> be<00:05:11.700> able<00:05:11.760> to<00:05:11.850> read<00:05:12.210> those<00:05:12.450> but<00:05:12.960> that

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
you'll be able to read those but that

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.750 
you'll be able to read those but that
see<00:05:13.770> hdmi<00:05:14.250> out<00:05:14.460> in<00:05:15.110> audio<00:05:16.110> out<00:05:16.350> in<00:05:16.760> so
