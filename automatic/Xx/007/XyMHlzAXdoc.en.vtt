00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.400
 hello what such spirit find very 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.860
 well today and well as you will see 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.090
 today I bring you a new tutorial this 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.710
 tutorial is inspired by the king's wool 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.720
 He decides to do this tutorial because they are already 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.730
 several friends who tell me and I 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.460
 they ask if I eat their makeup 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.650
 the king that they want to make them something 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.570
 as well as they make up the king so 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.330
 I decided to do it is a total so that 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.830
 you can do it too 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.040
 this tutorial is like a very 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.680
 dramatic 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.990
 the eyes are half dark, that is, not 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.970
 so much but the same if they are and the lips 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.550
 also the lips in this makeup 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.620
 They are the focal point of everything is 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.000
 our face is not makeup this 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.989
 makeup is also something that has 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.880
 a lot of trend in the season 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.530
 Autumn / Winter 2013 is a make-up that 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.620
 it is also used last season 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.890
 but it's still very strong this this 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.550
 year because of the strong colors that also 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:09.200
 they saw themselves using clothes the coffees 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.540
 the grays the dark colors and then 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.400
 this tutorial is super father is very 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.009
 elegant to the truth personally 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.610
 love the style of lan to the king always 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.120
 I liked a lot 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.250
 and well, really, as I say, he clarified 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.260
 an inspiration I really do not want 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.260
 look like the king's I just like it 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.960
 her makeup and I adapted it to my shape 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.270
 from the face to my features so 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.330
 obviously it will not look the same as 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.880
 how it looks to her and if they want 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.399
 learn this tutorial keep looking 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.649
 to begin we are going to brush our 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.990
 eyebrows and we will give you a little color 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.850
 filling the gaps with the help of a 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.780
 angular brush and a shade of tone 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.579
 correct this is extremely important 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.000
 because it gives more definition to these 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.000
 same 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.360
 If your children tend to be very messy 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.940
 during the day they help with a mask 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.160
 transparent for eyebrows so you 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.040
 you will ensure that these will remain in 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.430
 your place before starting with the shadow 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.370
 use a base on your entire eyelid I think 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.140
 that I'm using once when using it 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.000
 so that the shadow remains in the 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.000
 same place for a lot more time 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.540
 with a flat brush take a brown 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.430
 clear and place it on the mobile eyelid myself 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.580
 here I am using one of the object 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.010
 number 4 of vissum 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.980
 taking the dark brown of it 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.930
 pallet and removing the excess places it 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.290
 the eye socket with a brush for 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.290
 blur 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.859
 to 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.930
 to add a little more dimension 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.700
 we will take a brush in the form of a pencil and 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.910
 we will place some of the dark shadow 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.070
 in the eye socket causing this 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.550
 sink perfectly to the rest of 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.550
 our makeup 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.220
 let's not forget to apply a bit of base 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.770
 for shadows on the bottom of 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.110
 our eye and later with the 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.300
 same brush in the form of a pencil 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.640
 we will place some dark shadow 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.500
 thus achieving a smoked effect for not 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.660
 make the shadow dark or so that 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.490
 our look completely we will take 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.580
 a bare shadow since I'm 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:51.100
 using foxy of the pau lakers and 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.100
 placing it in key areas to highlight 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.930
 something very characteristic of this 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.520
 makeup is the thick feline outline 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.580
 help yourself with the black eyeliner that better 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.880
 I'll either in the form of pen or pencil 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.460
 gel 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.620
 then taking a flat brush to 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.380
 delineate we put a little shadow 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.980
 black on the lower part of 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.980
 our eye 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.890
 enchinado not forget eyelashes and 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.690
 place them from two to three layers of 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.960
 mask to be able to increase the volume 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.530
 in this 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.530
 no no 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.990
 taking a bronzer we will define 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.310
 our factions and we will add a little 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.310
 of color to our face 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.070
 for the lips this time use the 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.260
 color of the season that is something like 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.020
 like a burnt red 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.190
 since I'm using number 124 of 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.700
 wine 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.680
 if you left a bit, you do not take a 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.950
 flat brush and some concealer 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.140
 eliminate any excess later 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.140
 if this area with a little dust 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.060
 If you want to make your makeup or a 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.790
 little more dramatic you can opt for 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.570
 add false eyelashes and wait for 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.570
 it's dry 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.480
 once they are completely dry 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.570
 someone else's layer of personal mask 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.360
 false with yours and we are ready 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.720
 a perfect makeup for the season 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.520
 Easy and fast to do 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.160
 and well I hope you liked it 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.020
 much today's tutorial what do I 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.760
 makes this tutorial very father is that 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.770
 it really looks very complicated in that the 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.800
 people are not it this looks very complicated 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.110
 by the fact that it has very colors 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.870
 dark the truth many of us do not 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.360
 we dare to use dark colors 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.580
 but really if we do not try it on 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.500
 let's find out how we are going to be like 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.970
 they will see us so I invite them to 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.770
 use a little darker colors 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.190
 on the lips for example like this red 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.860
 burned that I'm using right now 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.150
 in truth nothing loses with trying to 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.520
 see if they like it or not at the best and 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:37.330
 they end up will end badly I do not know the 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.070
 dark colors on the lips and then that 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.710
 It was all for today I hope you liked it 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:44.740
 much the tutorial today have learned 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.980

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.320

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.030
 halloween tutorials is really 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.610
 something very complicated due to the fact that 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.990
 these tutorials to last much longer 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.540
 time to record it is the time to 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.000
 edit them so maybe I can not 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.670
 upload enough of them but then with 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.280

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.540
