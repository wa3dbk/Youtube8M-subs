00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.600
 twelve months the accumulated deficit of the preferential scheme knockier I approach 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.019
 also on the menu 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.019
 so I think he's part of me 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.869
 I do not know anymore in the world 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:28.749
 there I am 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.109
 behind the house 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.789
 nadges fashion and fabrics 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.180
 we know this building 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.660
 it's hard to say in the world 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.660
 he does not make him say that we were going to seduce 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.150
 if the logic of the ranking 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
 the swiss team 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.080
 the study 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.280
 I think I'll take a break I'll play rugby again at night 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.060
 it's a big IPO without waiting for anything 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.350
 watching the video video filing date 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.990
 it will end 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.550
 I manage a video 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.550
 the operation of guantanamo 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.930
 I teach them the video is not for them 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.530
 and then I consumed 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.790
 for men 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.810
 for a small fire show actually I decided to multiply the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.970
 stoppage of play that this 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.970
 cut the leaves I simply want to put two countries 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.710
 it will take more in hands 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.700
 vox pop revenge for me 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.700
 and then and most importantly the fourth investor and why 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.440
 I have not decided yet 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.100
 here is I got rid of deciphering this tree that I am well 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.769
 felt now 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:14.869
 here we are 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.869
 I'm recovering the life of the workers 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:19.929
 so less funny 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.049

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.049

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.039
 that our elected 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:37.039
 in the turn I put words 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:45.019
 the arpu legendary band 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.019
 coal climb which is the sign that I will go to vote 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:53.719
 I will try to grab a package 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.930
 unfortunately quote the client the gp of abou dhabi 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.619
 not very fresh on the markets more logical 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.619
 I took twenty races already 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.019

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.229

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:17.059
 on this link 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:20.069
 everything next to a fund that the competitiveness of peace just at 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.759
 Middle East 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:24.139
 for philippe I had fun 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.139
 it's a lot of little shows 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.109
 I take it like that 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:39.029
 and me that I am strong it will come to an end 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.859
 you do not see much in the dark I apologize 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:58.529
 can not do otherwise 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:01.529
 only the ancient port 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:07.469
 all dressed in white what you do not want second part on the blue gold 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:12.039
 it's still weird that I love them 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:18.649
 the shop 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.009
 you see what is most appetizing 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.199
 to indicate their presence 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.759
 he could actually have on the round here 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.659
 later on introducing the country 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.779
 this man who is not indispensable 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.580
 a small piece of this biennial summit 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.699
 this liner 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:19.019
 for you the video of the pillar and then I'm too much my thing I talked 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.369
 so I'm playing video back to a time when you do not see it 

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:26.059
 finishing levels 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:29.909

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.659
 we will kill her 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.490
 stop the machismo 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.490

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.849
 produce a kilo 

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:37.279
 I do not have these two countries 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:40.279
 they do not see the tile 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:45.719
 a foot closes the door 

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:57.289
 alas he is not there yet 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:00.289
 douglas buck and he can not go out anymore 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:03.419
 but do not explode easily 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:04.860
 me if I had killed 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.259
 so far 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:11.360
 you see there is no chaos in egypt said at the ats 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.589
 the idea that copper signals just delicate enough 

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:19.259
 I do not want to let go of Germany's pressure 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:21.749
 for olivier guiguet of october the terminals 

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:23.899
