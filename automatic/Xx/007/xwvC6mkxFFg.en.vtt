00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.699
 very good everything has to be seen in addition 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.410
 with all of us and well in this 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.840
 I come to speak 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.240
 of the new system that is going to be put 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.280
 play the Arab games and that is 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.190
 apart from the new map that will come out with 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.490
 the version of the lisandra patch the 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.930
 remember trolls and they joke apart 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.850
 we are going to teach a little something that is 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.670
 will do to have their own tail that 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.490
 we can see that we have classic tail 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.440
 normal dominion and Aaron we can see 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.780
 now we are going to select abyss of the 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.359
 laments that is what is called the new 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.379
 map and we can see it and normal everything 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.879
 random 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.550
 there is also a little curiosity and it is 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.620
 that in our profile we will get a 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.749
 small as a small die which we 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.719
 says we have we can throw once 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:48.999
 we have one of two to throw in aram 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.769
 what does that mean we're going to see now 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:52.870
 a little later and is that if we do not 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.219
 like our character nothing because 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.170
 there were certain people who did not 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.550
 I liked they left the games 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.469
 as now it penalizes abandoning a 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.620
 Aram departure now has 30 minutes 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.509
 of tail penalty and until you do not 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.960
 change in principle has that 30 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.210
 tail minutes 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.920
 they give you a choice that while 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.290
 the more you play, you have the option of 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.000
 roll the die and change the character what 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.010
 let's see now in an example is going to 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.780
 see much more clearly we put them in queue 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.340
 from aram this is already looking for a 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.900
 departure will make a game 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.300
 personalized on the new map that is the 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.620
 abyss we had seen once the 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.890
 find enter we go by god left 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.530
 a damn dry 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.500
 we wait again a little bit a little 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.060
 and we take we go let's go as I said 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.460
 now games are penalized 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.830
 from alhama so once you enter 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.840
 departure and they should not abandon or have 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.030
 a penalty on the server 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.160
 test served the pp right now is 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.580
 30 minutes so I hope you lower 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.440
 this because it really is almost like the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.119
 sanction of run gets and should be of 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.190
 5 minutes like normal games 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.250
 but we'll see how they treat this 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.860
 subject we have more luck and I accept all the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.630
 world to see that we are inside 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.550
 we will see that a champion has chosen us 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.890
 totally random as the system 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.850
 now we also see that the music of 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.310
 background is different 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.019
 we have used but here the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.000
 Novelty we no longer have the button to fix 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.340
 but we have as a die and we have 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.690
 as an opportunity that did not come out in 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.570
 the profile is given s 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.940
 not for god simply if we give to 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.740
 that little button we have there what 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.740
 does that character change us that 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.810
 we can have it up to date we have a 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.610
 opportunity for change so if the 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.560
 we spent on the next game of aram 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.610
 that we play we can not have the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.170
 Advantage of changing 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.690
 here we have we are going to try to do it 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.580
 now here we use the die and we see that 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.220
 has changed us from leasing to darius and 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.140
 we have no more more points more 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.580
 dice so to speak and we can no longer 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.550
 change more so now yes we 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.170
 we have to play with darius like 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.270
 you can see we can not leave simply 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.730
 we can continue closing the game which 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.110
 penalizes us with 30 meters of tail like this 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.310
 how good are we going to leave here I hope 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.980
 that you liked already know that you can 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.390
