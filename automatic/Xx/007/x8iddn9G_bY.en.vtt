00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.680
 Hello everyone in this lesson we are with you 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.770
 try to consider 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.110
 mediator and mediator play and and 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:34.120
 jumps from string to string what for this 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:36.310
 need to sort simple harmony i 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.390
 used harmony as a composition 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.670
 steve morse crazy and not notes 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.570
 all pulsation here goes all pulsation 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.280
 we are triple 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.560
 that is, two times three times two three times two 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.170
 three times two three and in order for us this 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.360
 good play we need to play 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.450
 highlighting every accent in the first three wills 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.040
 his 2 Tyrol we would get 1 3 1 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.210
 the accent we will have a blow down second 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.070
 the accent we will have blow up 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.200
 look at the bill first we take up 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.910
 major sus and in which everyone will appear 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.439
 here now on screen you will be very 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.689
 it just removes all about first 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:12.580
 we take dessus we reach 3 strings and back 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.360
 that is, 1 2 3 times focus on 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.750
 third string 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.070
 and come back to the fifth string if you 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.200
 Of course you have a classical guitarist is 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.240
 you have nothing to do is not easy 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.710
 can play with your finger 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.680
 plays a pick here will have like 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.260
 you should try the first chord now 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.350
 second chord also plays here too 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.300
 notice that first we are you 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.720
 You want to keep as a 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.910
 pinching the second finger on the 5 string afterwards 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.910
 ring finger on the 14th and third finger on 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.560
 tenth year or so but that also 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.290
 which is terribly uncomfortable therefore 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.729
 can try 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.430
 train your little bit and clamp 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.259
 10 from 5 fourth fourth string namely 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.050
 little finger that is so it will be much easier 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.940
 Of course, we don't have the structure of little fingers. 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.000
 all equally different as for example 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.209
 I or someone else but I feel so comfortable 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.009
 I also advise you to try 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.920
 now on the second chord 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.760
 second course we do 1 finger hold down 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.269
 sixth string 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.450
 namely the first finger that is, since 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.840
 chords 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.970
 You can assign such a fingering 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.409
 from put but so we can put him 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:33.790
 only when we play some 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:36.230
 compositions are exactly the same reason for one 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:42.920
 from the first finger passes us 6 to 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:46.940
 the third then the usual chord C major 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.400
 put and then this chord further 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.849
 play back and forth 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:57.760
 penultimate chord which is beautiful 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.760
 play it up to 3 strings then again at 5 and 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:07.160
 We end up with a third country in the end 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:09.260
 we get this phrase then 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.660
 then we move with you chord am for 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.069
 minor by all of us beloved and famous on 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.930
 court here we play it first 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.850
 notice that we can play 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.060
 here are these two strings 5 ​​with 4 only 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.310
 little finger then again 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.390
 first time we can play first 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.700
 finger and first finger again 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.250
 tipping over the third string 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.049
 then by the second finger you play already 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.140
 our first finger will pass 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:42.350
 go to the third string and then 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:47.570
 in the same way sous we have in A minor 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:50.500
 lived on we playing with you 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:54.220
 eat. usual chord mimino 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.010
 and the fact that we play the same way 6 5 4 3 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.750
 4 5 all on this we have simple forms 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.750
 we ended it turned out and 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.240
 next we play the chords in F major 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.280
 note that all play 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.470
 blow for blow down up down up there 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.870
 over and since here we have 4 well you 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.430
 we play the phrase 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.610
 then we’re farther away with 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:28.980
 hitting down again four notes 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:35.160
 then further in G major a 5 6 5 4 3 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.160
 then but miss the media smear in A minor 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.630
 try to play together 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.819
 I have 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.409
 This exercise should only be played. 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.280
 then when you already warmed up and 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.699
 feel 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.740
 3 volts when you can play 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.539
 or triple rhythm and then you will already be 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.539
 just enough to handle it 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:34.539
 I wish you success and creative victories
