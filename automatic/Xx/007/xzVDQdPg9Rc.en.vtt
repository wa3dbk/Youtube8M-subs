00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.839 
password and then I repeat the same
password<00:02:05.479> once<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.719> matches<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.819> update<00:02:08.819> my

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
password once it matches I update my

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.050 
password once it matches I update my
profile<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:10.830> now<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> new<00:02:11.819> password

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
profile so now I have a new password

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.460 
profile so now I have a new password
which<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.540> can

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
which I can

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.250 
which I can
let's<00:02:13.950> look<00:02:14.250> at<00:02:14.430> our<00:02:14.610> website<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.200> is

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
let's look at our website and this is

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.680 
let's look at our website and this is
the<00:02:16.440> first<00:02:16.710> look<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.340> your<00:02:17.580> website<00:02:17.760> doesn't

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
the first look of your website doesn't

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.110 
the first look of your website doesn't
look<00:02:18.990> very<00:02:19.020> great<00:02:19.530> but<00:02:20.280> that's<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.730> starting

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
look very great but that's the starting

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.880 
look very great but that's the starting
point<00:02:21.180> at<00:02:21.600> least<00:02:21.660> now<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.200> have<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.620> website

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
point at least now you have a website

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.090 
point at least now you have a website
you<00:02:23.520> are<00:02:23.640> online<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:25.260> first<00:02:25.500> thing<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.710> do<00:02:25.770> is

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
you are online so first thing I do is

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.540 
you are online so first thing I do is
okay<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.810> log<00:02:27.810> out<00:02:28.020> from<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:29.070> see<00:02:29.280> how

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
okay I log out from that to see how

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.700 
okay I log out from that to see how
other<00:02:30.180> people<00:02:30.690> will<00:02:30.840> be<00:02:31.020> able<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.440> view<00:02:31.650> your

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.540 
other people will be able to view your
website<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.880> view<00:02:33.030> which<00:02:34.550> word

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
website so this is the view which word

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.540 
website so this is the view which word
will<00:02:35.910> be<00:02:36.060> able<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.480> see<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.590> we<00:02:37.980> will<00:02:38.160> do<00:02:38.310> little

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
will be able to see so we will do little

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.870 
will be able to see so we will do little
bit<00:02:38.730> refinement<00:02:39.450> here<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.370> we<00:02:41.370> will<00:02:41.550> create

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
bit refinement here and we will create

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.350 
bit refinement here and we will create
our<00:02:42.150> first<00:02:42.780> post<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.800> this<00:02:44.040> one<00:02:44.280> for<00:02:45.210> doing

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
our first post in this one for doing

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.930 
our first post in this one for doing
that<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.990> once<00:02:46.260> again<00:02:46.440> logging<00:02:47.070> in<00:02:47.220> with<00:02:47.910> a

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
that and once again logging in with a

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.990 
that and once again logging in with a
username<00:02:48.660> as<00:02:49.080> admin<00:02:49.710> and<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.400> password<00:02:50.430> is

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
username as admin and the password is

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.790 
username as admin and the password is
that<00:02:51.180> new<00:02:51.360> password<00:02:51.900> which<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.380> set<00:02:52.860> up<00:02:54.800> before

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
that new password which I set up before

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.010 
that new password which I set up before
that<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.220> now<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:56.700> want<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.510> be<00:02:57.540> remember

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
that and now I want this to be remember

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.530 
that and now I want this to be remember
not<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.290> because<00:02:58.530> that's<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:58.830> password<00:02:59.220> which

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
not so because that's the password which

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.520 
not so because that's the password which
probably<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.600> don't<00:03:00.810> want<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.050> enter<00:03:01.290> every

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
probably I don't want to enter every

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.210 
probably I don't want to enter every
time<00:03:01.740> I<00:03:01.950> log<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.150> log<00:03:03.330> out<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:05.010> this
