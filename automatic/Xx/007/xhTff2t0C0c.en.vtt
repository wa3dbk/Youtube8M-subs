connect<00:00:53.520> me<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> server<00:00:54.030> um<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.550> I

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
connect me to the server um so like I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.910 
connect me to the server um so like I
said<00:00:56.789> earlier<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.480> was<00:00:57.629> hacked<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.770> in

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
said earlier it was hacked it's not in

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.220 
said earlier it was hacked it's not in
the<00:00:59.070> best<00:00:59.340> state<00:00:59.879> right<00:01:00.239> now<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> won't<00:01:01.020> but

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the best state right now so I won't but

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.009 
the best state right now so I won't but
I<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:02.359> traversal<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.390> recording<00:01:03.899> because

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
I really traversal of recording because

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.320 
I really traversal of recording because
it's<00:01:04.229> pretty<00:01:04.500> laggy<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.820> very<00:01:05.970> leggy

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
it's pretty laggy on it's very leggy

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.390 
it's pretty laggy on it's very leggy
anyway<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> lot<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.409> water<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.070> spawn

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
anyway and with a lot of water and spawn

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:18.469 
anyway and with a lot of water and spawn
and<00:01:08.850> stuff<00:01:10.400> so<00:01:11.450> um<00:01:14.659> basically<00:01:15.979> you<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.520> it's

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
and stuff so um basically you if it's

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.640 
and stuff so um basically you if it's
your<00:01:18.600> first<00:01:18.630> time<00:01:18.900> joining<00:01:19.020> you'll<00:01:19.439> spawn

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
your first time joining you'll spawn

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.289 
your first time joining you'll spawn
another<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.310> don't<00:01:20.670> know<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> thing<00:01:21.270> I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
another I don't know if it's the thing I

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.359 
another I don't know if it's the thing I
don't<00:01:21.659> wanna<00:01:21.780> say<00:01:21.930> anything<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.530> before<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
spawned before it was hacked you would

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.830

spawn has destroyed it life but was

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.700 
spawn has destroyed it life but was
hacked<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.149> you<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.329> you're<00:01:46.079> saying<00:01:46.380> water

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
representation of how the service is so

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.179 
representation of how the service is so
don't<00:01:53.640> use<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.060> with<00:01:54.240> your<00:01:54.329> judgment<00:01:55.189> it's

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
don't use this with your judgment it's

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.780 
don't use this with your judgment it's
playable<00:01:56.820> kinda<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:57.990> not<00:01:58.170> really<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.460> I'm

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790

ice<00:02:34.950> bugs<00:02:35.459> by<00:02:35.730> oh<00:02:35.760> it's<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.840> know<00:02:37.020> kind<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.650> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
ice bugs by oh it's you know kind of the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.280 
ice bugs by oh it's you know kind of the
blocks<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.940> we<00:02:39.090> have<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.570> politician<00:02:40.140> at

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
blocks that we have and politician at

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.620 
blocks that we have and politician at
the<00:02:40.470> moment<00:02:40.920> they're<00:02:41.489> biomes<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.239> step<00:02:42.569> and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
the moment they're biomes and step and

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.970 
the moment they're biomes and step and
basically<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:48.360> since<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:49.470> walked<00:02:49.739> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
basically it since you walked the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.040 
basically it since you walked the
world's<00:02:50.370> edge<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.269> will<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.870> know<00:02:51.930> for

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
world's edge and it will you know for

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.050 
world's edge and it will you know for
another<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.830> will<00:02:52.920> form<00:02:53.190> another<00:02:53.340> chunk

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
another it will form another chunk

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.870 
another it will form another chunk
around<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.810> guess<00:02:55.110> ahead<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.310> direction

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
around it I guess ahead of you direction

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.970 
around it I guess ahead of you direction
that<00:02:56.970> you're<00:02:57.090> facing<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.680> just<00:02:58.830> keep

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
that you're facing and you just keep

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.640 
that you're facing and you just keep
walking<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.610> if<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.780> walk<00:03:01.050> like<00:03:03.320> 110<00:03:04.320> macomb

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
walking and if you walk like 110 macomb

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.750 
walking and if you walk like 110 macomb
chunks<00:03:05.220> away<00:03:05.750> from<00:03:06.750> spawn<00:03:07.459> that'd<00:03:08.459> be<00:03:08.580> really

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
chunks away from spawn that'd be really

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.400 
chunks away from spawn that'd be really
long<00:03:09.000> walk<00:03:09.360> let's<00:03:09.720> excuse<00:03:10.050> me<00:03:10.170> that's<00:03:10.350> a

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
long walk let's excuse me that's a

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.380 
long walk let's excuse me that's a
really<00:03:10.620> long<00:03:10.800> walk<00:03:11.040> back<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.280> spawn<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:12.239> what

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
really long walk back to spawn so what

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.770 
really long walk back to spawn so what
you<00:03:12.510> can<00:03:12.630> do<00:03:12.810> is<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.230> can<00:03:13.260> type<00:03:13.680> /<00:03:14.510> set<00:03:15.510> home

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
you can do is you can type / set home

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.600 
you can do is you can type / set home
and<00:03:16.140> not<00:03:16.380> all<00:03:16.500> set<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:16.920> area<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.340> you're<00:03:17.489> in

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
and not all set that area that you're in

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.150 
and not all set that area that you're in
your<00:03:17.760> own<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.239> then<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:19.110> can<00:03:19.290> go<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.470> spawn<00:03:19.860> or

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
your own and then you can go to spawn or

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.560 
your own and then you can go to spawn or
do<00:03:20.250> whatever<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.579> need<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.940> achieve<00:03:21.060> do<00:03:21.390> your

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
your home with / home so that's a neat

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.560 
your home with / home so that's a neat
feature<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:28.019> avoid<00:03:28.470> walking<00:03:28.829> a<00:03:29.549> pretty<00:03:30.060> common

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
feature to avoid walking a pretty common

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:37.850 
feature to avoid walking a pretty common
feature<00:03:31.400> but<00:03:32.400> still<00:03:32.730> very<00:03:35.390> needed<00:03:36.650> because<00:03:37.650> it

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
feature but still very needed because it

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.430 
feature but still very needed because it
is<00:03:38.010> block<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:38.519> we<00:03:38.640> can't<00:03:38.850> spread<00:03:39.090> anything<00:03:39.440> so

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
is block so we can't spread anything so

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.759 
is block so we can't spread anything so
