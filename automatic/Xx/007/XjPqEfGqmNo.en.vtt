00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.180 
little flat areas that I need to hear on

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.570 
little flat areas that I need to hear on
the<00:00:09.269> intake<00:00:09.570> runners<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.580> number

bosses there's no boss underneath there

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.520 
bosses there's no boss underneath there
so<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.370> got<00:00:50.490> tap<00:00:51.150> those<00:00:51.360> holes<00:00:51.570> out<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.320> put<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
so we got tap those holes out and put a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.580 
so we got tap those holes out and put a
pipe<00:00:52.950> plug<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.310> there<00:00:53.490> here's<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.600> my<00:00:55.470> new

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
pipe plug in there here's my my new

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.580 
pipe plug in there here's my my new
little<00:00:55.860> pipe<00:00:56.040> tap<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.930> pipe<00:00:58.110> plug<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.560> I

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
little pipe tap and the pipe plug and I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.100 
little pipe tap and the pipe plug and I
keep<00:00:58.770> mentioning<00:00:58.980> pipe<00:00:59.720> and<00:01:00.720> that's<00:01:00.960> what

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
keep mentioning pipe and that's what

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.420 
keep mentioning pipe and that's what
they<00:01:01.230> are<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.620> there's<00:01:01.830> several<00:01:02.070> different

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
they are but there's several different

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.700 
they are but there's several different
kinds<00:01:02.880> of<00:01:03.559> pipe<00:01:04.559> threads<00:01:05.689> in<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.900> case<00:01:07.530> I'm

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
kinds of pipe threads in this case I'm

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.760 
kinds of pipe threads in this case I'm
actually<00:01:07.740> using<00:01:08.219> NPT<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:10.399> this<00:01:11.399> is<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> 3/8<00:01:12.060> inch

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
actually using NPT so this is a 3/8 inch

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.709 
actually using NPT so this is a 3/8 inch
NPT<00:01:13.770> pipe<00:01:14.280> plug<00:01:14.579> as<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.259> see<00:01:16.409> there<00:01:17.719> 3760

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
do I have a 9/16 inch drill bit which is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.630 
do I have a 9/16 inch drill bit which is
one<00:01:30.810> sixty-fourth<00:01:31.499> of<00:01:31.619> an<00:01:31.710> inch<00:01:31.859> smaller<00:01:32.039> than

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
one sixty-fourth of an inch smaller than

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.349 
one sixty-fourth of an inch smaller than
the<00:01:33.079> 37<00:01:34.079> 64<00:01:34.850> this<00:01:35.850> hole<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.329> measured<00:01:36.719> it<00:01:36.840> out<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
the 37 64 this hole I measured it out to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:42.109 
the 37 64 this hole I measured it out to
seventeen<00:01:39.359> sixty<00:01:39.719> fourths<00:01:40.249> so<00:01:41.249> we're<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
seventeen sixty fourths so we're a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.389 
seventeen sixty fourths so we're a
couple<00:01:42.240> sizes<00:01:42.719> too<00:01:42.990> small<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.979> I'm<00:01:44.100> gonna<00:01:44.249> go

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
couple sizes too small but I'm gonna go

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.580 
couple sizes too small but I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.759> give<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.969> shot<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.539> try<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.439> tap

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
ahead and give it a shot and try and tap

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.249 
ahead and give it a shot and try and tap
this<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:46.950> usually<00:01:47.159> with<00:01:47.460> pipe<00:01:47.700> taps<00:01:48.259> you

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
this out usually with pipe taps you

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.599 
this out usually with pipe taps you
they're<00:01:49.679> a<00:01:49.710> little<00:01:49.920> bit<00:01:50.069> different<00:01:50.100> than

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
they're a little bit different than

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.609 
they're a little bit different than
regular<00:01:51.119> taps<00:01:51.539> regular<00:01:52.139> taps<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.499> usually

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
regular taps regular taps you usually

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.160 
regular taps regular taps you usually
you<00:01:53.280> know<00:01:53.399> turn<00:01:53.609> them<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.880> half<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.450> turn<00:01:54.630> 3/4<00:01:55.109> of

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
you know turn them in half a turn 3/4 of

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.349 
you know turn them in half a turn 3/4 of
a<00:01:55.259> turn<00:01:55.439> back<00:01:56.189> them<00:01:56.340> off<00:01:56.490> about<00:01:56.639> a<00:01:56.759> quarter<00:01:56.999> and

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
a turn back them off about a quarter and

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.319 
a turn back them off about a quarter and
then<00:01:57.869> keep<00:01:58.289> going<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:59.490> when<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.789> back<00:01:59.939> Markel

quarter you kind of clear the chips out

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.080 
quarter you kind of clear the chips out
of<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.990> cutting<00:02:03.990> teeth<00:02:04.340> with<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> pipe<00:02:05.819> tap

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
of the cutting teeth with a pipe tap

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.059 
of the cutting teeth with a pipe tap
usually<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.139> just<00:02:07.170> want<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.679> start<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.819> go

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
usually you just want to start it and go

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.050 
usually you just want to start it and go
but<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.280> case<00:02:11.460> I'm<00:02:11.670> actually<00:02:11.820> probably

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
but in this case I'm actually probably

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.290 
but in this case I'm actually probably
gonna<00:02:12.300> have<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:13.130> cut<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> little<00:02:14.280> bit<00:02:14.520> back<00:02:15.150> it
