00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
is he gonna have a draft caller will be

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.690 
is he gonna have a draft caller will be
we'll<00:03:49.209> see<00:03:49.510> if<00:03:49.780> if<00:03:50.680> all<00:03:50.890> goes<00:03:50.920> well<00:03:51.100> he'll<00:03:51.489> be<00:03:51.670> a

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
we'll see if if all goes well he'll be a

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.640 
we'll see if if all goes well he'll be a
late<00:03:51.940> draft<00:03:52.239> pick<00:03:52.420> I<00:03:52.510> think<00:03:52.540> 5th<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.110> 7th<00:03:53.440> round

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
late draft pick I think 5th to 7th round

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.320 
late draft pick I think 5th to 7th round
but<00:03:53.950> maybe<00:03:54.280> at<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.549> point<00:03:54.790> a<00:03:54.850> free<00:03:55.000> agent

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
but maybe at that point a free agent

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.610 
but maybe at that point a free agent
deal<00:03:55.360> isn't<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:55.810> worst<00:03:55.989> thing<00:03:56.230> you<00:03:56.380> know<00:03:56.500> he

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
deal isn't the worst thing you know he

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.990 
deal isn't the worst thing you know he
can<00:03:56.769> kind<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:57.040> pick<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.280> right<00:03:57.430> situation<00:03:57.970> for

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
can kind of pick the right situation for

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.640 
can kind of pick the right situation for
him<00:03:58.299> keep<00:03:58.840> your<00:03:58.959> eyes<00:03:59.049> on<00:03:59.080> him<00:03:59.350> that's<00:03:59.500> for
