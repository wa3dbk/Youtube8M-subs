00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.090
 Erfurt the training workshop of the year 2008 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.410
 According to a recent study by Kraft Foods, people here give the am 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.909
 most common cases 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:12.249
 invited to his successful barbecue 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:16.039
 Kohler a kicker meat and of course 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.730
 because Johnny 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.430
 UniCat accompanies the Erfurt student in the search for the optimal I was 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.369
 with real in the Thuringian state capital 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.009
 You can choose from the Nordpark 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.449
 Petersberg 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.649
 the Louisan has and the uni-campus 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.499
 Depending on the quality of the barbecue, our critical tester distributes up to five 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:36.420
 percent 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.420
 and he really does not miss anything 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.020
 Let's start at Nordpark 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.940
 quickly make yourself comfortable to build the grill though with some 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.400
 teething problems 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.120
 and then it can be turned off, so the expert rates very well 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.139
 I like that there is enough space for sports activities here 

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:58.000
 because not the CDU must through the ears 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.720
 has to prevent the food 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.170
 only three percent 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.400
 gets the user 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.960
 the second station is the first Petersberg 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.870
 Here you can round off the day with your friends 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.250
 What I particularly like are very clear advantages, Gerstner says 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.810
 at the hopeless Petersberg 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.170
 with better Kaymer for points 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.490
 are there any disadvantages, of course, he clearly has it percent 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.650
 First, that they do 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.700
 WÃ¼rzburg has been run but exist itself 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.990
 Organ tours do not exist that knows where to put the garbage again 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.610
 take away and student without a car 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.530
 about anything Mio 7 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.070
 So what is the rating from just 33 percent the next day it goes on 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.780
 to the next day Euro 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.770
 Benches and trash cans are available 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.140
 but what strengthens 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.990
 to approach him 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.740
 under point 5 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.600
 Meat is reached milk 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.240
 a procedure for much more 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.380
 how many powers could not be recognized and 7 against the cold is sung 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 her money back 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.980
 The next evening it's out of the round of one life 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.500
 in the cold on campus, Johnny and his friends can finish the day 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.570
 the teacher will ring in more 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.769
 Hamilton LR quickly made the fire 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.949
 and already the tasty Christina Jahn are waiting for their hungry 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:15.949
 Stomach the benefits are definitely that I have a lot of friends with me 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.779
 Oil studies percent bull's-eye 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:20.980
 and he if the little sausages can have immediately over to the supermarket all 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.709
 People are not far to buy Pretoria sausages and means 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.799
 and you can start unpacking the grill immediately or down 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.090
 only drawback for the barbecue tester 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.589
 we do not have many disadvantages 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:37.289
 but now I want to find one then definitely that they are completely empty 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.829
 Building from the higher sometime the evening sun take away one takes 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.189
 Features sits 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.279
 already considered 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.309
 from trips 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:47.609
 back and stood 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.719
 The absolute winner is the Uni Campus 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:52.819
 Jonny Ebbert 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.239
 his personal conclusion 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.479
 Peter Egger 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.619
 Gaddafi was the uni-campus to get points on 5 Chris 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.809
 as suddenly the clear winner among the four places in Erfurt 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.699
 that's why I like my union 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.189
 Well that does not apply to most people and 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.939
 I can only recommend the people who study one thing to mention 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:19.150
 none of us tested for food places is an official barbecue area
