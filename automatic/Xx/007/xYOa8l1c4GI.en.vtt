00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.630
 yes and that's why 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.919
 is my Voltaire United go with the players I once 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:28.519
 played together 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.649
 and around except 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:31.699
 at the goalkeeper 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.990
 I am clear about that 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.480
 Peter Cech 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.110
 "From the game 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.720
 da and Prince 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.020
 Percent his attitude and as a player type 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.910
 number one at more 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.970
 Hero is 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.100
 and 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.100
 in central defense 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.680
 that's Nowotny 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.400
 and I have to o you 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.380
 in Sulz two types of players 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.480
 that could replace the whole defense 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.760
 around 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.340
 with two such 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.350
 Start running 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.750
 strong battle to tackle game strong 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.450
 in defenders 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.630
 Percent he always has Christoph Daum the once that is mine 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.370
 Bank of England and percent 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.950
 Therefore, around Kurt again in Leverkusen always relative 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.500
 play offensively also via the full-back position 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
 ze Roberto Prince William the 1 Steiger 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.380
 yes in the mountain, I believe in this position did not necessarily like to play 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.350
 because he also had defensive tasks in Pieschen 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.509
 He lost not only lost friends but all have 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.920
 ADATA brilliantly mastered Herthas Pal's majority here 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.720
 now the previous year shoots a progress in the area and others 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.450
 Players, we all know the goal net 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.730
 yes they are not stuck and percent accidents when my dad is this bridge 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.880
 There had to be Berthold Schneider 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.200
 a look back 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.020
 and percent instead of having a life around 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.209
 at the 18 start position as she suspects Hochwald is starting 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.669
 what has a new with the booked because itself 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.569
 before playing fish cup 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.699
 and that was always the player Dr 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:27.789
 Percent always uncomfortable nor that his leg has yet extended Meyer Exterra and 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:29.109
 to get a ball again 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:34.159
 So one percent of Eisler 90's world champion could not only do well if we did 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.929
 Playing football was also a humanly outstanding type 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.549
 from Mr on the 6th 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.469
 where I then met Martins on the paddling position 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.229
 not only on the one hand 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:54.209
 It's incredibly fast, he has that fast 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.480
 Eye for the sideline so always when I went through here always had 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.740
 with precise flanks 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.120
 Pröll used the strikers and from that time on he still needed time 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.849
 little 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.769
 Per cent work on themselves in terms of the reverse gear but after 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.409
 At the front, the right side is unbeatable 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.589
 Percent where I thank you 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:19.569
 Andrews Allessandro on the tens position 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.639
 He is an outstanding technician 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.059
 Hesse could play 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:31.749
 One percent and always looked at the top always has 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:32.310
 still 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.520
 the best man 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.239
 to still found at the side and percent decline 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.979
 Conti Wolfsburg states that they benefit 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.289
 and in the front because I mean 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.769
 nothing escapes Ing Bisky's first 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.419
 thanks not only with the consequence that the German 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:54.509
 percent of his attitude may have been to striker 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:59.290
 Today, percent of young players slice the record for the best 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:02.089
 Graduations have been role models in his time and of course they have a great deal too 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:03.069
 learned 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.069
 and second, I have not played together yet 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.859
 ksta not clear he was dead 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:11.889
 Dr 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.690
 one in my time was still in the development phase 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.269
 in the above mentioned us around with the me also in the Champions League and we also in 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.340
 the Bundesliga could play together 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.760
 Tehran has become scary to evolve well over the years in the United States 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.210
 Orkus imports Hamm and no longer plays wrongly percent 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.020
 Manchester United German Alcide not only goals but Stelzenbach 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.180
 template donors 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.770
 Percent and it is that Manchester United finished 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.020
 is not one of the best teams in the world and percent is playing as well 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.159
 the interest percent in front 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.479
 this is my 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.610
 at the same time I do not think 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.620
 to continue 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.600
 very good in the difficult can and where I am I think so too no 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.600
 Allowing a bad conscience can present profit 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.599
 because then Thomas Kohl Schröder all possible merger of 11 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.319
 but be the beginning 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.599
 there on Lake Como at least 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.020
 2002 if you 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.439
 a lot of fun and Leverkusen on it 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.039
 yes right or so 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.740
 so are my seven of eleven players at that time in the 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.520
 Champions league final accumulated are interest-free for Leverkusen have played 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.229
 what do you think are so high 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.539
 with Valon Behrami 2 points to 1 9 percent the full-back 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.590
 from the optimistically offensively positioned hair values ​​are around 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:27.569
 was about the topic 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.960
 and the second round is good 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.150
 what is wrong with brother? 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.050
 so it can be both there is our answer must be at 4 in the morning 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.939
 come 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:41.400
 but we are still 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.999
 April injured 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:47.539
 Still $ 0 APA also here to be stressed so schools plan the makers 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.660
 so we also met Lucerne Lucerne Manuel Döpfer Wasserwacht we wonder 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.219
 to have 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.179
 The reading sample was about five percent of previously enjoyable, the fund would only 

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:00.500
 a part fresher and 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.129
 and so expected 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:04.919
 9 of these are playing together again 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.159
 Renault with Peter Cech and bloodstains me strong, the left side has also 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:12.159
 would be affected with about 1000 hundred euros 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:14.589
 Jansen Berbatov represented 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:17.779
 is madly developed is changed to England we need to us 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:18.889
 not right again 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.300
 but to put in a game then also not yet decided eighth and will 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.719
 so we have to seize our opportunities »others 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:28.629
 and meanwhile not bad though Martin Petrov in the first round of the 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:29.499
 current 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:31.449
 and left adhesive 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:33.249
 we hope you worst 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:37.050
 He is always beautiful about left Jana Wittland smashed or the device 

00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:38.869
 taking profit dapd 

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:40.969
 Boston won at that time 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:43.969
 "Something has to stop somewhere wrong 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.889
 Do not be surprised anyway 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.050
 there was work to be sung 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.430
 Intendant Tomas Berdych thank you very much 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.180
 we will have 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.580
 Thanks to the viewers until it was finalized but a concept
