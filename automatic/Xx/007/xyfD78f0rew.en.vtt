something<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.140> need<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.350> figure<00:00:58.559> out<00:00:58.680> at<00:00:59.039> some

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
something I need to figure out at some

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.510 
something I need to figure out at some
point<00:00:59.570> but<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.050> part<00:01:01.260> I'm<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.800> little<00:01:02.219> upset

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
point but the part I'm a little upset

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.550 
point but the part I'm a little upset
about<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.359> had<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.780> 25<00:01:04.320> gig<00:01:06.560> partition

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
about is it had this 25 gig partition

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.850 
about is it had this 25 gig partition
here<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.220> had<00:01:08.460> nothing<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:10.830> I

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
here that had nothing in it so I

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.580 
here that had nothing in it so I
immediately<00:01:11.220> assumed<00:01:12.000> which<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.380> what<00:01:13.560> I

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
immediately assumed which this is what I

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.399 
immediately assumed which this is what I
get<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:14.040> assuming<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:15.210> oh<00:01:15.390> hey<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
get for assuming that oh hey this is the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.710 
get for assuming that oh hey this is the
24<00:01:17.100> gig<00:01:17.310> solid<00:01:17.729> state<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.930> named<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.159> and

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
24 gig solid state so named it and

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
24 gig solid state so named it and
installed<00:01:21.720> star<00:01:21.990> citizen<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.530> there

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
installed star citizen on there

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.510 
installed star citizen on there
unfortunately<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.369> it's<00:01:26.369> on

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
unfortunately as we can see it's it's on

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.830 
unfortunately as we can see it's it's on
the<00:01:26.640> spinning<00:01:27.000> disk<00:01:27.030> which<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.630> isn't

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the spinning disk which really isn't

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.270 
the spinning disk which really isn't
doing<00:01:27.990> me<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> whole<00:01:28.500> lot<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.189> it

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
doing me a whole lot of good to have it

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.090 
doing me a whole lot of good to have it
on<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.960> other<00:01:30.960> partition<00:01:31.680> over<00:01:31.890> here<00:01:32.070> so

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
on this other partition over here so

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.670 
on this other partition over here so
doing<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.250> from<00:01:35.880> what<00:01:36.119> I've<00:01:36.210> read<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
doing this from what I've read is a

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.940 
doing this from what I've read is a
little<00:01:37.920> bit<00:01:38.450> more<00:01:39.450> complicated<00:01:40.200> than<00:01:40.590> it's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
little bit more complicated than it's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.270 
little bit more complicated than it's
supposed<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:42.270> be<00:01:42.680> simply<00:01:43.680> because<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> way

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
supposed to be simply because of the way

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.789 
supposed to be simply because of the way
they<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.259> come<00:01:46.530> into

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
they do it so you do have to come into

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.740 
they do it so you do have to come into
computer<00:01:47.520> management<00:01:48.119> which<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.899> the

Administrative Tools in the control

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.940

panel<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.939> from<00:01:54.780> here<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.470> delete<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
panel and from here we can delete the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.510 
panel and from here we can delete the
volume<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:58.020> know<00:01:58.170> according<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.310> it

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
volume you know according to this it

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.429 
volume you know according to this it
wasn't<00:01:59.700> created<00:02:00.180> by<00:02:00.299> Windows<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.170> doesn't

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
wasn't created by Windows so it doesn't

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.620 
wasn't created by Windows so it doesn't
really<00:02:01.560> want<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.009> delete<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:03.450> know

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
sink on a server as s so obviously this

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.070 
sink on a server as s so obviously this
isn't<00:04:32.210> going<00:04:32.389> to<00:04:32.720> mount<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.440> s<00:04:34.870> so<00:04:35.870> we're<00:04:35.960> going

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
isn't going to mount to s so we're going

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:52.830 
isn't going to mount to s so we're going
to<00:04:36.169> change<00:04:36.440> it<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:47.380> mr.<00:04:48.380> P<00:04:49.330> for<00:04:50.330> plan<00:04:50.570> B

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
to change it to mr. P for plan B

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.920 
to change it to mr. P for plan B
here<00:04:53.380> we<00:04:53.500> are<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:53.919> now<00:04:54.340> it<00:04:54.520> popped<00:04:54.760> up<00:04:55.000> should

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
here we are and now it popped up should

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.740 
here we are and now it popped up should
have<00:04:56.050> known<00:04:56.200> that<00:04:56.970> from<00:04:57.970> experience<00:04:58.660> that

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
have known that from experience that

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.379 
have known that from experience that
pops<00:04:59.230> up<00:04:59.410> a<00:04:59.530> window<00:04:59.560> when<00:04:59.980> it<00:05:00.100> properly<00:05:00.490> mounts

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
pops up a window when it properly mounts

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.260 
pops up a window when it properly mounts
so<00:05:02.110> there<00:05:02.919> we<00:05:03.010> go<00:05:03.040> now<00:05:03.460> we<00:05:03.520> go<00:05:03.700> back<00:05:03.730> here

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
so there we go now we go back here

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.020 
so there we go now we go back here
there's<00:05:04.480> my<00:05:04.690> 22<00:05:05.200> gig<00:05:05.380> Drive<00:05:05.820> starts<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:07.000> the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
there's my 22 gig Drive starts to the

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.970 
there's my 22 gig Drive starts to the
Sun<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:07.419> beyond<00:05:07.870> for<00:05:08.650> B<00:05:10.440> so<00:05:11.440> now<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:11.590> just<00:05:11.710> get

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
Sun and beyond for B so now I just get

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.220 
Sun and beyond for B so now I just get
to<00:05:12.360> reinstall<00:05:13.360> star<00:05:13.660> status<00:05:14.050> on<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:16.330> think

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
to reinstall star status on I think

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.840 
to reinstall star status on I think
that'll<00:05:17.470> do<00:05:17.590> it<00:05:17.650> for<00:05:17.830> now<00:05:17.980> we'll<00:05:18.430> see<00:05:18.669> you<00:05:18.790> guys
