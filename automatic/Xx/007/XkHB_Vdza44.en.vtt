00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
okay so what should I wear as far as

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.310 
okay so what should I wear as far as
armor<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.380> really<00:01:43.620> like<00:01:43.740> my<00:01:43.980> helm<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.640> wise

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
armor I really like my helm of the wise

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.140 
armor I really like my helm of the wise
but<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.380> had<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.650> crimson<00:01:47.010> robe<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:47.820> I've<00:01:47.940> got

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
but I had this crimson robe and I've got

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.940 
but I had this crimson robe and I've got
the<00:01:48.180> shadow<00:01:48.570> garb<00:01:48.900> I<00:01:49.080> like<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:49.410> shadow<00:01:49.650> guard

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the shadow garb I like the shadow guard

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.450 
the shadow garb I like the shadow guard
because<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.400> it<00:01:51.120> weighs<00:01:52.050> very<00:01:52.380> little<00:01:52.830> and<00:01:52.980> I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
because it's it weighs very little and I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.760 
because it's it weighs very little and I
could<00:01:53.640> upgrade<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.150> a<00:01:54.210> bunch<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.650> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
could upgrade it a bunch and I like the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.560 
could upgrade it a bunch and I like the
Crimson<00:01:56.130> robe<00:01:56.310> because<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.760> actually<00:01:57.000> ups<00:01:57.390> my

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
Crimson robe because it actually ups my

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.920 
Crimson robe because it actually ups my
stats<00:01:57.870> so<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.800> can<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.310> right<00:01:59.460> there

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
stats so you can see on the right there

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.710 
stats so you can see on the right there
it's<00:02:00.930> going<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.320> higher<00:02:01.860> for<00:02:01.890> everything

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
it's going to be higher for everything

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.530 
it's going to be higher for everything
except<00:02:03.720> it<00:02:03.810> weighs<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> little<00:02:04.170> bit<00:02:04.380> more<00:02:04.560> but

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
except it weighs a little bit more but

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.450 
except it weighs a little bit more but
the<00:02:06.540> only<00:02:06.660> drawback<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.830> the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
the only drawback is it's the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.580 
the only drawback is it's the
resistances<00:02:09.390> are<00:02:09.690> lower<00:02:09.959> for<00:02:10.290> all<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
resistances are lower for all the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.850 
resistances are lower for all the
crimson<00:02:11.009> armor<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:13.080> I've<00:02:13.170> got<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.380> Crimson

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
crimson armor so I've got the Crimson

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.199 
crimson armor so I've got the Crimson
gloves<00:02:14.130> here<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.740> oh<00:02:16.740> these<00:02:17.730> are<00:02:17.910> actually

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
gloves here and oh these are actually

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.470 
gloves here and oh these are actually
lighter<00:02:18.450> but<00:02:19.170> they<00:02:19.320> have<00:02:19.470> less<00:02:19.680> defense

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.770 

so<00:02:24.050> i<00:02:24.110> got<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.409> kind<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:25.150> mishmash<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.420> stuff

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
so i got this kind of mishmash of stuff

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.789 
so i got this kind of mishmash of stuff
here<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:29.980> that's<00:02:30.980> okay<00:02:31.250> i<00:02:31.989> think<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.200> leather

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
here and that's okay i think the leather

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:54.220 
here and that's okay i think the leather
armor<00:02:34.190> has<00:02:34.310> given<00:02:34.549> me<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.670> nice<00:02:34.819> balance<00:02:35.150> though

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.949

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.680 

I've<00:03:25.280> put<00:03:25.310> on<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.879> ring<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.299> evil<00:03:26.569> eye

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
I've put on the ring of the evil eye

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.910 
I've put on the ring of the evil eye
because<00:03:27.019> I<00:03:27.080> was<00:03:27.200> just<00:03:27.290> messing<00:03:27.620> around<00:03:27.709> with

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
because I was just messing around with

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.199 
because I was just messing around with
some<00:03:28.159> stuff<00:03:28.400> before<00:03:28.549> but<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:29.000> should<00:03:29.180> probably

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
some stuff before but I should probably

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:45.950 
some stuff before but I should probably
get<00:03:29.569> rid<00:03:29.720> of<00:03:29.810> that

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.360 

I<00:03:46.050> was<00:03:46.770> really<00:03:47.040> not<00:03:47.160> ready<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.580> do<00:03:47.910> this<00:03:48.320> but

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.810 
I was really not ready to do this but
hopefully<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.460> can<00:03:50.610> just<00:03:52.070> fix<00:03:53.070> some<00:03:53.340> stuff<00:03:53.460> when

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
hopefully I can just fix some stuff when

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.910 
hopefully I can just fix some stuff when
i<00:03:53.880> get<00:03:54.060> over<00:03:54.270> here
