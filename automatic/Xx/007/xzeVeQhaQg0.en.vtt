00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.250
 Of course, that will be a lot again 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.250

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.940

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.150
 Do not tell the Guardian to go too fast that this is our life 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 shape into the abyss 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 Homann

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.410
 Striking bridges 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.310
 make problems 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.160
 Deggendorf the last word 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.190

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.659
