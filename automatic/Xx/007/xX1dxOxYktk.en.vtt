00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
this actually seems to be a good horror

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.100 
this actually seems to be a good horror
movie<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.239> unlike<00:03:43.239> that<00:03:43.390> they<00:03:43.540> actually<00:03:43.690> try

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
movie and unlike that they actually try

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.670 
movie and unlike that they actually try
to<00:03:44.140> apply<00:03:45.239> this<00:03:46.239> horror<00:03:46.540> genre<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.290> social

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
to apply this horror genre to social

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.199 
to apply this horror genre to social
media<00:03:47.800> I<00:03:47.980> mean<00:03:48.010> socially<00:03:48.550> it<00:03:48.610> is<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:48.970> big

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
media I mean socially it is so big

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.840 
media I mean socially it is so big
nowadays<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:50.080> I<00:03:50.400> think<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.550> most<00:03:51.730> people

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
nowadays and I think that most people

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.370 
nowadays and I think that most people
can<00:03:52.180> really<00:03:52.450> relate<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.989> this<00:03:53.110> and<00:03:53.290> we<00:03:53.350> have

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
can really relate to this and we have

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.800 
can really relate to this and we have
Skype<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:54.010> Facebook<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.880> I<00:03:55.480> don't<00:03:55.630> know

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
Skype and Facebook and I don't know

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.390
