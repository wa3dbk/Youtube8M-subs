cars.com auto reviews

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.350
I am Kelsey Mays for cars dot com here
with the 2012 BMW

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.960
X5 this is the final year so on the
second generation of the x5 which has

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.720
been around since

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.380
late 2006 it's a powerful SUV with a
roomie

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.050
handsome cabin but it gives up summer
BMW's trademark fun to drive qualities

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.800
in the process

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.060
we'll show you why a test cars index
tribe 35 I i mean just got a

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.230
300-horsepower turbocharged six-cylinder
engine

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.850
and eight-speed automatic transmission
on the reserve power getting off the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.860
highway speed

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.470
is not a problem even from a metered
autorip the problem is

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.610
getting to all that power especially
around town drivetrain respond really

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.520
gradually

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.530
to the gas pedal new throw the
transmission over into a sport mode

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.530
and it's a bit better kicking down the
gears when you needed to at speed but

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.020
still

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.480
getting off the line kinda slow believe
it and drive in the transmission

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.000
is really indecisive doesn't kick down
to the right gears when he needed to

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.210
not really great especially in traffic
the value reflexes carry over to use

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.850
during

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.640
be ex-wives 42 for turning circle means
you're gonna have to be making a lot of

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.609
three-point turns and the steering feels
heavy and artificially waited throughout

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:14.479
the whole process

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.899
it doesn't want to return to sender
naturally and at higher speeds the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.289
feedback is pretty numb

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.609
we do like the x5 interior not a lot has
changed with a smile over the years

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.100
and materials are pretty good soft touch
all the way down past knee level the

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.399
night

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.819
hello class graining along the dash
looks good even

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.909
in direct sunlight our test car as a lot
of things like four zone climate control

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:35.590
and even

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.090
a rear entertainment system it goes
right here unfortunately the STO the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.740
screen

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.399
well now you can open the center consul
what room in the back seat I've got

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.409
inches to spare here

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.819
from my knees and there's no center
floor comp it robs footwell

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.429
space still I wish to see where nature
to hire off the ground

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.139
twenties are kinda up in the air here
other adults may feel the same way

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:01.229
and the seatback doesn't work line
there's no forward or backward just

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:01.639
neither

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.799
so not being done these competitors
offer adjustments for the back row

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.170
I've never been wild about the way

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.760
the X 5's liftgate tailgate combination
kinda works the section comes up and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.290
then there's

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.300
another section here that comes down %uh
without the optional third rather arnie

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.070
handles here to facilitate holding down
the second row that's a bit of a long

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.920
reach here

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.430
can I get them down if you've got this
thing down its

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.520
almost impossibly far to get in there
still 36 cubic feet

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.280
a cargo volume: behind the second row 75
cubic feet have maximum volume that the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.940
seats folded

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.180
pretty decent numbers there not as good
as the x5 japanese competition but

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.430
comparable to its european competitors
so the x5 as dis mutilating in a premium

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.430
cabinet rides

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.930
pretty well too we wish BMW shop on
something that's reflexes

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.930
here's hoping that something that comes
our way when a redesign shows up

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.819
for more car-related new Skoda cars dot
com 400 block

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.260
