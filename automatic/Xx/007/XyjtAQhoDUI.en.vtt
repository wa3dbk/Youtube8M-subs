00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
a pretty funky-looking robot what can

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.850 
a pretty funky-looking robot what can
you<00:00:18.330> tell<00:00:18.420> us<00:00:18.510> about<00:00:18.600> these<00:00:18.840> robot<00:00:19.170> do<00:00:19.350> ok

specialist hobby market right and you

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
specialist hobby market right and you
know<00:00:34.710> what<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.040> got<00:00:35.220> is<00:00:35.370> something<00:00:35.640> that's

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
know what we got is something that's

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.030 
know what we got is something that's
really<00:00:35.940> advanced<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.840> as<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.350> see<00:00:37.560> lots

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
of really cool moves but at the same

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.310 
of really cool moves but at the same
time<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.190> really<00:00:41.580> accessible<00:00:42.240> to<00:00:42.480> people<00:00:42.630> easy

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
time is really accessible to people easy

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.780 
time is really accessible to people easy
to<00:00:43.680> put<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.980> get<00:00:44.100> well<00:00:44.310> there's<00:00:44.670> nothing

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
to put to get well there's nothing

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.700

nothing to put together but it's easy to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.010 
nothing to put together but it's easy to
get<00:00:46.829> started<00:00:47.100> using<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.910> then<00:00:48.090> when<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.540> seen

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
get started using and then when you seen

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.480 
get started using and then when you seen
everything<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.440> does<00:00:49.470> out<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> box<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.340> can

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
everything it does out the box you can

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.460 
everything it does out the box you can
start<00:00:50.700> programming<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.329> yourself<00:00:51.720> Rockne<00:00:52.260> you

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
start programming it yourself Rockne you

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.620 
start programming it yourself Rockne you
program<00:00:53.010> these<00:00:53.190> robots<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.880> PC<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.450> that

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
program these robots on a PC is that

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.180 
program these robots on a PC is that
right<00:00:54.810> you<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.560> you're<00:00:55.650> not<00:00:55.800> using<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
right you do but you're not using a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.680 
right you do but you're not using a
programming<00:00:56.670> language<00:00:56.700> so<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.329> don't<00:00:57.600> have

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
programming language so you don't have

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.870 
programming language so you don't have
to<00:00:57.810> worry<00:00:57.989> about<00:00:58.170> learning<00:00:58.560> things<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.070> C++

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
to worry about learning things like C++

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.280 
to worry about learning things like C++
and<00:00:59.910> all<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.329> stuff<00:01:00.450> like<00:01:00.750> driving<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
and all that stuff like driving one a

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.560 
and all that stuff like driving one a
headache<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.850> know<00:01:02.970> that's<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.540> real

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
headache so you know that's a real

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.240 
headache so you know that's a real
turnoff<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.470> what<00:01:04.620> we've<00:01:04.769> done<00:01:04.800> is<00:01:04.949> we've<00:01:05.220> got

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
turnoff so what we've done is we've got

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.760 
turnoff so what we've done is we've got
an<00:01:05.400> animation<00:01:05.760> package<00:01:06.390> where<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.470> like

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
an animation package where it's like

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.770 
an animation package where it's like
doing<00:01:08.159> stop<00:01:08.460> motion<00:01:08.760> animation<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.540> Wallace

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
doing stop motion animation like Wallace

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.719 
doing stop motion animation like Wallace
and<00:01:10.020> Gromit<00:01:10.050> don't<00:01:10.800> you<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.550> as

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
and Gromit don't you have that but as

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.940 
and Gromit don't you have that but as
you<00:01:12.090> know<00:01:12.300> you<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.570> frame<00:01:12.870> one<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.620> remove

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
you know you have frame one then remove

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.710 
you know you have frame one then remove
the<00:01:13.979> robots<00:01:14.430> arms<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:14.880> bit<00:01:15.180> remove<00:01:15.540> its

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
the robots arms a little bit remove its

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.710 
the robots arms a little bit remove its
legs<00:01:15.960> brain<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.070> set<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.940> time<00:01:18.180> between<00:01:18.360> those

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
legs brain to set the time between those

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.300 
legs brain to set the time between those
frames<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.350> then<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> robot<00:01:19.890> will<00:01:19.979> move<00:01:20.190> from

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
frames and then the robot will move from

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.310 
frames and then the robot will move from
one<00:01:20.520> point<00:01:20.760> to<00:01:20.880> our<00:01:21.000> next<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.630> how<00:01:22.020> long<00:01:22.080> can

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
one point to our next so how long can

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.100 
one point to our next so how long can
this<00:01:22.650> guy<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:23.000> either<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.150> dance<00:01:24.510> or<00:01:24.840> whatever

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
this guy do either a dance or whatever

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.110 
this guy do either a dance or whatever
else<00:01:25.409> you're<00:01:25.560> wanting<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.190> well<00:01:26.909> it

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
else you're wanting to do for well it

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.700 
else you're wanting to do for well it
will<00:01:27.210> dance<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.540> about<00:01:27.750> 45<00:01:28.229> minutes<00:01:28.440> on<00:01:28.680> one

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
will dance for about 45 minutes on one

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.880 
will dance for about 45 minutes on one
charge<00:01:29.159> right<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.750> 45<00:01:31.260> minutes<00:01:31.619> probably

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
charge right on that 45 minutes probably

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.520 
charge right on that 45 minutes probably
isn't<00:01:32.400> really<00:01:32.790> enough<00:01:32.909> time<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:34.080> you<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.320> see

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
isn't really enough time for you to see

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.230 
isn't really enough time for you to see
everything<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.220> could<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.400> stored<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:36.000> there

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
everything that could be stored on there

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.570 
everything that could be stored on there
so<00:01:36.510> you<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.840> sort<00:01:37.080> an<00:01:37.260> awful<00:01:37.680> lot<00:01:37.830> on<00:01:38.310> that

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
so you can sort an awful lot on that

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.399 
so you can sort an awful lot on that
robot<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.119> access<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.510> open<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> head<00:01:40.140> or<00:01:40.290> any

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
robot and access it open the head or any

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.310 
robot and access it open the head or any
our<00:01:40.680> seat<00:01:40.979> I've<00:01:41.159> devised<00:01:41.610> 45<00:01:42.600> minutes<00:01:42.930> or<00:01:43.080> 15

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
our seat I've devised 45 minutes or 15
