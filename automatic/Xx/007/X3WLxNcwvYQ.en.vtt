00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.480
 when bmw pulls out of the car cylinder 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.549
 such 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.690
 suddenly I forget my sister 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.089
 the front- wheeled MPV 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.799
 just presented and the odd one 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.340
 tingling that plagues my foot 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.080
 right 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.030
 the cure for finally finds relief 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.970
 example could be the new bmw 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.140
 series 2 tube 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.270
 but if the itch of the right foot 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.940
 should be of those who do not give 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.120
 annoying respite well then it takes 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:40.899
 a much more effective cure and we do 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.899
 we have it and the new series 2 km 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.719
 and she the progenitor of a family of 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.019
 light and snappy coupes dating back to 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.239
 1967 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.519
 as well as then the recipe of the house 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.940
 Bavarian has always remained the same 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.129
 skillfully mixing power 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.019
 balancing precision driving 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.840
 compactness and obviously the much loved one 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:09.020
 more aggressive rear-wheel drive than the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.020
 previous series 1 coupe the 2nd lines more 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.600
 cutting edges have increased the overall dimensions 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.090
 distance between the two axles and the engines are 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.979
 more powerful, a big step forward isn't there 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.979
 what to say underlined by the front 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.500
 redesigned with new LED and headlights 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.140
 massive wheel arches that emphasize a 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.729
 muscular and compact rear end that a 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.850
 my opinion would have been more balanced 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.420
 with a more subtle lighting but they are 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.700
 details 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.340
 so much has also been done where the eye 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.899
 at first it does not arrive I'm 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.270
 speaking of the asset that has benefited 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.700
 at the front of a double-jointed axle 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.159
 with swinging arm and at the rear 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.119
 of a five-arm scheme then there is 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.310
 also the new power steering 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.679
 electromechanical working with 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.989
 surgical precision leaving the 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.819
 smile in you print in the face if 

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:58.099
 let's talk about transmissions the news is 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.670
 all in the new 8-speed automatic 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:03.470
 optional that is good to remember is not a 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.730
 double clutch but an automatic 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.280
 traditional 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.170
 but feel how it changes 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.060
 the central console also shows the 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.010
 dynamic control that allows to act 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.140
 on the suspension calibration 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.569
 the accelerator response and the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.920
 steering readiness 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.920
 obviously all at the most to shoot 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.440
 on the track well if we talk about me numbers 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.750
 they are very important and fundamental 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.930
 then we have in these numbers under the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.090
 hood of the 235 i beats 6 in line 3 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.980
 liters of 320 six horses 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.840
 this means that zero feels yes 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.020
 covers 8 seconds with the light in 4 seconds 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.489
 control and without up to 250 timetables of the 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.750
 city ​​beyond which the limiter 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.930
 unfortunately he has no more respite 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.120
 few cars in addition to the bmw capable of 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.069
 give you the chance to sew yourself 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.459
 the driving position to you more 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.860
 congenial as I was from the tailor you are 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.140
 sitting down like me and the 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.989
 nice vertical steering wheel right where 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.010
 his hands would naturally look for him and 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.900
 since I'm on the track 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.200
 I can slowly raise the pace e 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.440
 look for the limit of the small coupe 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.930
 we see 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.930
 but think of the combination someone has 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.260
 left another 235 m in front 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.360
 to me and with the keys inside maybe with the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.170
 white paint goes stronger 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.640
 it is worth trying it agile and manageable 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.200
 dance between the curves with the ease of 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.820
 a skating dancer on the 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.260
 ice 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.300
 if you really want it, so does the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.160
 power oversteer that you control 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.020
 with great ease thanks to 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.100
 steering readiness and al 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.680
 exemplary balance 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.780
 the six-cylinder is a beautiful cavalry 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.630
 to be unloaded even if mine 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.090
 warning still lacks that pinch of 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.940
 badness needed when the needle of 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.370
 tachometer caresses the upper area of ​​the other 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.480
 However, I am talking about the torque curve and flat 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.980
 the maximum value of 450 newton meters 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.000
 favoring a constant push already since 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.040
 1300 laps and up to 4500 share which 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.100
 makes this propeller very regular 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.190
 in use but too much for a bmw 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.480
 with the m on the side 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.070
 I liked the change instead 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.989
 eight-speed automatic 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.270
 as quick and punctual as a Swiss of 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.910
 hurry allows you to put on a gear 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:24.010
 behind the other with great speed 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.470
 willingly accepting also climbing 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.389
 at the limit of the very good automatic revs 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.129
 but now I want to leave the circuit for 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.129
 see how it gets along on the road 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.520
 from petrol to diesel 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:45.180
 making a jump back of 142 horses 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.639
 now I'm at the wheel of the 2 220d series 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.940
 the ticking to a minimum reminds me of that 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:53.220
 the 2004 184-horsepower diesel cylinder is 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.860
 an old acquaintance an engine this 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.930
 which does not impress by sheer power but 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.599
 which is capable of a tenacious push to 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.150
 any scheme for sure personally 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.819
 I prefer gasoline but for those who have 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.479
 need to move so much is the choice 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:11.759
 perfect even the most humane 220d not 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.770
 disappoints expectations making me enjoy 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.530
 of all the sportiness I want without 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.139
 require a great mental commitment in 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.300
 sport mode plus slips away which is a 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:24.570
 pleasure and the great couple at the bottom 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.280
 here we are at 380 newton meters facilitates the 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.340
 loss of grip at the rear that 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.900
 draws black commas on the scarce 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.490
 the general balance is excellent and also 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.979
 when under the wheels they pass 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.960
 bumpy or dirty the pleasure of 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:42.180
 driving and always at the highest levels 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.180
 really nice little toy
