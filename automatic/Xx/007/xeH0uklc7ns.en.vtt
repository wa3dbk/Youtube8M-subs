four mile run stream how many people

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.900 
four mile run stream how many people
have<00:00:04.240> visited<00:00:04.360> four<00:00:04.810> mile<00:00:04.990> run<00:00:05.110> before<00:00:05.910> 50

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:06.910

have visited four mile run before 50
million<00:00:07.270> times<00:00:09.629> today<00:00:10.629> you<00:00:10.959> guys<00:00:11.410> are<00:00:11.679> gonna

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:11.799 
million times today you guys are gonna

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.039 
million times today you guys are gonna
be<00:00:11.889> learning<00:00:12.610> about<00:00:12.730> four<00:00:13.179> mile<00:00:13.360> run<00:00:13.570> stream

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.049 
be learning about four mile run stream

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.529 
be learning about four mile run stream
and<00:00:14.200> you're<00:00:14.289> gonna<00:00:14.379> have<00:00:14.619> three<00:00:15.009> stations<00:00:15.730> to

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
and you're gonna have three stations to

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.300 
and you're gonna have three stations to
learn<00:00:16.720> about<00:00:16.990> the<00:00:17.199> pollution<00:00:17.800> and<00:00:17.950> the<00:00:18.070> water

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
learn about the pollution and the water

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.430 
learn about the pollution and the water
quality<00:00:19.120> and<00:00:19.660> different<00:00:19.960> things<00:00:20.140> that<00:00:20.320> people

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 
quality and different things that people

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.690 
quality and different things that people
can<00:00:20.740> do<00:00:20.860> to<00:00:21.010> make<00:00:21.160> the<00:00:21.310> water<00:00:21.520> better<00:00:26.610> one<00:00:27.610> of

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
can do to make the water better one of

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.520 
can do to make the water better one of
the<00:00:27.760> things<00:00:27.940> that<00:00:28.090> we<00:00:28.180> do<00:00:28.420> with<00:00:28.990> the<00:00:29.110> county<00:00:29.380> is

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530 
the things that we do with the county is

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.170 
the things that we do with the county is
we<00:00:29.680> have<00:00:29.830> a<00:00:29.860> volunteer<00:00:30.430> program<00:00:30.580> where<00:00:31.150> people

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
we have a volunteer program where people

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.140 
we have a volunteer program where people
like<00:00:32.050> yourselves<00:00:32.469> and<00:00:33.010> other<00:00:33.520> folks<00:00:33.790> can<00:00:33.910> go

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
like yourselves and other folks can go

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.060 
like yourselves and other folks can go
out<00:00:34.329> and<00:00:34.630> get<00:00:34.990> trained<00:00:35.320> and<00:00:35.530> do<00:00:35.680> stream

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
out and get trained and do stream

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.290 
out and get trained and do stream
monitoring<00:00:36.490> have<00:00:36.670> you<00:00:36.730> guys<00:00:36.850> ever<00:00:37.030> heard<00:00:37.180> of

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
monitoring have you guys ever heard of

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.370 
monitoring have you guys ever heard of
stream<00:00:37.570> monitoring<00:00:37.780> you<00:00:37.930> said<00:00:38.110> you<00:00:38.200> did<00:00:38.350> a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
stream monitoring you said you did a

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.530 
stream monitoring you said you did a
little<00:00:38.590> bit<00:00:38.710> at<00:00:38.800> the<00:00:38.920> outdoor<00:00:39.010> lab<00:00:42.329> okay<00:00:43.329> well

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
little bit at the outdoor lab okay well

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.030 
little bit at the outdoor lab okay well
that's<00:00:43.690> what<00:00:43.870> that's<00:00:44.079> what<00:00:44.230> we<00:00:44.320> call<00:00:44.530> stream

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
that's what that's what we call stream

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.069 
that's what that's what we call stream
monitoring<00:00:45.430> and<00:00:45.670> you<00:00:46.210> guys<00:00:46.360> remember<00:00:46.840> why<00:00:47.020> you

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
monitoring and you guys remember why you

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.660 
monitoring and you guys remember why you
might<00:00:47.560> want<00:00:47.739> to<00:00:47.829> look<00:00:47.980> at<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.220> critters<00:00:48.520> in

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
might want to look at the critters in

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.540 
might want to look at the critters in
the<00:00:48.760> stream<00:00:49.440> yeah<00:00:50.440> you<00:00:50.770> can<00:00:50.950> use<00:00:51.100> these<00:00:51.340> what

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
the stream yeah you can use these what

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.370 
the stream yeah you can use these what
they<00:00:51.670> call<00:00:51.700> them<00:00:52.030> you<00:00:52.870> can<00:00:53.020> use<00:00:53.140> them<00:00:53.260> as

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
they call them you can use them as

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.830 
they call them you can use them as
indicators<00:00:54.070> of<00:00:54.309> water<00:00:54.550> quality<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:55.270> like

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
indicators of water quality and like

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.299 
indicators of water quality and like
this<00:00:56.020> first<00:00:56.260> group<00:00:56.530> here<00:00:56.770> we<00:00:56.980> have<00:00:57.100> some

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
this first group here we have some

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.299 
this first group here we have some
stoneflies<00:00:58.110> mayflies<00:00:59.110> caddisflies<00:00:59.890> this

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
stoneflies mayflies caddisflies this

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.580 
stoneflies mayflies caddisflies this
one's<00:01:00.489> called<00:01:00.640> a<00:01:00.760> water<00:01:01.000> penny<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:01.630> some

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
one's called a water penny and some

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.990 
one's called a water penny and some
beetles<00:01:02.920> these<00:01:03.130> ones<00:01:03.340> are<00:01:03.489> all<00:01:03.610> very

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
beetles these ones are all very

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.360 
beetles these ones are all very
sensitive<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.989> pollution<00:01:05.199> so<00:01:05.740> if<00:01:05.950> they're<00:01:06.159> in

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
sensitive to pollution so if they're in

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.850 
sensitive to pollution so if they're in
your<00:01:06.490> stream<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.990> you<00:01:08.170> have<00:01:08.380> any<00:01:08.560> pollution

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
your stream and you have any pollution

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.550 
your stream and you have any pollution
or<00:01:09.280> any<00:01:09.490> changes<00:01:10.060> that<00:01:10.240> for<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:10.960> habitat<00:01:11.380> that

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
or any changes that for the habitat that

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.260 
or any changes that for the habitat that
get<00:01:11.740> in<00:01:11.830> there<00:01:12.010> yeah<00:01:12.370> they'll<00:01:12.580> die<00:01:12.760> or<00:01:13.120> they'll

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
get in there yeah they'll die or they'll

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.399 
get in there yeah they'll die or they'll
you<00:01:13.570> know<00:01:13.630> kind<00:01:13.870> of<00:01:13.930> move<00:01:14.049> somewhere<00:01:14.350> else

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
you know kind of move somewhere else

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.140 
you know kind of move somewhere else
they<00:01:14.680> don't<00:01:14.950> really<00:01:15.159> like<00:01:15.340> that<00:01:15.520> so<00:01:16.000> hopefully

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
they don't really like that so hopefully

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.030 
they don't really like that so hopefully
you<00:01:16.570> would<00:01:16.690> be<00:01:17.049> able<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.260> find<00:01:17.560> all<00:01:17.799> these

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
you would be able to find all these

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.109 
you would be able to find all these
different<00:01:18.100> kind<00:01:18.549> of<00:01:18.610> critters<00:01:18.880> in<00:01:18.970> your

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
different kind of critters in your

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.219 
different kind of critters in your
stream<00:01:19.330> because<00:01:19.479> that<00:01:19.630> means<00:01:19.810> that<00:01:19.990> there's<00:01:20.170> a

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
stream because that means that there's a

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.649 
stream because that means that there's a
good<00:01:20.880> biodiversity<00:01:21.880> if<00:01:21.940> you<00:01:22.030> guys<00:01:22.119> had<00:01:22.390> heard

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
good biodiversity if you guys had heard

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:23.580 
good biodiversity if you guys had heard
that<00:01:22.810> word<00:01:22.990> before

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
that word before

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.310 
that word before
biodiversity<00:01:24.460> yeah<00:01:25.390> so<00:01:25.780> that<00:01:25.900> means<00:01:26.110> there's

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
biodiversity yeah so that means there's

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.080 
biodiversity yeah so that means there's
lots<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:26.740> different<00:01:27.100> kinds<00:01:27.310> of<00:01:27.369> organisms<00:01:27.909> and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
lots of different kinds of organisms and

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.609 
lots of different kinds of organisms and
because<00:01:28.540> of<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:28.780> just<00:01:29.020> we<00:01:29.110> were<00:01:29.200> at<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:29.350> site

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
because of you just we were at a site

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.109 
because of you just we were at a site
yesterday<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.189> we<00:01:30.250> found<00:01:30.400> a<00:01:30.549> whole<00:01:30.790> bunch<00:01:30.939> of

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
yesterday and we found a whole bunch of

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.730 
yesterday and we found a whole bunch of
crayfish<00:01:31.330> but<00:01:31.810> not<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:31.990> lot<00:01:32.200> of<00:01:32.229> other<00:01:32.409> things

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
crayfish but not a lot of other things

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.800 
crayfish but not a lot of other things
and<00:01:33.070> so<00:01:33.549> that<00:01:33.700> really<00:01:33.880> isn't<00:01:34.330> you<00:01:34.510> know<00:01:34.600> the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
and so that really isn't you know the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.240 
and so that really isn't you know the
healthiest<00:01:35.380> kind<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.560> situation<00:01:36.010> cuz<00:01:36.130> you've

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
healthiest kind of situation cuz you've

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.830 
healthiest kind of situation cuz you've
only<00:01:36.369> got<00:01:36.549> one<00:01:36.580> type<00:01:37.000> of<00:01:37.030> organism<00:01:37.659> that's

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
only got one type of organism that's

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.990 
only got one type of organism that's
that's<00:01:38.110> doing<00:01:38.470> really<00:01:38.590> well<00:01:38.770> there<00:01:39.010> so<00:01:39.340> does

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
that's doing really well there so does

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.140 
that's doing really well there so does
anybody<00:01:40.180> want<00:01:40.540> to<00:01:40.600> try<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.869> boots<00:01:42.000> now<00:01:43.000> what

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
anybody want to try the boots now what

about the water quality here in four

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.520 
about the water quality here in four
mile<00:03:22.609> run<00:03:25.900> but<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.049> one<00:03:27.260> of<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:27.380> baby

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
mile run but it's one of the baby

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.930 
mile run but it's one of the baby
there's<00:03:27.769> some<00:03:27.980> some<00:03:28.340> types<00:03:28.549> of<00:03:28.700> pollutants

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
kind of pollution do you think could be

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.030 
kind of pollution do you think could be
getting<00:03:32.480> into<00:03:32.690> form<00:03:32.959> all<00:03:33.079> right<00:03:33.319> cocaine<00:03:33.859> over

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
getting into form all right cocaine over

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.839 
getting into form all right cocaine over
there<00:03:34.250> well<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.950> he's<00:03:37.160> talking<00:03:37.340> about<00:03:37.519> litter

there well so he's talking about litter

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.129 
there well so he's talking about litter
so<00:03:38.239> litter<00:03:38.450> could<00:03:38.660> be<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:38.780> problem

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
so litter could be a problem

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.199 
so litter could be a problem
now<00:03:39.410> she<00:03:39.470> mentioned<00:03:40.069> lead<00:03:40.310> now<00:03:40.609> lead<00:03:40.940> was<00:03:41.180> a

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.930 
now she mentioned lead now lead was a
was<00:03:41.569> a<00:03:41.599> concern<00:03:42.109> in<00:03:42.500> our<00:03:42.920> drinking<00:03:43.340> water<00:03:43.400> but

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
was a concern in our drinking water but

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.490 
was a concern in our drinking water but
this<00:03:44.150> is<00:03:44.359> not<00:03:44.569> the<00:03:44.750> same<00:03:44.900> as<00:03:45.079> our<00:03:45.200> drinking

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
this is not the same as our drinking

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.110 
this is not the same as our drinking
water<00:03:45.560> our<00:03:46.280> drinking<00:03:46.579> water<00:03:46.639> do<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:46.970> guys

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
water our drinking water do you guys

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.069 
water our drinking water do you guys
actually<00:03:47.299> know<00:03:47.450> where<00:03:47.630> your<00:03:47.750> drinking<00:03:48.049> water

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
actually know where your drinking water

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.670 
actually know where your drinking water
comes<00:03:48.470> from<00:03:48.620> when<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.040> turn<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.370> faucet<00:03:49.609> on

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
comes from when you turn the faucet on

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.809 
comes from when you turn the faucet on
which<00:03:51.680> stream<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.190> comes<00:03:52.370> from<00:03:52.489> it<00:03:52.609> doesn't

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
which stream it comes from it doesn't

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:53.979 
which stream it comes from it doesn't
come<00:03:52.910> from<00:03:52.940> four<00:03:53.239> mile<00:03:53.359> run<00:03:53.540> but<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:53.840> comes

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
come from four mile run but it comes

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.930 
come from four mile run but it comes
from<00:03:54.109> another<00:03:54.410> big<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:55.400> Potomac<00:03:55.910> River

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
from another big the Potomac River

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.970 
from another big the Potomac River
that's<00:03:56.359> right<00:03:56.599> a<00:03:56.630> 4<00:03:56.930> Mile<00:03:57.079> Run<00:03:57.260> flows<00:03:57.530> into<00:03:57.889> the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
that's right a 4 Mile Run flows into the

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.430 
that's right a 4 Mile Run flows into the
Potomac<00:03:58.220> River<00:03:58.660> so<00:03:59.660> what<00:03:59.810> other<00:03:59.989> kinds<00:04:00.349> of

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
Potomac River so what other kinds of

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.839 
Potomac River so what other kinds of
pollution<00:04:00.650> might<00:04:00.950> be<00:04:01.069> affecting<00:04:01.519> four<00:04:01.700> mile

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
pollution might be affecting four mile

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.849 
pollution might be affecting four mile
run<00:04:02.030> do<00:04:02.810> you<00:04:02.870> think<00:04:03.079> that<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.319> runoff<00:04:03.530> that

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
run do you think that the runoff that

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.409 
run do you think that the runoff that
comes<00:04:04.069> off<00:04:04.220> that<00:04:04.370> parking<00:04:04.730> lot<00:04:04.760> could<00:04:05.150> affect

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
comes off that parking lot could affect

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:06.699 
comes off that parking lot could affect
the<00:04:05.540> stream<00:04:05.810> do<00:04:06.049> you<00:04:06.139> think<00:04:06.290> that<00:04:06.410> that<00:04:06.530> would

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
the stream do you think that that would

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.640 
the stream do you think that that would
be<00:04:06.829> good<00:04:07.010> or<00:04:07.220> bad<00:04:07.340> or<00:04:07.700> if<00:04:08.690> Adam<00:04:09.049> what<00:04:09.410> things

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
be good or bad or if Adam what things

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.280 
be good or bad or if Adam what things
might<00:04:09.829> get<00:04:09.950> on<00:04:10.099> a<00:04:10.130> parking<00:04:10.549> lot<00:04:10.870> oil<00:04:11.870> and

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
might get on a parking lot oil and

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.080 
might get on a parking lot oil and
grease<00:04:12.829> and<00:04:12.889> how<00:04:13.190> about<00:04:13.340> just<00:04:13.549> all<00:04:13.639> the<00:04:13.819> water

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
grease and how about just all the water

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.060 
grease and how about just all the water
that<00:04:14.299> lands<00:04:14.660> on<00:04:14.840> there<00:04:15.079> is<00:04:15.290> going<00:04:15.739> to<00:04:15.799> flow

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
that lands on there is going to flow

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.740 
that lands on there is going to flow
into<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.400> stream<00:04:16.790> and<00:04:17.060> can<00:04:17.239> cause<00:04:17.419> erosion

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
into the stream and can cause erosion

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.930 
into the stream and can cause erosion
and<00:04:18.169> things<00:04:18.320> like<00:04:18.440> that<00:04:18.500> for<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:18.979> stream<00:04:19.220> so

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
and things like that for the stream so

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.699 
and things like that for the stream so
in<00:04:20.269> a<00:04:20.390> more<00:04:20.570> urban<00:04:20.690> area<00:04:21.080> like<00:04:21.110> Arlington

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
in a more urban area like Arlington

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:30.310 
in a more urban area like Arlington
there's<00:04:21.890> lots<00:04:22.070> we<00:04:22.190> have<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.400> think<00:04:22.610> about<00:04:29.320> you

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
there's lots we have to think about you

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.460 
there's lots we have to think about you

fertilize more lawns all of the
pollution<00:05:21.380> that<00:05:21.830> that's<00:05:22.430> generating<00:05:23.210> is

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
pollution that that's generating is

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.640 
pollution that that's generating is
going<00:05:24.020> into<00:05:24.260> our<00:05:24.710> streams<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.960> at<00:05:26.960> some<00:05:27.350> point

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
going into our streams and at some point

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.120 
going into our streams and at some point
it's<00:05:28.400> going<00:05:28.730> to<00:05:28.910> be<00:05:29.660> enough<00:05:30.020> from<00:05:30.710> all<00:05:30.919> that

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
it's going to be enough from all that

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.550 
it's going to be enough from all that
runoff<00:05:31.460> that<00:05:32.210> it's<00:05:32.450> going<00:05:32.630> to<00:05:32.690> stop<00:05:32.990> poisoning

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
runoff that it's going to stop poisoning

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.710 
runoff that it's going to stop poisoning
and<00:05:34.100> killing<00:05:34.550> life<00:05:34.730> and<00:05:35.000> streams<00:05:35.480> are<00:05:35.600> gonna

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
and killing life and streams are gonna

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.200 
and killing life and streams are gonna
be<00:05:35.930> dead<00:05:36.140> zones<00:05:36.440> this<00:05:37.100> water<00:05:37.430> isn't<00:05:37.730> fit<00:05:38.090> to
