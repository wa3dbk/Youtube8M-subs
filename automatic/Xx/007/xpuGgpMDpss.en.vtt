00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:11.340
 so today our bastard us is 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:15.059
 samsung galaxy s4 ai-95 its 0 it 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.970
 the original has never been with China 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.859
 the problem is that it does not show 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.230
 Charging more accurately show but pretty 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:28.560
 in the original way 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:41.300
 look we put in between charging and he 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:44.430
 show something something that's a thermometer and ! 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.379
 when we turn on our device he 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.590
 shows such an interesting phrase 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.629
 the battery is too cold 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.809
 battery charging is not possible too 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.600
 it's cold something like that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.270
 I will not show it what 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.180
 work has been done with this phone 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.260
 but naturally was replaceable system 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.970
 connector and replace us twice 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.970
 it did not bring sense and therefore 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.430
 community of people who are also involved 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.850
 cell phone repair shops and on the Internet 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.400
 but also 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.000
 advises that the system connector here is not 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.200
 the assistant here is most likely out of 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.509
 building a thermistor i basically this 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.960
 I didnâ€™t even look for a thermistor somewhere 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.960
 is and just decided what is better 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.369
 replace not look for this thermistors 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.189
 then look for it somewhere in the parts 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.450
 somewhere just this whole thing 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:58.820
 replace and I bought it cost she 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.600
 me only 250 rubles here and 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.790
 the client said that 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:11.860
 does not work on this device yet 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:14.590
 microphone and as the case may be 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.440
 modules together with the system connector 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.230
 microphone i mean i kill 1 regiments as 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.270
 time two birds with one stone 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.480
 We agreed with her on 1400 rubles 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.700
 There is basically a replacement for this one 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.150
 module 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:35.650
 gives me how much a fivefold increase 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:41.040
 my costs and so now on your 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:49.600
 I insert my eyes here this loop 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:55.480
 by disconnecting it so that not 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:59.410
 undermine and think that the microphone 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.810
 it works even the fortuneteller do not go but 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.989
 for the charger should now check and because 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:16.209
 what am I still not very sure about here 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:20.820
 if this thermistor is on here 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:24.359
 this module is it then we have a problem with you 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.359
 charging decided 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.930
 as you can see charging passes from we 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:38.360
 literally in 5 minutes made such 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.860
 expensive phone just changing 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.360
 one 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.739
 customer part brought me this 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.079
 the device is already once and with the same 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.480
 the problem itself unfortunately in the past 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.390
 since I didn't have enough mind 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.599
 Now replace the unit entirely, I started 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.370
 look for a thermistor understand what i need 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.840
 in parts about the same 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.180
 the phone has to find it 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.220
 thermistor tried to guess here 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.470
 This module is completely replaced by me 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:12.590
 why the head did not guess but 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.070
 now she guessed the client will 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.440
 very pleased because she had to 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:21.350
 here with this glitch charge the phone 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.720
 such an expensive phone to charge from 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:29.830
 frogs naturally this is very extremely not 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:35.990
 convenient, but now everything will be fine 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:41.539
 and so the phone has imposed a microphone think that 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:47.750
 also works and basically voila repair 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:50.510
 succeeded and so once again to make sure 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.599
 what charging goin and there is no 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:57.800
 reports that the battery is too 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:59.620
 cold then i want to check right in 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:06.169
 on state 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:11.990
 This phone and stick charging charge 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:12.830
 We see that the charge goes and no 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.970
 posts 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:22.150
 He does not give us what I dry and required 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.150
 prove we are not great fellows
