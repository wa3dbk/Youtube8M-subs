00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
pretty straight there so 64 for five at

this<00:01:36.510> the<00:01:36.690> big<00:01:36.900> wicket<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.410> a<00:01:37.470> beauty

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
this the big wicket this is a beauty

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.230 
this the big wicket this is a beauty
yeah<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.160> thought<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.520> was<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.760> corner<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> day

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
yeah I thought this was the corner a day

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.940 
yeah I thought this was the corner a day
because<00:01:39.450> shoves<00:01:39.810> come<00:01:40.230> wider<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.710> crease

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
because shoves come wider the crease

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.890 
because shoves come wider the crease
very<00:01:41.430> cleverly<00:01:41.850> angled<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> ball<00:01:42.510> in<00:01:42.690> I<00:01:42.840> think

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
very cleverly angled to ball in I think

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.600 
very cleverly angled to ball in I think
it<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.260> straightened<00:01:43.680> good<00:01:44.040> length<00:01:44.250> Calais

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
it just straightened good length Calais

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.760 
it just straightened good length Calais

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
yeah absolutely and I think that for the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.070 
yeah absolutely and I think that for the
two<00:03:07.250> openers<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:08.150> way<00:03:08.300> they<00:03:08.450> went<00:03:08.630> about<00:03:08.780> the

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
two openers the way they went about the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.750 
two openers the way they went about the
first<00:03:09.320> session<00:03:09.770> in<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.070> first<00:03:10.280> Test<00:03:10.580> match

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
first session in the first Test match

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.280 
first session in the first Test match
that<00:03:11.090> was<00:03:11.210> a<00:03:11.240> tough<00:03:11.510> session<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.990> book<00:03:12.140> new

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
that was a tough session the book new

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.570 
that was a tough session the book new
ball<00:03:12.470> moved<00:03:12.710> around<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:13.100> lot<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.430> thought

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
ball moved around a lot and I thought

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.970 
ball moved around a lot and I thought
they<00:03:13.760> showed<00:03:14.000> very<00:03:14.540> good<00:03:14.750> application<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:15.530> I

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
they showed very good application and I

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.770 
they showed very good application and I
think<00:03:16.220> it's<00:03:16.550> more<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.910> same<00:03:17.120> here<00:03:17.420> although

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
think it's more the same here although

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.180 
think it's more the same here although
it's<00:03:18.020> a<00:03:18.080> different<00:03:18.380> pitch<00:03:18.590> they've<00:03:18.980> got<00:03:19.130> the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
it's a different pitch they've got the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.100 
it's a different pitch they've got the
pace<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.580> bounce<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:20.000> Centurion<00:03:20.510> they'll

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
pace and bounce of Centurion they'll

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
pace and bounce of Centurion they'll
still<00:03:21.380> want<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.739> take<00:03:22.730> their<00:03:22.910> time
