00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.370 
what you'll do is make your pins gently
angle<00:02:01.439> in<00:02:01.590> from<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.950> natural<00:02:02.460> line<00:02:02.930> of<00:02:03.930> your

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
angle in from the natural line of your

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.590 
angle in from the natural line of your
sewing<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.979> then<00:02:05.640> take<00:02:05.880> them<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> usually

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
sewing and then take them in I usually

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660 
sewing and then take them in I usually
pin<00:02:07.020> every<00:02:07.350> couple<00:02:07.680> inches<00:02:08.099> once<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.489> determine

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
pin every couple inches once I determine

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.140 
pin every couple inches once I determine
how<00:02:09.209> much<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.869> want<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.289> take<00:02:10.470> them<00:02:10.649> in

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
how much I want to take them in

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.960 
how much I want to take them in
and<00:02:12.140> then<00:02:12.440> what<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.709> can<00:02:12.920> do<00:02:13.129> whether<00:02:13.700> they're

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
and then what you can do whether they're

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.910 
and then what you can do whether they're
inside<00:02:14.150> out<00:02:14.659> or<00:02:15.200> right-side<00:02:15.709> out<00:02:15.739> is<00:02:16.159> I<00:02:17.000> take

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
inside out or right-side out is I take

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.289 
inside out or right-side out is I take
you<00:02:18.920> have<00:02:19.069> to<00:02:19.190> turn<00:02:19.370> them<00:02:19.519> inside<00:02:19.640> out<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:20.120> sew

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
you have to turn them inside out to sew

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.600 
you have to turn them inside out to sew
them<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.379> if<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.709> don't<00:02:22.159> know<00:02:22.310> where<00:02:22.459> my

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
them and so if I don't know where my

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.729 
them and so if I don't know where my
line<00:02:22.849> is<00:02:23.060> going<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.269> be<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:23.720> take<00:02:24.319> a<00:02:24.379> piece<00:02:24.709> of

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
line is going to be I take a piece of

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.180 
line is going to be I take a piece of
chalk<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.209> can<00:02:27.019> go<00:02:27.170> right<00:02:27.409> over<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.860> pins

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
chalk and you can go right over the pins

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.089 
chalk and you can go right over the pins
with<00:02:28.519> that<00:02:28.640> piece<00:02:28.849> of<00:02:29.030> chalk<00:02:29.299> and<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:30.650> helps<00:02:30.950> to

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
with that piece of chalk and it helps to

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.819 
with that piece of chalk and it helps to
make<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.280> nice<00:02:31.930> dark<00:02:32.930> line<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.650> can<00:02:33.799> use

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
make a nice dark line you can use

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.670 
make a nice dark line you can use
contrasting<00:02:34.670> colors<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.379> when<00:02:36.530> you

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
contrasting colors so that when you

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.009 
contrasting colors so that when you
start<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.489> take<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.849> pins<00:02:38.090> out<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:38.780> turn

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
start you take the pins out and you turn

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.619 
start you take the pins out and you turn
them<00:02:39.260> inside<00:02:39.440> out<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.640> can<00:02:40.849> use<00:02:41.090> those<00:02:41.360> lines

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
them inside out you can use those lines

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.970 
them inside out you can use those lines
by<00:02:44.629> again<00:02:44.900> pinching<00:02:45.349> them<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.650> where<00:02:45.799> that

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
by again pinching them to where that

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.030 
by again pinching them to where that
line<00:02:46.280> chalk<00:02:46.640> line<00:02:46.879> is<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.859> then<00:02:48.859> you<00:02:49.010> can

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
line chalk line is and then you can

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.390 
line chalk line is and then you can
repin<00:02:49.640> on<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:50.090> inside<00:02:50.799> where<00:02:51.799> that<00:02:51.950> line<00:02:52.190> is

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
repin on the inside where that line is

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.190 
repin on the inside where that line is
and<00:02:52.549> you<00:02:52.640> can<00:02:52.790> check<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.239> by<00:02:53.390> finding<00:02:54.049> out

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
and you can check it by finding out

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.280 
and you can check it by finding out
where<00:02:54.440> your<00:02:54.560> chalk<00:02:54.799> line<00:02:54.829> is<00:02:55.310> on<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.700> outside

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
where your chalk line is on the outside

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.660 
where your chalk line is on the outside
now<00:02:57.290> if<00:02:57.379> you're<00:02:57.470> going<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.650> put<00:02:58.430> them<00:02:58.549> on

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
now if you're going to put them on

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.720 
now if you're going to put them on
inside<00:02:59.120> out<00:02:59.299> and<00:02:59.510> then<00:02:59.659> pin<00:02:59.930> them<00:03:00.049> along<00:03:00.349> your

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
inside out and then pin them along your

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.210 
inside out and then pin them along your
your<00:03:01.730> seam<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:02.959> may<00:03:03.049> need<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.349> make<00:03:03.530> sure<00:03:03.560> that

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
your seam you may need to make sure that

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.339 
your seam you may need to make sure that
you<00:03:05.030> have<00:03:05.299> if<00:03:05.659> you<00:03:05.750> have<00:03:05.840> one<00:03:06.049> leg<00:03:06.319> that's

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
you have if you have one leg that's

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.229 
you have if you have one leg that's
fuller<00:03:06.829> than<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.190> other<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.730> make<00:03:07.879> sure<00:03:08.060> that

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
fuller than the other and make sure that

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.479 
fuller than the other and make sure that
you<00:03:08.420> allow<00:03:08.720> for<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.049> fullness<00:03:09.290> on<00:03:10.250> the

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
you allow for the fullness on the

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.640 
you allow for the fullness on the
opposite<00:03:11.090> side<00:03:11.359> if<00:03:11.599> it's<00:03:11.750> inside<00:03:12.140> out<00:03:12.319> because

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
opposite side if it's inside out because

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.349 
opposite side if it's inside out because
once<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.129> put<00:03:13.579> them<00:03:13.730> on<00:03:13.849> right-side<00:03:14.329> out

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
once you put them on right-side out

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.890 
once you put them on right-side out
it'll<00:03:14.780> flip<00:03:15.109> to<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.319> other<00:03:15.530> side<00:03:15.859> and<00:03:16.900> fit

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
it'll flip to the other side and fit

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.520 
it'll flip to the other side and fit
differently

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
differently

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.460 
differently
now<00:03:18.950> when<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.310> get<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:23.709> fold<00:03:24.709> line<00:03:24.859> and

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
now when you get to the fold line and

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.349 
now when you get to the fold line and
you<00:03:27.470> work<00:03:27.650> all<00:03:27.919> the<00:03:28.040> way<00:03:28.160> down<00:03:28.430> or<00:03:28.819> even<00:03:29.090> just

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
you work all the way down or even just

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.050 
you work all the way down or even just
partially<00:03:29.930> down<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.650> leg<00:03:30.849> depending<00:03:31.849> if<00:03:31.940> you

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
partially down the leg depending if you

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.580 
partially down the leg depending if you
want<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.299> just<00:03:32.450> narrow<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.139> then<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:33.290> want<00:03:33.500> to

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
want it just narrow and then you want to

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.170 
want it just narrow and then you want to
make<00:03:33.709> them<00:03:33.859> into<00:03:33.980> bells<00:03:34.310> you<00:03:34.609> can<00:03:34.790> do<00:03:34.940> that

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
make them into bells you can do that

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.390 
make them into bells you can do that
just<00:03:36.169> want<00:03:36.349> to<00:03:36.440> make<00:03:36.560> sure<00:03:36.799> that<00:03:37.010> if<00:03:37.220> you're

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
just want to make sure that if you're

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.039 
just want to make sure that if you're
coming<00:03:38.209> off<00:03:38.629> the<00:03:39.620> edge<00:03:39.769> of<00:03:40.129> the<00:03:40.730> pant<00:03:40.970> leg<00:03:41.299> that

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
coming off the edge of the pant leg that

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.729 
coming off the edge of the pant leg that
you<00:03:42.199> do<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:43.449> reverse<00:03:44.449> stitch<00:03:44.780> to<00:03:45.290> lock<00:03:45.500> that

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
you do a reverse stitch to lock that

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.550 
you do a reverse stitch to lock that
stitch<00:03:46.040> into<00:03:46.250> place<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:47.750> doesn't<00:03:47.870> open<00:03:48.260> up

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
stitch into place so it doesn't open up

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.479 
stitch into place so it doesn't open up
and<00:03:49.209> that's<00:03:50.209> how<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:50.599> take<00:03:51.049> in<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.590> pair<00:03:52.459> of

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
and that's how you take in a pair of

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.879 
and that's how you take in a pair of
jeans<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.910> get<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:53.299> perfect<00:03:53.750> fit<00:03:53.889> usually

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
jeans to get that perfect fit usually

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.270 
jeans to get that perfect fit usually
you<00:03:55.010> only<00:03:55.160> need<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:55.639> take<00:03:55.849> in<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.090> outside<00:03:57.280> and

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
you only need to take in the outside and

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.080 
you only need to take in the outside and
if<00:03:58.879> there's<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.180> double<00:03:59.389> stitch<00:03:59.840> seam<00:04:01.090> it's

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
if there's a double stitch seam it's

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.030 
if there's a double stitch seam it's
usually<00:04:02.359> on<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.840> inside<00:04:03.260> leg<00:04:03.500> because<00:04:03.889> they

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
usually on the inside leg because they

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.589 
usually on the inside leg because they
usually<00:04:04.220> allow<00:04:04.819> that<00:04:05.090> you're<00:04:05.209> going<00:04:05.329> to<00:04:05.359> take

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
usually allow that you're going to take

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.539 
usually allow that you're going to take
the<00:04:05.750> seam<00:04:05.989> in<00:04:06.199> on<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.620> outside<00:04:06.769> so<00:04:07.370> it's

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
the seam in on the outside so it's

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.550 
the seam in on the outside so it's
simpler<00:04:07.910> than<00:04:08.209> having<00:04:08.599> to<00:04:08.690> undo<00:04:09.049> this<00:04:09.199> double

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
simpler than having to undo this double

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.240 
simpler than having to undo this double
stitching<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:11.290> that's<00:04:12.290> how<00:04:12.410> you<00:04:12.470> get<00:04:13.220> a

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
stitching and that's how you get a

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.629 
stitching and that's how you get a
perfect<00:04:13.730> fit<00:04:13.760> on<00:04:14.209> your<00:04:14.389> jeans
