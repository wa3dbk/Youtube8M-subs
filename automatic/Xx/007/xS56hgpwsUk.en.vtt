00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
did you know that a simple amino acid

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.760 
did you know that a simple amino acid
derivative<00:01:10.479> called<00:01:10.630> Sammy<00:01:10.960> is<00:01:11.200> synthesized

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
derivative called Sammy is synthesized

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.620 
derivative called Sammy is synthesized
in<00:01:11.979> your<00:01:12.189> body<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:12.609> concentrated<00:01:13.420> in<00:01:13.509> your

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
in your body and concentrated in your

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.660 
in your body and concentrated in your
brain<00:01:13.929> and<00:01:14.079> liver<00:01:14.289> Sammy<00:01:15.100> stands<00:01:15.460> for

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
brain and liver Sammy stands for

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.029 
brain and liver Sammy stands for
s-adenosylmethionine<00:01:16.479> and<00:01:17.439> it<00:01:17.740> works

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
s-adenosylmethionine and it works

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.249 
s-adenosylmethionine and it works
because<00:01:18.310> it<00:01:18.520> boosts<00:01:18.880> our<00:01:19.090> master<00:01:19.869> antioxidant

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
because it boosts our master antioxidant

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.499 
because it boosts our master antioxidant
called<00:01:20.860> glutathione<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.850> that's<00:01:22.179> a<00:01:22.299> good

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
called glutathione and that's a good

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.600 
called glutathione and that's a good
thing<00:01:22.569> because<00:01:22.990> glutathione<00:01:23.799> creates<00:01:24.189> more

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
thing because glutathione creates more

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.399 
thing because glutathione creates more
pain<00:01:24.969> relieving<00:01:25.299> compounds<00:01:25.959> in<00:01:26.049> our<00:01:26.170> body

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
pain relieving compounds in our body

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.580 
pain relieving compounds in our body
think<00:01:27.189> arthritis<00:01:27.939> it<00:01:28.509> also<00:01:28.780> helps<00:01:29.229> enhance

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
think arthritis it also helps enhance

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.039 
think arthritis it also helps enhance
and<00:01:29.950> maintain<00:01:30.670> cognitive<00:01:31.359> function<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.020> that
