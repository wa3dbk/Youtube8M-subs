00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
and a couple people might even subscribe

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.620 
and a couple people might even subscribe
to<00:01:55.860> me<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.460> make<00:01:56.729> videos<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.450> may

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
to me if you make videos you may

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.840 
to me if you make videos you may
understand<00:01:58.290> how<00:01:58.500> long<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.010> takes<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.430> get<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
understand how long it takes to get a

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.649 
understand how long it takes to get a
good<00:02:00.330> subscriber<00:02:00.930> base<00:02:01.200> which<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.740> am<00:02:01.890> slowly

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
good subscriber base which I am slowly

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.289 
good subscriber base which I am slowly
accumulating<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.049> if<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.460> realize<00:02:05.460> how<00:02:06.119> much

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
accumulating and if you realize how much

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.119 
accumulating and if you realize how much
time<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.780> takes<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.170> how<00:02:07.320> difficult<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.069> to

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
time it takes and how difficult it is to

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.420 
time it takes and how difficult it is to
produce<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:09.149> one<00:02:09.269> video<00:02:10.140> then<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.129> maybe

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
produce just one video then you maybe

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.059 
produce just one video then you maybe
you<00:02:11.670> get<00:02:12.000> why<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.420> always<00:02:12.900> say<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.590> lot<00:02:13.890> of

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
you get why I always say that a lot of

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.180 
you get why I always say that a lot of
times<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.400> pre-fill<00:02:14.849> my<00:02:15.000> videos<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.390> few<00:02:15.900> days

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
times I pre-fill my videos a few days

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.940 
times I pre-fill my videos a few days
advanced<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:17.540> if<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.140> were<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.380> reach<00:02:18.650> a

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
advanced so if I were to reach a

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.240 
advanced so if I were to reach a
milestone<00:02:19.160> say<00:02:19.970> 700<00:02:20.750> subscribers<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.860> could

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
milestone say 700 subscribers it could

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.310 
milestone say 700 subscribers it could
be<00:02:22.370> anywhere<00:02:22.760> from<00:02:23.030> two<00:02:23.600> days<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.260> week

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
be anywhere from two days to a week

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.830 
be anywhere from two days to a week
later<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.190> video<00:02:25.460> goes<00:02:25.760> up<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:26.660> by<00:02:26.780> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
later that the video goes up so by the
