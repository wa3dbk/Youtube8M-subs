00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
third person present shooters and real

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.469 
third person present shooters and real
thinking's<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.659> such<00:02:03.960> because<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:05.070> know<00:02:05.479> it

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
skips when you turn around and such

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.270 
skips when you turn around and such

also and you never knew exactly what it
would<00:02:39.760> do<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.180> it's<00:02:40.870> sometimes<00:02:41.050> skip<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.739> lid

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
would do and it's sometimes skip the lid

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
annoys me is that the mouse buttons

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.800 
annoys me is that the mouse buttons
don't<00:03:13.030> really<00:03:13.920> well<00:03:14.920> they<00:03:15.100> don't<00:03:15.280> have<00:03:15.519> the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
don't really well they don't have the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.720 
don't really well they don't have the
feel<00:03:16.810> that<00:03:16.840> she<00:03:17.200> would<00:03:17.320> expect<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.549> right

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
feel that she would expect and the right

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.229 
feel that she would expect and the right
button<00:03:19.030> it's<00:03:19.750> way<00:03:19.930> too<00:03:19.989> easy<00:03:20.320> to<00:03:20.440> press<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:21.239> by

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
button it's way too easy to press you by

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.690 
button it's way too easy to press you by
accident<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.750> press<00:03:22.989> it<00:03:23.110> all<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.230> time<00:03:23.560> just<00:03:23.829> by

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
accident I press it all the time just by

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.009 
accident I press it all the time just by
relaxing<00:03:24.910> my<00:03:25.360> finger<00:03:25.690> on<00:03:25.720> it

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
relaxing my finger on it

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.180 
relaxing my finger on it
and<00:03:26.230> that's<00:03:26.560> quite<00:03:27.010> annoying<00:03:27.660> especially<00:03:29.190> in

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
and that's quite annoying especially in

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.340 
and that's quite annoying especially in
some<00:03:30.459> games<00:03:30.700> where<00:03:31.000> perhaps<00:03:31.390> this<00:03:31.690> button<00:03:32.200> is

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
some games where perhaps this button is

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.979 
some games where perhaps this button is
is<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:35.290> know<00:03:35.320> bound<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.790> menu<00:03:37.209> or<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.750> some

is you know bound to a a menu or of some

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.259 
is you know bound to a a menu or of some
sort<00:03:38.260> or<00:03:38.440> something<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:39.700> accidentally

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
sort or something and you accidentally

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.050 
sort or something and you accidentally
press<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.260> up<00:03:41.440> all<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.709> time

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
press that up all the time

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.800 
press that up all the time
meanwhile<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.109> left<00:03:44.530> button<00:03:44.890> is<00:03:45.070> a<00:03:45.970> bit<00:03:46.420> slow

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
meanwhile the left button is a bit slow

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.810 
meanwhile the left button is a bit slow
or<00:03:48.690> well<00:03:49.690> it's<00:03:50.079> not<00:03:50.260> as<00:03:50.440> easy<00:03:50.709> to<00:03:51.160> press<00:03:51.359> and

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
or well it's not as easy to press and

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.250 
or well it's not as easy to press and
for<00:03:54.820> example<00:03:55.180> if<00:03:55.299> I<00:03:55.390> try<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.690> shoot<00:03:55.989> really

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
for example if I try to shoot really

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.229 
for example if I try to shoot really
fast<00:03:56.500> for<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:57.280> pistol<00:03:57.640> or<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:58.150> know

fast for the pistol or you know
something<00:03:58.720> in<00:03:59.079> a<00:03:59.140> game<00:03:59.320> you<00:04:00.239> definitely<00:04:01.239> feel

something in a game you definitely feel
that<00:04:01.510> it's<00:04:01.870> oh<00:04:02.140> it's<00:04:02.700> not<00:04:03.700> really<00:04:04.090> possible<00:04:04.299> to

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
that it's oh it's not really possible to
