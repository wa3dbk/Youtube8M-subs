Sunday<00:00:07.680> I<00:00:07.890> have<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> box<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:09.380> the<00:00:10.380> new<00:00:10.559> stuff

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.950 
Sunday I have a box of the new stuff
12-13<00:00:12.139> score<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.610> just<00:00:14.610> went<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.849> target<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.389> I

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
12-13 score I just went to target and I

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.349 
12-13 score I just went to target and I
found<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.590> bunch<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:17.010> these<00:00:17.160> at<00:00:17.490> target<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.300> I

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
found a bunch of these at target so I

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.760 
found a bunch of these at target so I
guess<00:00:18.510> they<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:18.660> restocked<00:00:19.230> them<00:00:19.410> and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
guess they just restocked them and

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.529 
guess they just restocked them and
actually<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:21.060> don't<00:00:21.240> know<00:00:21.300> if<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.420> can<00:00:21.480> notice

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
actually I don't know if you can notice

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.830 
actually I don't know if you can notice
but<00:00:21.840> these<00:00:22.050> are<00:00:22.199> actually<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> lot<00:00:22.769> smaller

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
but these are actually a lot smaller

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.400 
but these are actually a lot smaller
than<00:00:25.160> what<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> usual<00:00:26.779> blaster<00:00:27.779> box<00:00:28.019> usually

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
than what a usual blaster box usually

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.650 
than what a usual blaster box usually
looks<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.490> think<00:00:30.029> they're<00:00:30.150> shrinking<00:00:30.510> in

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
looks like I think they're shrinking in

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.580 
looks like I think they're shrinking in
size<00:00:30.689> both<00:00:31.619> panini<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.399> tops<00:00:33.320> blasters<00:00:34.320> were

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
size both panini and tops blasters were

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.650 
size both panini and tops blasters were
about<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.190> size<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.000> lot<00:00:36.149> smaller<00:00:36.300> of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
about this size so it's a lot smaller of

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.310 
about this size so it's a lot smaller of
a<00:00:36.750> size<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.610> do<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.270> think<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.960> saves<00:00:40.200> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
a size I do like it I think it saves a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.860 
a size I do like it I think it saves a
lot<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.850> paper<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.450> you're<00:00:42.570> into<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
lot of paper so if you're into the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.990 
lot of paper so if you're into the
environment<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.530> all<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.399> good<00:00:44.550> stuff<00:00:44.610> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
environment and all that good stuff I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.600 
environment and all that good stuff I
think<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.989> good<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.190> good<00:00:47.219> way<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.430> go

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
think it's a good it's a good way to go

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.029 
think it's a good it's a good way to go
so<00:00:48.329> let's<00:00:48.360> go<00:00:48.629> ahead<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.809> open<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.950> know

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
so let's go ahead and open it you know

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.799 
so let's go ahead and open it you know
when<00:00:50.160> i<00:00:50.190> reviewed<00:00:50.399> score<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.120> wasn't<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.600> huge

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
when i reviewed score I wasn't a huge

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.260

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
excited about breaking it maybe it's

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.580 
excited about breaking it maybe it's
because<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.270> rookies<00:00:57.600> aren't<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.440> great
