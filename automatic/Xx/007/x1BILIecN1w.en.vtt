00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.850
 I clearly bought the little monkeys 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.880
 film with no film combo me 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.670
 they found the soda and honesty 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.220
 first of all 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.600
 I expected a lot in this movie to 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.920
 principle when I went to lara giácomo that 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.320
 lower expectations for not 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.599
 disappoint meo about deluding mind 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.939
 anything then I started to see it 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.470
 is everything and I expected the valhalla to 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.140
 open that all light as you know that 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.750
 it's a great movie and in the end like that 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.080
 did not finish meeting at a point it 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.770
 created too simple and that's what 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.770
 let's talk here 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.650
 I will not tell you anything of such history 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.180
 what because the story needs that 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.890
 experience from the beginning what 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.690
 is happening so you can understand it 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.300
 so whatever I say to you then no 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.600
 it's going to work a lot more I can comment 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.720
 that is a girl called ayleen our 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.850
 protagonist who is suffering a 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.270
 move and all the emotions that she 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.890
 lives while it is changing as the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.440
 house not the house that I expected 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.970
 I lose to his friends all his hobbies 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.460
 like they have to change that is not 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.590
 in the same place so it's a process 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.119
 gigantic mental that has to happen to me 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.700
 I identify a little with that girl because 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.350
 I also went through the fact of having 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.330
 to move so I do understand how 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.000
 It can be extremely complicated to 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.119
 11 years old she suffers a lot of this 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.180
 He does not know what to do and joy and sadness 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.149
 they get into a problem and they're going to have 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.460
 to cope with anger, disgust and fear 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.770
 to be able to keep this line centered 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.259
 the best possible while experiencing 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.470
 all these changes not only emotional 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.550
 but also in his memories because 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.920
 they do not mean what he remembers 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.020
 of what they meant before and this is 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.300
 something very interesting because the movie 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.490
 if it speaks of as an emotion and a 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.250
 I remember you have in today in the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.470
 present that makes you happy inside 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.869
 a few months is a few years can remove the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.730
 sad and that's what really 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.950
 liked the movie how it was with that 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.980
 concept for example we have all had 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.020
 a friend very close to a couple who 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.850
 we want and that while we are in that 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.030
 couple friendship relationship whatever 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.530
 like the memories we live in 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.090
 our mind while we are not with 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.160
 they are very pretty they are very happy 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.040
 but when you finish your relationship 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.760
 partner or you can not see that friend anymore 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.720
 X or E and reason advance the time and 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.580
 remember those things that make you 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.860
 so happy but it makes you feel sad 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.480
 You must feel how beautiful 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.270
 I have memories with that person but that 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.780
 person is no longer here soon those 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.670
 who experienced the death of someone not 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.130
 with that person or anything or 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.680
 you miss those sensations that are you 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.599
 feel good but we know that I no longer 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.760
 we will be able to have you know that he left 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.880
 so instead of being a really 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.340
 feeling that makes you happy and more 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.200
 great the feeling at the beginning of 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.050
 transforms demo of sadness change 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.209
 like and that's the most important thing 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.700
 movie intensely plays very well with 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.680
 that and the truth is that I loved that 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.599
 concept of it although it has enough 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.470
 problems on other issues now the 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:25.420
 I liked the movie a lot but it was 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.670
 quite predictable everything you think 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.470
 what's going to happen happens and there's a problem 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.269
 that I had with the movie in which I 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.430
 sometimes it was more real and the 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.019
 protagonist of the real world that the 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.330
 emotions of the inner world because of 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.640
 moment did not get too boring 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.959
 I've read pitt seems to lose or 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.819
 navillas then when I had the 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.739
 endless director without like the 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.049
 know is how you are used to 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.630
 fantastic worlds so good then 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.250
 you must intensely ethical is like no 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.920
 they explode the mind and how could 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.720
 exported do not reach level 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.430
 and that is my main complaint with the 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.200
 movie they had a great idea 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.460
 they wanted to develop it very well 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.440
 you even note why I got into 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.540
 concepts like the subconscious got 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.370
 memory got the memories and the 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.470
 emotions got a lot of things 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.540
 even as you forget them as you forget 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.579
 your own memories 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:18.070
 in short, intensely failed 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:20.590
 with his intention to challenge the public 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.600
 adult entertained the child very well 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.950
 made it out of fishing like that is that 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.810
 what I eat 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.790
 but the adult public just gave it 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.280
 a 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.500
 interesting perspective of the mind is 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.240
 some concepts that did not know about that 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.770
 if you pay attention and you do not know almost 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.210
 psychology we're going to have your class that 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.430
 that is meters from the movie and you're going to 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.650
 entertain a lot but outside of that is 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.860
 a movie to pass the time I liked it 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.810
 much interpret it 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.270
 I like the idea that he created something 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.979
 so that they come to say go because 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.750
 they are trying to do something new though 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.520
 the formula of always on proposal to the 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.990
 less are already trying it now the 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.110
 rating system of this channel 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.270
 will be up to 8 is not going to be one and that's 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.099
 15 will be from 1 to 8 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.319
 for obvious reasons because then close to 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.020
 the 8 classrooms will then be of the number 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:12.270
 8 and taking into account the qualification 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:14.009
 that I give to intensely is a 5.5 the 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.629
 movie was very well accomplished speaks in 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.710
 animation you know it's good has a 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.979
 lots of colors which also 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.710
 it works but I can not stop thinking 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.900
 the creator or writer who 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.990
 created the original idea of ​​this they had in 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.520
 mind something much higher 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.280
 the production of said how do you know that 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.740
 lower the low of your boxes we are going to 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.330
 make it easier no more digestible and 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.820
 Well, that's something that does not seem very 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.230
 Well, the day because they are 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.150
 finishing the ideas 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.650
 are doing remakes be words and 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.210
 we need to deal with newer 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.009
 we need to risk we have something left 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.990
 new especially in the cinema highlight 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.490
 and even though it 's a great movie yet 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.379
 when I see quite a few teachings 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.509
 for children and for adults one that 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:57.189
 amplifies another basics as 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.499
 intensely is a movie for 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:02.080
 enjoy is worth the ticket 

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:03.339
 of the cinema will be recommended if you buy one 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.440
 of the pretty ones if you want is not so 

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:08.480
 pretty so simple is not so pretty 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.220
 and when 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.960
 if you liked the video of the little hand up 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.120
 you share it with your friends so that 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.430
 can be more easily subscribe 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.560
 I'm going to be taking out I think two videos 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.390
 of the week wanting if one 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.470
 can when he wants no but he is 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.470
 bastard to that between us 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.180
 the pressure is forgetting that mother but 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.180
 human 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.169
 this is the car of the channel I'm just going to go 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.129
 completely direct I'm serious and 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:40.550
 go well think and question everything for 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:42.740
 that nobody has to tell them anything 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:46.330
 a pleasure to be here you liked me 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.330
 video until the next edition
