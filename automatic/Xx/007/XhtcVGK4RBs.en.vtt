00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.690
 stupefied with the amount of things that 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.610
 they are made when I am not 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.250
 love that personality and that 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.490
 structure was always present in 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:21.529
 the program me for example 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:27.189
 because I'm looking at my state a lot 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.189
 I have seen nothing yet 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:45.620
 I'm better prepared 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:49.579
 the last last minute that moves 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.579
 everything as it is 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.110
 this event is an Argentine rhythm how 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.110
 is called 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.280
 so 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:34.740
 the party of videos of everything up to the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:47.000
 Minions with little clothes today 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:52.039

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.149

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.149
 look, I do not know if it works out so well 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.340
 yes 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.010
 identify and change 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.450

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.120
 [Music]

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.400
 the berries miranda 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:45.510

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.510
 [Music] 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.570
 [Music] 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.010
 at the time 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.900
 to return 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:16.360
 I am a very elegant movement for the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.360
 dance 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.760
 so nobody can a peek 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.030

 but notice that I'm practicing 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:25.290
 but the important thing is that women 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.960
 [Music] 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.020

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.309
 at the same time 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.010
