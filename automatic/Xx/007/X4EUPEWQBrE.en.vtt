solar<00:00:39.000> eclipse<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.600> solar<00:00:40.079> eclipse<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.680> similar

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
solar eclipse a solar eclipse is similar

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.250 
solar eclipse a solar eclipse is similar
to<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.579> goblin<00:00:42.000> invasion<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:42.720> it's<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.020> lot

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
to the goblin invasion but it's a lot

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.470 
to the goblin invasion but it's a lot
tougher<00:00:43.530> than<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.190> goblin<00:00:44.550> invasion<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.420> you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
tougher than the goblin invasion so you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.260 
tougher than the goblin invasion so you
might<00:00:45.960> need<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> lot<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.710> armor<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.059> has<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
might need a lot of armor but it has a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.569 
might need a lot of armor but it has a
roud<00:00:48.600> drop<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.170> dropping<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.800> broken<00:00:50.399> hero

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
roud drop of dropping the broken hero

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.670 
roud drop of dropping the broken hero
sword<00:00:50.910> which<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.210> used<00:00:51.630> to<00:00:51.750> make<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.469> true

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
sword which is used to make the true

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.770 
sword which is used to make the true
excalibur<00:00:53.309> or<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.850> true<00:00:54.090> Knights<00:00:54.360> edge<00:00:54.600> if

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
excalibur or the true Knights edge if

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.209 
excalibur or the true Knights edge if
combined<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.410> both<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.770> those<00:00:55.890> items

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
combined with both of those items

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.639 
combined with both of those items
however<00:00:56.850> finally<00:00:57.630> true<00:00:57.809> Excalibur<00:00:58.320> might<00:00:58.500> be

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
however finally true Excalibur might be

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.350 
however finally true Excalibur might be
better<00:00:58.860> than<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.280> Excalibur<00:00:59.850> since<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.239> a

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
better than the Excalibur since it's a

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.729 
better than the Excalibur since it's a
really<00:01:00.600> good<00:01:00.750> upgrade<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.320> does<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> lot

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
really good upgrade and it does a lot

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.709 
really good upgrade and it does a lot
more<00:01:01.800> damage<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.670> also<00:01:02.820> has<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> projectile

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
more damage and it also has a projectile

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.969 
more damage and it also has a projectile
that<00:01:03.780> shoots<00:01:04.140> out<00:01:04.259> from<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> sword<00:01:04.769> every

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
that shoots out from the sword every

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.679 
that shoots out from the sword every
time<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.249> click<00:01:05.429> it<00:01:05.609> it<00:01:05.759> also<00:01:06.060> has<00:01:06.209> its<00:01:06.600> own

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
time you click it it also has its own

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.199 
time you click it it also has its own
cons<00:01:07.020> one<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.679> main<00:01:07.889> cons<00:01:08.130> being<00:01:08.429> that<00:01:08.700> you

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:09.209 
cons one of the main cons being that you

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:10.819 
cons one of the main cons being that you
need<00:01:09.389> to<00:01:09.539> actually<00:01:09.719> click<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.289> sword<00:01:10.530> every

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
need to actually click the sword every

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.139 
need to actually click the sword every
time<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.130> want<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.399> use<00:01:11.579> it<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.819> you<00:01:11.939> every

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
time you want to use it on you every

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.669 
time you want to use it on you every
time<00:01:12.179> you<00:01:12.420> want<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.630> use<00:01:12.749> the<00:01:12.869> projectile<00:01:13.409> so

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:13.679 
time you want to use the projectile so

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:15.379 
time you want to use the projectile so
it's<00:01:14.130> not<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.579> the<00:01:14.729> Excalibur<00:01:15.119> where<00:01:15.299> you

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:15.389 
it's not like the Excalibur where you

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:17.029 
it's not like the Excalibur where you
can<00:01:15.539> just<00:01:15.689> hold<00:01:15.840> down<00:01:16.170> your<00:01:16.200> mouse<00:01:16.590> key<00:01:16.859> and

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
can just hold down your mouse key and

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.219 
can just hold down your mouse key and
expect<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.639> sword<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.029> be<00:01:18.149> at<00:01:18.389> use<00:01:18.719> on<00:01:18.899> all<00:01:19.079> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
expect the sword to be at use on all the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.959 
expect the sword to be at use on all the
time<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.590> clear<00:01:19.770> bosses<00:01:20.219> that<00:01:20.369> way<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.819> it

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
time and clear bosses that way so it

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:22.550 
time and clear bosses that way so it
might<00:01:21.090> actually<00:01:21.299> not<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:21.840> well<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> con

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
might actually not as well be a con

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.559 
might actually not as well be a con
itself<00:01:22.950> if<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.399> to<00:01:23.579> actually<00:01:23.999> use<00:01:24.450> your

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
itself if you like to actually use your

itself if you like to actually use your
sword<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.959> fight<00:01:25.200> instead<00:01:25.469> of<00:01:25.619> spamming<00:01:26.039> your

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:30.889 
sword and clearing mobs that way but
either<00:01:29.189> ways<00:01:29.459> it<00:01:29.849> is<00:01:29.999> a<00:01:30.029> good<00:01:30.209> upgrade<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.569> think

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
either ways it is a good upgrade I think

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.269 
either ways it is a good upgrade I think
it's<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.049> good<00:01:31.170> weapon<00:01:31.289> but<00:01:31.679> let's<00:01:31.950> move<00:01:32.069> on<00:01:32.159> to

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:32.279 
it's a good weapon but let's move on to

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:34.039 
it's a good weapon but let's move on to
the<00:01:32.369> next<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.029> true<00:01:33.240> Knights<00:01:33.450> edge<00:01:33.630> can

true Knights it is actually similar to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
the true Excalibur in a way that they

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.289 
the true Excalibur in a way that they
both<00:01:55.889> have<00:01:56.130> true<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.459> their<00:01:56.609> names<00:01:56.819> and<00:01:57.060> also

they shoot projectiles the only
difference<00:01:59.009> between<00:01:59.159> these<00:01:59.489> two<00:01:59.669> swords<00:02:00.029> are

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.239 
difference between these two swords are

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:01.519 
difference between these two swords are
the<00:02:00.359> damages<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:00.959> the<00:02:01.079> way<00:02:01.200> they<00:02:01.380> actually

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:01.529 
the damages and the way they actually

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:03.379 
the damages and the way they actually
look<00:02:01.889> and<00:02:02.039> how<00:02:02.249> the<00:02:02.310> projectiles<00:02:02.999> actually

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:03.389 
look and how the projectiles actually

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.089 
look and how the projectiles actually
work<00:02:03.539> the<00:02:03.779> two<00:02:03.959> Knights<00:02:04.169> edges<00:02:04.499> projectile

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
work the two Knights edges projectile

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:06.379 
work the two Knights edges projectile
actually<00:02:05.429> spins<00:02:05.700> instead<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.060> going<00:02:06.239> in<00:02:06.329> a

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:06.389 
actually spins instead of going in a

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:07.849 
actually spins instead of going in a
straight<00:02:06.450> line<00:02:06.599> like<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.139> to<00:02:07.319> Excalibur's

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
straight line like this to Excalibur's

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:09.440 
straight line like this to Excalibur's
is<00:02:08.069> but<00:02:08.430> they<00:02:08.550> both<00:02:08.670> work<00:02:08.729> similar<00:02:09.210> in<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.420> way

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
is but they both work similar in a way

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.060 
is but they both work similar in a way
that<00:02:09.869> every<00:02:10.110> other<00:02:10.229> sword<00:02:10.500> works<00:02:10.710> in<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> game

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
that every other sword works in the game

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.650 
that every other sword works in the game
and<00:02:11.250> finally<00:02:12.150> we're<00:02:12.270> going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.450> talk<00:02:12.630> about

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
the terribly

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.100 
the terribly
