 in the field of the art of photography 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.099
 nutrition the world of well-being 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.080
 secondly she condemns thomas lab master our 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.970
 manufacturing others were looking for development that brought a real 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.829
 more 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.329
 to our overseas banking customers and then that's true of my commitment 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.989
 I love you high herbal medicine with them eight pokernews key books 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.009
 really helps to have their commitment a commitment it's not because in the day 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.059
 the market especially at porto everyone rushes into the market of 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:34.620
 welfare 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.819
 than three year chains 

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:38.889
 it is in a range that has really entered his market with passion 

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:39.790
 with faith 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.790
 these are words that come back regularly 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.500
 we live every day 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.879
 and so for our products scored three chains 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.420
 he is very appreciated why because the offbeat 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.820
 the three chains in relation to the world the pharma with a different part and 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.750
 its differences 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.930
 he qualified for the play-offs the mans abroad 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.300
 she got us some of your magazine the three chains 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.390
 the magazine and the next few years a little over 2 4 years 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.890
 starting from a very simple observation we are today in a world the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.790
 communication 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.870
 hypercommunication and as in all that is good to a 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.820
 given time there will be too high and too many things but there is a good 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.000
 selectivity so that information 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.590
 banks as I always learned that we should not always waste with 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.360
 were built as well served as by oneself as by others 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.840
 I decided to put at the service of the consumer a real information and 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.700
 training institutional briefing note 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.480
 with a girlfriend information that is clear that is net through a 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.090
 magazine or three channels I informed our consumers our customers about everything 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.600
 is happening in the welfare world the interest of natural products 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.300
 for their well-being their health and beauty 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.480
 perform 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.490
 a quality-loving performance in today's society 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.120
 and put at their disposal a network of 300 thousand copies 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.200
 every quarter 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.430
 distributed free of charge in pharmacies 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.570
 hotel movements in fitness rooms the link with the

 twenty-six thousand subscribers 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.760
 who therefore receives the magazine quarterly with them information that 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.980
 is issued either by specialist doctors the nutrition of the 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.539
 dietetics of pharmacists' doctors 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.509
 people told me so of course but also not aimed by people from the 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:17.369
 show business sports world what can also be good the same worries the 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:20.359
 same issues that are not going to excite me 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.479
 ambassador 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:25.039
 banks to advocate the interest of nature in our daily well-being 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.409
 nevertheless that does not prevent m 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.500
 first the next to be engaged surely comes in the modernity in 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:31.409
 his time 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.919
 we are convinced that internet information on the internet 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.340
 of the relationship with 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.679
 the end consumer on orbit an act 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:41.479

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.909
 the website www sedar com 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.510
 so he who can communicate on all the information next 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.369
 to be produced 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:53.689
 last night coaching wellness advice also at the physical level since 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.029
 we have coaching so wanted to clarify that on his website and 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.059
 we also noted on another site that is much earlier 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:01.839
 I took the same chain dot com 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:05.009
 on which one we have a lot of information that steals my training at 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.279
 bio-information products great monuments of sport show business and 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.489
 other than ironic safekeeping notes that the formation of generators 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:15.349
 you have privileged relationships with many personalities 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.819
 can you name some of them 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.489
 while a successful privileged Arab relations that make that chance 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.319
 of life at some point when 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.629
 butcher and when you make things pay a little bit 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.769
 cap on your little bit of ordinary attract you d 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.870
 people of all kinds of people including known people 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.150
 and it is true that mom give my dreams also pushed me to contact 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.590
 people and especially people like johnny hallyday kim allowed a 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.720
 given moment not dear friends and share moments of life and 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.400
 make products with him to follow him and then see him regularly for me 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.549
 johnny hallyday has always been a driving force by year hiring 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.379
 mymensingh always laughed people were running everywhere and i'm going 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.129
 always shout loudly because for me no fault and that's my 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.129
 best medicine when I'm not doing well instead of taking medication 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.549
 the 20 young people I'm listening to johnny and all of a sudden everything is fine for me that 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.760
 I can have a phenomenon a little bit of identification to someone 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.769
 that I appreciate and respect and that for me is a true example no 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.730
 longevity and then we talked about love and it's someone who has 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.489
 always do things with love and passion spice up a bit screwed up of that 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.320
 others to pull it but it's true that it's something that I like 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.680
 this effect after at many sportsmen can as richard virenque 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.840
 samuel the bihan thomert six weeks 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.840

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.380
 meeting that participates indirectly or directly in the upcoming sale and 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.960
 it is true that it is at 4 pm 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.560
 I would say even enjoyable for a little kid from the countryside that he was not 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.020
 at all to bring to the obvious this world there I was reserved to 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.120
 stay behind the goats the cows and it's true that to find me 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.690
 today around the world with people and personalities this is a 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.850
 true satisfaction again a satisfaction of heart and not go 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.039
 do you have plans for this summer 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.889

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.530
 my projects this summer and I have in europe we are on the meaning of the scene 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.090

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.930
 korea times 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.539
 so I have a lot of friends to a device that do sports suddenly it allows me 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:20.879
 demont on stage 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.599
 Then I will take a walk for Superman on his trumpet in neutral 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.069
 down close to miami 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.960
 butcher also has business peace summer Arab friends entrance 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.319
 otherwise we will miss a professional project we have plenty of 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:34.860
 development this world 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.120
 of products that take place at a big these miners 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.840
 sustainable commercials in June with a very important comeback 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.380
 for me in September 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.100
 it will be a lot of work 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.419
 as usual and a lot of two days and two passions again 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.809
 I hope under water or on the sun this summer 

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:53.809
 last komen who was rather adopted under the most chic 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:08.089
