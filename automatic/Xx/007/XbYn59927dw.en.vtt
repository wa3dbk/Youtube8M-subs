00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.690 
probably got no 56 inches maybe on the
width

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
width

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.030 
width
of<00:05:42.790> it<00:05:42.940> and<00:05:45.900> just<00:05:46.900> because<00:05:47.230> i'm<00:05:47.380> reviewing<00:05:47.770> it

Scots Peters got two inches on the
length<00:05:59.380> because<00:06:00.070> of<00:06:00.190> the<00:06:00.570> engine<00:06:01.570> in<00:06:01.690> the<00:06:01.750> back

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780
