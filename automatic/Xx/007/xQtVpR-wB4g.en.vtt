00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
in trying to do that because I've gone

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.880 
in trying to do that because I've gone
away<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:26.970> I've<00:00:27.210> put<00:00:27.420> ranaut<00:00:27.810> at<00:00:28.019> left<00:00:28.230> mid<00:00:28.470> but

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
away and I've put ranaut at left mid but

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.859 
away and I've put ranaut at left mid but
the<00:00:29.010> team's<00:00:29.250> pretty<00:00:29.519> cool<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.599> fits

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the team's pretty cool and it's all fits

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.330 
the team's pretty cool and it's all fits
in<00:00:31.050> with<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.230> series<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.769> i<00:00:31.800> thought<00:00:32.009> i'd<00:00:32.160> show

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
in with the series so i thought i'd show

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.620 
in with the series so i thought i'd show
you<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.550> anyway<00:00:32.820> maybe<00:00:33.030> it's<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.510> you'll

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
you it anyway maybe it's one that you'll

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.840 
you it anyway maybe it's one that you'll
want<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.930> try<00:00:34.230> out<00:00:34.410> maybe<00:00:34.980> somewhere<00:00:35.460> along

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
want to try out maybe somewhere along

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.330 
want to try out maybe somewhere along
the<00:00:36.030> line<00:00:36.239> okay<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.559> i<00:00:37.590> decided<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.160> actually

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the line okay so i decided to actually

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.549 
the line okay so i decided to actually
bring<00:00:38.640> back<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> whole<00:00:39.180> load<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.690> players<00:00:40.200> that

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
bring back a whole load of players that

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.069 
bring back a whole load of players that
I've<00:00:40.950> done<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.489> Ronaldo<00:00:42.270> &amp;<00:00:42.450> Co<00:00:42.600> series

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
I've done in the Ronaldo &amp; Co series

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.990 
I've done in the Ronaldo &amp; Co series
already<00:00:43.320> sort<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.250> ones<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.610> worked<00:00:44.879> really

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
already sort of ones that worked really

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.510 
already sort of ones that worked really
well<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.680> saw<00:00:46.680> I've<00:00:46.739> seen<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.160> they<00:00:47.280> could

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
well and saw I've seen if they could

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.130 
well and saw I've seen if they could
maybe<00:00:47.969> fit<00:00:48.270> together<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.719> some<00:00:48.899> sort<00:00:48.930> of

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
maybe fit together in some sort of

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
maybe fit together in some sort of
hybrid<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.860> actually<00:00:50.190> make<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.640> half<00:00:50.940> decent

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
hybrid to actually make a half decent

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.350 
hybrid to actually make a half decent
team<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.230> let's<00:00:53.190> get<00:00:53.399> our<00:00:53.610> player<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.210> at

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
team so let's get our player in at

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.729 
team so let's get our player in at
left-back<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.110> that's<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.710> be

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
left-back and that's going to have to be

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.860 
left-back and that's going to have to be
Fabio<00:00:56.010> Coentrao<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.969> because<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.390> strong

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
Fabio Coentrao just because that strong

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.569 
Fabio Coentrao just because that strong
link<00:00:58.170> means<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.530> ranaut<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.800> needs<00:00:59.070> more<00:00:59.280> no

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579

play the man the one and only he's

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.260 
play the man the one and only he's
expensive<00:01:07.439> he's<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> legend<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:08.970> Hurley

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
expensive he's a legend and it's Hurley

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.210 
expensive he's a legend and it's Hurley
he's<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.930> expensive<00:01:10.500> i<00:01:10.590> gotta<00:01:10.770> say<00:01:10.950> he's<00:01:11.100> like

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
he's so expensive i gotta say he's like

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.289 
he's so expensive i gotta say he's like
8<00:01:11.369> million<00:01:11.610> at<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.760> moment<00:01:12.119> but<00:01:12.180> he's

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
8 million at the moment but he's

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.940 
8 million at the moment but he's
dropping<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.080> maybe<00:01:13.229> you'll<00:01:13.439> pick<00:01:13.470> him<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:13.799> in

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
dropping so maybe you'll pick him up in

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.590 
dropping so maybe you'll pick him up in
a<00:01:14.040> little<00:01:14.280> while<00:01:14.460> when<00:01:14.670> he<00:01:14.850> has<00:01:14.970> got<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.450> low

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
a little while when he has got to as low

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.240 
a little while when he has got to as low
as<00:01:15.720> pricing<00:01:16.110> may<00:01:16.229> bounce<00:01:16.439> back<00:01:16.710> up<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.040> never

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
as pricing may bounce back up you never

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.950 
as pricing may bounce back up you never
know<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.090> go<00:01:18.119> he'll<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.479> goes<00:01:18.659> in

weak foot he's gonna score you a lot of
girls<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.030> he<00:01:39.210> goes<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.689> at<00:01:39.840> stryker<00:01:40.439> then

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
girls so he goes in at stryker then

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.920 
girls so he goes in at stryker then
upfront<00:01:41.610> we're<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.270> using<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
upfront we're going to be using the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.920 
upfront we're going to be using the
Aguero<00:01:43.590> as<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.790> see<00:01:44.970> fits<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.479> because<00:01:45.780> he

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
Aguero as you can see fits in because he

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.830 
Aguero as you can see fits in because he
gets<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.290> link<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.829> crespo<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:48.540> do<00:01:48.659> need

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
gets that link to crespo and we do need

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.969 
gets that link to crespo and we do need
a<00:01:48.899> link<00:01:49.079> going<00:01:49.290> into<00:01:49.470> crespo<00:01:49.799> because

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
a link going into crespo because

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:50.990 
a link going into crespo because
otherwise<00:01:50.130> he<00:01:50.220> wouldn't<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.759> full

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
otherwise he wouldn't be on full

we<00:01:53.189> are<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.579> be<00:01:53.670> using<00:01:53.850> Wayne<00:01:54.299> Rooney

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
we are going to be using Wayne Rooney

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.270 
we are going to be using Wayne Rooney
now<00:01:55.200> there<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> reason<00:01:55.860> because<00:01:55.950> you're
