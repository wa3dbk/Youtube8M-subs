00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.109
 hello and welcome to facebook.com 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.269
 so today you have received your 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.490
 first box that of october 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.710
 the very first and for the recipe we 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.320
 is going to need country bread from 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.880
 fresh basil sardines de jose 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.949
 gourmet olive oil 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.750
 olivier n'co with basil and also the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.550
 garlic cream with street pepper crosses 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.890
 is we are going to start now the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.210
 bruschettas tomatoes and sardines we go 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.670
 peel the tomatoes and for that we go 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.869
 incise the skin of the tomatoes slightly 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.250
 we will boil a few minutes 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.230
 here are the tomatoes we were boiling and 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.450
 then you see there that really takes off 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.380
 all alone we go we will remove the skin 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.579
 tomatoes and during this time we will 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.050
 also put an end then be at 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.520
 toaster as you wish at or 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.989
 then in a hot oven and we will put 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.000
 this here for a few minutes 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.590
 I read my oven at 200 Â° and while 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.600
 the bread will lightly toast 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.340
 we're going to peel the tomatoes here we go 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.899
 remove the skin from the tomatoes and remove 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.219
 also we are not interested in 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.410
 not going to eat that will be a little hard 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.960
 so we remove all that we'll cut 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.640
 each tomato in small cubes but one 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.899
 are we going to remove some pulp because 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.309
 that if not if we really look at any 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.140
 the pulp of the tomato 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.090
 it's a risk of 30 and bread even if he 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.820
 was grilled which one removes a little 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.540
 remove all that after our tomatoes we go 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.540
 cut them into pieces 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.280
 two years ago 3 then we do that 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.530
 Roughly there is no need to bother 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.930
 to do something really 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.770
 perfect less regular here once 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.840
 that these cut into cubes 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.820
 we will put the tomatoes in a 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.270
 container we will put some oil 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.290
 olive with basil then salt pepper with 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.880
 taste but we must not forget that the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.570
 sardines are already dirty and we're going 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.880
 add a little basil 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:46.290
 finely chopped a little salt 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.070
 now it will have to lift the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.990
 sardine fillets 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.320
 here we are going to pass the knife at the level 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.210
 from the village of sardine and we pass 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.960
 gently and there we open we remove 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.570
 gently 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.710
 all art is central to 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.970
 remove the bulk of the art is and we're going 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.220
 put all the wires and we did 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.920
 in a small dish that we will put in 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.780
 oven and we will heat up all that 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.880
 next to the bread that is in the process of 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.530
 grilling gently that's all is almost 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.080
 ready we will take the slices of bread 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.620
 scorched senses and instead of rubbing with 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.120
 Garlic 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.810
 we will put the garlic cream in 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.430
 before we have it we take a part of it 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.410
 tent insa as we fall we would 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.610
 for this article the morning lunch with 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.040
 the butter and there we put the cream 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.380
 garlic with pepper here we put the cream 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.270
 garlic by weight on all slices 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.050
 of bread we will now add the 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.430
 tomato 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.620
 so you saw I removed a lot 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.630
 of juice just now and yet they 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.400
 have made a little more so we try 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.750
 to remove as much as possible 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.600
 after we will add the sardines that 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.050
 are just out of the oven is fine 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.030
 lukewarm and we will water everything with 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.310
 olive oil 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.770
 we take the sardines so we go 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.870
 pick up the spine then we can 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.790
 put oneself in full either 6 funds this 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.560
 which is a little bit the case here on 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.450
 liked the pieces on bruschettas 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.450
 we are also going to h and basil 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.739
 to finish a tiny bit of oil 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.140
 olive with basil 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.480
 here we put the bread garlic tomatoes 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.160
 sardines and bruschettas wanted 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.440
 serve immediately it will be good 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.970
 best hot and crisp 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.049
 so that's what tomato bruschettas 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.049
 basil and sardines 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.910
 we redo
