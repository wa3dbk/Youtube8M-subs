00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
hours with x-rays and everything which I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.999 
hours with x-rays and everything which I
know<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.539> a<00:01:48.570> lot<00:01:48.750> longer<00:01:48.990> than<00:01:49.410> that<00:01:49.860> your

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
know is a lot longer than that your

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.430 
know is a lot longer than that your
regular<00:01:50.399> dentist<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:51.180> again<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.410> are

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
regular dentist but again we are

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.800 
regular dentist but again we are
students<00:01:53.039> and<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.369> are<00:01:53.580> learning<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.360> does<00:01:54.780> it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
students and we are learning but does it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.110 
students and we are learning but does it
mean

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
mean

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.350 
mean
we're<00:01:55.210> not<00:01:55.330> skilled<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:55.900> trained<00:01:56.200> but<00:01:57.360> so

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
we're not skilled and trained but so

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.000 
we're not skilled and trained but so
that's<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.780> only<00:01:58.810> downside<00:01:59.560> i<00:01:59.590> would<00:01:59.830> say

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
that's the only downside i would say

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.320 
that's the only downside i would say
