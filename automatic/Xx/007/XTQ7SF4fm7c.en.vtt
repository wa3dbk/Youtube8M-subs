 families with two or more children up to 90 euros 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.899
 per month 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.130
 whole night was a meeting on whether 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.110
 parliamentary 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:56.930
 debate but the law passed in the morning 821 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.040
 so we are very happy for 30 or more hours 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.400
 didn't sleep 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.070
 but this is a co-le-ss cyc reformists and 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.160
 social democrats could do that 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.070
 what's the first good news and think what 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.400
 all children but also on guns because 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:18.020
 because if the gun is glad that the grandson 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.990
 or that through on but there is help baby 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.790
 allowance will increase so tell more 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.320
 noteworthy that children's law 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.970
 allowances was adopted during the night 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.740
 parliamentary meeting which 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.840
 lasted almost a day during 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.910
 the initiators of long gatherings made 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.710
 union fatherland and republic so 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.720
 the way the opposition party desired 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.400
 influence coalition plans to postpone 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.410
 three years of parental entry into force 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.479
 pensions however it failed and 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.780
 Parliament eventually passed 10 laws and 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.710
 finished reading 5 bills 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.300
 despite the fact that today 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.670
 officially considered the last day 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.050
 work in this session tomorrow 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.910
 riga gaga gathers for the first 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.640
 extraordinary meeting to continue 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.679
 work on a number of other laws among 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.020
 but they certainly won't be offered 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.210
 centrist amendments that eliminate in 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.130
 including the injustice pledged 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.610
 so widely publicized 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.690
 increase child benefits cars raised 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.990
 child benefits 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.310
 this start is wonderful and even 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.830
 probably not superfluous 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.410
 but the fact is that children's allowances 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.370
 the law still counts as part 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.819
 family income 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.030
 which means that with the rise of the child 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.800
 benefits even more number 7 and boston and 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.560
 only this right to receive transparent 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.180
 allowances one allowance here swallow 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.430
 other 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.930
 the situation is pretty 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.240
 wacky room and pass the spirit 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.780
 of the law and the letter of the law because 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.030
 law child allowance to know only 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:52.280
 to cover expenses binds 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:54.530
 under the food of a child for example despite 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.450
 on the critical assessment of the opposition authors 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.830
 increase child benefits claim that 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.870
 family allowance will also increase

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.850
 will increase the welfare of children 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.130
 and in all likelihood create conditions 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.340
 for fertility growth as a feeling 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.360
 family security will increase 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.590
 confirm or deny this 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.020

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.490
