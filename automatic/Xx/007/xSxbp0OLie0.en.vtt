you

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.470 

in<00:00:10.680> this<00:00:10.890> movie<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.460> want<00:00:11.520> to<00:00:11.760> focus<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.330> on

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
in this movie I want to focus in on

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.959 
in this movie I want to focus in on
another<00:00:13.080> important<00:00:13.800> aspect<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.430> the<00:00:14.580> camera

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
another important aspect of the camera

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.840 
another important aspect of the camera
interface<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.930> that<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.980> histogram<00:00:17.640> and

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
interface and that is the histogram and

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.820 
interface and that is the histogram and
we're<00:00:18.480> going<00:00:18.599> to<00:00:18.660> focus<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.290> how<00:00:19.349> we<00:00:19.560> can

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
we're going to focus in on how we can

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.920 
we're going to focus in on how we can
start<00:00:20.130> paying<00:00:20.490> attention<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.390> histogram

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
start paying attention to the histogram

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.320 
start paying attention to the histogram
and<00:00:22.140> also<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.340> want<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.970> share<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> few

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
and also I want to share a few

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.569 
and also I want to share a few
techniques<00:00:25.050> with<00:00:25.349> you<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.130> use<00:00:26.340> in

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
techniques with you that you can use in

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:27.769 
techniques with you that you can use in
order<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.910> turn<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.390> what<00:00:27.630> are<00:00:27.750> called

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
order to turn on what are called

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.040 
order to turn on what are called
clipping<00:00:28.770> indicators<00:00:29.550> these<00:00:30.329> indicators

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
clipping indicators these indicators

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.110 
clipping indicators these indicators
help<00:00:31.410> us<00:00:31.590> highlight<00:00:31.919> when<00:00:32.310> we<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> problem

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
help us highlight when we have a problem

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.660 
help us highlight when we have a problem
with<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> tonal<00:00:34.350> values<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.920> our<00:00:35.100> photographs

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
with the tonal values in our photographs

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.030 
with the tonal values in our photographs
all<00:00:35.970> right<00:00:36.510> well<00:00:36.720> first<00:00:36.750> starters<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.829> can

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
all right well first starters you can

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.440 
all right well first starters you can
see<00:00:38.220> that<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.520> histogram<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:39.390> a

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
see that the histogram is a

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.290 
see that the histogram is a
visualization<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.010> colors<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.000> tones

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
visualization of the colors in the tones

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.660 
visualization of the colors in the tones
and<00:00:42.600> our<00:00:42.750> pictures<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.980> go<00:00:44.160> ahead<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.519> make

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
and our pictures if we go ahead and make

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.060 
and our pictures if we go ahead and make
a<00:00:44.699> change<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.359> the<00:00:45.449> exposure<00:00:45.899> se<00:00:46.260> will<00:00:46.890> see

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
a change to the exposure se will see

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.459 
a change to the exposure se will see
that<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.340> will<00:00:47.460> remap<00:00:48.120> those<00:00:48.390> tones<00:00:48.719> if<00:00:49.079> we

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
that it will remap those tones if we

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.040 
that it will remap those tones if we
push<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.010> too<00:00:50.399> far<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.929> it's

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
push this too far you can see that it's

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.990 
push this too far you can see that it's
actually<00:00:52.199> pushing<00:00:53.010> these<00:00:53.160> tones<00:00:53.579> out<00:00:53.910> of

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
actually pushing these tones out of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.829 
actually pushing these tones out of
range

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
range

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.979 
range
here<00:00:55.320> we've<00:00:55.579> overexposed<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.850> image<00:00:57.149> we

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
here we've overexposed the image we

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.349 
here we've overexposed the image we
don't<00:00:58.170> necessarily<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:59.249> how<00:00:59.699> far<00:01:00.120> we've

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
don't necessarily know how far we've

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.020 
don't necessarily know how far we've
overexposed<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.379> photograph<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.609> what<00:01:02.879> you

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
overexposed this photograph so what you

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.180 
overexposed this photograph so what you
can<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.110> turn<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.680> clipping

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
can do is you can turn on the clipping

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.070 
can do is you can turn on the clipping
indicator<00:01:05.640> by<00:01:06.150> clicking<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.780> little

see all of these areas of our photograph

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.600 
see all of these areas of our photograph
which<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.750> highlighted<00:01:13.470> red<00:01:13.680> that's<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
which are highlighted red that's a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.730 
which are highlighted red that's a
warning<00:01:15.000> indicator<00:01:15.509> telling<00:01:15.930> us<00:01:16.140> we<00:01:16.560> have

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
warning indicator telling us we have

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.340 
warning indicator telling us we have
some<00:01:17.009> sort<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.549> problem<00:01:17.840> well<00:01:18.840> now<00:01:19.079> with

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
some sort of a problem well now with

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.340 
some sort of a problem well now with
this<00:01:19.530> view<00:01:19.890> turned<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:21.570> decrease

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
this view turned on I can then decrease

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.560 
this view turned on I can then decrease
my<00:01:22.560> exposure<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.399> order<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.119> correct<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
my exposure in order to correct the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.749 
my exposure in order to correct the
exposure<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.649> I<00:01:25.770> don't<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.310> much<00:01:26.520> of

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
exposure so that I don't have as much of

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.270 
exposure so that I don't have as much of
loss<00:01:26.969> of<00:01:27.210> detail<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.810> those<00:01:27.990> areas<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.649> can<00:01:29.130> also

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
loss of detail in those areas I can also

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.160 
loss of detail in those areas I can also
use<00:01:29.399> other<00:01:29.790> sliders<00:01:30.149> say<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.780> highlight

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
use other sliders say like the highlight

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.289 
use other sliders say like the highlight
sliders<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:32.100> bring<00:01:32.340> back<00:01:32.579> detail<00:01:33.030> into

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
sliders to bring back detail into

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.149 
sliders to bring back detail into
important<00:01:33.869> parts<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> photograph<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
important parts of the photograph and

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.969 
important parts of the photograph and
that<00:01:35.939> clipping<00:01:36.299> indicator<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.229> showed<00:01:37.710> me

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
that clipping indicator it showed me

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.209 
that clipping indicator it showed me
those<00:01:38.219> problematic<00:01:39.000> or<00:01:39.149> those<00:01:39.360> problem<00:01:39.930> areas

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
those problematic or those problem areas

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.770 
those problematic or those problem areas
we<00:01:41.219> also<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.729> an<00:01:41.850> indicator<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.390> our

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
we also have an indicator for our

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.139 
we also have an indicator for our
shadows<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.189> click<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.729> triangle

icon and what that will do is it will
show<00:01:47.520> us<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.939> areas<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.539> our<00:01:48.960> shadows<00:01:49.500> where

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
show us the areas in our shadows where

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.039 
show us the areas in our shadows where
we<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:50.039> these<00:01:50.219> problems<00:01:50.509> let<00:01:51.509> me<00:01:51.600> exaggerate

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
we have these problems let me exaggerate

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.929 
we have these problems let me exaggerate
the<00:01:52.469> problem<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.039> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.340> see<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.729> more

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the problem so you can see this more

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.270 
the problem so you can see this more
clearly<00:01:54.020> here<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.320> see<00:01:55.560> where<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.070> is

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
clearly here we can see where this is

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.700 
clearly here we can see where this is
blue<00:01:56.609> the<00:01:56.939> blue<00:01:57.119> color<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.570> telling<00:01:58.049> me<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.350> have

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
blue the blue color is telling me I have

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.399 
blue the blue color is telling me I have
loss<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.340> detail<00:01:59.549> there<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.149> other<00:02:00.659> words<00:02:00.930> that

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
loss of detail there in other words that

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.580 
loss of detail there in other words that
is<00:02:01.680> 100%<00:02:02.549> black<00:02:03.119> well<00:02:03.750> that's<00:02:03.960> not<00:02:04.200> going<00:02:04.469> to

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
is 100% black well that's not going to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.319 
is 100% black well that's not going to
print<00:02:04.979> very<00:02:05.189> well<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.789> I<00:02:05.850> need<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.119> make<00:02:06.299> a

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
print very well so I need to make a

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.749 
print very well so I need to make a
correction<00:02:06.869> again<00:02:07.649> we<00:02:08.100> can<00:02:08.310> use<00:02:08.340> these

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
correction again we can use these

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.780 
correction again we can use these
sliders<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.420> order<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.899> make<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.289> correction

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
sliders in order to make this correction

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.520 
sliders in order to make this correction
there's<00:02:11.790> also<00:02:12.060> another<00:02:12.750> way<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.080> we<00:02:13.320> can

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
there's also another way that we can

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.260 
there's also another way that we can
work<00:02:13.710> with<00:02:13.890> these<00:02:14.010> clipping<00:02:14.460> indicators<00:02:14.970> and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
work with these clipping indicators and

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.500 
work with these clipping indicators and
that<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.870> by<00:02:16.110> way<00:02:16.320> of<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.590> few<00:02:16.860> shortcuts<00:02:17.460> if<00:02:17.760> you

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
that is by way of a few shortcuts if you

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.620 
that is by way of a few shortcuts if you
press<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.110> U<00:02:19.440> key<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:19.950> will<00:02:20.160> toggle<00:02:20.490> on<00:02:20.880> or<00:02:21.330> off

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
press the U key it will toggle on or off

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.660 
press the U key it will toggle on or off
your<00:02:22.380> shadow<00:02:22.740> clipping<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.430> case

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
your shadow clipping in the case

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.480 
your shadow clipping in the case
if<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.510> press<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.080> O<00:02:25.290> key<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:26.069> will<00:02:26.220> toggle

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
if you press the O key that will toggle

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.240 
if you press the O key that will toggle
on<00:02:26.940> or<00:02:27.300> off<00:02:27.540> your<00:02:27.930> highlight<00:02:28.440> indicator<00:02:28.980> and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250

that<00:02:29.819> can<00:02:30.030> be<00:02:30.150> really<00:02:30.510> helpful<00:02:30.720> because

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
that can be really helpful because

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.110

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.360 
shown you where you have the biggest
problem<00:03:44.640> say<00:03:44.910> in<00:03:45.180> these<00:03:45.510> areas<00:03:46.049> here<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.560> by

problem say in these areas here and by

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.729 
problem say in these areas here and by
having<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:47.910> perspective<00:03:48.500> basically<00:03:49.500> it's

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
having this perspective basically it's

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.440 
having this perspective basically it's
just<00:03:49.860> another<00:03:50.340> way<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.670> access<00:03:51.269> this

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
just another way to access this

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.569

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
information and then to be able to make

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.789 
information and then to be able to make
any<00:03:53.820> needed<00:03:54.060> adjustments<00:03:54.320> so<00:03:55.320> that<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.590> have

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
any needed adjustments so that you have

any needed adjustments so that you have
better<00:03:56.100> color<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:56.970> tone<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.450> regards<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.840> the

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
better color and tone in regards to the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.229 
better color and tone in regards to the
overall<00:03:58.860> way<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.220> you've<00:03:59.370> processed<00:04:00.030> your

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
overall way that you've processed your

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.680 
overall way that you've processed your
image<00:04:00.660> so<00:04:01.530> why<00:04:01.739> is<00:04:01.799> all<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.459> this<00:04:02.760> important

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
image so why is all of this important

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.660 
image so why is all of this important
well<00:04:04.410> it's<00:04:04.560> all<00:04:04.769> really<00:04:05.010> important<00:04:05.549> because

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
well it's all really important because

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.539 
well it's all really important because
it's<00:04:06.060> kind<00:04:06.299> of<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.570> safety<00:04:07.079> check<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.860> lot<00:04:08.400> of

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
it's kind of a safety check a lot of

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.490 
it's kind of a safety check a lot of
times<00:04:08.760> when<00:04:08.940> we<00:04:09.060> work<00:04:09.269> in<00:04:09.420> camera<00:04:09.840> we're

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
times when we work in camera we're

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.110 
times when we work in camera we're
making<00:04:10.860> adjustments<00:04:11.489> so<00:04:11.760> that<00:04:11.790> our

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
making adjustments so that our

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.400 
making adjustments so that our
photographs<00:04:12.660> look<00:04:12.870> great

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
photographs look great

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.500 
photographs look great
according<00:04:14.070> to<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.310> way<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.700> we<00:04:14.880> see<00:04:15.239> them

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
according to the way that we see them

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.409 
according to the way that we see them
yet<00:04:16.289> sometimes<00:04:16.820> some<00:04:17.820> of<00:04:17.940> these<00:04:18.030> adjustments

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
yet sometimes some of these adjustments

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.810 
yet sometimes some of these adjustments
can<00:04:18.930> push<00:04:19.260> an<00:04:19.440> image<00:04:19.709> in<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:19.950> way<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:20.370> we<00:04:20.519> lose

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
can push an image in a way that we lose

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.420 
can push an image in a way that we lose
detail<00:04:21.209> in<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.870> highlights<00:04:22.410> or<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:23.010> shadows

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
detail in the highlights or the shadows

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.909 
detail in the highlights or the shadows
well<00:04:24.120> this<00:04:24.330> is<00:04:24.510> going<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:24.900> then<00:04:25.140> lead<00:04:25.530> to<00:04:25.710> other

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
well this is going to then lead to other

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.890 
well this is going to then lead to other
problems<00:04:26.340> as<00:04:26.760> we<00:04:26.910> start<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.390> work<00:04:27.419> on<00:04:27.780> our

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
problems as we start to work on our

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.080 
problems as we start to work on our
photographs<00:04:28.410> so<00:04:29.100> in<00:04:29.220> order<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.520> ensure<00:04:29.789> that

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
photographs so in order to ensure that

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.600 
photographs so in order to ensure that
we<00:04:30.419> have<00:04:30.660> good<00:04:30.930> detail<00:04:31.380> in<00:04:31.620> our<00:04:32.130> highlights

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
we have good detail in our highlights

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.300 
we have good detail in our highlights
and<00:04:32.849> also<00:04:33.270> our<00:04:33.419> shadows<00:04:33.870> we<00:04:34.410> can<00:04:34.620> use<00:04:34.830> any<00:04:35.070> of

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
and also our shadows we can use any of

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.520 
and also our shadows we can use any of
these<00:04:35.430> techniques<00:04:35.789> let's<00:04:36.599> review

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
these techniques let's review

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.590 
these techniques let's review
we<00:04:37.710> can<00:04:37.920> either<00:04:38.130> click<00:04:38.460> on<00:04:38.670> these<00:04:38.850> icons<00:04:38.910> by

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
inside of the histogram or we can turn

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.370 
inside of the histogram or we can turn
those<00:04:44.760> on<00:04:45.000> by<00:04:45.240> way<00:04:45.480> of<00:04:45.510> a<00:04:45.720> shortcut

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
those on by way of a shortcut

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.250 
those on by way of a shortcut
remember<00:04:47.220> it's<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.580> U<00:04:47.970> key<00:04:48.270> for<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.630> shadows

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
remember it's the U key for the shadows

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.700 
remember it's the U key for the shadows
it's<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.980> Oh<00:04:50.220> key<00:04:50.640> for<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.060> highlights

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
it's the Oh key for the highlights

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.020 
it's the Oh key for the highlights
another<00:04:52.710> way<00:04:52.920> that<00:04:52.950> you<00:04:53.190> can<00:04:53.370> access<00:04:53.790> that

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
another way that you can access that

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.660 
another way that you can access that
type<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:54.390> clipping<00:04:55.170> information<00:04:55.860> is<00:04:56.220> by

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
type of clipping information is by

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.640 
type of clipping information is by

Alt key on Windows and then clicking on
one<00:05:01.560> of<00:05:01.590> your<00:05:01.860> basic<00:05:02.400> panel<00:05:02.640> sliders<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.420> here

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
one of your basic panel sliders and here

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.990 
one of your basic panel sliders and here
you<00:05:04.050> can<00:05:04.170> see<00:05:04.410> we<00:05:04.560> now<00:05:04.710> have<00:05:04.950> that<00:05:05.160> view<00:05:05.550> of<00:05:05.760> the

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
you can see we now have that view of the

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.930 
you can see we now have that view of the
areas<00:05:06.510> where<00:05:06.780> we<00:05:06.960> have<00:05:06.990> problems<00:05:07.830> now<00:05:08.550> because

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
areas where we have problems now because

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.820 
areas where we have problems now because
I<00:05:08.970> think<00:05:09.150> these<00:05:09.570> particular<00:05:10.140> techniques<00:05:10.620> are

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
I think these particular techniques are

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.280 
I think these particular techniques are
really<00:05:11.130> valuable<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:11.820> recommend<00:05:12.660> that<00:05:12.780> you<00:05:12.840> jot

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
really valuable I recommend that you jot

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.140 
really valuable I recommend that you jot
some<00:05:13.530> notes<00:05:13.560> down<00:05:13.860> about<00:05:14.370> them<00:05:14.610> because<00:05:15.120> I

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
some notes down about them because I

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.659 
some notes down about them because I
think<00:05:15.300> that<00:05:15.570> as<00:05:15.870> you<00:05:15.900> get<00:05:16.500> better<00:05:16.830> at<00:05:17.130> working

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
think that as you get better at working

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.640 
think that as you get better at working
in<00:05:17.760> Camera<00:05:18.120> Raw<00:05:18.270> you'll<00:05:18.870> definitely<00:05:19.350> want<00:05:19.560> to

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
in Camera Raw you'll definitely want to

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.480 
in Camera Raw you'll definitely want to
integrate<00:05:19.890> these<00:05:20.370> into<00:05:20.940> your<00:05:21.030> workflow
