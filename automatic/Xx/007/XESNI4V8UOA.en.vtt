the<00:04:39.890> biggest<00:04:40.890> issue<00:04:41.100> is<00:04:41.280> that<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.520> game<00:04:41.700> is

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
the biggest issue is that the game is

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.850 
the biggest issue is that the game is
very<00:04:41.880> story<00:04:42.479> driven<00:04:42.600> and<00:04:43.050> if<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.320> story<00:04:43.650> isn't
