Orson<00:00:33.149> vault<00:00:39.020> 20<00:00:40.020> cams<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:40.290> pretty<00:00:40.469> easy<00:00:40.559> to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
Orson vault 20 cams are pretty easy to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.369 
Orson vault 20 cams are pretty easy to
get<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.770> fly<00:00:40.920> with<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> flat<00:00:42.079> shovel<00:00:43.079> there's

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
get the fly with a flat shovel there's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.549 
get the fly with a flat shovel there's
an<00:00:43.530> Evo<00:00:43.770> floor<00:00:44.070> wheels<00:00:44.430> are<00:00:44.989> recessed<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.230> so

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
an Evo floor wheels are recessed in so

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.979 
an Evo floor wheels are recessed in so
it's<00:00:46.710> hard<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> get<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> clamp<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:48.930> you

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
it's hard to get a clamp in here so you

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.450 
it's hard to get a clamp in here so you
wind<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:49.320> having<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.649> use<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> smaller<00:00:50.100> clamp

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
wind up having to use a smaller clamp

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.720 
wind up having to use a smaller clamp
most<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.910> time<00:00:51.649> to<00:00:52.649> do<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:55.579> you<00:00:56.579> get

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
most of the time to do it so you get

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.340 
most of the time to do it so you get
that<00:00:56.789> around<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> backside<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> bearing

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
that around the backside of the bearing

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.630 
that around the backside of the bearing
you<00:00:58.739> don't<00:00:58.920> tighten<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.190> quite<00:00:59.399> all<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> way

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
you don't tighten it quite all the way

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:19.760 
you don't tighten it quite all the way
it's<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> crank<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> little<00:01:00.750> bit<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.899> clear

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.679
