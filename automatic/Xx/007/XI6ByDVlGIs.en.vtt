00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 and that's everybody knows that his 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.700
 pain of others and so video on the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.179
 boxing of my telescopic pole and 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.260
 my art deco pro so that's what 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.600
 was going on a flight and so here I think 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.250
 not only his marks and his fine from 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.289
 so therefore it comes amazon employees 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.810
 of China 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.810
 so that's good but everything is quiet in baden 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:51.600
 I did it gently because I did not 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:56.149
 want to fart the trees so here you go 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.149
 I am very happy so at amazon 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:05.339
 you will see I will introduce you 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.530
 it's not the real real harness 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.840
 it's a reel so I have a lot 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.420
 cheaper because the army and the brother 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.659
 that level there to 45 days 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.500
 and that one is the exact copy year 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.860
 just that you can not be the same but otherwise 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.080
 it's the same as 15 euros for 100 euros 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.080
 of humanity's good because 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.210
 no we are going to talk 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.870
 the harness in a small vinci pocket 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.870
 concessions 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.880
 with a small mosque to put it 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.450
 in 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.909
 and here is the harness so it's not a 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.070
 trick of seguela stick 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.020
 so it's convenient and that for the shot 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:09.720
 for the safer it's cool 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.720
 so here it's just it has detached 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.450
 so we put on so we close and we'll have 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.950
 just got there for once for 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.260
 our size 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.370
 so here's after I pray you vaart good 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:35.519
 day and night and that's the pocket 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:41.709
 telescopic and therefore unpacking 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:43.599
 so super convenient a rhythm there is 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:49.299
 another batter for maybe the 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:56.500
 put on a tripod so the little 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:59.769
 wheel here in front to move the pace 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.440
 10 to burn the list paws and that 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.329
 one on side to move to orient 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.640
 like this 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.640
 so here we are, we are planning to enlarge 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.299
 so it's really balÃ¨ze so I you 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:22.900
 will see after when there will be more 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:26.769
 of space so that's nickel have seen 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.810
 especially if we can really there the plant 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.790
 is not stealing it but it arranged it 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.790
 without it being bulky 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.560
 is it who is very happy with this 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:44.219
 package is that with the harness with the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:49.140
 harness and we were providing this so 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:51.290
 this is normally books in the year 50 14 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.290
 euros 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:00.769
 it's a little bit like that with no 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:04.709
 so when I saw that at 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.769
 that with the when I saw that with their 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.280
 we provide that and that I saw that the 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.980
 pole 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.819
 she was just 13 euros but I 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.370
 did not hesitate 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:23.340
 I hated because at first I wanted 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:25.860
 in fact I apply them to you the harness 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.539
 I wanted to make myself 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.190
 even my pot of told me that it 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:37.680
 was used to lose that it served back 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:40.919
 because because as I saw that the 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.180
 perch is and not expensive but I have not 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:47.729
 too hesitated 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:54.590
 so here is a little trip to put it 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:57.409
 wrist a little small gap for you 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:01.169
 so here is the telescopic pole 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:02.690
 of bits and harness 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.340
 so I'll show you now 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.669
 how what gives the time is 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.280
 surely not here right now 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:14.220
 so that's what gives it so it's 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:19.020
 really cool of success the sexy practice 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:22.789
 may well be used and therefore its slope 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:26.430
 between ge and the six curable on hints 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:30.810
 but we can not be him because 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.850
 it hangs all that is to this people 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.500
 health is not the same as on the 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:40.290
 helmets hostages claret so here you are 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.120
 berard is not the perch 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.470
 now I'm going to show you this 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.889
 so that's gone right now 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:54.000
 so that's what it allows to unfold so 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:58.520
 the little gem oriented towards me here 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.840
 super super earth 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.760
 in beautiful film and water ticket 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:10.020
 cool mom is to keep 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:14.730
 in addition to that easy rotate 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.920
 it will turn itself not dreaming 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:22.380
 to go because I'm aghast and 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:27.420
 if not with the little wheel there is there 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:32.370
 can rotate very easily and 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:35.550
 the oriented also very well so here at 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.710
 I tell you hi and see you next time 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.140
 for a new video and we need 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.290
 a little high that it's going 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.290
 Hi
